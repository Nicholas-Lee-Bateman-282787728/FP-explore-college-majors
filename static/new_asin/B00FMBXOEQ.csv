One would not thing that Master Classes are interesting to observe. Nothing could be further from the truth. Another thing is that one really learns to hear (and see) things in the music that enhances one's love of the piece. These were not composers that I relished. Yet, after I saw what Accardo and his students did with the pieces and what the structure of the pieces were, I came  to adore them. In fact, it prompted me to buy the whole piece. I don't want to repeat myself, but I can't tell you how much fun and how much you learn about music appreciation from watching these dvds. I bought all of Accardo's teaching DVDs, and I have watched them over and over again. By the way, I am NOT a violinist. And I did not particularly for the music until Accardo and students taught me what to listen for. My musical knowledge is deepened; the borders of my music appreciation have expanded considerably. I feel enriched. A new music world has opened for me.",1403049600,,1118,4.562189054726368
