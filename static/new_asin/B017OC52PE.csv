7512377,5,B017OC52PE,"History was one of my favorite subjects in grade school and I was probably in the 9th grade when this series was on tv.
I remember it being telecast on Sundays and there were no vcrs then and I didn't want to be away from home to miss any episodes.

It also reminds me of the great times with my Mom and Dad who are now deceased.

I also remember the many character actors who appeared each week with James Darren & Robert Colbert; Kevin Hagen, John Crawford, and many others..

Thanks for the memories!",1376092800,12,503,4.273684210526316

7512379,2,B017OC52PE,"I have already sent a review on this, but I will explain why I was not happy.
I received The Time Tunnel Complete Series in time for it to be wrapped and ready for my husband's birthday.  When I ordered it I overlooked that it was imported, and at the time did not know what Region 2 meant.  I agree that it is was my ignorance not to know that foreign DVDs would not play on American DVD players.  Well.......we found out very fast.  I was never aware that there would be a code to unlock my DVD in order to view the series.
I spoke with the seller and he offered codes and ways to unlock my GE DVD player.  Without any luck, I then contacted him and told him that this had failed.  He then told me to view them on my PC.  Well, my PC is in a very small nook of our home, and this would not be very comfortable for viewing. I then told him I wanted a refund, as it was my fault for not knowing about REGION 2.  He said he would NOT refund my shipping back to the UK, which I thought showed poor customer service.  I worked for L.L.BEAN Inc. for 14 years and we returned every item for any length of time and paid the shipping to and back to our customers.  I guess what I am saying is, I told the seller of my ignorance in not knowing about the Region 2 DVD and the how I was clueless about this.  He showed no compassion.  Therefore, $11.60 out of my pocket was to send this back to RAREWAVES IMPORTS.  It will take 6-10 days before they receive it, and God knows how long before they credit the amount back to my account.  My husband was very disappointed, but not by me, by the fact that the total amount was not reimbursed and that they were not very understanding.  I only ordered from them, (overlooking the Imports part) because they were the only ones on Amazon, at the time who offered the complete series. It's too bad because my husband truly wanted to view a program that brought him back to his youth.  I am sorry that this was not the most positive review, but this was just the way it happened. I hope to re-order an AMERICAN DVD soon!  Thank you.  M.S.",1344211200,28,2069,4.091811414392059

7512394,5,B017OC52PE,"A fun show mixing Sci-Fi and History. The two scientist travel both back in time and forward in time. Its too bad the show only lasted one year (1966-1967). Good special effects for the time of the show; which, overall hold up well today. These are standard DVD discs which are two-sided for episodes.",1463702400,3,301,4.592592592592593

8739951,4,B017OC52PE,Nice to have all in one box plus all single sided discs. Only problem I encountered was disc 1 and 9 ( the special features disc) were mis-labelled and swapped) Discs are region locked but you need to buy a region free DVD player which are available cheaply or unlock your current one if possible (just search internet for instructions for how to do that). Picture and audio are nice too.,1507766400,,388,4.47887323943662
