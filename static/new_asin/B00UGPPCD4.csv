8705823,4,B00UGPPCD4,"This film has an importance in film history that resonates today, in that it popularized the widescreen process of Cinemascope. (Widescreen was experimented with in the 1920s into 1931 but abandoned until the astonishing 1952 popularity of Cinerama.) THE ROBE followed M-G-M's 1950 blockbuster hit QUO VADIS in launching a slew of big-budget, Biblical epics for the rest of the decade and into the 1960s.

My comment is to provide detail on the original Blu-ray release's bonus content, apparently not carried over onto the ""repackaged"" versions.
Bonus Features (which are quite interesting) listed on the package are:
-Introduction by Martin Scorcese
-Audio Commentary with composer David Newman (son of Alfred, the film's composer) and historians Jon Burlingame, Julie Kirgo, Nick Redman
-Isolated Music Score
  Documentaries:
-The Making of THE ROBE;
-From Scripture to Script: The Bible and Hollywood.
-Vintage Featurette - The Cinemascope Story (which was listed on the DVD box but missing from that release)
-Fox MovieTone Newsreels
-Still Galleries, which include the Pressbook

A further bit of trivia is that HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE was actually shot first, but THE ROBE was a more spectacular way to launch 20th Century Fox's new Cinemascope process. THE ROBE was so successful that, while the sets were still standing, a sequel was quickly developed, DEMETRIUS AND THE GLADIATORS, that picks up exactly where the first film ends. They represent the kind of glamor, opulent, non-CGI, non-gory films of the era that focus on sincerely emotional characters, interesting story, and entertainment values, mostly absent from modern films. Despite some hammy, over-the-top performances, they are still fun to watch. How many new films will still be talked about and enjoyed 60 years hence?",1471478400,,1796,5.380782918149467
8705824,5,B00UGPPCD4,"A film classic was brought to life with this blue ray edition! Remember growing up, this was a network broadcast each year during Easter, similar to The Ten Commandments The digital treatment of this film makes it look as it was a recent film. Yes...some of the background was painted, but overall a pleasing visual treat. Classic story of a Roman solider sent to Judea and was in charge of the cruxifixction of Jesus, but later converted to Christianity. Great cast, with Richard Burton and Jean Simmons at their best. Great overall supporting cast.",1460764800,,550,4.861702127659575
