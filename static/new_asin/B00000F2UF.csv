1202380,2,B00000F2UF,"I really enjoyed John Katzenbach's novel about a murder trial set in a German POW camp during World War II.  The story moved well with good, three dimensional, characters.  I was excited when it was announced that the rights for the movie were sold.
I was somewhat apprehensive when it was announced that Bruce Willis was starring in the movie.  This is not to say that I don't like Willis, just that there wasn't any character appropriate for him in the book...  When I saw the trailer for the movie I was totally turned off by all the explosions.  It appeared that a tight courtroom thriller was turned into ""Die Hard"".  The trailer turned me off and I never went to see the film in the theatre.
I finally saw the movie this past week and I discovered that my apprehensions and refusal to see the movie in the theatre was right.
""Hart's war"" is not a terrible movie - it's not great with good visuals and a comparatively weak plot (probably three stars).  The problem is that the movie states that it ""is based on"" a great book and virtually none of the story was passed from the book to the film.  Somewhere in the adaptation, Hart's character is no longer a drafted law student, there is suddenly _two_ black airmen (the book only has one) and the movie's story is more about hurting the German war effort - not about finding a murderer.  None of these changes help the story and, to be honest, the movie's plot really doesn't make a lot of sense.",1024876800,36,1451,4.424812030075188

1202432,2,B00000F2UF,"When will Hollywood stop promoting racial animosity? That is all this gratuitous white guilt story-line crap achieves. How can you muddy a WW2 film and make black racial prejudice the central theme? How cheap and overtly politically motivated.

1202435,5,B00000F2UF,This is a go to war flick for me. I love that its so honest and shows the racism that was VERY American at the time as well. Most WWII movies portray black people as a way to go or look they succeeded a bit and Harts War shows a bit of that dark side. Most Americans didn't want anything to do with someone who had dark skin... even whilst fighting a war that dealt with genocide. Sad sad sad. Honest solid piece of work.,1516752000,,421,3.9647058823529413

1202444,5,B00000F2UF,"This is a very good movie which is based on real events.  It's more of a thriller type movie not having any footage of WWII battleground clashes.  The movies is based on U.S. POW camps and how things were.  I was a bit surprised how well the US troops were treated.  When you speak of Hitler and his death camps I was prepared to see the same type story line.  If the movie is close to actual events it gave me a sense of relief seeing that our troops kept in the camps were fed, had beds, clothes and winter jackets etc.",1482883200,,521,4.068627450980392

1202450,2,B00000F2UF,"A Totally Inaccurate  movie Based  On a War where the where MYTHS account more than facts in order to make hero's out of a group of mediocre pilots.
why
! the Germans did not have officers and enlisted men  in the same camp
2 the German air force had their own POW camps ( no army or sailor POWS )
3 the 51d could not fly upside down it was carbureted
4 the Russian pows would have been east of berlin
 the dogfight looks like a cartoon drawing and only a 5 year old would pass it off as real
 a real movie to watch is Stalag 17 which has no computer effects and Great Acting

I did hear this director and spike lee are working on a new movie Where the Tusgee  airmen force the Japanese at knifepoint to surrender in ww2",1460332800,,720,3.993006993006993

What it means to live with honor is the key lesson at the end of the day.

The movie is interesting and gripping as Lt. Hart is pitted against a four-generation West Point officer who manages the American prisoners.  There is an underlying theme about universal racism until another fork in the road is taken.",1432252800,,553,4.51

1202601,5,B00000F2UF,"Hart's War is three movies tied in one.  Movie 1 is POW life in WWII Germany.  Movie 2 is McNamara's (Bruce Willis) control of the American prisoners including Capt Hart (Colin Farrell) and LT Scott (Terrance Howard).  Movie 3 is the treatment of black American officers and soldiers in the U.S. military.

Terrance Howard may rightly be typecast as the WWII black aviator having played in Red Tails.  Howard does a wonderful job playing this type role.  He is as able and confident actor whose appearance in this movie makes for more believable characters.

Hart's War is a movie of dilemmas.  It's a movie of prejudice, of bigotry, of cowardice and of sacrifice.",1421625600,4,664,4.814159292035399

1202676,1,B00000F2UF,This is a racist revision movie written by someone who obviously knows nothing about WWII or POW's. They use WWII as a basis to advocate that all Americans were racists and that racism was the key motivator to the plot. Strangely enough the Nazis in this movie are presented in a kindly fashion.

1203387,4,B00000F2UF,"While this film is not an action film, a new twist for Willis and many of his fans, it is a thriller with the story being told by Lt. Hart (Farrell). The performances were believable and quite stirring. Farrell is the lead actor in this tale and carries the film quite well. I wonder if the producers found it necessary to engage Willis to lend it some big name for the box office.

The scenes and experiences of the POWs in the camp were quite well done. Since it was filmed in the Czech Republic, locations were likely closer to what could have been a real POW internment camp in Germany. The Winter of 1944-45 was one of the worst on record.  The coldness of the camp and the plight of the soldiers being held prisoner was accurate enough for me to be shivering as well.

I do not understand why people rate this film low, as it was quite well done and believable in many aspects. While many may doubt the interactions of the German guards and officers and commandant with their equal ranking Allied officers, from the stories I've read and heard about, there was a mutual respect. It was always known by the Germans that the prime directive for POWs was to escape, and while some actually did escape, very few of the many thousands held in German POW camps, ever made it to safety. It was almost impossible to return to active duty and continue fighting the war, once captured and interned in a camp. Allied POWs were sometimes even held in camps associated with concentration camps.

View this film with an open mind and be very mindful of the hardship each and every POW endured as a result of their captivity. Not all Germans were Nazis and not all were immoral and cruel beyond words. And, not all were honorable. War produces a lot of suffering and people who endure it are only seeking to survive. Some are not willing to sacrifice their morals or honor and others do so without much visible angst.

Thanks to the production staff and crew and actors for making this film. It is truly a great view of what could have occurred during one of the most awful wars in mankind's history. With each story about WWII, we need to be reminded of the horrors of global war and pledge to never allow it to occur again.",1418774400,,2216,4.421568627450981

1203656,1,B00000F2UF,"I put off watching this  film for years even though I like war films, instinctively expecting a stinker. I finally watched on amazon and found that my instincts were absolutely right.  No basis of reality at all.  The aviation scenes were the purest carp ever created.  Clearly the folks thought that airshow demonstrations were true depictions of air fighting.  They got the planes right, but the maneuvers and sequencing was gawd awful.  Apparently they also thought that the TV comedy series Hogan's Heroes was also history as they appeared to borrow heavily from it.
  Colin Firth was ok in his role, almost very good, but the rest of the cast had no chance with the terrible script and story.  Bruce Willis acted like he did not want to be there, and he pretty much wasn't, playing a wooden character with no character development. The white bigot and heroic and larger than life  superior black aviators were very stereotypical,while the rest of the characters were just there for background.
  The story was horrid, and the character's actions in the story were consistently overacted I think due to poor direction and scene set up.  Some good actors were wasted in this film, the fault was not theirs. There was nothing they could set their teeth into, they were apparently just trying to get through it. I like to give positive views, but Hart's war needs to be burned.",1418342400,,1378,4.788135593220339

1205086,4,B00000F2UF,"HARTS WAR is an incredible WWII film set in a German POW camp. Bruce Willis plays Col. William A. McNamara, senior ranking American officer in the camp. Colin Farrell plays Lt. Thomas W. Hart, who has been recently captured during the Battle of the Bulge. Hart had attended Yale Law School. There is a murder in the camp and a downed Tuskegee Airmen is accused of the murder. Col. McNamara organizes a court-martial with the permission of the camp commandant Visser, played by Marcel Iure, and Lt. Hart is chosen to defend him. The court-martial is an elaborate ruse to cover a planned escape and more. HARTS WAR is an interesting film. It is worth seeing to watch Bruce Willis performance. Bruce Willis Col. William A. McNamara is a very strange character as probes and manipulates people and events. I thought Rachel Portmans score was very interesting and brought out the underlying humanity of what unfolded. HARTS WAR is an incredible film and that is just the point. It is a dark and moody film, but under it all, it lacks credibility. If HARTS WAR had been simply an outright battle of wits between Col. McNamara and commandant Visser I think it would have fared much better.",1416528000,,1182,4.714975845410628

1205145,2,B00000F2UF,"It was a very good topic to have made a better movie but some how it was botched. I read some where there is a book from where the movie was inspired, the book is excellent the movie is not. Bruce Willis is very good at martial scenarios and themes, not even him is able to save this over performed, senseless disaster.

There's a scene where a Tuskegee pilot, a black pilot, shoots down a German plane right above the POW's camp thus the allies know then where the camp is, well nobody shows up only one American plane flukes into German occupied territory once, and after it downs the other plane does nothing else like trying to destroy the sentries towers or the offices in the compound, it just leaves; time goes on for another three months, movie time, and still nobody comes.

I would not recommend this flick, watch it at your own risk.",1416441600,,844,4.403846153846154

1205152,4,B00000F2UF,"Let us agree immediately, anyone looking for a sequel to THE GUNS OF NAVARONE can expect to be disappointed. A screen adaptation of John Katzenbach's excellent novel, this late WW2 flick tackles racism, POW life and honor...and not necessarily in that order. A re-hash of the plot is unnecessary as every second reviewer has covered this aspect. It is a film to LISTEN to and to take from it what you are able. Negative comments such that the events portrayed are ""unlikely,"" that Bruce Willis isn't the ""star,"" that ""nothing happens except lots of people keep talking,"" are a sad indictment of viewers with a limited attention span. A lot of what is uttered during the ""court-room"" sequences has great relevance in all facets of life - IF you care to listen. Farrell is excellent as is Willis in what admittedly IS a far smaller role. Willis' presence however is felt throughout the movie in much the same way as was Jack Nicholson's in A FEW GOOD MEN.

Some predictable, almost cliche devices and subplots litter the overall story which by itself is compelling. I thought it was well acted and believable.  I would have liked to see more development of the relationship between the camp commandant and the defense attorney. That relationship was far more interesting than his relationship with the ranking prisoner officer played by Bruce Willis.

Was it the best movie I've seen?  Perhaps not but it was certainly a good flick that I'll be recommending to people who enjoy the genre.  It's not an uplifting movie by any stretch, but it's intriguing and perhaps a needed view of the reality of war and the brutality of it.  Perhaps we too often glorify war in remembering the stories of the war heroes and forget about the stories of the guys who were captured or the many casualties of war and how intricate and drama filled each of their lives were.

1205535,4,B00000F2UF,"This is not your typical ""Hogan's Heroes"" kind of feel good POW movie.  The movie is a tragic portrayal of heroic action by an imprisoned General (Hart) told from the viewpoint of a captured Colonel with no combat experience during WWII.  The movie deals with race hatred and involves the fates of two captured Tuskegee airmen.

The portrayals are interesting and the movie will hold your attention.  However I only gave it four stars because there is no greater meaning to the events that drive the action forward in the film.  In that sense, the movie seemed superficial to me.  The central conflict of the film turned out not to be the motivator for the heroic action.  Therefore the resolution of the conflict held no real power.",1415577600,,733,4.724409448818897

This is waaaaay over the top. Honor, bravery, is what the message is supposed to be, but excuse me here, placed in astonishingly unbelievable circumstances that might play once but not throughout the entire movie!

The self-anointed compassionate ones say we need to discuss race to heal this country, but all they are really doing is picking at scars and keeping the issue alive.  That way they can show their peers how altruistic they are, but they don't care about the plight of Black Americans in America's past.

1205723,4,B00000F2UF,"First of all, let's get some housekeeping out of the way.  HART'S WAR suffers from some of the worst marketing in cinematic history.  Bruce Willis, as POW Commander Colonel William McNamara, is a second tier character in this film.  This is not a Bruce Willis ""action"" flick--although his character has a seminal moment as the movie comes to its heart-pounding conclusion.  HART'S WAR is the story of Lieutenant Thomas Hart (one of Colin Farrell's finest roles, in my opine), a law student picked by Col. McNamara to defend an African-American officer (Terrence Howard) on court martial for the murder of a racist Sergeant (Cole Hauser).  The court martial takes place in a German POW camp, and is carefully supervised by camp commandant Col. Werner Visser (Marcel Iures).  And be on the lookout for a bit part played by a very young Sam Worthington.  The young Lt. Hart initially thinks the court martial is a kangaroo court, with McNamara pulling all the strings.  But could all of this be a ruse for something more significant for the entire camp--and the war effort?  And is McNamara willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for his men?  These are resounding questions that are emphatically answered in this dramatic thriller.

Farrell and Howard are outstanding as defender and defendant facing what appears to be overwhelming obstacles based on entirely circumstantial evidence.  And every time they score points with the jury, McNamara throws another roadblock in their way.  If you like courtroom drama, augmented by exceptional acting, HART'S WAR is definitely for you. Again, Willis is a secondary character, but he also gives a solid performance as a stubborn, apparently single-minded, commander.  The film does take a while to get going, but once the court martial is in place, with the interactions of all the major players, HART'S WAR is an exhilarating thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

He is able to play such a wide variety of characters from the seductive and scary vampire in Fright Night, the guilt ridden suicide hitman in In Brugess to the Russian Criminal in The Way Back (all highly recommended.

In Hart's war he is chosen by fellow nazi war camp captive Willis to defend a black man (Terence Howard) accused of killing a white prisoner. There are many plot twists and dramatic moments.

1205766,4,B00000F2UF,"""Hart's War"" is about a lieutenant with a background in law (Colin Farrell) who has to defend a falsely accused black pilot in a German POW camp (Terrence Howard). Marcel Iures plays the German commandant while Bruce Willis plays the tough-as-nails American colonel of the POWs.

This is obviously not a conventional WWII flick. Although it starts out with some great war action, it has more in common with films like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stalag-17/dp/B00AEBB978/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stalag 17</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Great-Escape/dp/0792838408/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Great Escape</a>"", albeit with modern filmmaking craft. As my title blurb points out, it's reminiscent of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hogan-s-Heroes-The-Komplete-Series-Kommandant-s-Kollection/dp/B002L9N4O2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hogan's Heroes: The Komplete Series, Kommandant's Kollection</a>"" but without the comedy.

The film isn't about survival in the POW camp, but rather the tensions of the prisoners and the court room drama. Some have complained that no facist camp colonel in his right mind would allow such a trial. The commandant allows it (1.) for entertainment, (2.) to witness and understand the American way, (3.) he knew the war would be over soon and wanted to have the Allie's favor, or (4.) a mixture of the above. Keep in mind that the commandant went to school in the US after the first world war so he was enamored by American lifestyle and had a fondness for jazz. I'm sure entertainment was a huge factor since POW camp life is just as boring for the captors as it is for the captives over time.

The climax telegraphs that this is a war MOVIE and not real life, but it's action-packed and ultimately quite moving.

The film runs 125 minutes and was shot in the Czech Republic.

FINAL WORD: Although it failed at the box office in 2002, ""Hart's War"" is a very good WWII POW camp movie, in some ways great.

1205767,5,B00000F2UF,"This is a superb and rather complex WW II POW movie w/a different twist. Two of the POWs are Tuskegee airmen, both of whom are the target of racist bigotry...especially from one fellow POW, a vindictive Sgt Bedford, who plants a weapon under one of their beds and then informs on him. After he is shot by a firing squad, Sgt Bedford is murdered and the prime suspect is the remaining Tuskegee airman, because of his revenge motive. Instead of summary execution, the senior-ranking American officer, Col McNamara, convinces the camp commandant, Col Visser, to convene a courts martial to try the airman. Lt Hart, by virtue of the fact he was attending law school before the war, is appointed defense lawyer. Hart learns who really killed Sgt Bedford from Col McNamara, and why. If he reveals the information he has learned it will put numerous lives in jeopardy. What will he do? That will set the stage for what is an excellent War movie. If you are intrigued so far, queue it up and see how it plays out...I think you may be surprised by the final outcome. Colin Farrell is Lt Hart and he delivers an exceptional performance; as does Terrence Howard, as the black airman on trial. They are both upstaged though by Bruce Willis as Col McNamara, in one of his finest performances; and by the acclaimed Romanian actor, Marcel Iures, as the camp commandant, Col Visser. Visser is on the one hand a typical sadistic Nazi; but on the other hand, a sympathetic character...Iures, absolutely nails the characterization. Cole Hauser likewise nails the bigoted Sgt Bedford. Universally good acting throughout and excellent pacing by director, Gregory Hoblit. If you're a fan of war movies, I'm betting you will like this",1360627200,4,1711,4.803389830508475
1205768,5,B00000F2UF,"This was an excellent moral tale which illustrated how much homework awaited the WWII-era United States regarding tolerance and enlightenment.  Fighting a war against a murderous, racist-driven, ignorance-loving regime, most Americans had the same hang-ups as Hitler - not about the same race, of course, and, in most cases, not as extreme.  But Sgt Bedford WAS as extreme about blacks as Hitler was about Jews.  Bedford was a cartoon caricature of the US at the time - features grotesquely exaggerated, unlikely (but not impossible) to be encountered in mainstream American life (outside of certain old Confederacy enclaves), but still recognizable.  The greatest weakness of the ""Greatest Generation"" - and of THEIR parents - is that most of them would have felt little or no heartburn over Bedford's rants.  They would, of course, have recoiled at Bedford's friendliness to the Nazis, but they would have been blind to its roots:  Bedford's American phobia about blacks.

The other major character, Major McNamara, is more typical of the ""Greatest Generation"" - more of a professional portrait than a cartoon drawing.  Like most of his peers, he dislikes blacks, and he ""allows appalling things to happen"", in Lincoln Scott's words.  At the end, he almost allows another appalling thing to happen:  unjustified execution of Scott in order to provide cover for Bedford's death, and thus save the tunnel project from discovery by the Germans.  But McNamara lacks Bedford's demented hatred, which drives the latter to sabotage the American war effort against Nazi Germany.  These two characters complement each other nicely, and each meets an ignoble end as a result of actions driven by his inner darkness.

Poor Thomas Hart, the title role, is shoved aside by the more powerful characters.  He seems to me to be more of a catalyst than a player.  His interrogation faux pas, his confrontation with Bedford over the wristwatch, and his trial defense of Lincoln Scott are devices that move the story along.  But he himself observes and conveys more than he actually participates in the drama.

There were many places where suspension of disbelief was necessary for the story to unfold properly.  The trial of Lincoln Scott, meant to introduce American respect for rule of law, was a bit unlikely in a POW camp; the Germans in real life would probably have not allowed it and summarily executed Scott as they did Archer.  Likewise, it is unlikely that Oberst Visser would have openly supported Hart's legal efforts on behalf of Lincoln Scott.  Visser's superiors would have been scandalized, and would likely have sanctioned him severely, because of his illicit congress with American POWs.  But the idea was to show that there were decent Germans who did not share Bedford's and Hitler's evil.  Finally, Bedford's de facto defection to Germany in the middle of WWII would have been difficult and unlikely.  He would have had a hard time adjusting to a culture shift in poverty-stricken, bombed-out postwar Europe, should he have attempted a life among German right-wing diehards.  He would have had an equally hard time returning to the US after a performance like his, and he would probably have faced court-martial, were there any survivors from his POW camp.  He might, however, have pled anti-Communism to regain his respectability.  At that time, there were many Americans in high places who would have accepted this ploy and run interference for him, just as they actually did for Europeans of his ilk who played this game (more homework for the US to do!).  But the irony of having a Hitler ""mole"" among the POWs was rich and not to be missed.

One can regard these improbabilities not as depictions of what really could have happened, but as moral statements to guide a moral tale.  All in all, this is an excellent movie.",1360281600,,3830,5.015822784810126

1205785,4,B00000F2UF,"Whatever may have been the merits of the novel (which I did not read), this is a film and not to be confused with what one can do with the written word.  This was the response Fred Astaire kept to himself -he says- when the real life person, upon whom one of his films was based, complained that the movie wasn't what she had actually done.) Mostly well acted, pretty well scripted, and within the realm of what most of us, who were not in prisoner of war camps, can accept as real, I think this will involve people for whom war films are not anathema. I admit that I was somewhat confused as to who was whom in a crowd dressed alike, mostly kept in semi-darkness, and pretty much indistinguishable beneath their semi-bearded faces. That gave a certain fuzziness to the characters, which made the ultimate ""trial"", difficult to follow in its fringes, though not in the central foci of black-white tension and sacrifice of one for others.

1205786,1,B00000F2UF,"This movie is nothing like the novel, a pretty good novel of World War II escape from a German prison of war camp.  The people who adapted the novel obviously know nothing of World War II prison camps in the Third Reich. Each branch of the armed forces had its own prison camp.  In 'Hart's War,' only flyers were held in the pow camp, no infantry or navy. What I enjoyed about the book was the character development among the prisoners and the Germans which led to a very realistic conclusion, which unfortunately, was completely lacking in the movie. The characters were changed; the incidents were changed; and the development of the plot was changed, so much, the movie does not resemble the novel. The exchange between Farrel and Howard is critical to the story line, and it is completely lacking in the movie, so much, that the movie makes no sense. Even turning the Commandant of the pow camp into a sadistic German is laughable: it did not happen in pow camps. The Commandants were usually retired or disabled German officers of the branch that held the prisoners, and they respected their prisoners. The SS were used in concentration camps.  The pathos was gone entirely from the novel in this movie. If I could, I would rate this movie a turkey, and even that is too high.  The movie makes no sense; to fully understand the movie one must read the book--this will lead the reader to the conclusion that the movie is a horrible mishmash of nonsense. This has to be one of the worse adaptations of a novel ever made; I could hardly see the novel in this movie.  I would strongly recommend instead the classic 'The Great Escape,' 'The Wooden Horse,' or 'The Colditz Story' for a good World War II pow escape movie.",1302220800,,1720,4.571428571428571
1205787,3,B00000F2UF,"For a film that, for the most part actually works, there are just too many flaws here to regard it as a good film.  The acting is convincing, especially from Willis and Farrell, and the overall feel of the film is intriguing (for the most part), but the lack of logical plotting and human depth leave the film feeling cold, distant; stagnant.

The film centers around a POW camp where a young black pilot is accused of murdering a fellow prisoner.  A young law-student lieutenant shares the camp, and thus attempts to exonerate the man he believes innocent.  He then, obviously, uncovers the truth.

First of all, do not come into this expecting an action film.  Just because the word `War' is in the title does not mean that this is going to be `Saving Private Ryan'.  The opening sequence has its fair share of excitement, but the `War' being spoken of in the film title is an internal war, a struggle for justice that Lieutenant Hart strives to attain.  So, if you are disappointed with the films `flow' then you should reevaluate your expectations of this particular film.

With that out of the way, for me this is a mixed bag.  I had a hard time swallowing a lot of the plot developments and the way that the characters themselves are developed.  A lot of the personality switches didn't make sense to me, especially not in the `extremes' with which a lot of the characters were painted.  There was a lack of balance used in developing the characters from the inside out.  That said, the acting was a saving grace because you had actors who really attempted to dig a little deeper and bring a shred of credibility to their implausible characters.

But even some good acting couldn't elevate the films emotional stagnancy, which is a shame because that is the most important aspect of a film (unless the artistic viewpoint requires an emotional detachment).  With a film like `Hart's War', one needs to become a part of the action, part of the story and I just didn't feel like that was happening with this film.  It didn't connect in the way I wanted it to.

1205789,2,B00000F2UF,"Hart's War starts out like it's going to have a *ton* of promise. Prisoners get shot, blood flies everywhere, planes from above shoot the people below in graphic fashion, a generic looking explosion, establishing the main characters... but then the film gradually morphs into Law & Order: the Movie.

I can't recall the last time I seen a plot fall completely on its behind like this one did. Bruce Willis as one of the main characters or not, this movie stinks thanks entirely to the plotline.

Why focus on the real, interesting events that took place during World War II when we can have some kind of melodramatic courtroom scene dragging out for the entire length of the film? Why focus on the real-life cruelty imposed by the Germans in a war that actually happened when instead we can be treated to a storyline that deals with skin color, prosecution and an unbelievable, makeshift jury system that the Germans themselves actually seemed to enjoy (because they sat around and watched it take place the entire time)?

Was any of this supposed to be believable?  I don't get it.  Did the Germans really admire the American jury system and thought it was legitimate and fair, and *that* was the idea behind making this movie?  I know it's based off a book so... what was the inspiration behind the creation of the book?

Honestly, if you thought the ides behind the storyline to Hart's War was a good idea, that's your choice of course, but what kind of people is this film really intended for?

The storyline stood apart from all the life-saving, action hungry, emotional heroic rescue type storylines that are normally associated with most war films.

But the more the movie progressed the better it got because each character was incredibly multi-faceted and thought-provoking. Colin Farrell plays Lieutenant Hart, a former law student who now has to use what little schooling he received  to defend Lieutenant Scott (Terrence Howard), a pilot who is being forced to be the patsy in a military murder trail. This is the first movie I have ever seen with Colin Farrell and I was very impressed with him because his emotions run the gamut of everything from enraged to terrified to shocked with such percision and complexity. As usual Bruce Willis (as Colonel McNamara) was perfect. Although the part is considerly smaller compared to Colin Farrell, Bruce sort of walked away with this movie because he is really the most memorable. What that man can accomplish with his eyes few men can do with their entire bodies. And every word out of his mouth was so real and dramatic that I probably would have thought that I was watching a period documentary (if only I hadn't recognized my very favorite actor). ""Hart's War"" includes several subplots which all have intricate meanings and all thread into the ultimate story. It's very character-driven (there's not a lot of overt violence). Instead, this film really causes the viewer to think about ethics, honor, integrity and the meaning of honesty.

When black American fighter pilots are brought to the camp, they face prejudice and a trumped-up court-martial in which the inexperienced Hart is appointed defense counsel.  This all sounds straightforward, but in reality there is a convoluted sub-plot that I will not give away in this review.  There is an interesting angle of fraternization with the German camp command that I found somewhat unrealistic, but who can say?

I have the the DVD version and the Blu-ray version. My experience has been that DVDs mastered in high definition look identical to the Blu-ray version (either on a Blu-Ray player or an upconvert DVD player). Although the DVD version has a very good transfer, I could see slight improvement in the Blu-ray version.  (The branches on the trees in the first scene had slightly better definition.)  On the other hand, it really didn't matter for most of the movie.

The real problem with the Blu-ray version was the lack of special features.  The only feature was the trailer.

1205829,2,B00000F2UF,"Welcome to a new style of reviews.  For those of you who have been following my career, my comments on the films that I have seen have been lengthy, verbose, and at times, just plain boring.  Today marks a day of change.  I am finding myself with less time, energy, and dedication to the cause, so I am changing.  Perhaps I will fall to the wayside, or pick up new fans - but for me, it is still all about the cinema.

War, really people, what is it good for?

Apparently, to those involved with the creation of the film ""Hart's War"", absolutely nothing - do you need me to say it again?  To be short and sweet, pretty-boy Farrell gets caught by Nazi's, tells a dirty secret, and somehow gets put in the posh-of-the-posh POW containment camps this side of Germany.  No brutality, no murder, no starvation - just simple catered meals and a freedom like no other.  Willis plays a Colonel that somehow was captured and has named this base as his ""luxury"" suite.  He is best friends with the Nazi commander, while all the time planning the big escape.

Did I hint towards ""The Great Escape"" - please don't think the same thoughts with this film.  What makes ""Hart's War"" a bit more random than you typical war film is that the bigotry, hatred, and racism comes from not the Nazis, but the American soldiers.  It comes in the form of Terrance Howard.  One time racism turns its dirty head, people look the other way - but the second time, it takes us into a melodramatic, off-the-beaten-path courtroom drama that can be viewed in an assortment of regular films.  It sparks nothing new, nor anything of interest.  Continually, we wait for Howard, or Willis, to shout that cult-like phrase, ""You can't handle the truth"", and it nearly happens, when Willis reveals his wild card and changes the course of the war forever.

How bland.

""Hart's War"" fails because it involves too many elements and not enough time, or maybe, too many elements and too long of time.  Instead of sticking with a war story, we are bludgeoned with another story of racism, another story of respect, another story of lies, and jumbled between it all a story about escape.  It is too much for one film to handle, and as our characters become less and less dimensional, as does the film.  Willis is Willis.  If you have seen any of his work this decade, you have seen his character in this film.  Farrell remains shaved and pretty-boy throughout the film, continually denouncing the authenticity, which was already faulted by the fact that it seemed like nobody was against anyone in this camp.  I think that is what struck me as odd, the layout of the camp.  Why were the Russians treated worse than the Americans?  Did they not have a Bruce Willis of their own?

Questions upon questions continue to pile until we think we have had enough then another world opens in the final act giving us another reason to yell, ""oh brother!"".  The ending lacks consistency, as we are left with no resolutions, no finale, and no moment of Zen.  It is perfect for you Willis nay-slayers out there, but for the rest of us, we are left with a symbolic ending that will bring a tear to the women, and the rest of us demanding our money back.

This film contained very little action, very little suspense, and very little answers to bigger underlining questions.  It was a hastily put together film that boasted big names, but bigger downfalls.  For two hours I was plummeted into everything Hollywood could think of to throw into a film.  While I believe it had potential, what happened in the end is that the director could not control the momentum.  This is strange, because I loved ""Fallen"" so very much.  ""Hart's War"" did start strong, in my eyes, with some decent cinematography (I enjoyed the opening snow scene), but fell of the face of the Earth by the end of the first hour.

So, again my friends, I must ask - what is war good for?

To my reply ... absolutely nothing.

 I cannot suggest this film to friends or family.  Poor acting, too many plot points, and an unresolved ending makes me give ""Hart's War"" a

1205830,5,B00000F2UF,"""Hart's War"" is one of those often forgotten war movies, sometimes hard to find in the rental aisle, but a good part of any collection. It features one of the best performances by Colin Farrell, a then promising young actor (pre Alexander, Miami Vice). Bruce Willis also offers understated yet solid acting. Notable performances by Marcel Iures and Terrence Howard are also worth mentinoning. The plot offers intrigue, action, a courtroom drama and relevant issues. Highly entertaining!",1170979200,,486,5.324675324675325
1205831,4,B00000F2UF,"I finally got around to watching this movie last night (after buying it for $4 on DVD a few weeks ago) and I can say I was very pleasantly surprised by it after reading so many negative reviews.

The Problem: This film was mareketed poorly - the trailers give an accurate idea of the content, but they give you the wrong impression as to the tone.  Because Bruce Willis is in it, they chose to make it out to contain tons of action and heroic combat!  They also chose to make it appear to be a Bruce Willis vehicle.  Let me tell you, if you are renting or buying it for either of the above reasons, you will hate it!  The ""combat action"" scenes are sparse (two scenes) and extremely short (though very exciting when they do occur.  And Bruce Willis is really a supporting actor to Farrel - in fact, of the major characters, he probably has less screen time than anyone else, and is rarely seen outside of Farrel's perspective.

(Also, Americans seem to reject the idea that Nazis in an interrment camp could have had a shred of civility.  Perhaps this film gave them a little too much credit - but I think that even as evil as they were, not all Nazis were inhuman brutes.)

The Good: So, the first thing you need to do is lay aside your expectation of a SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or GUNS OF NAVARONNE type movie.  This is a drama!  And it is a very good one.  There are several layers to this story - one is that of Lt. Hart's (Colin Farrel) need for redemption after an early failure in the film.  His assignment to defend the falsely accused marine gives him that chance.  The main story is the trial of a marine who asserts he was framed for the murder of a fellow marine in the stockade.  Farrel quickly learns that the cards are stacked against him as the presiding officer McNamara (Willis) seemse bent on a guilty verdict.  This sets up some very tense confrontations between the two.

Adding a second layer to this drama is the apparently misunderstood character of the commanding Nazi officer Werner Visser.  Visser represents an aging officer who has wound up in a remote post and seems to have accepted this lesser role.  (Someone commented below that his ""nice guy"" attitude would not get him far in the German Army - ahem, well, I think that's the point - that's why he's watching over a camp rather than storming the frontlines!) He is a foil to Willis's McNamara, who wants nothing more than to get back to the war.  The confusion as to why Visser suddenly wants to help Hart is that people perceive this as Visser suddenly becoming the nice Nazi.  Well, anyone paying attention can see that Visser is ONLY motivated by getting back at McNamara.  Hart is a convenient tool to do so - but there is not fondness for Hart from Visser, as you will see by the film's end.

The third layer is that of the racist motivation behind the original crime.  Two of the confined officers are African-American, and they are portrayed in a very heroic light here - but the white enlisted men are very prejudiced to their presence (this is the 40s, remember).  This gives ample opportunity to see racism as it truly is - these are fine outstanding officers, but their contributions are ignored by those who only see the color of their skin.  Someone said below that the film portrayed the African-American soldiers as Spineless and hapless - I don't know what movie he saw, I think the film COMBATED this misconception!

Combining these three threads takes a skillful director, and Hoblit shows himself up to the task.  The film never loses momentum, but switches nicely between the various threads.  The writing is crisp, the cinematography is appropriately drab and dreary in its own beautiful way (love the light beams coming through the barrack windows) and the few actions scenes keep the excitement level high.  All told, this is an excellent movie, and one I am proud to own - it's a shame more people will miss out on it because of the critics who didn't get it.

The Bad: That is not to say it is the perfect film.  I did have a difficult time following alot of what was going on for the first hour, but near the end, when a plot twist was introduced, much of these scenes made more sense.  Also, some of the dialogue was either poorly recorded, or poorly delivered.  But, my main gripe was covered above about the misleading marketing of this film.

The Summation: Think of it as a combination of THE GREAT ESCAPE, A FEW GOOD MEN, and TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD - with the final sum being just a few notches below each of these titles, and you'll get an idea of what you're in for . . . give it a chance!",1124409600,59,4602,4.438095238095238
1205832,1,B00000F2UF,"Saw ""Hart's War"" the other night and couldn't really believe anyone would invest money and time in a film as awful as this one.  This film bombed at the box office and was yanked from circulation after only a few days.  Here are ten reasons why:

1.  This film isn't ""The Great Escape"" and even though he would probably like to think otherwise, Bruce Willis isn't Steve McQueen.  Even though Willis received top billing, this is a Colin Farrell vehicle.

2.  The vast majority of the target audience of 18-34 year old moviegoing males could care less about what happened during the Reagan administration, much less World War II.  ""Hart's War"" may just as well be a film about a POW camp during the War of 1812.  Anything with Vin Diesel or the Rock would be bound to sell more tickets.

3.  As far as depicting life in a POW camp, ""Hart's War"" is pretty much on par with ""Hogan's Heroes"".  The Germans are nice guys with guns who don't know very much and everyone gets away with just about anything.  Where did the GI's get all those cigarettes, anyway?

4.  Any Stalag Luft comandant worth his weight in sauerkraut would have just as soon killed the Bruce Willis character as look at him.  As depicted in ""Hart's War"", the camp commandant (as portrayed by Marcel Lures) would have had a very difficult time maintaining any sort of status as an officer in the German Army.  His collection of American jazz/blues records is a cute writer's invention that has nothing to do with the reality of the situation, or of the type of men who were in charge of German POW camps.  In reality, the Marcel Lures character would probably have been relegated to another type of nazi camp with a pink triangle sewn on the front of his tunic.

5.  The storyline is not completely unbelievable - trials did take place in POW camps, one good example being the POW's who were tried and hung in Andersonville;  However, the whole idea that the camp's commandant would actively participate in such a trial as sort of a Jerry Springer type advocate is ludicrous.

6.  The idea that during the trial, a group of POW's who escape go on a secret mission to destroy a nearby munitions factory is insulting.  Not only did nothing like this ever happen during World War II, it degrades the bravery of those poor souls whose only act of heroism was to survive internment under harsh and sometimes brutal conditions.  The German army simply wasn't that stupid.

7.  I saw this film once and didn't like it.  I thought that maybe the second time would be better.  It wasn't.

8.  Beyond being sheer Hollywood political correctness, ""Hart's War"" seriously misrepresents many of the more important aspects of internment.  It ignores the real focus of life in such a Stalag which, for most POW's, was just day to day survival.  Also, the soldiers who served in our armed forces during World War II and also happened to be African Americans weren't spineless, hapless dopes.

9.  Bruce Willis playing the same role in variations of ""Die Hard"" over and over and over again is tiring.

10.  Better films about the same sort of subject matter are ""The Tuskeegee Airmen"" and ""Stalag 17"".  Hopefully in a few years, ""Hart's War"" will be completely forgotten, and these dvd's will be rotting in some landfill.",1118707200,8,3267,4.627177700348432
1205833,4,B00000F2UF,"I thought the movie had a great plot.  The Bruce Willis role of being in charge of a POW camp in Germany.  To sacifice a black American Airman for the good of an escape plot is abhorrid.  The thing is I'm sure this could have some historical merit.  Collin's role is quite good as he launches his investigation into the war crime.  It brought up racial bigotry in a way not told too often.  We talk of the atrocities of Nazi Germany, but we do the same things here --- even today.  I did not think Collin's role should have pointed out the area where Allied men were after being captured before arriving at the POW Camp.  Being a fan of Mr. Linus Roache, (great British thespian) was not pleased he had such a small role in this film either.  He deserves better from US films.  Other than the fiction of the '60s comedy Hogan's Heroes, I really doubt that things in a POW Camp in Germany, or anywhere are really that calm.  If your a fan of Bruce Willis, or Collin Ferrell this would be for you.  As for me being a fan of Linus Roache it left flatter than old soda.  Also this was a film of merit as it delved into the subject of racism in America, and everywhere.

A modern era message here maybe, ""We have No Business in Iraq,""  We should clean our own house first, then help other nations.",1099180800,2,1292,4.216326530612245
1205876,4,B00000F2UF,"In early 2002, movie audiences were still getting acquainted Irish newcomer Colin Farrell.  On the same token, they were also quite familiar with Bruce Willis' acting credentials.  Putting the two of them together in a racially charged World War II drama would seem an unlikely mixture.  Farrell was already establish his bad boy credentials in Hollywood and Bruce Willis, despite a recent renaissance with films like ""Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"", was still being remembered mostly as `Mr. Joe Actionhero' from movies like ""Die Hard"".  As strange as this combination would seem, actors and story, the resulting ""Hart's War"" turns out to be surprisingly good film.

""Hart's War"" is set in the waning months of World War II.  While the Allied forces are locked in the struggle of their lives in the Battle of the Bulge, Lieutenant Thomas Hart (Farrell) remains comfortably behind the lines at headquarters, courtesy of strings pulled by his father, a United States Senator.  However, one day Hart volunteers to drive an infantry captain back to the front lines and ends up a prisoner when his jeep is ambushed by Germans posing as Allied MPs.  After a few days of interrogation, he is sent to a German P.O.W. camp where he is promptly billeted to bunk with the enlisted men because he was less than truthful with Colonel McNamara (Willis), the ranking U.S. P.O.W. about the information he gave up under interrogation.  The routine seems to be setting in as the Hart prepares to spend the rest of the war in captivity.  That is, until a few new prisoners are added to the U.S. contingent, two black pilots from the Tuskegee Airmen.  Needless to say, in the still segregated U.S. Army, this does not sit well with many of the soldiers; especially a racist sergeant in Hart's barracks named Bedford (Cole Hauser).  Bedford conspires to get one of the pilots executed on a trumped up charge and not long afterwards, Bedford ends up murdered, seemingly by the other pilot as revenge.  Instead of ordering an immediate for execution of the second pilot, the camp Commandant (Marcel Iures) agrees to let McNamara form a military tribunal to try the case, with Hart, a law student, defending the pilot, Lt. Scott (Terrence Howard).  Of course, there is more to this trial than just trying to see justice served.  McNamara wants to buy time for an important plan while the German staff is distracted by the proceedings, and the entire tribunal is merely a pawn in this plan.

""Hart's War"" owes a large debt to great World War II prison movie such as ""Stalag 17"" and ""The Great Escape"".  Certainly, many elements are borrowed from these films.  However, it's the addition of the racism angle that sets this film apart.  While some will see this as a forced-upon-the-audience message, it actually fits quite well when one looks at the overall arc of the story.  ""Hart's War"" is not meant to be a referendum on racism in the U.S. Army in that era.  It simply uses that issue as a way to distract all the characters from the true mission of McNamara's (while also still managing to make a point about racism).  Willis, in his role as McNamara, continues to bring the demeanor of quiet, dignified fury about him that he first put into use in ""Sixth Sense"".  It's a strong performance, matched Farrell's nuance effort as the nave (but learning) Tom Hart.  Marcel Iures as the conflicted, manipulative commandant is also a treat to watch.  While ""Hart's War"" won't ever been in the upper pantheon of great war films like ""Patton"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"", it is a still solid, compelling entertainment and certainly worth a watch.",1097366400,3,3615,4.820097244732577
1205877,2,B00000F2UF,"HART'S WAR had potential. The last months of World War Two as a backdrop with demoralized GI's crammed into an overcrowded POW compound.  If this picture was soley about the hardships endured by surrendered soldiers during the Battle of the Bulge, then it could have had a chance.  Instead the film makers took on too many plots and subplots.

Unintentionally the movie borrows from SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, A SOLDIER'S STORY, THE GREAT ESCAPE and STALAG 17.  A cardinal rule in war films is that the premise has to be simple.  In HART'S WAR we find some good elements lost in a virtual Mulligan stew.

In the story Colin Farrell's character, a rear echelon lawyer, accompanies another officer on what he thinks is a joyride.  Unfortunately for Farrell, the Germans have launched their attack in the Ardennes. The young lawyer is captured, harshly interrogated, and finally shipped out to a German stalag.  There he meets the senior POW officer, played by Bruce Willis, and tries to settle down in the dirty and uncomfortable life of a POW.  A soldier is killed and a recently downed Tuskegee airman is accused of murder.  Yes, you guessed it.  Farrell takes on the aviator's defense during the subsequent courts martial.

If director Gregory Hoblit left the storyline to develop around the trial a decent film could have emerged.  Instead we have additions of Colonel Hart's unexplained behavior, an mass tunnel escape plot, sabotage and the German Commandant's attempt to befriend the American lawyer as superfluous baggage.

HART'S WAR was filmed in the Czech Republic, no doubt to cut costs.  A little more effort and a lot less story and this film would have had a better showing at the box office.  Still, if you enjoy war movies you should probably add this DVD to your collection.",1089936000,2,1784,4.8966666666666665

In the few years since he burst on the scene in TIGERLAND, he has given us marvelous performances in films such as MINORITY REPORT, PHONE BOOTH, and THE RECRUIT.  In HART'S WAR, it is heart and fierce performance that drives this well executed film.  Director Gregory Hoblit (Fallen, Frequency) has orchestrated a tense, inspiring and suspenseful look at men in war.  Bruce Willis also stars as Colonel McNamara, a man whose intense desire to be at war obscures his humanity and morality.  Terence Howard as Lt. Scott, accused of murdering a bigoted soldier, is also brilliant in his uncompromising performance.  Howard never overdoes the prejudice he faces, and is truly moving in his speech about the German POWs treatment in Alabama as compared to African-Americans.  Marcel Iuries as the German commandant gives a multi-layered performance of a man driven to exert his power and yet commiserate on the agonies of war.  The rest of the cast, including Sam Jaeger (Fisk) and Cole Hauser (Brendon) are perfect.  The cinematography, music and editing are likewise top notch, and HART'S WAR provides us a searing, heartbreaking look at the power of honor and justice.

It doesn't portray all Germans as animals as some movies do - it actually show some of them as humans who do care a little bit about justice.
Colin Farrel does a splendid job as the role of the lead actor. Bruce Willis does better but his role is not the lead one. He does an exceptional job of letting Colin Farrel take a lot of the camera time while at the same time making the movie. Without him it couldn't have happened. Bruce Willis is exceptional and both characters will surprise you at the end. If you don't buy it it is a must see unless you can't stand courtroom drama.",1083110400,2,841,4.1656441717791415

As far as POW films go this was on par with STALAG 17 and THE GREAT ESCAPE. The camp seemed have the same layout as the two movies I mentioned above but the buildings seemed to be worn down and more in line with what a prison camp would be like. I've spent time in Norway. It seems that you are always in the shadow of some mountain and it creates a dark depressing atmosphere. I thought the way the director captured the dark winter was just right.
I'm not a big fan of Colin Farrell but thought he did a fine job as did all the actors. Bruce Willis has worked hard to shed his action image and it has paid off. For a movie just over 2 hours I think it does quite well to include a murder mystery, racial confrontations, prison escape and a courtroom drama. This film is well worth a view!

1205882,3,B00000F2UF,"Well, why not get the positives out of the way first. I thought Id brought home a good even great one after the stunning 'Battle of the Bulge' jeep-scene and chase in the opening sequence. Tense little scene, beautifully-filmed, this was the highlight of the film in the first 10 minutes in terms of convincing atmosphere, I really believed I was in this jeep stopped by German infiltrators dressed as Yanky MPs in the Battle of the Bulge, this sort of thing in very general terms was happening then.
 And for further credit, the experienced-guy whos 'on the ball' and 'gets wise' to these 'Krauts',  spots the heavily-camouflaged German weapons-pit in the snowy tree-line ( eyes sideways while nervously chewing cigar, looked right.) and makes a sudden brave move on these American-speaking German  Kommandos doesnt kick-asse or even make it, is actually killed outright immediately, as the odds would generally guarantee. The other guy roars off in a sequence recalling James Caan's jeep-rally in 'A Bridge Too Far' but after looking like he might make it, the jeep crashes to a wheel-spinning engine-revving halt in a hole . Bravo. Thats a cut! Top war action-scene, frankly.
The old  'For you zee war iss ofer, Schweinehund!'  trick.
 Fair-enough.
We have a fair but routine POW convened criminal trial, with some PC overtones, good-guy German Kommandant( there were bad Germans , like Anton Diffring in this war, and jolly-decent Germans, to allow for the fact Germans  became good when the Russians simultaneously became bad in 1945. All the bad Germans like Anton Diffring we either hanged or shot, or employed at the CIA or NASA, so we definateley only had good ones around from then on-oh yeah, a lot of the good Germans like Rommel and Canaris were also disposed-of  by the bad Germans)more PC overtones with falsely-accused good black- man by racist bad white-man (Cole Hauser, who steals the film, perhaps, I like this actor, seen him around, always good value)
BruCe Willis just walks through being Bruce Willis,  and on balance we are travelling solidly but routinely, and then comes the preposterous 'Hogans Heroes' without the laughs , ending. This ending should not have been attempted without Sergeant Schultz, Colonel Klink or at least, Major Hochstedder. Prisoners mass-escape and blow up sinister grenade or ammunition-factory next-door on the way out, 'changing the course of the war'
Oh, dear.
One previous-reviewer asked 'did anything like this ever happen in the war?' NO, it did not, Nothing remotely like it.  Prisoners occasionally escaped, they did not blow up German plants on the way home, and even if the had, this is weeks after the Battle of the Bulge where the main character is captured, the war was within 5 months of conclusion at the end of this battle, and the destruction of one ammo or grenade factory BY ANYBODY was not deciding the war at any point in the war, let alone January 1945. Allied bombers had been blasting factories like that routinely for 3 years without seeming to even slow the Germans down.

1205885,1,B00000F2UF,"My brother bought me this book a long time ago from a dollar-store. He bought it more for a lark than anything else. The other day I decided to read it. The book had me glued to my chair, and I read it cover to cover in just over a day. John Katzenbach's portrayal of life in Stalag Luft XIII is gripping, terrifying, exciting and heart-warming all at once. J.K's father was, himself, a POW at one of the many Stalag Luft camps during WW2.
But, the screen production of Hart's War is not Katzenbach's portrayal at all, but that of director Greqory Hoblit. The movie fails to bring to life the characters from the book, and some very important characters are missing too. The movie seems to be aimed at showing everyone the great American justice system... Hollywood style! There is no mention of the British and Canadian Officers who play such a vital role in the unfolding of the plot. Not only that, but the entire plot, how it unfolds and the proceedings thereafter is completely different. While there are a lot of good points to the movie like Farrell's performance for instance, it does this great book little or no justice.
If its just the movie you're interested in then crack on by all means, but if you crave attention to detail, and all the thrills of a good criminal investigation set amidst a POW camp then the book is for you. I would suggest you read the book instead, or at least before you see the movie. It only costs a couple of bucks and its available right here on Amazon!",1062201600,6,1493,4.432727272727273

1205916,5,B00000F2UF,"First of all, I wanted to see Hart's War, because it is one of the few WWII revival films that came out recently, a fresh return to a genre that produced many classics and great entertainment. Having said that, I had no other idea about what the film was about,nor had I read the book, and my ignorance my greatly rewarded by discovering a powerful movie that remained with me long after the credit rolled. This is what I sometimes enjoy most about watching films, having to discover them all by myself, reading no reviews beforehand, and knowing little about it.
I will not go on a lot about the plot, since it has been well written about by other reviewers, save to say it is a film about a German POW camp towards the end of the war. The politics, racism, survival instinct that exist among the prisoners go hand in hand with honor,integrity and incredible courage. I am surprised to see that many have compared the film to The Great Escape, something I did not quite see. Yes, there is an escape attempt, and a daring operation, but it not by far the core of the plot! The film is more about these human values that are put under incredible pressure, where some will succumb, some will passively resist, while just a few will abide by an unwavering sense of honor, and duty and face the consequences with dignity.
And it is not about war itself, though what little action we see, (the raid on the train station for example,) are very well directed and edited.
The movie is first and foremost about acting and excellent actors! Colin Farrell adds lots of vulnerablity to his role, and gives his best performance to date, Bruce Willis sinks his teeth into the meatiest, most three dimensional role he had had for a while, Marcel Iures plays to perfection the German POW commander with a sense of civility of an educated man at times, and the ruthlessness of a Nazi officer at others.
But, in my opinion the revelation of the film is Terence Howard!!What a brilliant actor and what a performance! subdued yet full of depth, reflecting the invisible heroes of WWII, the African-Americans who fought bravely for their country, facing impossible odds from everyone!
The last ten minutes of the film ,which I will not reveal since it has many shocking twists, are very powerful! I just kept looking, transfixed to the screen, with all my senses glued to the events that unfolded before me.
This is by far Gregory Hoblit,(Frequency, Fallen, Primal Fear) best film to date, one that if you give it a chance,forget Great Escape for a minute, and watch it with some kind of ignorance, then it will surely reward you with a movie experience rarely seen these days.",1058745600,,2656,4.605485232067511

It's more or less a remake of The Great Escape (1963), but instead of the comic Escape (a la Hogan's Heroes), Hart's War takes on a more serious, dramatic element (which isn't to belittle the Nazi POW comedy, I personally liked Great Escape more). There are well done performances by Willis and Farrell--very low key--but the truly great performance in this film is Marcel Iures as the Nazi camp commandant. He manages to keep from being a cliche and humanizing what would normally be portrayed as a 'monster.' You even find yourself liking the man.

From the opening sequences which blend artfully into the credits we are introduced to Colin Farrell's character, an officer who sits comfortably at a desk behind lines, due apparently to the fact that his father has clout with the military.  Very quickly Farrell becomes a fugitive from an ambush and ends up in a POW camp run by two powerful characters, Bruce Willis as the understated US oficer in charge of the POWs and Marcel Iures as the Commandant of the camp.  Power struggles develop, Farrell moves gingerly into the role of a defense lawyer for an African American officer, the inevitable tunnel out of the camp toward escape is dug, etc.  It is not so much the tale that is being told that is as winsome as the performances by the actors mentioned.  Colin Farrell is becoming this generation's fine-tuned heroic actor, Bruce Willis manages his part without the usual wisecracking asides, and the work of Iures is extraordinary.

Anyway, this is a good movie.  The SLOW start to this movie really detracts from the good story.  The makers of the movie should have spent more time developing the two main characters, and less time with trivial scenes that do not add much to the story. There is a weak attempt to throw in some action at the beginning, and I cannot figure out the significance to the story.
Also, do not expect this movie to be an action movie.  This movie is really more like a courtroom drama, set in a german POW camp during WW II. The marketing of this movie was more along the lines of an action movie, which was a mistake.
On a technical note, I found that the DVD dialogue is a little too quiet in comparison to the background noise and soundtrack, etc.  Many scenes it is really difficult to hear what the characters are saying, and the fact that some of them speak with german accents makes it even harder to hear correctly.  I had to turn up the volume very loundly to hear what they were saying.  At first, I thought it was just me, then I watched it again with my wife and mother and they also had trouble hearing the dialogue.

While impressively produced with accurate equipment, the film suffers from a basic reality check:  Allied prisoners were not this well treated by 1945.  Having spoken with someone who was in a German POW camp as a GI in late 1944 his description of the conditions were a lot worse than what's shown here.  In fact he found this movie to be dead wrong in that regard.  If the conditions shown were a year earlier he could have beleived it, but by 1944-45 the Germans were running out of everything and had scant resources to spare for allied POWs.  Conditions were therefor a lot worse than shown here.  The whole barrack room lawyer court case and racial bit shown is another Hollywood ploy for political correctness in today's movies.  God, will we ever be rid of this deadening influence which spoils so many films today.  Even Blacks must be getting tired of this by now.  But for these detracting elements the movie tries to follow in the footsteps of earlier well known POW epics like ""The Great Escape"" and ""Stalag 17"".

1205985,4,B00000F2UF,"WARNING: Do not watch the trailer for ""Hart's War"" before you watch the film.  I almost did that and changed my mind at the last minute, which was good because the trailer spoils 90% of the movie.  I probably enjoyed the film more than I would have otherwise because I did not know what was up.  It has been a while since I have seen a trailer do such a gross disservice to a film.
It will suprrise a lot of viewers that Bruce Willis is not the title character in ""Hart's War.""  Willis plays Col. William McNamara, commanding officer of the American Troops at German Stalag VI A.  Colin Farrell is Lt. Thomas Hart and who he is and how he came to be at this place is one of the first major pieces in the puzzle of what is happening in this film.  But then a pair of black Air Corps pilots, Lt. Lincoln Scott (Terrence Howard) and Lt. Lamar Archer (Vicellous Shannon) enter the camp to a hostile reception from their fellow Americans.  Meanwhile, the camp's Russian prisoners are doing forced labor at a bomb factory that the Allies think only makes shoes.
What we know about World War II films set in P.O.W. camps is that there is supposed to be an escape (e.g., ""The Great Escape,"" ""Von Ryan's Express"").  What we do not expect is a court martial, but that becomes the event that starts to bring all the sub-plots together in this film (unless, of course, you made the mistake of watching that trailer).  However, having created some momentum towards the conclusion it has carefully constructed, the film throws it away at the end, and not to some greater good.  If this had happened after I had seen the trailer I would have been motivated to really trash this film because it would have been the proverbial adding insult to injury.
Willis's face was used to sell this film but Col. McNamara is really a substantial supporting role.  This is primarily Colin Farrell's film and he has as much conflict with the characters of Lt. Scott and the Nazi commandant Col. Visser (Marcel Iures) as he does McNamara.  I can not speak to John Katzenbach's novel, beyond the disparaging comments directed at it by Stephen King in his book on writing, but the screenplay by Billy Ray and Terry George certainly wants to comment on racism.

1205988,4,B00000F2UF,"Marcel Iures , thats who! Portraying the commandant of Stalag VI, Marcel Iures steals the show from Bruce Willis , the nominal star of this unusual ""war"" movie. I was not sure of what to expect from this DVD other than most Bruce Willis roles are of a tough guy with some depth. The co-star , Colin Farrell , comes across as a real wimp-dimp little rich boy sent to war , inadvertantly captured in the Battle of the Bulge , interrogated , broken , and sent off to a stalag to sit out the remainder of the war.
In the prison camp ,Col. McNamara , portrayed by Willis , shunts Lt. Hart , portrayed by Farrell , to the enlisted men's barracks instead of quartering him properly as an officer. Shortly thereafter , two Tuskeegee airmen (black pilots)who have been shot down are also sent to the enlisted barracks with Hart. A highly predictible racial scene ensues--an execution takes place-- and another racially inspired ""setup"" finds Lt. Hart as a defense counsel for the surviving black pilot.
Through all these antics we observe Col. Visser (Marcel Iures) attempting to maintain order and discipline in the camp with an iron hand. As the story progresses , we see an unusual depth of character emerge from the man. In all , Iures' portrayal is what saves an otherwise somewhat weak movie.
Altho' I gave this a 4 star rating , based primarily on the acting of Mr. Iures , it is probably only worthy of 3 stars otherwise. Overall an entertaining way to spend an evening at home.",1044921600,2,1477,4.535580524344569
1205989,4,B00000F2UF,"This is the only American-made World War II movie I have seen that does not present US soldiers as heroes on the battlefield. Instead, it shows us the internal dynamics of US prisoners kept in rather good conditions in a German POW camp. The contrast between the treatment Germans accord to the Americans and that they mete out to Soviet prisoners is disturbing, as is the behaviour of certain white American prisoners towards their black comrades. Thus, the violence in this movie does not consist of hours of blood-soaked footage, but rather of the more subtle violation of human dignity.
The story revolves around a young lieutenant from a privileged background who cracks all too easily under German interrogation and spends the rest of the movie trying to earn the respect of his fellow inmates. His quest to redeem himself drives him into constant confrontation with the ranking US officer in the German camp, from which they both emerge wiser men.
This is a rather refreshing war movie, for it avoids overblown heroism and shows us, instead, the triumphs and failures of ordinary men caught in an extraordinary situation.",1044662400,,1128,4.973544973544974

1205991,4,B00000F2UF,"""Hart's War"" was, in my opinion, plagued by its own promotion; thus its brief run in theaters.  Through the trailers and other advertising, it seemed as though the studio couldn't decide whether to market it as ""The Great Escape"" for a new generation, or whether it was to be ""A Few Good Men"" set in World War II.  Those expecting it to be in either category will be sorely disappointed.  ""Hart's War"" turned out to be an interesting character drama that, while incorporating some parts of similar movies that have preceded it, proved to stand out as a unique film in the genre.
The basic plot involves Hart, a rear-echelon staff aide, winding up in a POW camp after an unfortunate errand gets him captured by the Germans.  There he meets Colonel MacNamara, who doesn't trust Hart, fearing that Hart spilled secrets during his interrogation.  Enter a downed Tuskegee airman, later accused of murder.  MacNamara, trying to cover for his escape and sabotage plan, convinces the stalag commandant to hold a court-martial, at which Hart will defend the airman as a means of keeping him out of MacNamara's plan and distracting the Germans while they carry it out.
The story plods along in a lot of places, and nothing very dynamic occurs until the climax and surprise ending to the movie.  In that respect, it would merit a low rating.  However, it is the climax and surprise ending that save the movie and highlight the uniqueness that separates this movie from its predecessors.  But, most importantly, it is the characters which drive this drama.
Colin Farrell is rather plain in the lead role of Hart.  If anything, he annoyed me in that he came off as a wimp and someone to despise, until a brief stand of courage at the end salvages his role somewhat.  Perhaps this was the intent of Mr. Farrell's role, but all in all, nothing really distinguishes him, and the outstanding roles of the supporting cast make his rather forgettable.
Bruce Willis, billed as the marquee name in this movie, plays Colonel MacNamara.  However, the marquee billing is deceptive, as Mr. Willis plays much more of a supporting role.  But, he has a track record of being able to step out or share the spotlight and creates memorable, subdued supporting characters.  This is what he accomplishes here, portraying a man from a legendary military family who wrestles with the personal demons of being captured before he can have his moments of valor.  His brooding adds to the edge and command of his role, making the viewer believe he is truly the leader of the POW's interred at the camp.
But perhaps the best role in this movie - and one of the remarkable roles in any movie in recent years - goes to Marcel Iures, who portrays the German stalag commandant.  I was utterly fascinated by the depth, complexity, and quiet brilliance of this character.  The commandant is a world-weary man, burdened by the loss of family and friends in years of war, and knowing that he is on the losing side of this conflict.  However, in the face of all this, he attempts to maintain some order and discipline in the camp - accentuated by the occasional flash of evil - while at the same time balancing a system of respect and equity for the Allied officers (MacNamara and the other POW's).  He allows the court-martial in the guise of fairness, though behind the scenes, he attempts to rig the trial to his favor.  He lashes out with cruelty, yet fights emotions of sorrow and extraordinary remorse in an act he performs near the end of the movie.  Mr. Iures elegantly and quietly carries off this complex role in a way I believe no one else could have.  As I noted, I found his to be one of the most remarkable roles on film in recent years; a pity that more people did not - or will not - witness it.
All in all, I give ""Hart's War"" a four-star rating for the outstanding roles portrayed by Mr. Willis and Mr. Iures, and for a different twist on the prisoner-of-war camp genre.  The story does move rather slowly and predictably, which prevents me from rating it with a full five stars.

Willis is older and wiser now). And the real character twist was the Nazi comandant of the POW camp who seemed a little laxed in character and not befitting of the stereo typical film Nazi.

1206037,4,B00000F2UF,"HART'S WAR the movie bears more resemblance to HART'S WAR the book than it does to its own trailers.
The ostensible leading role of this film is played by Bruce Willis as Colonel William McNamara, the ranking American officer in a German stalag for Allied prisoners towards the end of WWII. However, the primary character is arguably Lt. Tommy Hart (Colin Farrell), recently captured and interrogated before being deposited in the prison. Under relatively mild coercion by his Wehrmacht captors, Hart had pinpointed a crucial U.S. Army supply dump that was subsequently captured by the Germans during the 1944 Ardennes offensive, so Tommy's self-esteem is at low ebb. In any case, on the basis of Hart's two years of law school, McNamara assigns him to defend Lt. Lincoln Scott (Terence Howard), a Negro fighter pilot recently arrived in the camp and now to be courtmartialed for the murder of a fellow POW, the racist Staff Sgt. Bedford (Cole Hauser).
HART'S WAR the movie is part murder mystery and part courtroom drama. What it definitely isn't, as otherwise implied by its pre-release previews, is a Bruce Willis action flick. Perhaps that's why the film swiftly disappeared from the Big Screen - it was a bit more intelligent than the trailer-targeted audiences could bear.
While Willis plays second fiddle to Farrell, the most intriguing character is that of the German camp commandant, Col. Visser (Marcel Iures), a world-wise veteran wounded in the Great War now engaged in a battle of wills with the no-nonsense  West Pointer McNamara. Is the help in case preparation Visser gives young Hart simply because both attended the same American university, or does it stem from a more hidden agenda? And what are those Russian POWs up to at that shoe factory next door? Also effective is Terrence Howard as Scott. At one point in the trial, he describes the freedoms German POWs, who were interned in the Deep South, enjoyed that were denied to the uniformed Tuskegee airmen in training, such as sitting in the front row of theaters or eating at certain diners. His speech is a pointed reminder of the virulent racism that once characterized America's military forces until only relatively recently.
I enjoyed HART'S WAR the movie because it was a reasonably faithful adaptation of the excellent novel, and all the characters were well-played, particularly the fascinating Visser.",1031961600,4,2383,5.048223350253807
1206038,4,B00000F2UF,"This is another in a series of recent films that seem to be less interested in plot plausibility than with getting a great ensemble cast together to spin a decent yarn. For me the problems with the plot here really strain the credibility of everything else, and although I liked the performance of all concerned, I found myself impatient at points because it all seemed far too contrived. Having said this, the acting is uniformly good, and I found that to be the one redeeming feature of the film.
Colin Farrell is especially good here, and acting out the title role lends credibility and verve to the film. Likewise, Marcel Lures does a good job convincing us he is indeed an evil and manipulative Camp Commander. Bruce Willis is also terrific as the by-the-book West Point graduate and Prisoner Commander who must decide whether or not to intercede to save Hart from his existential situation. Given his willingness to let one man die for the good of many, the choice he must make is by no means a foregone conclusion.
The action sequences are extremely well choreographed and photographed, and while the plot reels from happenstance to happenstance all too conveniently to be believed, the film is entertaining and intriguing in bringing up social issues one does not ordinarily think about in terms of the Second World War. While this isn't intended as a serious drama, it is a good action flick that will keep you entertained if you don't allow the potboiler plot to get in the way.

It did not depict an accurate perspective or scenerio of what a real POW camp would have been like in Germany during WWII.
I thought the whole thing about causing a distraction with a court trial was rediculous.  POW's wouldn't be allowed any such privilege in the first place.  I mean come on, what rights do prisoners anywhere really have from the inside?  Not much.

I didn't because Hollywood's approach to stories with racial themes is usually so politically correct as to insult the viewer's intelligence (which is demonstrated by my buying the DVD, rather than paying $5.00 for the matinee ticket?). This is a well made movie with an excellent cast. The interaction between the German POW Camp staff and the prisoners is excellent - taut and dramatic. The racial bias of the white enlisted men vs. the black Air Force officers is also realistic, and because it is not sanitized, it comes across very well. Good films are ""good"", because they draw the viewer into the story; one becomes a viewer, through the camera, of the plot, and often loses the sense of ""watching a movie"". Older films have less of this characteristic, I think, because stylized camera and acting techniques of that time detract from the viewer becoming totally immersed in watching believeable action. This movie brings the viewer into contact with characters and plot from the outset, and never lets go. Bruce Willis has come a long way from the ""Die Hard"" days, and is more convincing because of his matured talent. The rest of the cast perform very well.

That's OK, because we aren't supposed to be surprised; the point is that Hart is surprised.  What will Hart do with his knowledge? Col. McNamara (Bruce Willis) is a puzzle -- is he a good guy or a bad guy? We are seeing McNamara through Hart's eyes, and Hart, with his inexperience in life and war, cannot understand or comprehend McNamara. Hart misses some things and misreads others because of his own fears and ignorance.  Hart's ""war"" is not just WWII, or his ""war"" in surviving the prison camp or dealing with other prisoners.

It is mainly a story of racial problems in a POW camp. There is also an underlying problem between the German commander and the leader of the POWs (Willis). This problem is never explained. A side story to the film is an escape attempt and a local factory that is making munitions.

I can't say it was a terrible movie, but it lacks any real emotion. You don't feel for the characters, and frankly you don't care whether they live or die.  Bruce Willis doesn't cut it playing a commanding officer, he doesn't have the presence nor the charisma.  The rest of the cast follows suit - decent actor, wrong role.
When the movie delves into race relations (the arrival of the Tuskegee airman to the camp) circa 1940, it becomes very cliche'. The black righteous man vs. the despicable racist white man.  Not denying that this was a wrong that happened in that era, but it is getting very old and predictable the way Hollywood takes every confrontation of the sort to outrageous and dishonest levels.

The movie opens with LT. Hart, a rear echelon support staff soldier being captured in an ambush and being shipped to the hard reality of a prison camp.  This is quite a shock for the young LT.  At the prison camp he meets the Colonel (Bruce Willis) who is the ranking officer and somewhat of an enigma to the LT. throughout the movie.
The young LT. has to prove himself to his new subordinates, his new superiors and to himself.  It is a bit of a ""coming of age"" type of movie if you look close enough.
With turns at every corner this movie keeps you guessing until the very end.  It is full of surprises and the back-drop is stark and gives a great feel for what winter in a prison camp must have been like.  The stark reality of where they are keeps creeping in but is never really fully explored by the director.
This is a good prison camp movie.  Not many bombs and guns for a war movie but it is still a good movie in time.  With a nod toward Stalag 17 and The Great Escape it makes its point.  Duty, honor, sacrifice and racism are themes of this movie.

1206096,3,B00000F2UF,"It is hard to imagine a more contrived story than this WWII POW film.  There are just so many unrealistic plot elements that the story loses all credibility.  Director Gregory Hoblit, (""Frequency"", ""Primal Fear"") has delivered good dramatic films in the past, but this one simply loses its grip on reality.  While the production values are excellent, Hoblit doesn't seem to notice or care that plot and the behavior of his characters range from inconsistent to implausible.
Take Colonel Werner Visser (Marcel Iures).  The workup on him shows him to be evil, intolerant, cruel and autocratic and those are his nicer qualities.  Then suddenly, for no reason we can discern, he develops a soft spot for Lt. Hart (Colin Farrell).  This is a conniving, manipulative, hard hearted creature and just because he went to the same college as Hart, he becomes his avuncular advisor and benefactor.  Let's get real here.
Yes, and I am sure they are going to send a lieutenant assigned to headquarters and privileged to strategic information, who has never been in combat, to shuttle another officer to the front lines so he can get captured and spill his guts to the enemy.  That detail would have been given to a non commissioned officer with no exposure to such intelligence.
The one bright spot in this film is the acting of Colin Farrell.  Farrell combines rugged good looks and excellent dramatic skills to bring this film whatever shred of credibility it has.  He manages to make his character believable, despite the unbelievable nature of everything that is going on around him.  Bruce Willis gets top billing in this film, but doesn't log 20% of the screen time that Farrell commands.  Willis plays the hard shelled West Point officer well, although his switch from heartless malevolence to heroic nobility is just a bit too abrupt to accept.
Everything about this film stretches credulity.  By the end of the film, my eye sockets were sore from all the eye rolling.  I rated it a 5/10.  Despite some good performances and technical elements, this kind of drama needs realism to be effective and in this regard ""Hart's War"" fails spectacularly.",1027728000,11,2141,4.908333333333333

I mean the unsuspecting average Joe goes into a theater to watch a WWII flick and he figures its gonna be about Americans fighting Nazis.

WWII is really about black and white Americans fighting eachother, with the urbane, literate Nazis acting as referees; that is when they're not occupied tossing off the odd urbane remark.

1206101,1,B00000F2UF,"Hart's War isn't unwatchable, but it isn't good either.
Why Bruce Willis is the primary actor listed in the credits speaks more to his declining fame than his role in this film (typically an actor who receives top billing does so for a reduction in salary).
Midway through this WWII potboiler, I expected to hear the theme music from ""Hogan's Heros"" and have the actors visages flash up on the screen. Hogan's Heros was a comedic take on a serious and excellent film: Stalag 17. Hart's War incorporates aspects of Stalag 17 and then adds in parts of To Kill A Mockingbird for good measure. Based on a book, I suppose I'm also critiquing that novel's content as well.
So what's my critique? How could I not like a film (and book) that are so politcally relevant and emotionally draining as a story of white and black prejudice set against an even greater evil of Naziism? Oh, puleese!
I thought I was going to see a fair to good WWII drama, but then I was duped by the filmmakers into a racism drama that typically casts the poor put upon black man in a role that he can do nothing but become a hero as a result of circumstances put upon him. Don't get me wrong - black men have been dealt a poor hand for a long time, but this film doesn't cover new territory and it doesn't tell a story that is unique: it feels stale and overcooked. The black character at the heart of this story could have just as well been cast and written as an American Indian, a Jew, a homosexual, or any other minority group and it would have worked as effectively.
If it seems that I am a bit ticked off - you'd be right. I don't have a problem with the role of prejudice being identified and played on in a film, but it doesn't have to be handled in some a heavy and ham-handed way as Hart's War lays it out.
Our narrator is apparently some sort of saint (but he is also a bit of a coward in that he gives up U.S. secrets for his own safety - a plot point which dies on the vine in lieu of the racist subject matter) because he's the only white man in the entire prison camp who isn't a racist.
The characters in this film are sketches - two dimensional sketches. They are either good or they are bad. No one has multi-layered personalities. The camp bigot is not only a bigot but he is a traitor! The captain is not only a hardcase, but he has ulterior motives that may be bigotry and probably include selling out the camp saint in addition to the black man. The narrator (saint), though he committed treasonous acts, is to be completely forgiven because he is in support of the camp's only black resident. People are not all bad and people are not all good. There are many a murderer out there who are extremely good to their mothers, but who would gun you down without thinking twice.
Surprisingly, the Nazis don't come off as hideously evil as the typical Hollywood film would portray them. The Commandant of the camp is intelligent and suspicious, and even a bit self-serving, but that would be expected in war. The Nazis are actually cast more believable than any of the Americans.
I would love to see Hollywood address racism with more subtly than this. I think it is a point that deserves attention, but I think that we have also moved beyond the point when it has to be shoved down our throats as Hart's War does.
Photograhed beautifully, and yet not unlike Stalag 17 and Hogan's Heros (it's always winter in these prison camp shows - you know Germany is actually quite beautiful in the summer - you'd think that such a contrast might sometime be brought out in these war pictures), Hart's War is sadly a poor rehash of material previously covered in Stalag 17 and To Kill A Mockingbird.",1027296000,,3673,4.363503649635036

Hart had a conflict over the way he surrended to questioning when he was caught and was reliving this over at the Stalig Camp when he is asked to defend a black Lietenent POW, who has been accused of murdering a fellow white officer. This white officer had a hand in getting his friend who was also a black Lietenent POW in trouble with the Germans, which prompted a firing squad.
The movie again has surprises in it and is intelligent. I like the way the Nazi Captain was portrayed. Very different, a melodramatic man, with a kind of thoughtful demeanor. This was really not so much about the Nazi's as it was about how the irony was really appalling, here we are fighting to stop genocide and treating our own fellow Americans as if they were lesser than, in this movie it was the African Americans. It makes a good point, one that I really didn't realize. I had no idea that the blacks were treated as if they were just fill ins, and deserved no respect, even if they were officers. The hypocrisy is just so visible, its a wonder people stayed in denial.
The drawback is the movies ending, it was clever but it didn't let the movie stay true to form. The black officer should have walked away the hero, he didn't have a chance. Hart had an agenda, he wanted to take the slot, because of his internal conflict, mainly guilt. McNamara took it because he was supposed to he was the captain, therefore his que. But the Black Officer whose name I can't remember, should have been the hero, he should have been the one we mourned, let us feel our anger. The movie starts out letting us feel the anger but than as always whoever the star is, in this case Willis, he steps out of the smoke and grit and takes the hero slot. This is frustrating. That is why I did not give this movie as many stars as it could have achieved. Overall, worth viewing!

1206150,1,B00000F2UF,"or is it because Bruce Willis is such a bad actor. Sorry folks, i think the guy is a jerk. His overacting just makes me laugh and i couldn't take this picture seriouly. Also all this violence is histerical,,,,lets see what more can we give the audience to shock them and make them feel uncomfortable. This movie is a piece of trash and belongs in the trash and Bruce Willis only comfirms this.",1026518400,5,393,4.397260273972603
1206151,5,B00000F2UF,"I liked all aspects of this movie but rather than repeat the already excellent reviews in this forum, I would like to point out the outstanding soundtrack with the widest dynamic range of any DVD I have ever experienced. The average volume setting (set by normal speech level) on my home theater system is -37db. On this disk I had to crank it up to -29.5db, a hugh difference. The result was the fighter attack sequence and the blowup of the ammo dump literally rocked us in our seats. Having participated in many naval gunfire and weapons demonstrations I can attest that this is close to the way it would have sounded in real life. Very few movie soundtracks and NO TV soundtracks ever achieve anything like the real thing.",1026518400,2,726,4.592307692307692
1206152,4,B00000F2UF,"Two words are sufficient to explain this movie's 4 star rating: Colin Farrell!  The man is amazingly handsome, and the camera lingers on his face much longer than would seem usual.  He belongs with Christian Kane, Christian Bale, and Ben Affleck as one of the most attractive young actors around. He is also wonderfully talented as an actor.  I bought this DVD after seeing Mr. Farrell steal Minority Report from Tom Cruise, and, although it took a long time to get to the ""meat"" of the story--the trial--it was worth it.  As a viewer who watches JAG for the trial scenes and zones out during the rest, I thoroughly enjoyed watching drafted law student Hart do his best for his innocent client.  Bruce Willis gave his usual fine, understated performance as Colonel McNamara, the ranking officer in the POW camp, but Cole Hauser was a little heavy handed as the bigot of the barracks.  My husband enjoyed this movie very much and was surprised that I enjoyed a movie with not only no love interest but no female presence.  Fans of Hill Street Blues might notice Joe Spano in a small role at the beginning of the movie.  All in all a worthwhile movie.",1026518400,5,1149,4.598039215686274
1206153,4,B00000F2UF,"For the most part, ""Hart's War"" is a gripping and entertaining movie. It switches courses several times, going from a battlefield adventure to a tense story of racism in the military during WWII to a court-martial drama to, finally, a POW escape thriller. The movie successfully navigates these changes until the climax, where it detours into rah rah patriotism by turning one of its villains into a hero. This allows for a feel good ending, but it lessens the impact of the themes it developed earlier.
Lt. Thomas Hart [Colin Farrell] is the son of a US senator. He's assigned to a desk job at the European front, but  winds up instead being captured by the Germans and sent to a POW camp in Belgium. There, Col. William McNamara [Bruce Willis], the vindictive, prejudiced leader of the American prisoners, tells him there is no room in the officers' barracks. Hart is forced to bunk with the enlisted men. Later, he is joined there by two other officers. It's easy to see why they were sent there. They are black. When one of them is accused of murdering a white soldier, McNamara demands a court-martial. Hart, who isn't a lawyer, is told to defend the man. Hart is both terrified and angered by the assignment. What he can not know is that there is a method to McNamara's madness.
Bruce Willis gives his usual excellent performance, but it is Colin Farrell who is most impressive. The young actor seems destined for stardom. Also great is Terrance Howard as the accused.
Despite its faults, I found ""Hart's War' to be the best of several war movies released recently.",1026345600,,1571,4.692028985507246
1206154,5,B00000F2UF,"As Lt. Hart the young Dubliner Colin Farrell steals the show. His talent is matched by his incredible good looks. I thought Bruce Willis was terrific as well and the movie worked for me. My Uncle was a POW in Germany for 3 years in World War II and I was reminded of the honor and courage those men had. I also had the priviledge of meeting two Black men who flew P51 Mustangs during World War II..they served a country that wasn't just in the treatment of them, I hope young people will see this movie and appreciate the sacrifice that these great men made.
