38659,5,0782008119,"Being the hard core grunge fan that I am I absolutley love this video.  It  helped me gain more knowledge of some of my favorite bands.  I've always  been intrested in the seattle music scene and this was just a tool to help  me learn more.

38660,4,0782008119,"This is an incredibly interesting video that documents the growth and succeeding explosion of the grunge movement in Seattle.  I can't believe how many people reviewed this film that missed the point entirely.  Hype!  mostly focuses on the smaller bands that layed the foundations for the  giants like Soundgarden and Nirvana, and how those smaller bands eventually  were overshadowed and/or taken advantage of by the national hype that  followed.  I especially enjoyed the old footage of Hammerbox, Some Velvet  Sidewalk, and the premier performance of ""Smells Like Teen  Spirit"" (where did they get that footage? ) There's also a humerous  shot that has the camera roaming through The Bon Marche looking at  ""grunge"" clothing while Nirvana muzak plays in the background.
Only a few things bothered me about this  film.  The first was Eddie Vedder's ""commentary"" which was  Vedder-esque genius as usual, if you know what I mean.  I have a bad  feeling he was thrown in there just to make this film more marketable,  which is some pretty sad irony.  The second thing that bothered me was the  profanity. Considering the subject matter, it could have been a lot worse,  but it also could have been better.  I don't mind the occasional slip of  the tongue, but hearing the F-bomb twenty times or so in an hour doesn't do  much for my intelligence level, and it doesn't say much about the  intelligence level of the musicians either.  If you think you can stomach  this, Hype! is an educational, interesting, and well-shot documentary that  deserves a watch.",963014400,2,1555,4.9494163424124515

38662,5,0782008119,"I never liked ""grunge"" or ""alt-rock"" , but this film should be required viewing 'cause it is so DAMNED FUNNY!  The whole ""grunge"" fad was funny back in the early 90's but seeing all of  these pretentious twits talk about how cool they are is pure comedy.  Eddie of Pearl Jam  steals the show with his pretentious commentary on the  nature of fame and fads.  This film should be shown to young teens as a  warning against jumping on to silly fads!

38663,5,0782008119,"HYPE! is the most comprehensive documentary on the subject of""the Seattle sound"" that there is. It shows how good a thing is until it is done in excess.

38696,3,0782008119,"THE GOOD:
More than a music doc, this is a relevant, illuminating and moving music film. I knew most of the big north-west bands but I had no idea of the context in which they developed, circumstances and the deeply american nature of the whole thing. Hype! quickly turned into my most replayed doc ever. This film captured a pop-culture explosion from within. As Art Chantry put, ""It's fascinating to be able to see it for yourself""; I was transported to Seattle circa 1988-94. its plot has all the ingredients of a great play: humble beginnings, a great struggle, a moment of ascension, a tragic crash-and-burn, and a bitterly optimistic aftermath.

the bands involved offered amazing insight and were very entertaining to see and hear live. Some of them were low profile, bands that didn't break; some others were de rigueur names offering down-to earth and quirky commentary. I have since acquired albums by FASTBACKS, FLOP and MUDHONEY thanks to this doc.

THE BAD:
no extras. it seems this film went under the radar, judging from the poor digital offering here. The doc is great, this DVD is not. While it's commendable that the publisher digitized and released it, It has absolutely no extra content or bonus material. The yards of unedited footage that must have been left out of this cut makes me froth at the mouth. Take for instance The Year Punk Broke, the bonus features nearly doubled the length of the main film. Hype! deserves this treatment. I give it three stars solely on its digital shortcomings. You might as well watch it on Youtube in the same quality.

Will we ever see a BLURAY release? I doubt it. The quality is there, the cinematography of Hype! is impeccable, it was shot in glorious 16mm. Watch Nirvana's Live at the Paramount in BLURAY and you'd see how incredible Hype! would be in 1080p. But it's probably never going to happen. the 90s was a disaster for future-proofing video. Similarly to the X-Files tv series, Hype! must have been transferred from film rolls to VHS tape for the editing process; BIG MISTAKE. This resulted in miserable and constrained 480i transfers that cannot be restored or improved in any way.

Here's hopping that 2016 sees a properly remastered release of Hype! when it turns 20 years old, with an extended 2 hour director's cut, deleted scenes, and extended interviews. It might not happen but it's sure fun to imagine.",1335139200,3,2381,4.8
38697,5,0782008119,"It came in great shape, and it worked flawlessly so far. I've only watched part of it (well @3 quarters of it) and I've got to say that it's great. One of the nest underground music bios I've ever seen. Period. the music on it. The bands, some big named Seattle bands )don't plan on seeing  the video or hearing ""SMELLS LIKE TEEN SPIRIT"" ..!!!! That's not what it's about. It's about the 'truth' of these bands,where they come from, and why they came at all..",1318636800,,459,4.337209302325581
38698,5,0782008119,"Hype really captured the time well. Seattle was a magical place to live in the late 80's and early 90's. There definitely was a greater creative energy that took over the town although most of the ""Grunge"" thing and the label itself was created by Hollywood. Seattle has always been a city that doesn't pay much attention to what other city's cultures are up to. We live under our own overcast (literally). We've always had a great music scene. It doesn't always jive with what Hollywood is paying attention to. But in the early 90's it did and they came and swept up a few of our more prolific bands. Suddenly the world was wearing flannels and wool hats and Doc Martens, even if they lived in 90 degree weather. Go figure. If you want to know a little more about the scene, this movie is a great place to start and see the life that inspired great bands like Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains. You will see rare early footage of Layne and Kurt. Hopefully, you'll also take the time to check out a few of the other bands featured in the movie, bands that didn't quite experience the same success but made some amazing music nonetheless.

38699,5,0782008119,"Very enjoyable film of the best music scene in the last twenty years - i was 15 or so when i first heard Soundgarden's Badmotorfinger in 1991, a week or so later picked up Nevermind and i was sold. Then it was Mudhoney and after that Alice in Chains, Screaming Trees, Gas Huffer etc. Still listen to those bands all the time and this film reminded me how good so much of that music was and is. A real nostalgia trip for any 30 somethings like myself who were saved from a Thrash Metal dead end by all things Seattle!",1237593600,2,516,4.17
38700,5,0782008119,"This was by far one of the greatest Grunge documentary I have ever seen. If you are a fan of a ton of Seattle bands, or want to learn more this is the product for you! I loved it, recommend it to anyone. Enjoy.",1207699200,,210,3.7954545454545454

38702,5,0782008119,"What a great surprise. . . When you think you've heard, watched, read, or seen everything having to do with the greatest art form ever, grunge, something like Hype! comes along.  And it's like discovering Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Soundgarden, Alice In Chains, Temple of the Dog, Mad Season, Screaming Trees, Mudhoney, or L7, all over again.

And the Seattle scene is captured perfectly.",1196294400,,381,5.031746031746032
38703,4,0782008119,"Hype! is one of those documentaries that is actually true to the genre by researching the topic at its source.  That research is in the interviews with bands and others in the industry that were truly at the heart of the scene and not just the big names.  This documentary gives even the most self-proposed diehard ""grunge fan"" a deeper look into how everything really took place, behind the huge promotional blitz from major labels.  There are some interesting live performances in here and the interviews are simply full of quality responses.  I only gave this four stars for two reasons.  One, I don't think the casual fan of the scene or even some diehard fans would really enjoy the roots of the scene and some of the performances on the disc that evolved from those roots.  This isn't just a Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, and Pearl Jam festival, there are some wildly different styles displayed on this disc, which is part of the reason why this documentary truly represents the scene.  Two, though I said that they went the right direction by steering clear of some of the more obvious acts, I think it still might have been nice to hear from people like Jerry Cantrell or Layne Staley (RIP) of Alice in Chains or Dave Grohl of Nirvana or any of the other members of the ""Big 4"" as they were eventually nicknamed.  Some of the responses that Kim Thayil and Eddie Vedder came out with were very interesting.

If you want to know more about the Seattle scene then this is the place to learn.  It really does debunk some silly myths and there are quite a few hilarious moments such as the Grunge Lexicon.  Timeless.",1194739200,2,1628,4.5793103448275865
38724,5,0782008119,This movie is great. Represents the Seattle scene well and has a plethora of awesome bands. Interviews are interesting and live performances are ones to wish for.

38725,4,0782008119,"I was *very* impressed with this film. I had already seen Doug Pray's ""Scratch"" documentary, and felt the need to work my way back from there. I spent the latter part of my adolescense and most of college in the midst of the grunge ""revolution,"" wholly unaware of its true musical origins in the pacific northwest (I'm speaking of the original bands themselves, not demographically). My only complaint with this film is that it wasn't long enough, and Doug definitely seemed to side with those who felt the ""scene"" had been compromised...but it seems to me that the owners of Sub Pop are the ones who made that determination. The majors just capitalized on their decision to ""go commercial"" -",1187136000,,692,4.775

Being a huge fan of heavy music and rock over the past 20+ years, this movie opened my eyes to a whole new scene like nothing ever had before. Of course I had been a fan of Nirvana, AIC and Soundgarden in the early to mid 90's, but this film exposes you to the origins of all that. With a little independant research, you can then find all sorts of gems of bands and albums you might truly enjoy. Mudhoney, The Supersuckers and The Murder City Devils are three of my favorite bands and I first sought them out as a direct result of watching ""Hype"" and then doing my own investigating from there. It won't steer you wrong. What's up with the new cover though? Used to be black and white stage diving scene with red letters.",1150588800,7,848,4.2024539877300615

I love the film because it had heart and it had an insight on its own implosion. I happen to like a lot of the bands that were on this tape(I am from NY BTW)The Posies needed to be grouped in there because they played with (and are friends with) Nirvana, which brings me to my next comment...If you don't like the sound--""FINE""-but when you are happy because someone is dead,you are a messed up person. If you like the Hollies,good for you. I like their stuff as well,but to wish death upon someone because you think the movie ""sucks"" is absolute rubbish.

It came as a shock to me that this film was largely unheard of, and very upsetting when I tried to get my hands on a copy for myself but could not find one.  Therefore I am very pleased that Lionsgate decided to take on HYPE and release it in DVD format.  This movie opened my eyes to the wonders of the Seattle ""scene"" and the grunge music that I had previously ignored.  The film even inspired me to travle to Seattle and explore it myself!  You do not need to be a fan of NIRVANA or Soundgarden to enjoy this film as it deals with many other grunge acts besides the popular ones, and it is more of an exploration into the societal aspects of this large cultural movement than a direct focus on certain bands.  Enough said, I highly reccommend this movie to anyone interested in musical history.  HYPE is a crowning achievement in my books!",1104796800,7,972,4.337016574585635

Personally, this period of time had a great influence on me, even though I still listened to Black Sabbath and other REAL rock / music bands from the 70's.  Singles was also another movie that had an effect on me like this one and to this day, when I watch Singles, I sorta get that ""feeling"", and when you got a movie that does that to you, you got something!!

A lot of the people interviewed were humorous, others very serious, but either way it was a really candid interview.

It gives insight to the origin of grunge around 1984 or 1985 with bandslike Green River and the U-Men, to the fomration of its core bands like Soundgraden and Alice In Chains, the grunge explosion of the early 90s, and its demise with the death of Kurt Cobain and the fall of other great Seattle bands.

But I came to relize that the talking was actually rather informative... although for someone like me, it was nothing really new.... and was found very much appreciated. They, despite the odds, chronicaled every major and/or trivial event they'd happened in the ""grunge"" and ""sub pop-early-alternative"" scene.  They -meaning those who are musicians who play in clubs there (& throughout the film), had to do with the making/process of the music, were a fan, or (just) lived there- looked at it all with some disdain or humor... but at the same time treating the music with respect.  Admiting that it was just a scene... & not all that different place from many other ""scene"" places... that it was once a completely normal place, aside from all the suicidal action, (BUT SPECIAL)and that it was cool and yet mediocre that it got all that attention.

The interviews are great especially the one with the two colorful Sub pop founders : Jonthan Poneman and Bruce Pavitt, and the ones with the bands are especially funny, except for the interview with Eddie Veder(he's from San Diego: no sense of humour!).  This tape doesn't limit itself to explaining the grunge scene and sound, it talks about the tragedies of sucess, and the media's negative impact on the scene by mass marketing it.  You'll watch this one over and over again, see some great concert footage, hear about the tragedy surrounding Kurt Cobain and deceased Mother Love Bone singer Andy Wood.

But, what HYPE! does is suck you in with the music and the personalities and proceeds to show you how the Seattle music ""scene"" was expolited by corporate America and eventually destroyed.
Most of the bands you see in HYPE! are exciting, energetic, talented musicians both on record and stage, but the travesty of the situation is that no one knows who they are until now.  In that aspect HYPE! is a great showcase of all the talent of Seattle musicians, not just a document of Kurt Cobain and the triumph of Grunge in the mainstream.
The most interesting aspect of HYPE! is its depiction of SubPop records and how they instigated the hype that ultimately lead to the over-commercialization and downfall of grunge -- whether it was done out of calculated marketing or misguided satire, the result is evident.
HYPE! is a testament to the great people involved in the Seattle music community, whether they be musicians, producers, artists, or just acquaintances.

brought to life with a British story line and for better or worse the

This film Hype lays it all out.  And, the music industry still
hasn't got the message. Frank Zappa said the same thing.
Main stream rock music in 2017 is causing
mental illness by way of sick repetitive/slick productions, sub harmonic beats,
female and male singers that are all the same sounding, drum machine and hand clap sounds,
that basically market looks and body images and cliche semi ghetto lyrics and
lifestyles. Its exactly like the British producer says in the film, frak the gear, the looks,
the spread chiseling marketing of the hedge fund recording industry
just bash it out with guitars, bass and drums, scream the angst of your times.

7789928,5,0782008119,"Best movie of the years in Seattle where the World learned of the Seattle Sound and other such nonsense!! Lemme tell you kids: there was and will never be anything like it again !!! Seattle was chugging along very nicely BEFORE Life Magazine and RollingStoned decided to ""find"" Seattle!! Well, the freakin' ruined it !!! There were hippy hillwilliams bouncin' off every Greyhound for a few years...""do you know where Nirvana lives??"" grunge,grungin,grungy,grungopolis-tastic!! There was a grunge-only video-tv show hosted by a guy w/new longhair named ""BillBored"" and Nordstroms had ""pre-distressed"" jeans for $599. (and i DON'T mean five dollars !)anyway this movie cuts through the cheese like a hot little knife into yer crooked wanna-be BlakHeart!! You won't know the names of these bands but you will want to !! This is a reminder to all of those too slow to recognise that they missed out on the best rockrebellion this Culture has had since PUNK!! and the last gasp, too!! RandR is good and gone . the only bands left are the one formed in the 70's and the STONES !!! that's it kids!! oh, well...watch the movie and spend the rest of your empty lives looking for this pile of vinyl !! Play it LOUD and PLAY it PROUD !!!",1492473600,2,1226,4.76056338028169
