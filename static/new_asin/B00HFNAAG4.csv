8632482,5,B00HFNAAG4,"Classics....nine of them in one package for $38.99 was something I could not pass up. I'd seen the majority of them at least once and now I can watch them again on Blu Ray in High-Definition. Now I just have to find the time to watch them....and share them with family and friends. How can you go wrong with DeNiro, Stallone, Costner, Hoffman, Poitier, Cage and Cruise? You can't and that's why this collection just makes cinematic sense.",1399420800,,438,4.628205128205129
8632483,4,B00HFNAAG4,"I wanted to post this review to help out those who may be interested in buying this set if or when it goes back on sale again. I was a bit apprehensive about buying this set especially considering how surprisingly little information has been shared about it. Thankfully, this set turned out to be not that bad of a blind buy. I didn't own any of the films featured in this set (except for ""Rocky"") on Blu-Ray, so this set really helped to fill my Blu-Ray collection.

Granted, in a perfect world this set would feature a more wider and diverse selection of MGM titles from the Golden Age of film rather than just those films acquired by 20th Century Fox from the past five or so decades.

I was hoping that the set would come in a digibook style case similar to the ones used in the ""Universal 100th Anniversary Collection"" or the ""Best of Warner Bros 50 Film Collection"" but unfortunately the discs are just set in a big and bulky Amaray style case with 2 discs per divider.

With regards to the Special Content and Features, here's a rundown of what the discs contain based on ithe single release information on Blu-Ray.com.  The discs are set in the following order:

""Thelma & Louise"" (1991) - Same disc as the ""20th Anniversary"" (2011) version with the same extras.
""Leaving Las Vegas"" (1995) - Same disc as the current version (2011).  No extras aside from the trailer.
""Raging Bull"" (1980) - Same disc as the 2009 version (not the recent ""30th Anniversary"" Edition). Same extras as 2009 version.
""Midnight Cowboy"" (1969) - Same disc as the current version (2011) with the same extras.
""In The Heat of The Night"" (1967) - Same disc as the current version (2014) with the same extras.
""Rain Man"" (1988) - Same disc as the current version (2011) with the same extras.
""Dead Man Walking"" (1995)  - Same disc as the current version (2011) with no extras except for commentary and trailer.
""Dances With Wolves"" (1990) - 20th Anniversary Ed. (2011) but does not include 2nd Extras Disc. Extended Ver. only.
""Rocky"" (1976) - Same as disc contained in the ""Rocky: The Undisputed Collection"" (2009) with the same extras. Artwork is different from disc in that set.

According to Blu.ray.com, you only save about $20 buying this set than from buying the individual discs themselves so, it is up to one's discretion whether or not it is worth buying this set as opposed to getting the single release discs themselves.  The fact that ""Dances With Wolves"" is missing the extras disc may be a turnoff for some but I don't really miss it.

Hope this review helps.",1393891200,20,2554,4.618101545253863
8632484,5,B00HFNAAG4,"Got my copy today at a great price. Since I couldn't give the collection 4.6 stars, I rounded up to 5 stars.  Set includes 9 discs.  Here's what's included and my ratings:

* Raging Bull--4.5
* Leaving Las Vegas--5
* In the Heat of The Night--5

* Dead Man Walking--4
* Dances With Wolves--5

8632485,3,B00HFNAAG4,I hate how you can only buy the extended edition out now. I really want the 3 hour Theatrical version of Dances With Wolves on Blu Ray. Anyone know if this is it??,1393372800,2,163,3.9696969696969697
8632486,2,B00HFNAAG4,"Interesting compilation that contains not a single movie produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Since the studio no longer exists (except in name only) this package contains movies made by United Artists and Orion, and some other non-Metro studios. Since this is celebrating ""90 years of MGM"" it should include titles like BEN-HUR, GIGI, HOW THE WEST WAS WON, AN AMERICAN IN PARIS, MRS. MINIVER, GONE WITH THE WIND, MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY, GRAND HOTEL - Those are movies that MGM won Oscars for best picture - and they are all owned by Warner Bros. now, and obviously could not be included in this collection.  Most people don't care and that's fine; it's just sad that this great studio is no more, and they are being represented by movies that they had nothing to do with.  Two stars for the misrepresentation.",1393113600,223,804,4.818840579710145
