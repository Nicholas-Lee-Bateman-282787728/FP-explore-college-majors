5278307,4,B0099115AU,I saw this film at the cinema when I was a teenager. I have been trying to get a dvd copy for a long time so it was nice to be able to see it again. A little over long at times but it is always good to see Robert Mitchum in action.,1356048000,,231,3.3773584905660377
5278308,2,B0099115AU,"""Wrath of God"" is a 1972 color western that some people believe is a comedy, others a parody, and still others think is action adventure. The film stars Robert Mitchum with Frank Langella and Rita Hayworth.

Robert Mitchum (1917-97) received his only Oscar nomination for ""The Story of GI Joe"" (1945), but movie fans know that Mitchum was a terrific actor who deserved far more acknowledgement, but his ""bad boy"" persona undoubtedly interfered. Mitchum's work in films like ""The Night of the Hunter"" (1955) and ""Cape Fear"" (1962) is ranked by AFI as among the top 100 villains of all time. In this film, he plays an adventurer dressed as a priest who carries a machine gun.

Frank Langella made his initial splash in 1970 by winning 2 awards from the National Board of Review for performances in ""The 12 Chairs"" and in ""Diary of a Mad Housewife"".  He took a detour playing ""Dracula"" (1979) and then spent considerable time on the stage (where he won 2 Tonys). My personal favorite is Skeletor in ""Masters of the Universe"" (1987), but many people think his portrayal of Nixon in ""Frost/Nixon"" (2008) was his best work - indeed he was nominated for an Oscar, but lost to Sean Penn (""Milk""). In this one he plays a villain, although he is so young it's hard to take him seriously.

Beautiful and sexy Rita Hayworth (1918-87) appeared in more than 60 films. At first she stressed her Latin background and her skills as a dancer. After several forgettable films she made her mark in Howard Hawks' ""Only Angels Have Wings"" (1939) and then went on to more acclaim in ""The Strawberry Blonde"" (1941) with Jimmy Cagney and ""Blood and Sand"" (1941) with Tyrone Power.  She was a major cover girl in WW2 and is best remembered for her role as ""Sadie Thompson"" (1953). This was Hayworth's final film as she was in the early stages of Alzheimer's. She plays Langella's mother.

Note: Langella and Hayworth do not show up until nearly an hour into the film.

Fans of ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969) will recognize Jorge Russek (he plays Cordona in this film and Mapache's chief aide in TWB)) and Chano Urueta (he plays a villager in this film, and the wise old villager in TWB).

Victor Buono (1938-82) was that rare breed of actor who could play comedy (""Robin and the 7 Hoods"") as well as horror (""Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte""). He was nominated for an Oscar and a Golden Globe for ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" (1962).

Director Ralph Nelson (1916-87) is best known for his Oscar nominated ""Lilies of the Field"" (1963) although I prefer his work in ""Charly"" (1968) and ""Requiem for a Heavyweight"" (1962). In this film he seems confused.

There have been more than 100 ""comedy westerns"". Here's a list of some of the best: Mel Brooks' hilarious ""Blazing Saddles"" (1974), Lee Marvin's Oscar winning ""Cat Ballou"" (1965), Billy Crystal in ""City Slickers"" (1991), Bob Hope's ""Son of Paleface"" (1952), Jimmy Stewart's ""Destry Rides Again"" (1939), Gene Wilder as ""The Frisco Kid"" (1979), the Marx Brothers' ""Go West"" (1940), W.C. Fields and Mae West in ""My Little Chickadee"" (1940), Don Knotts as ""The Shakiest Gun in the West"" (1968), Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood in ""Paint Your Wagon"" (1969), and James Garner's ""Support Your Local Sheriff"" (1969).

This one is not on the top 10 list, and probably doesn't make the top 100 list. As a comedy there just aren't enough laughs. As a parody, the material is just not sharp enough. As action adventure, there is a paucity of both.",1352678400,4,3452,4.717607973421927
5278309,4,B0099115AU,"I thought this film was a real blast to watch. Mitchum is great as always. I saw this on cable a few years back, but until now haven't been able to track it down on dvd, so I'm excited to see it's finally available. The other review posted on here has more info on this strange and fun film.",1350604800,,291,3.9491525423728815
5278310,4,B0099115AU,"Saw this at the drive-in when it first came out and remembered it as being a somewhat sub-standard Western, kind of a Spaghetti Western/Sam Peckinpah wannabe, and though that may be true, THE WRATH OF GOD does have a few slight merits of it's own.

First is Robert Mitchum's performance as the sleepy-eyed priest who mows 'em down Django-fashion with a hidden machine gun. He scoffs the Lord, swears, drinks whiskey, smokes cigars and kills. Back then, I thought it just a ruse, now, I'm not too sure. Is he taking this ""Fatherhood"" seriously, or is it all just part of the scam? Certainly one of Mitchum's best roles, though not nearly as great as his other heavenly outing in NIGHT OF THE HUNTER. Still, food for thought.

Secondly, Victor Buono finally gets to play a somewhat good-guy, or at least be on Mitchum's side. He's a likable lout in the George Sanders fashion, a con man who is always looking out for himself, yet leads a courageous attack on the enemy stronghold, driving a battering-ram car while machine-gunning the fodder that stands in his way. He actually has voice-over thoughts to justify his actions.

And thirdly, we get some social comment throughout the film on third-world oppression. Executions are abundant and viewed with disgust. The masses are left with no meaning to life..., that is until Mitchum rebuilds the church and gives strength, support and dignity to the downtrodden, then defends it all with a machine gun.

Strange, weird.

Rita Hayworth is wasted as the mother of Frank Langella, who likes to kill priests. Also lots of familiar Peckinpah faces here, Aurora Clavel, Jorge Russek and even that old man with the white beard that appeared in THE WILD BUNCH and was mowed down by Gig Young and Robert Webber in BRING ME THE HEAD OF ALFREDO GARCIA is on board.

And nudity...two scenes bare-assed, but not of a woman. Co-star Ken Hutchinson, who gives a pretty good performance in yet another complex role as a lout who re-thinks his situation (this movie is full of 'em) does the nude scenes. No nude women? Like I said...

Strange, weird.

All in all, certainly not as bad as I had remembered it to be, actually quite good and really quite entertaining. And the wide screen dvd from Warner bros. offers a nice transfer, great color & sound. So if you need to fill in that gap between Spaghetti Westerns and American Westerns influenced by Spaghetti Westerns (EL CONDOR, BARQUERO, etc.) then this is certainly a must have for your collection. The perfect example of a movie taken for granted when first released.

Also, Lalo Schifrin's offbeat soundtrack is currently available at the SCREEN ARCHIVES website.",1350518400,12,2651,4.808791208791209

5278404,1,B0099115AU,I saw this film on TV in the 1970's and was very impressed as it follows the book very closely. I would like to see it again but I'm not going to buy a new DVD player just to play this on. Why is there no UK compatible version?

5278409,5,B0099115AU,I have been waiting forever for this title.  The presentation did not disappoint and Robert Mitchum is wonderful in this action/adventure tale.  The Wrath of God is all kinds of pulp.  The kind Quentin Tarantino revers as all other fans of this genre.  Victor Buono adds to all the fun.  Wonderful twists and turns with witty dialogue.  A great representation of the kind of cool the directors of the 70's could entertain us with.,1358726400,,430,4.743243243243243

8537893,5,B0099115AU,"I saw this movie at the theater in the seventies and hoped that one day it would be available on DVD. Mitchum is terrific as the gun toting ""preacher"" Frank Langella is his usual smarmy self. Not listed in the Amazon cast list is Rita Hayworth. This may have been one of her last movie roles and it was sad seeing her in the condition that she was in.",1422576000,,351,4.101449275362318
8537894,3,B0099115AU,"What starts off as a promising flick, turns in the end, to be an insipidly idiotic premise.  Three guys bring down a bunch of outlaws that can't be brought down by an army?  Okay.  Still, take a look at it for its nice set locations.",1417824000,,233,4.133333333333334
