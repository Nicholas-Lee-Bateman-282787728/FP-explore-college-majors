8052115,1,B0007UZMSS,"This dvd stole the playbook from reefer madness and is full of wrong information. Shame on everyone who had anything to do with this evil film. Marijuana is a gift from god and should be enjoyed by all!  There are so many better marijuana docs out there, so smoke a fatty and watch one of them instead of this disc of lies.",1379808000,,323,4.209677419354839
8052116,5,B0007UZMSS,I'm an addictions counselor and have been looking for something to show my family's that is updated.  It's very accurate and am getting good feedback from the family's that have watched this.,1314489600,2,191,4.96875
8052117,4,B0007UZMSS,"Overall a good DVD. Still has some misconceptions of marijuana use however, finding one without trying to ""scare"" users from using is almost impossible to find. Good information with very little political slant.",1167782400,2,211,5.424242424242424
8052118,5,B0007UZMSS,"I get so tired of seeing these people leave there proraganda on every thing drug related on Amazon. This video does an excellent job of presenting very truthful and factual information about mariluana. It makes no moral judgement about weather marijuana should be legalized or not, it just presnets the facts about what it can do to your body and mind. Don't buy into the pro-drug hype these druggies are pushing. Buy a professional and well researched video like this one and learn the real truth.",1118016000,9,498,4.8023255813953485
8052119,2,B0007UZMSS,"This poorly researched propoganda campaign is laughable at most!

The extremley illinformed commentary makes it all worthwhile.

I recommend you light up a few spliffs before watching to enhance the comedic experience.",1117756800,4,218,5.78125
