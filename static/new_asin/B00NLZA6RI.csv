8679087,3,B00NLZA6RI,"got hooked on Lorena and Elizabeth years ago with 'Doctor Of Doom' way back in the WERID WORLDS segment of KHJ channel 9 in Los Angeles in the sixties! Sure the stunt doubles for the stars didn't come close to matching. I wanted to see more of ""Sonja and The Golden Ruby"" any way. Because I'm from that era i enjoy the fashion, cosmetics, and stereotypical plots. I am surprised and pleased to see the real luchadoras in heels and dresses fighting the gangsters. No English subtitles, but it wad easy to follow the plot. The  video quality was good, like reception in the old days.",1438646400,3,581,4.481132075471698
