796001,5,6304156154,"I just caught this recently for the first time on tv I saw the dubbed english version and was still completely awe struck.  If anyone is looking for a good place to start with Hong Kong style film making this is a great one.  It has excellent production values and a great story, making it more western than some Asian cinematic efforts. My wife actually watched it and loved it as well the choreography of the fight scenes is above average as is the cinematography and once you understand the story you will be sucked into its layers immediately. I cannot recommend this title more highly.  For those of us waiting for the new Chow Yun Fat movie this should help bide the time.",975283200,2,678,4.451612903225806
796002,5,6304156154,"This is one of the movie that afterward, you yearn for more because it's that good. Brigitte Lin is one of my favorite actress. She was perfect in this movie. For those who haven't seen this movie, you guys are missing out on a great movie. Hollywood don't make this kind of stuff. The cinematography is awesome!!",969667200,,313,4.508771929824562
796003,5,6304156154,"I'd never been a fan of Hong Kong cinema prior to seeing this magnificent film.  Truly there's almost nothing else like it, certainly nothing  Hollywood produces has this film's sense of style, wit, visual beauty and  energy.  A haunting score (for those who asked, I believe the music is from  Kitaro's ""Silk Road"" -- if it's not, the Silk Road CDs will give  you the same feeling as this movie's wonderful score) adds to the ethereal  atmosphere.  Surprisingly, the acting is excellent (avoid the dreadful  dubbing and stay with the subtitled version) -- Brigitte Lin has a  compelling screen presence (and is one of the most striking women I've seen  in film), and Leslie Cheung (check out ""Farewell My Concubine"")  is her match.  Francis Ng as the cult leader is simply awesome.  Besides  its visual beauty, the plot is filled with surprises (and admittedly, some  of the plot makes little sense).  The action is frequent and stupifying,  but it isn't traditional martial arts; this is NOT a martial arts movie by  any stretch of the imagination.  If you're willing to keep an open mind,  and are always on the lookout for great new titles, take a look at this  one.",966124800,31,1170,4.745
796004,4,6304156154,"I read this movie was the best sword play movie around and had a great plot,cinematography,and acting. It was true for the most part except for the fight scenes(they were very blury and extremley altered).But this was a  very creative movie with a good plot and interesting characters,I must also  say that the cinematography is some of the best around and was attractive  enough to keep my attention. To quikly summarize this,it's a more hollywood  than hon-kong filmed movie that would have been excellent if someone could  do the fights better,if you want to see intense swordplay I highly  reccomend Fire Dragon(aka Fiery Dragon Kid)",958176000,,637,5.019047619047619
796005,4,6304156154,"'The Bride With White Hair' blows most other 'sword-play period movies' out of the water. It's a non-stop visual feast, the fight scenes are amazing, and the characters are emotionally involved with each other and  their surroundings. And, near as I can tell, the acting *was* top-notch...  but that's a bit hard to tell as I think some of it has been leeched away  by weak performances on the part of some of the voice actors. (Particularly  annoying were the scenes where the doomed lovers first meet...)
'The  Bride With White Hair' thankfully trancends the weak dubbing effort. It  only hampered my enjoyment to the point where I took a single star off.
I highly recommend this film... but do yourself a favour and get the  subtitled version. And whatever you do, make sure it's 'letterboxed.' You  don't want to miss any of the exciting visual presentation of this  masterpiece!",954720000,2,883,4.833333333333333
796006,5,6304156154,"To begin with, I feel so blessed to have ever seen such a Film. Thanks so much to the cast and directors that were chosen to bring alive such a breathtaking film. I would like to acknowledge that Brigitte Lin Ching  Hsia's( the white-haired bride) performance in TBWWH  filled me with  adoration and inspiration. Nothing can compare with her divine beauty and  grace.  Leslie Cheung(Cho Yi Hang) was also very impressive. He also  contributed greatly on this films success, in my view.  In this legendary  story, Brigitte Lin and Leslie Cheung are warriors from opposing clans, but  become so ever deeply in love with eachother that they have to comfront  their pasts and decide if they will truly devote to eachothers lives and  abandon their families and soils for good. Filled with non-stop action and  drama, this film should not be overlooked.  Also, I believe that such a  film cannot be viewed superficially because TBWWH contains many  sophisticated views on the subject, Emotion,  and if viewed in such a  single-minded way, would ruin the intention for every person who views it.  It is also necessary to view it several times before you give an inference.  Truthfully, I believe that this movie was intended for a certain audience  and you're either going to truly love this movie for its meaning, or you  will only appreciate it for it's amazing visual content. Regardless, I  would recommend it to anybody who is into fantasy, emotion-filled, doom and  gloom movies.
Finally, I have to say that The Bride with White Hair was  that one legendary  film that truly embezzled my heart..
  I must thank  Ronny Yu /Tai Seng productions and I hope that they will continue to flower  such captivating films like THE BRIDE WITH WHITE HAIR in the many years to  come.",951436800,7,1770,4.822742474916388

Both Mr. Cheung and Ms. Lin played their parts  well (the sacrifices they had to make in the movie...how tragic) and even  though part I leaves you hanging (you should watch the sequel), it's a good  movie nevertheless.  Viewers (like me) do miss Ms. Lin's presence in the  movie world.  Maybe she could come out of unofficial retirement and make  more movies.",945043200,,539,4.720430107526882

796095,4,6304156154,"The Bride With White Hair is a curious beast. Much of the first half of the film feels like you've seen it a hundred times before (a troubled sifu/student relationship, divided loyalties, warring clans and the rise of what would become a united China) and the style often looks like a relatively low-budget film trying to look more expensive than it is rather than the genuinely expensive film it was, with director Ronny Yu shooting much of the film in near darkness with deep blacks, heavy blue filters and smokey backlighting, stylistic devices that aren't to everyone's visual taste. The action scenes are often played out via jerky step-printing (where the film is shot at around 12 frames per second or less but each frame is printed twice or more to create a sense of motion at normal speed that's either heightened or degraded depending on your point of view). While the film was shot on massive sets (genuine exteriors are few and far between), they're neither lit or shot to stress their scale or often to be particularly visually interesting, with much of the early action of the film very deliberately styled after a shadow-puppet play, all profiles and silhouettes. And yet gradually it casts its spell over you and begins to grip as the story becomes more ambitious and intriguing.

On the surface it's a Romeo and Juliet story between Leslie Cheung's heir apparent to a clan dedicated to good but filled with doubt no-one else shares about the severity with which it is enforced and Brigitte Lin's ""wolf-girl"" (meaning she was raised by wolves rather than turns into one) who has been trained as a supernatural killing machine by an evil pagan cult and who sports a particularly lethal whip that Indiana Jones would kill for - sharper than a meat cleaver and very handy for slicing-and-dicing any number of opponents. Their inevitably doomed romance occupies a moral middle ground that, naturally, neither side will tolerate, with their respective rejected mentors eager to reclaim their undivided loyalty. In many ways the film is a rejection of all the intransigent moral codes of the fantasy swordplay genre, where even the ""good"" clan and their allies are so blinded by their own self-importance that they have no qualms about killing innocent peasants just to be on the safe side in case they're lying (""Better to kill a hundred innocents than let one guilty escape""). And just to add to the complexity, the film offers a truly unique villain - a pair of male/female Siamese twins, the sister often goading her brother over his inability to understand the woman he loves. The finale is certainly unusually ambitious, and can be seen either as a fantasy battle or as a physical realization of the hero's nervous breakdown: either way, it offers a welcome level of emotional weight to what could easily have been clichd fare. It's a film that has a lot working against it, but it lingers in the memory long after it's over.",1198800000,4,2941,4.8353174603174605
796096,5,6304156154,"What a great movie. Ive seen it more than once and it got better each time. The way it is shot is pretty old school but the story and acting or top notch! there is not a lot of fighting action but the love felt between the two main characters really keeps things interesting. the ending of the movie is sad but the reason why the swordsman stays on the mountain ledge is very romantic!

796097,1,6304156154,"The movie is widely considered a classic for Hong Kong action movies.  Leslie Cheung is a fantastic actor, and I enjoyed Bridgitte Lin very much in Chungking Express.  So, even though I don't normally enjoy action movies and certainly not kung fu movies, I still decided to watch this movie.  I was extremely disappointed.  The cinematography is boring and poorly done.  The plot is juvenile.  It is the type of movie that would appeal to teenage boys.  I hated the movie.  However, I fully understand that many, many people love the movie and that it is one of the most important HK movies ever made.",1163030400,7,601,4.6571428571428575
796098,4,6304156154,"The story is a little different from your standard kung fu films.  The minimally erotic content was kind of a nice change too, as you don't see that in most kung fu films.  My only complaint about the film is that some of the battle sequences, they reduced the frame rate, which lessens the intensity of the combat.

(Brigitte) Lin Ching Hsia is a great action actress as usual.  If you like her films, you won't be disappointed.",1150675200,,429,4.461538461538462
796099,4,6304156154,"Finally, I get my first chance to see this Brigitte Lin that so many martial arts film fans keep talking about.  She's beautiful, delicate, and absolutely deadly as Lien, a mysterious assassin raised by wolves and later trained in martial arts.  With or without the white hair, she is all but untouchable in battle.  The only real problem is that she is on the wrong side of the fight, serving as an elite assassin for an evil cult led by a, uh, unique brother-sister pairing that attacks the Eight Clans.  Cho Yi-Hang (Leslie Cheung) is the designated successor to the current master of the Wu Tang clan, which makes him the de facto future leader of the united Eight Clans.  He doesn't really cherish that role, though; in fact, he doesn't even see a real reason to fight until such time as the cult has actually acted against the Eight Clans in some way.  When the battle is finally joined, Cho dishonors his master and his kinsmen by taking off with the enemy's elite assassin.  He thinks the two of them can start a new life for themselves elsewhere, leave the fighting and the dying to others, and basically escape their obviously precarious situation - but there are always repercussions to such bold actions as this.  This is especially true when you fail to honor a promise you made with utmost earnestness.

There is less fighting action than you might expect - but it's always a treat when Lien shows up.  She literally makes mincemeat out of her enemies with nothing more than a strong rope; I mean, this girl is just wicked fast, and she would just as soon snap your head off as look at you - although, it must be said that Cho does manage to see more of her than any other man ever lived to tell about.  Obviously, there is a romantic element to the story; it's a sort of Romeo and Juliet star-crossed lovers theme, except the Montagues and Capulets never went so far as to go around beheading each other.  The romantic dimension is actually rather subtle, and any viewers who miss the full impact of the revelations toward the end may well wonder how this could be considered much of a love story at all.

Director Ronny Yu's The Bride With White Hair is a beautiful film, but I must admit that I felt it lacked a certain vitality; the picture always seem to be somewhat cloudy in some indistinct kind of way, making the print look older than it is (the film was released in 1993).  Still, perhaps the real beauty of the film is its ability to succeed on multiple levels.  Naturally, there's the obvious martial arts and romantic themes, but this movie also offers up an intriguing study of good and evil and, in particular, one's personal responsibility toward others on both sides of the conflict.",1135728000,4,2714,4.544147843942505
796100,5,6304156154,Anyone and everyone in America has grown up on the fairtales of Europe. This is one the best movies out there about a classic chinese tale of swords and sorcery of horror and love. As the title suggest. I can't really find the words to explain it but this movies rates up there with Fong Sai Yuk 1 and 2. Its that good.,1125878400,4,319,4.079365079365079
796101,4,6304156154,"Brigette Lin was one of the biggest female stars in Hong Kong and Taiwan in the '80s and '90s, and she's also very versatile, having done many romantic role and spectacular period action films like Bride, The Legion of Tsu Mountain, Ashes of Time, The New Dragon Inn, and her career-revival movie The East Is Red. This is not her best action role, but it's certainly one of the most visually satisfying ones. The fight scenes, art direction, and cinematography is an absolute eye-candy. And of course, there is her wardrobe, which was outlandishly elaborate and the ""wedding costume"" was the reported to be the most expensive ever made in HK films. This is the kind of film that North American audiences should check out if they thought Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and Hero were good.

Bridgett played a powerful assassin nick named Wolf Girl. She was adopted by the powerful evil conjointed twins(Elian Lui and Francis Ng) during a battle when she was a little girl. They trained her to become their most lethal sidekick to fight against the good side. Bridgett Met Leslie Cheung without knowing each other are vivals, and gradually fell in love. He's the top trainee at the House of Wu Don Mountain. Their relationship soon provoke both sides disapproval, because Good and Evil cannot be together. When one of Leslie's female fellow trainee got killed by the evil party, he was obligated to revenge. The misunderstanding of Bridget from Leslie and Wu Don Mountain caused her to go insane, and her hair turned white as she started to lose control of herself......

Even though both Bridget Lin and Leslie Cheung are not ""professional"" action stars like jet Li and Donnie Yu(Hero, Iron Monkey), they execel in this movie, since the action style is not realistic, but fantasy style. Bridget Lin is very stunning especially when her character had gone mad and transformed into white hair woman. She's not evil at all, it's just that she was with the evil side and condemned by the Good Side. The evil conjointed twins are very kinky, bizzare, wicked, and even funny. The sister(older) has different interest and desires than her brother, who secretly loved Bridget, and forced her to marrying him. His sister was like,"" Oh, my little brother, didn't you know that there is no happiness if you force her to marry you?!"" He got very mad when she said that.

The Bride With Whit Hair 2 is not as good as this one. If you want to see Brigett Lin's best action role, check out The East Is Red(she played the most powerful transsexual villian in love with Jet Li). The special effects and fight scenes were over the top along with great performances and theme song.",1113955200,,2661,4.755411255411255
796102,5,6304156154,"Ronny Yu chose the perfect characters to play the lovers! Brigitte Lin looks absolutely beautiful in every angle in every scene. This movie will not be good for those who are expecting to see a great deal of martial arts. From the moment Leslie see's Brigette Lin, the story continues to concentrate how the two interact with each other. The love scene is breathtaking with the falling cascades of water around the couple. I have to say I did not expect to see such moves that Leslie made while filming the love scene with Brigette. For those who loves listening to Leslie, the theme song is a must buy!",1109808000,4,603,4.541284403669724
796145,5,6304156154,"If you liked Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, then see The Bride With White Hair. Drawn from the same sword and sorcery tradition, both movies feature strong female leads. In the case of Bride, we have Brigitte Lin Ching Hsua, one of Hong Kong's most popular female stars. Brigitte is beautiful and compelling; more fey than Zhang Ziyi, she is a sorcerous assassin at the top of her game. Her meeting with the male lead, Leslie Cheung (a singer-actor best known in the US for his role in as Chen Dieyi in Farewell, My Concubine) is either accidental or destined, depending on how you look at it, but it changes her world and his.

The visual style of the film is spectacular, thanks in no small part to cinematographer Peter Bao. Director Ronny Yu Yan-Tai, who has been compared to Ridley Scott, is not very well known in the United States yet, but he's got a pretty good following world-wide. (Yes, yes. He directed Bride of Chucky. I'm not going to defend or attack him for that, because I've never seen it.) In Bride he conducts, like the best of the fantasy Hong Kong masters, an opera or ballet. Every word, every move is larger than life, everything fraught with meaning, promise or threat--this is not ""everyman"" action; this is epic. Like many epics, it sometimes does suffer from excess.

Bride is, in my opinion, not quite as good at humanizing its characters as Tiger. Both are Romeo and Juliet stories, but Lin's Lien Ni Chang and Cheung's Zhou Yi Hang are not as fully rendered as the star-crossed lovers of Tiger (either pair). They're archetypes. But they're grand and glorious archetypes. Who cares that Lien Ni Chang was raised by wolves who somehow taught her the mastery of wind instruments? Who cares how precisely the villains came by their genetic-defying bond? That isn't the point in this film, and people who allow themselves to bog down on these issues are, I believe, depriving themselves of a transporting film experience. Go willing to enjoy, and you probably will.

Those disturbed by the loose ending of Tiger, be warned: Bride isn't likely to satisfy you much more. If the ""what then?"" haunts you too much, you can find an answer in The Bride With White Hair II. It returns all the major characters and picks up where the other left off.",1103414400,8,2268,4.679197994987469
796146,4,6304156154,"First, the movie:  I saw this film in the mid 90s at a film festival in Houston.  I had no information or expectations before-hand.  I just sat in a dark room and it showed up in front of me.  It immediately went on my top 10 list and I dragged all of my friends to see it a few days later.  It's way over the top in every dimension.  Visually stunning and unapologetically emotional.  Brigitte Lin kicks ass so hard you can actually believe that a goth-fu loner like Leslie Cheung would turn the world upside down just for her.

Second, the DVD: Blech.  A soft, non-anamorphic transfer of an ugly print.  Gargantuan subtitles fill a big chunk of the image.  Not a significant improvement over the Tai Seng US release laserdisc.

Typically, chinese films film love scenes by implied action rather than overt or graphic depiction.  This movie goes beyond their traditional approach, but the love scenes are tastfully and artfully done and portray the two main characters in love, in the Romeo and Juliet style.

The movie does have its good points... the battles, the 'cool' characters, and the drama which unfolds between the characters.
There are a few interesting subplots, which are nicely tied to the end, but there are also annoying tiddly bits.. including the sexual frenzy between the two heroes which could have really been left out. Kinda makes you want to look away.
(sexual frenzy might have been a slight exageration, more like lots of touching and feeling with clothes on)
either way it should have been excluded.
Onto the rest of the film, its all rather enjoyable.
By the end though, you would have forgotten what most of it was about, and will surely not want to watch it again with any deal of urgency.

796154,5,6304156154,"This is one of the most rommantic films that I have ever seen that also delivered brilliant fight scenes as well.
The Bride With White hair is simply the greatest story telling of the classic tale-two lovers from seperate sides long to be together but they are torn by fate itself and they seem dawned forever by fate. This is the Bride with White hair. It is tragic, sad, loving, and emotional. It is film-making at it's peak with remarkable performances by Leslie Cheung and Brigite Lin Whom play the star crossed lovers. Francis Nig also makes another great performance as the villian that is joined at the middel to his sister.
The Bride with White hair is shear fantasy and transport you to whole new and dark existance in a time of ancient China where tensions were high and men ruled as demons and Kings, and Swordsmen were the wandering seeds of the land. The film also has a breathe taking theme-song, sang by none other than the original Hong Kong Pop Star Leslie Cheung.

The cinematography is so simple sometimes that its breath-taking.  The early scene of the young swordsman against a backdrop of a golden sky slicing through falling pink petals beneath a molting tree is perfection on the eye, just stunning, and never i don't think has a woman looked more beautiul than bridgitte lin as the mysterious witch bathing in a cavernous pool.
The storytelling is so grand, so innocent, so perfect that all hollywood ""epics"" pale in significance, and the acting is of a high quality to match.
Essentially its a martial arts/swordplay/fantasy/love story but in such a refreshing way it almost fails to fall into any of these genres.  Rich in history and traditionalism yet something entirely fresh - remember this is 1993, before Ang Lee brought flying Wudan warriors and epic swordplay to the attention of the public.  It should be noted that this has been part of chinese cinema for over a decade, but Bride With The White Hair puts it in an entirely different context to the likes of the Tsui Hark Directed Once Upon A Time In China series.
Not to give too much away but by the end even the hardest of hearts will break and at the very least some of the imagery will stay with you for a long long time - i never thought something visualised on a screen could be so beautiful as everyday sights, but somehow its managed - i have no hesitation in saying this is the best cinematography i have ever seen, and any student of camera work or direction should watch it as a piece of art, or more, a work of art.

796200,3,6304156154,"i rented this movie expecting it to be full of unrealistic fighting (which i love)...and beutiful scenery (which there was a lot of).  the problem with this movie is the fighting is too unrealistic to the point where it is funny(in a bad way.)  another point in this movie which i didn't like is that they fight with their hair- come on that is pretty messed up, you know??
but do rent this movie because it fun to watch- and if you don't like it, atleast watch it to the end-  because the ending was  incredible.  the story was a fairy tail of romeo and juliet but with fighting, and unbelievable chinese scenery.
the subtitles where good so if you are like me and hate fighting to read subtitles in yellow, this movie does a well job making everything legible.
i hope this helps",999302400,3,780,4.388888888888889
796201,4,6304156154,"I bought this film because of an ad I saw on another Kung fu flick.  I have to say that I was impressed right away with the cinematography.  Even though the film has a dark overtone, the film was interseting to watch.
I also found the chacraters to be interesting and the plot absorbing.
THe only reason I gave the film four stars, was due to the lack of satisfying fight scenes.  It's definately not as action packed as a Jet Li flick.  But I'd say the stroy is alot more intellingent.
If you want a Kung fu flick with a little less intensity then Jet Li, this should be right for you.  If your looking for more, then I suggest you rent it at least once to see if it's to your liking.",995846400,2,685,4.082089552238806
796202,4,6304156154,"well boys and girls, im back!  I just saw this movie earlier today (although i bought it over a month ago), so it's fresh in my mind. Thank god that finals are over...oh, sorry back to the movie.
Well, i agree with the overall consensus, this movie is quite good.  I was exceptionally skeptical due to the trailors i had seen, but the customer reviews swayed me to take a dive, and i did, and i enjoyed the swim afterwards.  This movie is more story than martial arts.  it has fighting in it, but if you're looking for a kick and punch thriller (what i kinda enjoy) then this may not be the movie that will satisfy your appetite, however, it will impress you nonetheless.
It's quite an interesting story about two young martial artists from opposing clans that fall in love, they meet, they fall in love, they vow to love one another, they do, and then something happens.  what you ask?  well, watch the movie, i won't ruin it anymore than i already have. haha.
It's not cheesey, although i was expecting it to be (remember i took a dive).  Although, i have a complaint about the unnecessary nudity in the film.  there was one scene that showed some naked woman wearing a mask, yeah, not your typical martial arts studio activity (i haven't seen something like that,and ive been involved with MA for 12 or so years).  but its a movie, so if you're planning on watching this with your children, don't!  it only occurs one time, but my other complaint was with the sex scene in this movie.  no nudity here, just acting, but quite explicit. so if you're easily offended by this type of material, you have been cautioned.
the story was honestly pretty good, the acting was also very good.  I got the DVD copy, so i didn't have any problems with blurriness, i thought it was a pretty good translation (picture and sound quality wise).  The dvd has options of english, mandarin and cantonese audio tracks, so its good for those who don't feel like reading.  the english language, isn't too bad either.  infact, its pretty good. my brother and i looked at one another in shock, it's not bad at all, although, the cantonese with english subtitles is still better.
towards the end, i thought Bridgette Lin's character was really cool, and that she gave a very strong performance.  A very good movie, though gloomy, a definite bang for the buck!",993772800,7,2335,4.536992840095466
796203,3,6304156154,"First off, HK fantasy films tend to be a little... quirky.  This movie is definitely quirky, but the problem is it's also dull as paste.  At no time did I give a flying fig about Leslie Cheung and his disaffected Romeo performance.  Brigitte Lin comes off as a much better actor, but by the 15th minute, I had already started checking my watch.  Boredom reigns here.  And add to that the trademark HK over-the-top mugging and exaggerated Chinese Theater emotion, and you have a grueling film to watch.
Another huge problem I had was that the film was so murky and dark.  Can we possibly have any more cave scenes?  The characters are mostly paper-thin in simplicity, and the ""evil twins"" are more annoying than imposing.  The story jumps around with little to no fanfare and little to no interest being built up.  The fight scenes are mostly lame, if for no other reason than the cheesy blur-effect that was used to excess.  I didn't care about Lian's brother, nor his sister, nor his uncle, nor the 8 clan leaders, nor the cackling evil sister, nor the foppish evil brother, nor anyone.  And therein lies the problem.  Such a moody film should make you interested in SOMEONE throughout the movie.
Bottom line: a lame Romeo & Juliet storyline with very little plot to follow and very few interesting themes or characters.  A disappointing snoozer.",991958400,6,1347,4.705128205128205

My Opinion:  This is a fairly hard core Hong Kong Action/Martial Arts film. It's a lot like a live action version of an animated film like Princess Mononoke or Akira. I really enjoyed those films as well as this one. It is quite strange but that's part of its beauty. It is very easy to sympathize with the main character as he doubts the word of the strange wolf girl he fell in love with.
DVD Quality:  Nothing Special. Includes trailers from other films. The English language track isn't that great.
What You Should Do:  If you are into martial arts films and/or animated movies like Princess Mononoke then you should check this out. This is definitely one you should rent or borrow before you decide to buy. If you are looking for another Crouching Tiger, I think this one will be a little too strange for you.",990489600,11,1043,4.383419689119171
796205,5,6304156154,"""The Bride With White Hair"" is the film that turned me on to Hong Kong cinema. If you are one of those Hong Kong aficionados who has enjoyed this movie on VHS, I highly recommend the DVD version because of its subtitles. Now---while I admittedly enjoy the awkwardly translated English subtitles in Hong Kong films, this is one film that I love enough that I've always wanted to see the grammar, spelling and sentence structure cleaned up! That is the wonderful surprise I found when I saw this flick on DVD! In addition, if you want to turn friends on to this film, and they're the crowd who just doesn't enjoy a flick with subtitles, then this DVD has an English dubbed version that is fairly good (especially compared to badly English dubbed jobs of great Hong Kong films like ""A Better Tomorrow""). For those unfamiliar with this film, ""Bride With White Hair"" is one of those rare fantasy features that actually makes my eyes a bit misty. What initially strikes me about the movie is the way the story is set up; we see Leslie Cheung (who starred in ""Farewell My Concubine""), having sat hunched in desolate state of guard over a healing plant for many years, wondering if ""a woman"" knows that he regards her as holding great importance, even greater than that of the emperor. A great and tragic story is then told as a recollection, beginning from his childhood when he firsts encounters the mystical girl who saves him from a pack of wolves by charming them with her song. They are drawn together again as adults (Bridgette Lin is both gorgeous and fantastic as The Bride!). The complexities come as both characters are torn by devotion to their clans, barters they have made with others, and by their vow of love to each other. This is beautiful and well told story, visually astounding, and the surreal nature of the film works. I highly recommend you treat yourself to this DVD!",986342400,59,1884,4.626865671641791

7863275,2,6304156154,"Not a good martial arts movie.
Not a good Wuxia movie.
Not a good romance movie.
What is it good as?
Not much besides extremely weird cinema.
If your into extremely-weird, go for it.

The plot and characters are ridiculous
and they are realized poorly.

The cover claims ""Erotic!"".
I don't think so,
unless your idea of erotic is
a male/female Siamese twin
with a bizarre psycho-sexual relationship
with itself (""themselves"")
and/or a man and a woman whom act
as if sexual relations are a form
of aggression.
There is nothing erotic about it.

The ""twin"" is a human-blood drinking
sorcerer/-ess and leader of an ""evil"" cult.

An assassin for the evil cult
is a woman, also a sorceress(witch),
who was raised by wolves.
She flies around slicing people up
with her hair.
She and the sensitive-guy
leader-in-training of an association
of clans opposed to the evil cult
are in ""love"".

of the movie for you,

7863276,5,6304156154,"This film is a classic example of the glory and impenetrability of Hong Kong cinema. It is a movie of pure genius whose gifts are so wedded to its esoteric and bizarre nature, its cultural specificity, and its low-budget limitations, that it is almost unwatchable for a viewer not properly prepared for appreciating it.

First, a few words to prepare you for, or, alternately warn you away from, this film and others of its genre. The print itself looks bad--blurry, grainy, and with some snap, crackle, and pop. This is typical of HK films of this time period. For some reason they even looked like this when shown in theaters.

The subtitles are awful. Most Tai Seng releases re-use the subtitle translation that was inserted by the film studio at the time of production, which was mandated by British Colonial law. In Bride, the subtitles are not only poor translations, they are pasted over the picture of the film, instead of being under the letterbox, and obscure a lot of the shots. Also, at the time, most HK films were shot without sound, which was then recorded later and dubbed in, which produces a slightly off lip-syncing effect, and is very jarring if you are not used to it. For those considering the English dub, it isn't quite as bad as those 70's chop socky flicks they ran on Sundays on Channel 20, but it's close.

Lastly, in terms of caveats, this movie, like others at the time, was produced on a budget that wouldn't get a decent half-hour TV show made in the States. The special effects are crude, to say the least.

That's just the technical stuff that may keep you from enjoying this movie. The other news is that the story, characters, style of filming, costumes, and other assorted elements are so over-the-top and bizarre as to be almost insane by Western standards. However, that is part of this film's great and enduring charm!

The basic story is sort of a fairy tale or legend, and it needs to be viewed as such. The characters and situations are larger than life and in many cases, completely berserk. This film lacks the impressive martial-arts demonstrations of a Jet Lee film, but that doesn't mean it is not enjoyably action-packed. It is just stylized action of a different type. The action is frenetic, swirling, and at some points, ridiculously blunt and bloody.

One of the main joys of the movie is the incredibly stylized art direction: the the colors, lighting, sets, costumes, and camera compositions are delirious and other-worldly, and stunningly beautiful.

Finally, the sheer screen presence and charisma of the star, Brigitte Lin, is an indispensable element of this film's magic.

If you can properly prepare yourself for this exotic experience, you will find one of the true treasures of international cinema: a crazed fairy tale, with an operatic sensibility and an incomparably visceral mixture of the beautiful and grotesque.",1248825600,7,2881,4.841463414634147
