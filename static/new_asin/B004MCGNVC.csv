8435920,5,B004MCGNVC,"This four DVD World War II Chronicles from History Channel Classics is a must have. I own a 100 WWII DVDs, however I watch this one the most. Patrick O'Neal narration draws me in, archive film is good, special notes on main characters priceless.",1423526400,3,245,4.590909090909091
8435921,2,B004MCGNVC,"I was definitely intrigued when I picked up this DVD set but immediately disappointed upon viewing them. First off, there is no indication on the box whatsoever that this documentary content is from over 25 years ago. Secondly, I suppose I should have taken the title more literally, as that's essentially all these discs do: quickly go over events with next to no analysis. Basically it's a 'this happened and then that happened' type of affair, nearly completely without commentary on why this particular battle was important, how it affected the war, the causes of the conflict in the first place, the aftermath, and so on.

I came away after having watched the first DVD feeling like I had learned absolutely nothing. A paper-based timeline would have been a better investment. Additionally the total America-centric approach to the conflict is quite disturbing, and makes it seem like the war didn't really start until the United States got involved.

Real history buffs should avoid this set at all costs.",1311206400,13,1011,5.011904761904762
