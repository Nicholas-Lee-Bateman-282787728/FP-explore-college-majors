7888137,5,6305294003,"If you like Sorcerer Hunters like I do, then this is a must have.  Like Volume 3 you can see how Carrot goes from a disgusting, obnoxious (but hilarious) pervert into a decent person with feelings.  Even though this box has two episodes, those two are the best I have seen out of all  fourteen that I have seen so far.  Episode 11 teaches yet again that  siblings should be there for eachother no matter what, and Episode 12  teaches that no human is fit to make a choice of sacrifice, no matter how  justifiable or worthy that sacrifice may seem.  Volume 5 is well worth your  money (unless you have more of a life than I do and wish to spend it on  shoes or something), and especially if you are a Sorcerer Hunters fan.",950486400,4,721,4.235294117647059
7888138,5,6305294003,"Well, I really enjoyed this tape. I was kind of put off by the review I read, but I ordered it anyway and man am I glad I did. I actually liked this tape better than tape 4. If you are into the Sorcerer Hunters the way  I am, then buy this tape!",948153600,,245,3.6226415094339623
7888139,2,6305294003,"I really love Sorcerer Hunters, and especially Marron :), yet I was really disappointed with this tape.  There were only 2 episodes on it and both were mediocre...and one episode was EXTREMELY disturbing!  It looked like Marron had lipstick and eyeshadow on through half of one episode, and the  whole time I was staring in shock while thinking, ""WHAT IS  THAT! ""  I suggest trying the other tapes, or holding off to buy  this one at least...  Not that I wouldn't of bought it anyway, since I like  having all the tapes, but I could of asked for it for my birthday, I  suppose, instead of going out and spending $ on it myself!  *Bangs head  on table*  So, if you like Sorcerer Hunters a smuch as me go ahead and  buy it, just BEWARE, it's NOT their best performance.",947289600,,767,4.392857142857143
