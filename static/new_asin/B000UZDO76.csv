2927989,4,B000UZDO76,"The DVD isn't HD, and it doesn't contain a lot of episodes. But my son loves it! It's also interesting to see how this show is low stimulus by removing unecessary environmental clutter in it's visual presentation. Kids can focus on the character and key elements presented on the white background. The stories are also cute and have a postivie message. Besides, how can you not love that ridiculous duck, Pato?",1215993600,,410,4.788732394366197
2927990,5,B000UZDO76,"While children's entertainment is cluttered with mediocre to poor properties, this series stands out as head and shoulders above the pack. Built on simple and entertaining story lines, each with a message that avoids topics that smack of being ""politically correct"", Pocoyo episodes are good stories with a good message. All that is needed.

The design of this series hits a bullseye with clarity, simplicity, and appeal. The animation is solid and has loads of playful energy. Simple, good, and fun.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pocoyo-Meet-Pocoyo/dp/B000UZDO76/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pocoyo: Meet Pocoyo</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pocoyo-Pocoyo-and-Friends/dp/B000UZDO7G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pocoyo: Pocoyo and Friends</a>&nbsp;are well worth the price. In fact, you don't need kids to enjoys these stories.

Why this isn't widely available on television in the US one can only guess. Perhaps top Execs in the US are worried they would end up with an audience of smart kids who expect quality.",1212105600,3,1112,6.879432624113475

2927992,5,B000UZDO76,This dvd is so cute!  I love the characters.  This is a very clever brand which I appreciate!  I like that my child can watch something witty and fun that is still age appropriate.  You can catch a glimps of Pocoyo scenes on Youtube.  I love it!,1202169600,4,245,4.127659574468085

This show is probably the most adorable thing EVER, and my kids adore it.
I think it's great, and I usually have to watch with them! :)
These episodes teach lessons about friendship, teaches identifying objects, and other good lessons.  Plus, Pocoyo is SO FUNNY!!!  We giggle the whole time!  I highly recommend this for anyone who wants awesome programming for their young children.",1195948800,2,412,4.857142857142857
2927994,4,B000UZDO76,"Just received the two DVDs ordered - after two delays they now appear to be in stock.  Am happy to have them BUT unlike the other region DVDs, this only has 7 stories - the others have been issued with 13 so I am feeling a little cheated.  (Amazon's website did not list any details when I ordered).  The stories included are:
The Big Sneeze
Drum Roll Please
Umbrella, Umbrella
A Mystery Most Puzzling
Double Bubble
Sleepy Bird's Surprise
Swept Away
I also think (compared to the Euro version) that these have been edited and shortened (but it's been a while since I saw the others so I might be mistaken).  The quality is good and the stories are still entertaining.  Just be aware that you're not buying the 1/2 season per DVD.
The show itself is lovely - the backgrounds are plain white so the individual characters and props are easily seen.  The stories are about friendship, sharing and caring and can easily be understood by the 3+ crowd.",1195776000,54,945,4.529411764705882

Decided to get the DVD to be able to use when traveling without internet access, but it was not clear to me from the product description if the DVD had Spanish audio since she mostly speaks Spanish now.  Pleased to find it did have Spanish audio (but no closed caption or subtitles as far as I can tell).

Great, simple videos, good for very young children.  The format is simple without too much background visuals and distractions.  We'll be using the English audio soon as she learns more English!",1374105600,6,576,4.553398058252427

2928006,3,B000UZDO76,I have not seen this or have had a chance to ask my daughter how my grandson liked it...he loves Pororo so thought he might like this one...unfortunately the Pororo dvds were sold out at Christmas.  This was my second choice.,1358208000,,225,4.487804878048781
2928007,5,B000UZDO76,Pocoyo is a funny and lively series for kids. With the selection of violent trash that is being beamed into children's brains this is a good alternative.,1356912000,,153,4.703703703703703

You, the adult, will actually enjoy it the first couple of times; really!",1351468800,,292,4.528301886792453
2928013,5,B000UZDO76,"We have a 3 1/2 year old that spends some time in our home. We catch the 10 minute episodes of Pocoyo on PBS on occasion, and he just loves them, but they only come on twice a day. I thought it would be fun to have a video for rainy or boring days in the house. We really enjoyed this dvd. The cartoon is quite cute, entertaining, and fun, even for adults. The stories are short, so they keep the kids' attention, and they always have a wonderful little moral (like sharing, working together, helping a friend, etc.). And, unlike some of the popular cartoons or shows, they're not annoying or tiresome for adults to watch. I have shown this show to several children, both boys and girls, and ages 6 months to 5 years, and they all enjoy this show. I purchased 4 Pocoyo dvds at once, and ended up giving two of them to a girlfriend who has a toddler and runs a child day care from her home, and she and her kids love them, as well! And again, they range in age from a few months old to almost kindergarten. She loves that, on a rainy or housebound day, it catches and keeps the kids' attention, they laugh, play along, and really enjoy the stories.

I didn't notice when I was considering purchasing this dvd, but there are several stories/skits on each dvd, which adds up to an hour (or more) per dvd. I wasn't certain, since the shows are only 10 minutes on tv, so that's why I purchased 4 dvds. But, since they are each so long and have so many shows on each one, that is why I gifted two of them to my friend. I knew her kids would enjoy them and she would make good use of them. Great purchase!",1334102400,2,1598,4.15483870967742
2928014,4,B000UZDO76,My son loves Pocoyo... as soon as he received he put it on and he is watching him. This a very good video set for toddlers and babies!! I don't give him 5 stars because they promised me to be delivered in 2 days and I got it in 4. I recommended this video to every parent that wants to have a lot of quality time with their children.,1333065600,,333,3.8405797101449277
2928015,5,B000UZDO76,"Have yet to receive this dvd, but have seen this show on Nick Jr. and LOVED It! The little boy that I nanny is 3, and loves all sorts of different shows. For instance he loves the Last Chance to See series with Mark Carwardine and Stephen Fry.

So by chance we caught this show just before his bed time, I was not paying particular attention to it (anything is better than Calliou! ). When I thought that I heard Stephen Fry. I thought it was a commercial or something so I asked Adam what was Stephen talking about, he told me that Mark &Stephen (to him the two shall never be individual ), were telling him the story. I went on Imdb, and sure enough it was Stephen Fry as the Narrator!  Made my Night! Now he won't go to bed until (Mark &) Stephen tell him a Pocoyo Story!

A must have for any with toddlers! :-)",1331164800,,814,4.1069182389937104

2928017,5,B000UZDO76,"Best kids show.  It's short (only 7 minutes) so I can let my kids watch ""1 more"" and it doesn't take a half hour.

2928020,4,B000UZDO76,"I have introduced Pocoyo to my baby when he was around 5 months old. Now that he is going 15 months in June 30, 2011, he could watch and understand cartoons much better, all he's ever wanted is Pocoyo. Nothing seems to get his interests much, except Pocoyo. He can sit and watch Pocoyo the entire dvd in contrast to Mickey Mouse dvd. Good investment when parents like me get to take a quick break.",1309046400,,397,4.306666666666667
2928021,4,B000UZDO76,"Me and my son watch this show on daily basis. Ever since pocoyo graced NickJr with its presence, it became my son's fave 8 minutes show. Since the tv version only shows one episode that last from 6 to 9 minutes, the dvd gives us more stories and more time to amuse our kids. I love how simple the show is, in each episode pocoyo only says a few words..this is easier for my son to grasp. I also love how the animation looks, it doesn't look cheaply made animation movie. It's very simplistic yet entertaining. I caught my son laughing everytime he watches this show. For only a few dollars, this dvd is worth to buy.",1307577600,,616,4.273504273504273
2928022,5,B000UZDO76,"My 2-year-old daughter LOVES Pocoyo. She watches it every day on Nick Jr. after Wow Wow Wubbzy as a pre-nap treat, but it's just one little episode per day and the only way to record and watch it is to record the previous or following show and fast forward or rewind to Pocoyo. This DVD is perfect! She can watch it on long car rides or just watch it at home without me having to constantly rewind and fast forward. Such a great show. I love the animation, and my husband thinks Pato is hilarious when he dances. Fun for the whole fam, and without annoying voices or images (definitely not like Dora...phew!)",1302739200,,608,4.389380530973451

2928024,5,B000UZDO76,"The writing and the narrator's delivery of the lines are witty and smart. The stories have little lessons without being heavy or preachy. The animation is simple but not that lazy, too flatly drawn type of simple (like creepy Hopla); the movements of the characters are highly expressive despite their simplicity. My 2 year old son laughs and laughs at Pocoyo. He understands and appreciates that Pocoyo is his peer, a very young boy too. My son calls him ""baby"".",1301616000,,463,4.8
2928025,4,B000UZDO76,"This is a pretty well created show compared to the others that are out there and one I don't mind watching. The characters are cute and the stories are pretty good. Not sure it will be a show my son will like for a long long time, because it is geared toward younger kids, but he enjoys it now. He is only a year, and while he doesn't just stare at the tv while it's on, he does like to watch it while playing with his toys. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good cartoon for young children.",1299715200,,504,4.0

2928028,5,B000UZDO76,"My wife and I purchased this DVD after seeing Pocoyo on Nick Jr, and wanting more. The show is lighthearted, upbeat, and colorful. The stark contrast between the characters and the blank backdrop is fantastic. The mannerisms of the characters make small children love them. Each episode is rather short at about 7 minutes, but that's fine, because it keeps the writing tight. Also, it's fine when your child wants to watch ""one more"", since the length of time is so short. This is one of those rare shows that both parents and children enjoy.

Specifically to this collection, there were not any episodes I recognized, but my family still enjoyed all of them.",1295049600,,659,4.780701754385965

Wow, I didn't think my 2 & 4 year olds would love it this much but now it's a go-to for something they BOTH enjoy.  My only complaint is that they do cost a little more than I'd like for the length of the DVD.  I feel like I get more bang for my buck when I buy Backyardigan DVDs.",1294444800,,392,3.814814814814815

All the reviews I've read are spot on! This is a very well done show. Cheers to Spain and it's creators!

I purchased some UK videos off eBay at a very high cost as they were being shipped from Singapore to the States. I'm glad to know I can purchase through Amazon for less cost.

If you have any doubts of ordering, view some of the Pocoyo's on YouTube and make your decision from there.  Like many of us reviewing,once purchased, you'll only wish Pocoyo was more popularly known/televised.",1268179200,,710,4.438461538461539
