It would be great if other musicians would do similar things. The only reason I say that is now there are several Crossroads concerts available and they are pretty much the same people playing the similar music. There are so many great musicians out there and many of us (like myself) cannot afford to go see them at live concerts. So DVD recordings are the next best thing.",1405555200,,502,4.527472527472527

2140293,5,B0002Y4T92,"Bought this DVD for my husband for Fathers Day. He absolutely loves it. He loves anything with Eric Clapton and Blues. It has such a mixture of music. Anyone who appreciates music and the crossroad festivals will enjoy watching the many different performers. It does have a couple of unheard of musicians at least to us, so even if they're not your thing, the others make up for it.",1373673600,,382,4.550724637681159
2140294,4,B0002Y4T92,"I have a handful of these Clapton sponsored festivals and like the others, Eric manages to attract a wide spectrum of musicians, all of which have a guitar as a primary instrument.  And as John Mayer says in an early, between sets interview, ""These are not week-end guitar players.""  Indeed.

I can't imagine anyone who would be totally satisfied with all the performers because Clapton has a diversified line-up.  Certainly the focus is on blues as it usually is.  I've heard from more than one guitarist who said that Clapton may be best remembered as the man who introduced the blues to America.  He being British and the blues being an American based musical genre, which is quite a statement, if based in fact.

I do have a couple beefs however, so let's get those out of the way.  One of my favorite guitarists and one of the most original, is Pat Metheny.  And while you can see him mixing it up with other musicians backstage, he's nowhere to be found on this DVD.  Instead we get a very long song by Indian artist Vishwa Mohan Bhatt who opens the second disc, followed shortly thereafter by Larry Carlton playing ""Josie"" a 1984 smooth jazz hit that has been played to death, and few care about in 2004.  Former Whitesnake guitarist Steve Vai seemed to be getting the biggest response from the audience in the whole festival, yet he was relegated to only one song here.

On Disc 1, I found the order a bit unusual.  There doesn't seem to be any sequence as the acts go from night time to day time, then back to night.  Just a bit weird.  But quibbles aside, this is always a great show to catch on DVD/Blu ray no matter the venue.  And Clapton moves things around.  This show also highlights Clapton guitar more than on those that followed.  Here he also pays homage to Texas - takes place in the Dallas Cotton Bowl - by closing the show with some great work by ZZ Top.  I can't wait for the next version (fall of 2013 I think) on Blu ray.",1373155200,,1947,4.4033613445378155
2140295,5,B0002Y4T92,"I guess this is a product review. the seller was excellent and the used product (2-DVDs) was in perfect condition. I am not a huge fan of eric Clapton but I do enjoy jj cale and Clapton admires him so I guess that is okay. is he playing at this festival? james taylor is always a hoot; he has a good sense of humor, sings good blues, and I can't spell accoppella.

I liked the way they had a large replica of Stevie Ray Vaughan's Guitar displayed on the side of the stage (on the right). This one has been reviewed quite extensively, so I'll just point out a few things, that I really liked. I liked all of it from beginning to end!!!

Some highlights I liked include: ""Six Strings Down"" by Eric Clapton, Robert Cray, Robert Randolph, & Jimmie Vaughan, ""Sweet Home Chicago"" by Eric Clapton, Robert Cray, Buddy Guy, Hubert Sumlin, & Jimmie Vaughan, ""I am a Man of Constant Sorrow"" by Dan Tyminski & Ron Block ""the Soggy Bottom Boys"" from the Movie ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"", ""After Midnight"" by J.J. Cale & Eric Clapton, ""Call Me the Breeze"" by J.J. Cale & Eric Clapton, ""Funk 49"" & ""Rocky Mountain Way"" by Joe Walsh, ""LaGrange"" & ""Tush"" by ZZ Top.

2140380,3,B0002Y4T92,"I can't say this 2 DVD set blew me away. There are some OK performances but 98% of them are just OK. I bought this (used I might add-cheap!)coming in as a guitar fan and mostly as a fan of Eric Johnson and Pat Metheny - although I do love 95% of the other great names on this disc. Most of the artist's cuts here are just OK. However.........................

 I will keep this disc as Robert Cray plays the performance of a lifetime with TIME MAKES TWO. After reading most of the reviews (there were 158 at the time) only 2 people mention fact to this! Are you not listening people? Mr. Cray simply turns in the greatest of blues performances - he sings and plays his @ss off and lets each member of the audience (even the DVD audience)know that HE HAS THE BLUES! One of the best musical performances ever IMHO. If you don't feel something at the end of this track, well then, I don't know what to say? Maybe David Cassidy does it for you........dun'no?

 I've seen Robert live before (mid 90s) and it was OK. He's never been my fav but I've always had respect for him. I thought more people would mention the R.C. performance. Well, out of deep respect, I am letting the whole world know about his performance. Robert, you truly deserve such praise and acknowledgement on THE BEST BLUES PERFORMANCE of the past 100 years (yeah, I heard that one note near the end but it didn't take away ANYTHING!)

To see BB King, Eric Clapton, Buddy Guy and Jimmy Vaughn all on the same stage together singing ""Rock Me Baby"" is incredible.  I enjoyed hearing ""After Midnight"" by the original artist (JJ Cale), and I liked the fact that although Clapton was on stage with him, he let Cale sing it his way.  (Anyone who knows Clapton knows that he rocked up ""After Midnight"" to the point where it didn't sound like the original at all.)  I believe that's a testiment to how much respect Clapton had for his fellow musicians.

Joe Walsh was in a bit of a playful mood during his set.  He introduced ""Rocky Mountain Way"" by saying, ""If I had known I'd be singing this song for the rest of my life I probably would have written something else.  But I didn't so you're stuck with this one.""  I thought that was good.

A little too much footage of John Mayer but I guess the producers were hoping to snag the younger crowd.

I was also a little disappointed that despite showing Neal Schon on the side of the stage and in a brief interview segment, there is no footage of him playing!!? Would've also liked to have seen Jeff Beck who I understand was there but left out of the final edit. And I concur that there are many other guitarists more worthy than who did make the cut...Di Meola, Knopfler, David Lindley, Betts, Lukather, Coryell...

There was a sitar player who played on forever - please stop already!!! AND that's NOT a guitar! It's a SITAR! Not even a hint of a classical guitarist.

2140424,5,B0002Y4T92,"Eric Clapton did a fabulous job in organizing a rare collection of guitar talent to perform at this three-day festival in Texas. It is as much a treat to see the legendary bluesmen Buddy Guy and B.B. King onstage with Eric, as it is to see fret-shreddin' Steve Vai, Jimmy Vaughn and Johnny Lang.

The music is blues-based, but many different styles and flavors are present: old-style blues, cultural (Indian), jazz, blues-rock and rock. Although there were time considerations in editing the footage of this CD, the ""best of the best"" is represented here.

One of the key highlights of this show is Robert Randolph, a new Jersey native, who played the pedal steel guitar in a cross between the styles of Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughan. I have never seen anything like it and he clearly made his mark in this performance, appearing onstage several times.

Some of the tunes were inspirational enough to pick up the guitar, turn on the amp and play along, as some of my favorite musicians played onstage. I would recommend watching in this in 5.1 on a home-theater system, as the presence of the music is much more realized.

I disagree with Amazon's assessment that ZZ Top as a closing act was anti-climactic. The group is monumental in the history of rock and they are at the top of the Texas blues-rock genre. I saw it as befitting to have them close this show, especially in the state of Texas.",1175472000,9,1401,4.637096774193548

Eric Clapton's Crossroads DVD was just the ticket for me. Now I want a CD of the music to make my own mix.

Before I watched the DVD I played it as a CD. Disk one I have no complaints with, just superb. Disk 2, the first three compositions weren't my cup of tea, musically, although I recognized the talent. I forgave it and moved on. It is to be a classic, if only the DVD were better known. I do know I want more Robert Cray, Johnny Lang and John Mayer. Joe Walsh must be wonderful to hang with; what a human.

I have CDs with some of the music and in the concert it was done even better. Eric, give us a CD - I'll buy it.",1172620800,,907,3.907608695652174

2140455,4,B0002Y4T92,"If you buy one video in the hope of learning some great guitar lick's Buy Crossroads Guitar Festival. The blues licks one can glean from watching Buddy Guy,Eric Clapton,and a great set by Joe Walsh are one of the best teaching videos i have ever seen. Slap this DVD on the player hook up your guitar and prepare to jam with the best blues players in the business. Claptons extended soloing with Doyle Bramhall JR on the songs Cocaine,I shot the Sheriff & Have You Ever Loved a Women are pure bliss to play along to. Other benifits for guitar players are the close up shots on most solo progressions and makes fingering of solos easier to learn, you will also notice the types of guitar amps and effects pedal's the players are using.

I also agree with the other reviewers that more material should have been added, it could and should have been a 3 or 4 disc dvd set. David Hidalgo(los lobo's) and Jonny Lang & Jimmie Vaughan to name a few should have been given more time on this two disc set.

That being said this is one of the best DVD's i have ever owned and has such great longevity, you simply will not grow tired of listening to this eclectic gathering of guitar greats.",1161043200,6,1179,4.378995433789954
2140456,5,B0002Y4T92,"This is an absolutely EXcellent show.  There's alot that ISN'T on this two-DVD set, to be sure, but what is here is splendid.

As a guitarist, i grade the photography an A ... it shows ALOT of actual player footage, which is thoroughly enjoyable.  The presentation is very tasteful ... no jerky cameras; none of this fast-paced ""MTV""-style BS.  This is QUALITY taping all the way....well planned and produced.  It gracefully moves from musician's performances, to occasional crowd pans or closeup's, to well-integrated brief commentaries from some of the musicians.  The sound quality is excellent as well.  It plays great on my WS plasma TV.

The player round-up is fabulous .... a number of ""old-timers"" from the Blue's roots, as well as many of our contemporary favorites. (Mostly ""old timers"", but a nice ""smattering"" of some of the ""younsters"" too ... John Mayer in particular is great.)  Eric Johnson's segment, though too short, is Nirvana for us players.

AND, fittingly, there's ALOT of REALLY GOOD Eric Clapton material.  (Man can he STILL rock ... and his endurance is nothing short of phenominal.) The show's spectrum aptly demonstrates how much Clapton is loved WITHIN the professional musician's community as well as the fans.  I've always loved Clapton's style and technique, and tried to emulate him early-on in my playing.  But i also love his Heart, and how he gives SO MUCH back to the ones who love him ...  including conceiving of and organizing this festival.

This show honors the world of music, and guitarists in particular.  BUY THIS DVD!  You'll be glad you did.",1158105600,8,1589,4.958333333333333

As many others have mentioned, not to have Jeff Beck on the DVD is a real glaring ommison. I also thought ZZ Top were way past their prime on this recording.

Joe Walsh looked drunk to me as well, but then he seems to always look and act that way. I really enjoyed a number of artists on DVD #2 such as the incomprable John Mclaughlin. Steve Vai seems to make playing look so easy and fun!",1153958400,6,512,4.009803921568627

One other problem: Booker T & the MGs (with Steve Cropper on guitar) were featured as Joe Walsh's backing band, but nowhere on the DVD credits were they mentioned.

2140487,5,B0002Y4T92,"This is a really good representation of the shows. They don't tell you that the Robert Cray cut was the first song of his set and was the best modern blues song of the day. Eric Johnson doing ""The Wind Cries Mary"" is one of the biggest missing moments. There were so many moments I'm sure it was daunting to pick them, but when John Mayer wailed his solo with Eric,BB,& Buddy watching then laid his guitar at the feet of Buddy Guy bowed to him and walked off the stage, there was more electricity in the  air than the lightning that forced an early end to the show. Wish that one made it.

The reality though is after you stand them all side by side for two days, Eric was still the best we heard all weekend.  To bad the encore of Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton and ZZ Top doing ""I'm Going Down"" never happened.

This video accurately captires the spirit of the event.

2140492,3,B0002Y4T92,"If you love all things guitar then you won't go wrong with this DVD. Great sound, good visuals, huge variety. But the strength of variety is also the greatest weakness.

In some ways you do not want to criticise as there really are some superb tracks on this double DVD. The frustration for those like me who couldn't be there is that we missed so much. You can't help noticing this during the DVD. I saw Pat Metheny being hugged but didn't hear a note from him, as others have noted the great Dennis Chambers on drums, yet we don't see him while he solos and we hardly see the maestro, Steve Gadd. I suggest too diverse a range was attempted to be captured for the 2 disc DVD. I don't want to see two ZZ Top numbers at the expense of not seeing Jeff Beck. Why three tracks with Joe Walsh and only one of Larry Carlton? As much as I enjoy Vai, this track seems so out of place. This DVD should have rather just been a blues/Clapton DVD rather than an uneven hotch-potch.

Overall, I'll keep and enjoy this well recorded DVD, but there will always be a little frustration of what could have been. If you want a taster of the variety of guitaring on show then this will not disappoint.",1133222400,24,1183,4.253333333333333
2140493,5,B0002Y4T92,"This DVD set is becoming the most watched DVD in my collection.  The video is a compilation from a 3 day ""guitar festival"" organized for Eric Clapton to support his Crossroads Drug and Alcohol rehab center in Aruba.

I must say that if you enjoy guitar music, you HAVE to have this DVD in your collection.  That's not to say you'll like ALL of the performances.  This is a mixed bag of music, from Blues and Rock 'n Roll to Country and Bluegrass to Jazz and even an Indian/Hindu number.  Every artist here is technically excellent for the style of music they play.

Low points for me were:  the Indian piece; Steve Vai who is technically a good player, but I don't care for his style or his attitude; and John Mclaughlin.  McLaughlin is a great guitarist, but, again, his style really isn't my taste.

High Points:  Most of the rest of the video.  Clapton is top notch, as always.  BB King, Buddy Guy and the rest of the ""old blues"" artists were quite good and interesting to see in this setting.  I enjoyed seeing John Mayer play to a crowd that is a bit older than his typical fan base.

I especially enjoyed seeing players that are much less known...some even new to me.  It's good to see guys like David Hidalgo and Eric Johnson get more exposure.  I wish the video had a few more songs by these guys.  Dan Tyminski was quite good, although he seems a little out of place here.  (he's the guy who played and sang ""Man of Constant Sorrow"" on the movie ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"" that George Clooney lip-synched to.)

I'm not a country music fan, but I even enjoy seeing Vince Gill here.

Joe Walsh is always entertaining.  He has two solo numbers as well as a ""cameo"" backing up James Taylor while Taylor does his ""Joe Walsh imitation"".

From those who were at the concert, it seems that some of the best music at the festival didn't make it to the DVD.  That's unfortunate.  It's too bad they don't release a larger or second volume set.

The casual viewer or music fan may not enjoy this set as much as I do.  Keep in mind that there are many styles here, and the purpose of the DVD is not necessarily to only present the best of the festival, but rather to provide a sampling of what the festival had to offer.  As a guitarist, I'm fascinated watching players who are GOOD even when I don't always enjoy their style of playing.

I guess I'm more of a vintage Clapton fan, ironically there is a picture of ""Blackie"" on the back cover, and I absolutely LOVED the tone he got from that guitar as opposed to his (new) tone. As far as his line-up I would have liked to have seen other greats such as Van Halen, Walter Trout, and so many others. Joe Walsh always blows me away and he was great on this dvd, and funny too. I have to admit one of the best and tasty performances was by Vince Gill, yeah, the ""country"" dude, he tore the neck off that thing and made it look ""EASY"" as in no effort. I'm not a big fan of Steve Vai,  I just don't understand notes being played at a million miles per hour with no taste or style or feeling, I saw him live and he was a first class ""A-hole""  very very arrogant.

From James Burton on ""The Adventures or Ozzie and Harriet"" to Buddy Merrill on ""The Lawrence Welk Show"" and of course all Ed Sullivan Show performances from Segovia to Buddy Holly.  I even watched the unbearable ""Merv Griffin Show"" to check out Herb Ellis.

  Fast forward to today, I'm loving the availablity of live guitar performances, and I'm metzmerized by great playing of any type. For my taste, I loved John McLaughlin's performance, plugged into a laptop, and just killing it and I wanted more  I would have liked more too of Larry Carlton, especially playing some improvised blues/jazz. I wished they would have invited ROBBEN FORD to the party.  Eric smokes on several tunes including of all things, ""I Shot the Sheriff"" which I usually hate.  Doyle Bramhall II's unique take on blues is outstanding, and I enjoyed the hilariously dopey Joe Walsh backing James Taylor, who is always a class act.

Top, a cameo by Joe Walsh, the guys who did the music for oh Brother where art thou and on and on. You won't be disappointed a two dvd set for a great price!!!",1122854400,5,423,3.9302325581395348
2140528,5,B0002Y4T92,"yeah that is the worst thing you can say about this show, given the galaxy of stars and the performances!

i'm a huge fan of clapton of the late 60s and early 70s and i'm glad that it is in that spirit that he plays here. his jam/duel with carlos santana is itself worth the price of this dvd.

the sets of the blues greats - bb king, buddy guy, hubert sumlin are awe inspiring. multiple jams between them and clapton - great stuff!

eric johnson, robert cray, robert randolph and john mayer show that axe slinging is still alive with the younger generation. the first two put on an inspiring set.

the exotic piece is the hindustani piece played by vishna mohan bhatt from india with his self-invented/styled guitar which he plays with a slide.

the highlight of the show (imo) is the piece by john mclaughlin who is the guitarist's guitarist. such control and feel at such speed! unbelievable! i'm sure every guitarist out there was in a state of daze/shock after that 7 minutes of shredded melody!

james taylor is boring. and so is jj cale (though he is saved by clapton), larry carlton and steve vai. jimmy vaughn is not great - but i dig him for his spirit (one can only imagine what a show it would have been if his younger brother had been alive to play here - we miss you stevie)!

towards the end david hidalgo and joe walsh set the stage on fire and the concert is brought to an end by zz top (a mediocre set).

i hear that jeff beck and neil schon got edited out - a pity - as there is some stuff here in the dvd which could have easily substituted for those!

btw this review wouldnt be complete without a mention about the guitars used in the show : the fender stratocaster seems to reign supreme in this show - everybody from clapton to walsh to robert cray to jimmy vaughn to buddy guy is shown playing one. surprisingly very few gibson les pauls. john mclaughlin has a weird but solid looking guitar with only one pickup. hidalgo shows off a rare gibson firebird. likewise joe walsh, a brand new black rickenbacker. but imo the guitar of the show was the beautiful leaf shaped red gretsch with its trademark thumbnail inlays, sported by billy gibbons.

if you're a fan of the guitar, get this dvd!",1122854400,6,2214,4.378048780487805
2140529,1,B0002Y4T92,"A very dissapointing lack lustre performance from Mr Clapton, who decided to dress like a beach bum, and plays equally badly. Ommissions like Jeff Beck, from the concert are not acceptable. Larry Carlton did a good job but one short song, is far too short. Buddy Guy and Hubert Sumlin showed what real blues players can do (take note Eric you have so much to learn). The inclusion of obscure unknown artists, inplace of major players is a waste of time and money.

I suggest saving your money on this DVD, and getting something else. Eric and his new multicoloured strat guitar are sounding tired and boring. He is poor to average in his playing ability, and is now living on a former reputation, he can not replicate these days.",1121731200,10,729,4.607692307692307

Was he even there? Also read John Mayer sat in with Clapton, BB, Vaughn and Guy. Maybe he did but there was no footage included here. Was waiting for Johnny Lang to rip into a solo, never happened. Eric Johnson was surprisingly sloppy at times. Of course his sloppy is still better than most guitarist. I really enjoyed Clapton playing with JJ Cale.  I thought that was great. Vince Gill put on a great set also. David Hildago was smoking, great vocals and guitar solos.  Clapton playing with Santana was interesting, although Clapton looked lost at times. I guess that will happen during a walk on. I have to say this was worth the money. I can't wait to watch it again.",1117238400,5,838,4.365384615384615
2140536,2,B0002Y4T92,"Where should I begin? Given that the cross-section of artists at this festival is so diverse, it makes it nearly imposible to cull a meaningful collection of music without having to cater to the greater listening audience which is kind of disappointing. The selection of songs on this set is what I really take issue with. Case in point, no Jeff Beck performances and shoddy-at-best performances by Joe Walsh and ZZ Top. Singular mediocre performances by Eric Johnson, Johnny Lang and Steve Vai, etc. I could go on and on about what could have and should have been on this set. Highlights however include Buddy Guy's performances, along with Robert Cray's. Clapton's ""I Shot the Sherriff"" (would you expect any other tune?) was pretty good as well. Probably the best guitar playing on the whole set is Vince Gill's finger picking on ""Oklahoma Borderline."" Very impressive. I see that a lot of the glowing reviews are by people who were at the show. I myself was not and that drives home my point. If this is supposed to be the best of the festival I'm glad I didn't go. Just look at all the other reviews for this set and take this review accordingly and honestly. If you are a casual listener or intermediate musician than this set will be very entertaining. If, however, you are looking for something a little more inspiring, save your money.",1115942400,12,1344,4.6991525423728815
2140547,4,B0002Y4T92,"I've been playing guitar for 25 years and I love DVD concerts that feature guitar.  Clapton's Crossroads festival is a heapin' helpin' showcase for some of the best fret-grinders in history.  The best part is you don't have to get blasted by the Texas heat in Dallas' Cotton Bowl to enjoy it!

With a line-up that reperesents many in the constellation of all-time guitar greats, some of the finest players shown on the DVD turn in mediocre performances, and some of these you might think less of, are absolutely killer.  I find most of the ensemble performances are lukewarm, including those with BB, Clapton, Buddy Guy, and Jimmie Vaughan.  Buddy DOES play great, no question, and he really stands out.  But I saw Jimmie Vaughan play live last year and he was awesome.  The playing I saw on this DVD of him was pretty tepid.  His requiem to his lengendary brother Stevie, ""Six Strings Down"", is pretty weak, but is rescued by the addition of pedal steel phenom Robert Randolph, who turns in a sizzling performance.  Other disappointments include Eric Johnson. His ""Desert Rose"" is one of his showcase pieces and he labors through it on this disk.  Johnny Langs hardly plays a guitar solo on his featured song.  Why the hell was that tune even put on the disk?

The Great stuff:  Steve Vai and his over-the-top, tongue-in-cheek antics are amazing. Beat-up and haggard,  JJ Cale is sublimely great.  James Taylor, as usual, plays with great warmth and subtlelty, and is accompanied by dobro giant Jerry Douglas, whom he refers to as ""The Muhammad Ali of Dobro"", and also by Joe Walsh.  It is Joe Walsh, in my opinion, who steals the DVD's show.  His electric blues-drenched stylings dipped into a bucket of digital delay is pure candy and heaven for guitar aficionados' ears.  I've never been a big fan of his, even though he's a respected player.  Joe's blues intro in his own set will floor you.  His tone and phrasing are fantastic.  John Mayer surprised the hell out of me...thought he was just a pretty boy, but he's an excellent electric guitarist.  Carlos Santana and Clapton play a guitar duel in the classic , ""Jingo.""  Country player Vince Gill plays some hot Telecaster licks in his set, esp. on ""Oklahoma Borderline."" Finally, Clapton himself plays some great stuff, clearly inspired, and he sings with a passion that burns.

Other issues: the sound mix has problems at times...the overall level dips now and again through Vai's song and Gills' ""Oklahoma Borderline.""  Some of the audience reaction shots make the crowd look dazed and like they don't understand what they're seeing/hearing.  Maybe it's just the Dallas heat and dehydration at work.  Some of those shots look so out of place they appear to be taken from songs other than the one they're married to on disk.  And the director makes some strange choices, as in Gills' ""Oklahahoma Borderline,"" he gets confused and calls for the camera on Jerry Doulglas while Gill is playing a solo (I have not looked at the alt. angles yet).

Finally, we see or hear snippets of some other players not on the disk: Jeff Beck, Pat Metheny, John McGlaughlin and Neal Schon.  Schon's ""Star Spangled Banner"" is heard on closing titles and sounds great.  One can only hope those and the rest of the omitted performances are being saved for a Volume II.

Issues aside, I really like this DVD and show highlights from it to all my music aficionado pals, who end up digging it as much as I do.

2140548,3,B0002Y4T92,"Having been to the concert myself, I truly believe it to be of of those 'concerts of a lifetime'. I was really looking forward to watching the DVD, since I wanted to be reminded of all the great artists I saw.

Unfortunately, they were unable to capture this on the DVD. It looks as if the DVD was rushed, and someone just randomly put clips together, interspersed with interviews, sometimes appearing DURING the performances. And it wasn't in order.

I wish they did an alternative version, because it was based too heavily on ZZ top, country and folk than blues/rock/jazz. They missed Jeff Beck, Robert Randolph's show stopper ('I need more love'), Doyle Braham's guitar solos in EC's sets (esp Layla), the brilliant part where John Mayer put his guitar down in front of Buddy Guy / BB King and walked off stage as a mark of respect (like EC did to Hendrix one time)... and especially buddy guy! he was my favourite, really engaged the crowd, and they missed most of his set out.

one thing you wouldn't know unless you went to concert was that it was Zakhir Hussain who played with John McLauglhin - and this was not mentioned on the DVD. I think there was an excellent jam between him and the drummer (ok they're not guitarists...) and this I thought would have been essential listening, especially since McLaughlin played some of his old stuff along with them.

I just hope they bring out a second DVD with all the good stuff on it.

It's ""his"" selection of guitar top guitar players (Robert Cray, Buddy Guy, Jonny Lang, ZZ Top, Steve Vai, John McLaughlin, BB King, ...), supported by their genuine bands. The two DVDs will take you away for over 2 hours, and leave you back to earth with your ears filled with top-notch 6-string based live music.

As per the video and audio quality, it is really impressive to see such a recording under those ""windy"" conditions at the arena. The audio and the video is much more than satisfactory.

And they're not just doing ragged, what-do-you-expect-from-a-benefit performances; many of them play their heart out.  Do you like Clapton?  His I Shot the Sheriff (among other numbers) is spectacular; he obviously wanted to give it everything he had.  Wondering if McLaughlin can still do it?  As you'll discover, indeed he can.  Not a big fan of Steve Vai?  Me neither, but at least he shows why some folks are.  One reviewer says Joe Walsh was drunk.  I don't know, but his solo behind James Taylor is very tasty.  Another dissed J.J. Cale's numbers; I pity his inability hear that master's genius.  Forgive me, but I'd never seen Vince Gill play.  Wow!  I could go on.  (I would have to agree with one reviewer who questioned having ZZ Top close the show, but if the worst thing you can say about a show is that ZZ Top was the least impressive among several dozen acts, well, you could do a whole lot worse; I mean, it would be hard for anyone to close that show, so you have to give them credit for trying).

2140555,4,B0002Y4T92,"There is no question that this is an essential album for any fans of guitar, especially those with a diverse taste in music. This is just full on ingenius soloing, shredding, slide playing, and anything else you want to see done with a guitar.

As usual, we have some trademark performances from old stalwarts. Clapton delivers a impassioned jam on Have You Ever Loved a Woman and plays great alongside Carlos Santana. McLaughlin, of course, is possibly the greatest jazz guitarist ever, and proves it again with Tones for Elvin Jones. And ZZ Top are as usual just good fun and a fitting way to close up a Texas show.

Of course one of the best moments must be attributed to the absolutely unbelievable Robert Randolph. The vets are great and all, this guy is hungry and ready to prove himself which he does in spades. Check out Live at the Wetlands for some playing that will get you dancing and grooving late into the night.

Another new performer, whom I had never heard until this DVD, is Vishwa Mohan Bhatt. As a recently converted fan of Indian music, this blew me away. It is different and played early in the afternoon (the night crowds were out for Clapton) and he wakes everybody up with his custom made guitar, made specifically for the tones and rhythm of Indian classical. If you've ever enjoyed Ravi Shankar playing you need to hear this guy play.

Having said that, this could be much better. It is most egregious that you could NOT HAVE Jeff Beck on a guitar dvd, yet he played at the festival. Also some of the song choices were peculiar. How do Dan Tyminski, Vince Gill, and J.J Cale (mostly uninteresting performances) show up twice apiece while Buddy Guy, B.B King, and Hubert Sumlin (blues legends all) get one song each. Hell, they let Joe Walsh show up twice, and he was drunk (just look at him and you know). Furthermore, the superstar performances opening the dvd (containing Clapton, Guy, King, Cray, Sumlin and Jimmie Vaughan) are surprisinlyg devoid of life. There is no pulse to these jam sessions, and they all seem either bored or just out of time with each other. The least we could have were more solo performances for King and Guy (two of the most electrifying live blues players ever). In the case of Robert Lockwood Jr. (Robert Johnson's adopted son) and ""Honeyboy"" Edwards are given such short thrift, that they play interviews DURING THEIR PERFORMANCES! Yes history of blues is great, Vaughan, but could you let me listen for a minute!

I can't give this three stars for the compelling and intricate playing of Randalph, McLaughlin, Doyle Bramall, ZZ Top, James Taylor, and Cray. But if only for lack of more performances like these I can't give it 5 stars.",1110499200,5,2695,4.6533613445378155

Unfortunately when you live in Oz the odds of an event like this ever happening downunder are very long indeed, so I'm happy someone recorded it.

I also liked this DVD, but I can't help but think that this DVD could have been, or given the quality of the musicians performing, SHOULD have been better.

Everybody has got their own taste in music, so it's normal for one to ask questions like "" Where is E.Van Halen, Jimmy Page, Ritchie Blackmore, Al di Meola, Steve Morse, Joe Satriani, Gary Moore, Brian May, Eric Gales,Gales Bros, Walter Trout, Steve Lukather?"" as the name of the festival is ""Guitar Festival"" and these names represent the meaning of ""guitar"" for many people, notwithstanding my respect for the guitar players who took part at the festival.

We have legends like , Santana, Robert Cray, Steve Vai, Eric Johnson, John Mac Laughlin, BB King, Jeff Beck(was he there actually?) and Buddy Guy and that's wonderful, but they are covered for only one song each (Jam sessions do not count), and they definitely deserved more coverage than some of the others, such as the ones singing about what they like about Oklahoma girls, why they prefer the Oklahoma girls over the Texas girls, what the cowgirls do and the consequential results, etc...

We have great non-guitarist musicians, or should I say legends in their own field of interest like Dennis Chambers, Donald Dunn and Steve Gadd playing at the festival, which is great, but unfortunately they didn't get noteworthy spotlight (check out Dennis Chambers' solo during John mc Laughlin's set, we can see anything, including ladies with sexy outfits, but we can't see the solo of the best drummer in the world, perfect camera selection(!))

DTS AUDIO = FINEST OF 60+ DVDs

Most of the tracks are mixed so well they make the majority of other DVD concerts sound sad in comparison.

Two tracks are the best audio mix I have ever heard for this genre on a DVD:

Track 17 Disc 1 - Jingo with Carlos Santana

Track 3 Disc 2 - Josie with Larry Carlton

Again, it seems every production I own with Clapton involved has this excellence in audio.  Crossroads may even beat my long-time Clapton favorite ""One More Car, One More Rider""

VIDEO = OUTSTANDING QUALITY

Very high video resolution.  Widescreen format.  Looks as good as some of my Superbit movies.  Camera angles and video production are tasteful and appropriate (not too many fancy tricks or dizzyingly fast changes/sweeps).  Sometimes the camera is too close to enjoy the performer, just focusing on a guitar close-up...but I'm sure the guitarists watching love it.

I sincerely hope this DVD marks the beginning of a new standard for both Audio and Video.  If only every music concert DVD produced could look and sound this good!",1105747200,6,1280,4.719457013574661
2140582,4,B0002Y4T92,"What a great tribute to the guitar and its players. Not surprisingly, the set focuses on blues and rock which is fine with me. But you have to love J McClaughlin's(?)brilliance and Larry Carlton is a monster player also. I think Metheny is overrated but I still would have liked to have seen him on

this disk. Leaving out Jeff Bck is a huge mistake. Mayer is OK, but cut him and incluce Beck. The Vai, with Sheehan on bass,  thing is a helluva lot of fun. Its fun to watch the shredders. He has very fast fingres but plays with emotion to boot.

To P Dummy(Duffy), Billy Gibbons is probably the most underrated player in the whole genre. If you cannot recognize  that you have your ears up your posterior or you havn't really

listend to that ""Little 'ol Band from Texas."" Listen to the

ZZ Top sixpack which focuses on all their great 70's stuff.

There a lot of guys that could have been on this disk. I wonder if Warren Haynes was invited?

Eric Johnson is awesome. Go see him live. Incredible.

I'm a huge Buddy Guy fan. I love Clapton and all those guys, but to me Buddy is just the S**T. I've seen him 6 or 7 times

here in Atlanta, over the last ten years and man he smokes. If you haven't seen Buddy live, do it! Watch Sweet Home Chicago. Buddy is toying with those guys. They are all under his thumb. To me , he is the greates bluesman alive today(with huge respect for BB King...different styles).

My 2nd disk also had the same problem the earlier reviewer had. The last four songs were not there. When I tried to get to

them the disk went to Santana and Bramhall performances

from the first disk.

I went to Best Buy and swapped it. The new one is OK.

I have listened to the two DVD's approx. four times now and can honestly say there is not one performance that I didn't enjoy.

These guys can truly play.

I was going to list my favourites but it seems pointless as they are all just too compelling.

2140584,5,B0002Y4T92,"What can I say?  Clapton fan or not, this 2 dvd set is an awesome addition to one's musical collection.  Over three hours of music which still doesn't cover all of the greatness of the Festival, yet it's easily a classic dvd.  Eric, Jonny Lang, Jimmie Vaughan, Buddy Guy, B.B. King, Dan Tyminski, Doyle Bramhall II, ZZ Top, Larry Carlton, etc.  There is such a vast span of the musical forum with these artists.  Different styles, different ages, different tones, etc.

Some of the highlights for me.

First, of course, Eric.  Cocaine is rockin'.  I Shot The Sheriff shows why it's such a highlight through the years, but even more so this last tour.  If I Had Possession Over Judgement Day is a just a steamroller of the blues, and Have You Ever Loved A Woman is beautiful as always.

Then of course there is the blues jams.  Eric, Buddy Guy, Robert Cray, and Jimmie Vaughan onstage together.  It's something to see them just having fun and is one of the showstoppers of the whole event.  Then Hubert Sumlin joins for a song, and later B.B. King is thrown into the mix as well.  This jam session basically allows for Buddy to really show off his style on Sweet Home Chicago.  And to see Buddy urging Eric on during his solo until Eric just points and him and laughs.  Classic.

Rock Me Baby let's us all see that B.B. King hasn't lost any showmanship even if he does approach his music from a different direction than he did 40 years ago.

Jonny Lang has one song on this dvd, and it's from his latest album, Long Time Coming.  The song, Give Me Up Again, is one of my favorites from the new album, so it's nice to see it live.  Jonny is one who is the future when it comes to guitar.  He's amazing for his age, and he's been just about that good since he was a teenager.  I love his expression and passion when playing.  And hopefully when you see him, if you don't know much, you'll be tempted to find out more.  Maybe he'll be one of your favorite guitarists as he is one of mine.

Doyle Bramhall II has one song on this dvd as well with Green Light Girl.  He gives a great performance, and you can see Eric really enjoying the song over to the side of the stage.  Why wouldn't he?  Doyle is fantastic!

It was good to see Santana for one song which brought out Clapton again.  You can tell they really enjoy playing together, and the song rocked the house.

J.J. Cale gave two nice performances with After Midnight and Call Me The Breeze.  Clapton played guitar on both songs, and right before After Midnight Cale tried to get Eric to sing.  You can see Eric shaking his head and saying no.  I guess that goes back to him enjoying being the sideman for a bit of time.

One person I discovered while watching this dvd was Dan Tyminski.  I had heard his music before with I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow, but I guess I never paid a lot of attention.  Naturally, being at the show, he's a good guitarist, but I loved everything about the song including the guitar work.  He also did a song called Road To Nash Vegas which isn't too bad.

ZZ Top were very good, but I thought for an ending it could have been better.  At least feature one different ZZ Top song over the very well known Tush and La Grange.  Speaking of ZZ Top it's too bad the final night's pending storm stopped their stage time with Eric.  That would have been killer to end the dvd I'm sure.

It goes on and on -- Rocky Mountain Way - Joe Walsh, Neighborhood - David Hidalgo, Josie - Larry Carlton, Steamroller - James Taylor w/ Joe Walsh, etc.  It could have kept going such as Eric and Jeff Beck doing Cause We've Ended As Lovers which was omitted along with other performances.  All in all a dvd well worth the money.  Besides the performances their is artist interviews, photo gallery, and you can access solos of the songs.

And before I forget I should mention there is a hidden song on this dvd.  Go to the extras section on disc 2, press the left button so nothing is highlighted on the menu, then press enter.  Now, sit back, and enjoy LAYLA!!",1104969600,30,4020,4.30173564753004
2140585,4,B0002Y4T92,"I went out and bought this DVD after first seeing 2 hours of selected material from it on PBS's ""Great Performances"". While the pros out-weigh the cons, there were some short-comings, mostly in the form of the absence of great material by the guitarists on the DVD and the guitarists not featured on the DVD (Jeff Beck comes quickly to mind).

Pros:

As a guitarist who appreciates many different styles of music, I found something, if not in many cases everything, to love about the spirited playing of some of the greatest living guitarists; from John McLaughlin's jazz-instrumental tribute to the late Elvin Jones, to Steve Vai's technical wizardy on the multi-guitar shred-fest ""I'm the Hell Outta Here"". Eric Clapton has not lost his touch; on the contrary, ""Slowhand""'s musical talent has just kept improving.

The sound and video quality of the DVD is phenomenal. You can see and hear all of the playing in all it's crystal-clear glory.

Cons:

On the DVD, the first performance is Eric Clapton giving a spirited rendition of his classic, J.J. Cale-penned hit ""Cocaine"", but the opening performance on the TV presentation I first saw, which is not featured on the DVD at all, is Clapton performing what might be the greatest rock song ever recorded: ""Layla"". Words can't describe how let down I was when I got the DVD home and found that it wasn't there. The version of ""Layla"" he gave was what really made the concert presentation for me. The main, rock and roll part of it (the first three minutes), were, to me anyway, better than the original studio version off the album ""Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs"". The latter half of the song, (the 4 minute piano, acoustic and slide guitar instrumental) was not quite up to par with the original version, which was truly beautiful, but was still amazing. Doyle Brahmall the 2nd (Eric's rhythm player for the set) does the late, great, legendary master Duane Allman proud on the solo and slide parts. Nobody can ever be as great a slide player as Duane, but here Brahmall does him even better justice than Duane's current replacement in the Allman Brothers Band, Derek Trucks (who is also an exceptional musician).

My final verdict:

This DVD is an amazing chronicle of a historic concert festival that perhaps, in 30 years time, will be mentioned in the same breath as Woodstock (or will at least be more revered than Live Aid), but I sincerely hope that the rest of the festival will be released in new DVD installments in the very near future (especially the live version of ""Layla"").",1104969600,3,2545,4.7704545454545455
2140586,3,B0002Y4T92,"High Points:

""Sweet Home Chicago"" with Buddy Guy (!),

""Constant Sorrow"" with Tyminski and R. Block,

""Oklahoma Borderline"" with V. Gill,

""Copperline"" and ""Steamroller"" with J. Taylor,

""Jingo"" Carlos Santana,

All of JJ Johnson's drumming with Doyle Bramhall.

JJ Cale cuing a Clapton solo by calling ""Hey Clapton.""- So irreverent! I love it!

John Mayer

Drawbacks:

Joe Walsh - sloppy drunk and `shTupid!""

John Mayer - yes.

And ...Clapton.

Short and sweet synopsis:

Eric Clapton appears in almost every set - ""Clapti""fying otherwise fresh and dynamic performances. A more effective format would have been to have a short Derek and the Dominoes reunion show and then have old `slohand' sit back with a margarita and enjoy the other bands without crashing their sets.

Long, Drawn-out, opinionated review:

After my own personal 30 year love affair with Rock and Blues guitar, my amazement with Clapton's fame and recognition only grows. Only in America can a fluffy Brit-Blues-wannabe so blatantly plagiarize the primal genius born exclusively of a tradition of hardship and 3rd class citizenry. How Clapton gets BB,  Buddy, and the constant host of remaining originals to keep coming back to lend their hard-won credibility to his preppie whitebread bullsh*t plastic cutout version of their magic that elevators everywhere have piped indelibly into ears too stupid and tasteless to know better - I will never know.

Let's face it... some of these guys are getting old. Perhaps they simply need the money. It's kind of sad.

The show begins with Clapton rocking powerfully with classic ""Cocaine"" - complete with a gaggle of tasty chocolate backup beauties. The audience is enamored. Follow-up numbers bring out the likes of Jimmy Vaughn. Clapton remains to host.

Hubert Sumlin - clearly playing a loner axe - appears on stage cold and dusty, but instead of laying back and letting the master heat up and kick it, Clapton (still there) simply cannot restrain himself from coming to the heroic guitar rescue and almost completely washes Sumlin off the stage.

Don't worry, it picks up... Putting Clapton in his place solidly, Buddy Guy masterfully played the audience and rose above as a clear and soaring talent. Cutting perfectly into a rapid-fire lick trade with Clapton which left the Englishman blushing and seeking the coda, Guy reminds everyone where the Blues came from.

Also holding the mojo just inches out of Clapton's shaky reach was Santana. Like a first year Spanish student accepting English directions to the bathroom in a Barcelona soccer stadium, Clapton vanely ""Sals""ified his canned, ripped-off style into Santana's churning rumba space rock. Patiently - yet at his whim, Carlos steps in and squashes Clapton's wimpy squawk with singing PRS tone. His delivery is deft and classic rock star cool.

College jock on a good acid trip? - I never realized what a great sound John Mayer has! No doubt that this guy has an awesome Hendrix vibe! I also never realized what a retard he looks like when he plays, though! Alright, I'll admit it... he's a better player than I is, but I'll make a bet with you... If you can watch this without thinking about what kind of bus this kid rode to school, you are probably not paying attention anyway. Personally, I found his presentation too cocky, overly emotive and distracting to enjoy with so many other great young players on the bill(ie Doyle Bramhall and Johnny Lang). I have to end by saying that Mayer is a Damn good player though and this DVD does a great job of showcasing his undeniable talent (don't watch though, just listen).

In a brief yet prominently staged interview sequence, Clapton states ""Nothing beats sitting around on an equal footing with 3 or 4 other musicians, and not have anyone be the boss."" - at his own show where he is walking onto everyone's stage to be the guest of honor. A bit contrived, I feel.

Disc 1 is certainly very entertaining. And as much of lout as he is, Clapton is at least decent enough to have arranged the event and not completely sack everyone's performance. I just can't get past the narcissism though. Why can he not just sit there in a box seat like the royalty that he really thinks he is and just allow the talent to perform their sets unencumbered? No... he absolutely has to play! -As if he started the underground railroad by himself. Doesn't he ever get tired of hearing himself play? I guess that I do.

It's a 2 DVD set. I will add comments for Disc 2 later.

Hope that BB didn't scratch Clapton's Rover on the way to the car wash.",1104796800,5,4557,4.831402831402832
2140597,5,B0002Y4T92,"This is a remarkable set of DVD's, for sure!  Any show sponsored by the World's preeminent guitarist, Eric Clapton, is sure to be excellent!  But, this show had unrealistic expectations of being entirely presented on this two-pack DVD set, I think.  There were just too many quality artists involved to permit each of them to be adequately accomandated on this set.  I believe that there will be much more yet to be seen! The ""plum"" of the festival was certainly the one song that Jeff Beck performed with Clapton, and it was mysteriously deleted from this set dramatically just days before it went into production, (if the media is to be believed).  A second set featuring this performance, along with a good helping of Buddy Guy's set, is certainly yet to come!  Actually, there is enough of the best stuff omitted in this set to allow for a second ""Crossroads"" release to be the better of the two!!

  I think that Clapton did a good job in all his participation, (at least in what is on these two DVD's), with the one exception of not giving more time to Vince Gill.  Gill is the best guitarist in country music, and I had hoped that he would have been able to really exhibit his playing skills at this guitar-oriented event.  Usually, he has to focus on his vocals, that is what made him such a huge figure in his genre, but at the expense of his playing time on stage.  His guitar-work is incredible, when he has time to display it.  I had even thought he might have played some more rock-oriented selections, just to show what he can do!

  The single best song presented on this set is the one solo number by Robert Cray.  It really stands out among the selections on the second DVD.  ZZ Top was a good choice to end the DVD, but they butcher the lyrics, though the two songs were well chosen.  Where were Tommy Shaw, & Styx?  I heard they were awesome at this festival!  The young guys were able to reach a different audience, I think.  I was particularly impressed by Jonny Lang, who sings as well as he plays.  Vai's performance was well-planned, and Mayer was an interesting addition.  But, what was James Taylor doing there?

Cale, who's songs I've always enjoyed but whom I've never actually seen or heard perform before -- seeing him do After Midnight and Call Me The Breeze with Clapton was a definite treat (and I've ordered some Cale for my library!). The other artist that knocked me out was Robert Randolph -- I knew nothing about him, and the way he plays the particular guita he does is excellent. Doyle Bramhall 2nd is also intersting to listen to...

It would certainly be improved if there were more of some of them, like Buddy Guy, who's performances are always smokin' hot, or Steve Vai, or even John Mayer, who shows he can really play.  By the same token, some folks who appreared at the festival or who jammed together are absent, like Jeff Beck, and, I believe, Pat Metheny.  Anything from the aforementioned folks would be better than J.J. Cale, whose performance is so subdued its almost painful, and I personally could do without a solo performance from Robert Cray in favor of the others I mentioned.

2140604,4,B0002Y4T92,"As a fundraiser for his subatnce abuse clinic, this festival will hopefully raise a lot of money and awareness, whether you play or not. As a guitarist, what is assembled here is simply a master class of some of the greatest living guitarists (well, ZZ Top excluded) extremely well photographed and often quite intelligently commenting on what it is about their craft that compels them to play.

And it is a GREAT show. The sound is terrific in 5.1, and the pace is brilliantly executed. The intersecting of various parts of the festival in a non-linear mode enhances the interest visually and musically. The different stages, the times of day, the sizes of the audiences, all change enough that you have a more compelling document, and it is not so cliched in building to an inevitable conclusion.

Through out the film, Clapton is positively sublime, whether as sideman in support, or taking the lead. It is not a film about him, though, and it is a credit to his integrity that he keeps the focus on the diversity. You're not likely to appreciate each and every artist, but that's what makes the film so great.

2140623,5,B0002Y4T92,DVD is great yet would very much like to have a CD.  Is there any news of it coming out on CD???,1101859200,,96,3.3636363636363638
2140624,3,B0002Y4T92,"I do like this DVD.  The sound quality is very good as is the overall production.  But I've heard the full concert, which is over 10 hours, and these discs squeeze out only 3 1/2 hours of it.  And don't tell me they couldn't fit on any more - the Led Zeppelin 2DVD set has 5 1/2 hours of music!  So what do we miss here? - well, Clapton starts with 4 or 5 Robert Johnson songs (not surprising, given his latest album) but the DVD has just one.  ZZ Top give a great closing one hour set, but we get just 2 songs here (good ones though) etc etc.  Highlights of the DVD include: Eric playing in shorts and sandals, JJ Cale with Eric (superb), Buddy Guy (all too little), Hubert Sumlin, BB King, ZZ Top - and John Mayer turns out some very nice blues licks.  I would have liked to see much more of these artists - which space and taste justified - but the proceeds to charity would have remained the same so we get de minimus.",1101859200,9,922,4.060773480662983
2140625,5,B0002Y4T92,"I too was at the Sunday show in Dallas. I agree with others that Jeff Beck was brilliant. His one song set was flawless and wowed the crowd - he got a huge ovation. It is a terrible shame that he did not make the disc. But, I would encourage perople to buy the set - there is a lot there to love. Thanks to Eric! -  BTW, Eric was a gracious host to the other players as always. He is always willing to help others sound at their best and not get in the way.",1101513600,7,457,3.7604166666666665
2140626,5,B0002Y4T92,"This DVD is by far the most stunning electric guitar show ever. Sure people can find shortcomings and I live in Australia so I wasn't there. But this DVD is a magnificent experience. Eric is back in fine form after his supressed mix in the John Mayall 70th Birthday concert. His ""Blues In C"" is his best playing in years, he is inspired as would any guitarist be after this show. I bought two copies because I knew it would be great.

Highlights:  All blues songs-especially Hubert Sumlin. Plays as he did with Howlin Wolf-same style.

  Buddy Guy is his best in years also. He is 70

  B.B. is superb- He is 80

  Robert Cray- ""Time Make Two"" is perhaps the best perfromance on the DVD.

  Eric Johnson-Plays a great pop-style song with a Jimi Hendrix set up.

  Booker T and the MGs with David Hildago and Joe Walsh is a highlight. Walsh acts as drugged out as ever, but his blues licks a la Albert King's ""Drowing On Dry Land"" are cool.

  John McLaughlin is great. His tribute to Jazz drummer Elvin Jones who just died this year is moving and he uses just himself and two drummers; one western and one eastern (tabla) as accompaniment. Fantastic!

  Eric Clapton's various collaborations are all superb. He plays well with Doyle Bramhall II, whose father played with Stevie Ray and others is great and Doyle plays Albert King style, left-handed and upside down! And plays a good chord backing, too!

  This is well produced, good sound, good photography except all the crowd shots are young women enjoying the event!! And a great selection of tunes. Jeff Beck should have been included as should have Otis Rush, Mick Taylor and maybe Peter Green, but get this, it is great!!!!",1101340800,8,1680,4.572390572390573

2140638,4,B0002Y4T92,"I absoulutely loved this festival.  It was one of, if not, the best guitar playing footage I have seen on a DVD.  It had Steve Vai, Eric Johnson, Clapton, King, ZZ Top, BUDDY GUY, JIMMIE VAUGHAN, and others, but missed one important player that deserved to be on the DVD:  Jeff Beck.  I was disappointed when I bought the DVD and realized he wasn't on there.  It had John Mayer (who did great) and Johnny Lang (who could have had a better song on the film), but did not have Jeff Beck!?  I couldn't believe it!  That's why I only gave the disc 4/5 stars because I feel like it could have been better.  Maybe they will come out with another disc or something (probably not, but I can hope).  If you want to see good guitar playing, BUY this DVD.  If you want to see Jeff Beck...then go see him in concert.",1100995200,11,804,4.196078431372549

The scope and breath of whats here covers every era of  blues, mixed with a bit of rock and some country. Thats Just DVD Disc 1. The second disc gets into some more interesting fringe music like John McLaughin, Rag Bihag, Steve Vai, and Eric Johnson. Then it continues on the rock theme with Joe Walsh, more Clapton and a smattering of Robert Cray and ZZ Top. The sound is top notch, every note, vocal and seperation of musicians is perfect. This is a top quality production, every DVD show should sound like it. The interviews are interesting also, along with a nice photo gallery. I could not recommend this disc more, to anyone who enjoys blues rock or music in general. BUY IT NOW! You won't be disappointed.

I have high respect for Eric Clapton but I hope he could provide an explanation on the ommision of other respectable worthy artist. Another thing a lot of people would agree that Steve Vai must play more part as he was a scene stealer and a high octane guitar player as everybody was mezmerised by his performance with his awesome band. Nevertheless as Eric Clapton stated that he was in heaven the whole weekend so what are you waiting for, grab and get a hold of this Dvd.",1100563200,2,655,4.290322580645161
2140643,5,B0002Y4T92,"An amazing display of musicality and eagerness to help, you can feel the good vibe in this DVD set that captures the best of the performances from the guitar players that, for 3 days, rocked Texas.

With the benefit of his Crossroads centre in mind, EC and his tour manager organized this festival and got the help of the best guitar players around, including names like BB King, Robert Cray, Steve Vai, Jonny Lang, Buddy Guy, Hubert Sumlin, Robert Lockwood Jr, Eric Johnson, Joe Walsh and many, many more.

I don't have to say that the music is great, and although the selection of songs may not be the most popular (no Layla, no Cliffs of Dover, no The Thrill is gone) it is indeed a very fine sample of the 3 nights of music.

The dvd's themselves (yes, this is a 2 disc edition) are of the top quality. The concert audio comes in 5.1 and Dolby Stereo, and Video is crisp and colorful, and presented in letterbox format, wich gives an elegant touch to it (Same you can see in One More Car dvd, from Clapton's 2001 tour) and also has a multiangle feature included.

Interviews are abound and very funny, and add to the whole intimate experience, since you can feel you are actually in the concert. Camera direction is wise and to the point.

Animated menus are the cherry on top, and visual design is very neat. Dvd comes in transparent keep case with display cardboard case.

In all, a must have for fans of the blues and rock guitar, and sales from the DVD benefit Crossroads centre for substance abuse, so what are you waiting for, help EC and enjoy his music.",1100563200,7,1565,4.435540069686411
2140644,5,B0002Y4T92,"This DVD set attempts to capture a once-in-a-lifetime experience. I was at the Crossroads Festival both days that there were performances. Sure, there are parts I would like to see on the DVD that were cut, but obviously they could not put TWO DAYS of music on two DVDs. As some of the other reviews indicated, I too would love to see a volume 3 and 4, but highly doubt that will happen.

It was a grand event for a grand cause and I would not have missed it for anything. I equate some of the complaints about the DVD set (yea, the sound could be a little better, but it is still VERY GOOD quality) to some of the whining I heard while walking back to my car at the Cottonbowl that Sunday night. People had seen hour after hour after hour of amazing music performances by the top guitarists in the world and were actually whining and cursing about the ""finale"" being cut. I don't blame the promoters, the weather was looking quite bad. At the end of the day, you had gotten many times your money's worth and then some.

The DVD set is but a small snapshot of a really fantastic music event. That is all. It is like the photo you take on vacation. It is but a small window, a reminder, of a really nice event that took place and I was truly glad to be there to see it.

Good DVD. I was ready to buy it the second that I read that there was to be a DVD released. If you were there, the DVD is a great reminder. If you were not there, the DVD will make you wish that you had been.",1100563200,135,1478,4.054794520547945
2140645,3,B0002Y4T92,"G.Bohn got it right with his review.  Very dissapointed with the song selection.  Many songs were left out of the Saturday night blues spectacular.  Every song gave me chills that night.  Robert Randolph was absolutely amazing on a couple of songs that were left out.  Jeff Beck's performce was one of the best Sunday night.  You could hear a pin drop throughout the song.  Simply amazing and yet it was left out.  Two songs by Vince Gill and only one by Santana.  And this was a guitar festival?  Needleass to say, this DVD set could have been significantly better.  I only hope the rest of the material is released soon.",1100476800,2,622,4.5636363636363635
2140646,4,B0002Y4T92,"I was also fortunate enough to be at this concert in person on Sunday, the final day.  There were three songs that day that totally blew me, and ALL of them were omitted from this DVD:

1) The opening National Anthem, with Neal Schon on lead guitar and the popular Randy Jackson on bass... my guess is that this was omitted because there was a time at the end of the song when something happened to the mikes or the drum set, and they only played the cymbals for about 5 minutes, but that came at the very end of the anthem, so it could have easily been faded out

2) Jeff Beck... he only played ONE song in this concert (Cause We Ended As Lovers) because they were running short on time and the rain was approaching, but it was definitely one of the best songs of the entire event.

3) BB King / Buddy Guy / John Mayer / Eric Clapton combo.  I think they could put out a whole DVD for just the one hour BB King set.  When BB was trading licks with Buddy Guy, Mayer and Clapton (with Vaughn butting in here and there), that was possibly the best concert experience of my lifetime. Every few minutes, another guitar superstar would pull up a folding chair and start cranking.  Sure, there were a lot of screw ups during the set, but the free-form trading of licks between these huge guitar legends should not have been left off. One BB King song... but two from Vince Gill and JJ Cale? What were they thinking???

Anyway, other than that, I am EXTREMELY impressed with both the audio and video quality of this DVD. I just hope they put out a DISK 3 sometime with the rest of the good songs.",1100304000,33,1589,4.221122112211221

2140659,4,B0002Y4T92,"Being a long time Clapton fan, especially his live DVDs, attracted me to this release. I have found over the years that I have tended to like the music that the musicians I like like, so this seemed a natural.  The concert was to raise money for his Crossroads rehab center in Antigua and showcase a number of the guitar players he would like to listen to. You have an eclectic mix of guitar artists playing Blues, Country, Rock & Roll, Gospel, Folk, Jazz and Indian. The performers ranged in age from 20 to 80+, so not only do you get a number of types of guitar music, but a number of generations playing their brand. Great event, very good quality video, good sound (haven't figured out why they offer 5.1, certainly didn't take advantage of it) great music.  You are bound to enjoy most of performers on the two DVDs. There are many songs that have all-star backup performers, so look and listen closely. I gave this a 4* overall, but give it a 5* for the performers I liked. Good opportunity to broaden my tastes.",1099958400,,1018,4.438502673796791

Also, not mentioned, but great to see was Steve Cropper & Duck Dunn backing up a couple of the acts.  I hope Eric makes this an event possibly yearly if not occasional.

2140666,5,B0002Y4T92,"I was lucky to attend the festival in Dallas this summer.  While the songs selected for the DVD aren't always the ones I would have picked (Buddy Guy blew everyone else away, but he is conspicuously absent except for the ensemble numbers), this is nontheless sure to be a great DVD.  Clapton was brilliant as usual, Santana was fantastic and ZZ Top were their usual eccentric selves.

John Mayer, Jonny Lang and Robert Randolph were all excellent newcomers in the mostly over-50 lineup.  Jimmie Vaughan and his Tilt-a-whirl band served as a fantastic houseband, backing up the many blues legends on hand.

Some disappointing omissions ... Robert Randolph's ""I Need More Love"" ,a surprising show-stealer on the second day of the festival is not listed.  Same with John Mayer's ""Come Back To Bed"".  Styx put on a surprisingly good set of cover tunes, from the Beatles' ""I Am The Walrus"" to BB King's ""The Thrill Is Gone"".  Also, Eric Clapton's set on the third day included a nice selection of songs from his new album of Robert Johnson covers that are omitted here.

That said, I still pre-ordered my copy as soon as I saw it announced.  They could have made it a four disc set with more material and doubled the price and I still would have bought it.",1098489600,206,1251,4.6454545454545455
