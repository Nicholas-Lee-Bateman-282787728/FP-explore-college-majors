8330056,5,B001OB3R2W,I think I will be able to do it.,1446076800,,32,2.6666666666666665
8330057,4,B001OB3R2W,"Love Kathy Smith. It's a little fast to pick up the moves if you've never danced, and I haven't. Not sure when I,d every be good enough to pull any of these moves on a dance floor!",1443657600,,180,3.891891891891892
8330058,4,B001OB3R2W,"I love the belly dance CD.  I find too many others blast through the belly dance instructions and I have no idea how they made their bodies move like that.  Not only are the instructions slow enough to understand, but you also get a workout too.
The Latin workout is just okay.  I agree with another reviewer that said the camera angles are bad.  This portion is unlike the belly dance - Kathy blows through any instructions at all so you are forced to follow their movements.  It really is not that difficult, but with horrendous camera angles, it is a challenge.  In the end, I did end up with a sweat (and so did Kathy, as evidenced by the armpit stains in the cool-down!)
5 stars for the belly dance, 3 stars for the Latin, overall 4 stars!!",1303862400,,745,4.323741007194244
8330059,3,B001OB3R2W,"As another reviewer already said, the Flex appeal was great. I felt that it gave a good introduction and workout.  I also found that it really helped my back which has hurt since we moved, probably because it works your front and back and stretches everything out.
Latin rhythms really was lacking.  Half the time I couldn't tell exactly what they were doing because of the lighting and their clothes.  There are much better Latin dance videos out there.",1259625600,2,454,4.7215189873417724
8330060,2,B001OB3R2W,"I am giving this 2 stars because I love one of the workouts, which I already own, and the other workout I didn't care for when I bought it once before & promptly sold it. This is disappointing that this DVD contains 2 previously released titles. The bellydance workout was originally released as Flex Appeal, and also was re-released after that with a different cover. This is it's 3rd incarnation. The bellydance workout is actually very good. Ansuya, a very well known & wonderful bellydancer, helped in the creation of the workout. For someone new to bellydance this is doable & made into a workout that flows very nicely so you do feel like you're dancing. For an intermediate to advanced student, or for an experienced dancer, this is a nice way to drill some basics & get a decent workout. The music is really very good.
The other workout that comes with this was originally released as the Latin Rhythm workout. It has had 2 or 3 incarnations since then, and now has been re-released here. I do not care for this one. I find it way too repetetive, the music isn't very good, the camera angles are odd sometimes, and it just isn't much fun. I also think the set was too busy with the large crowd they had as background exercisers. Ugh.
If you do not yet own Flex Appeal I'd say this might be a good choice, but then again you can get that workout new or used right here on Amazon for less than this title here.
All in all this is a disappointing, yet unsurprising, workout DVD. Kathy Smith's DVDs seem to be among those that don't just get re-released, but they get 3 or 4 or more re-releases, and even with different titles. If you don't keep up on these titles you could easily wind up buying the same workout multiple times. Such a shame.",1240704000,18,1747,4.428571428571429
8330061,4,B001OB3R2W,I was disappointed to learn this dvd set is a carbon copy of two separate dvds I purchased recently at amazon. Kathy Smith belly dancing and Kathy Smith Salsa aerobics.  I will be more careful and read the description more thoroughly next time.  Other amazon customers be careful not to buy the same dvd on a different dvd cover. I am sending the dvd back since I already have it on other dvds.,1236038400,27,394,4.383561643835616
