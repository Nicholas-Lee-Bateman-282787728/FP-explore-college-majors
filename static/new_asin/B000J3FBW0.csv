2666686,5,B000J3FBW0,Well im a big fan of fmp and this was just icing on the cake after fmp ended I felt left hangin with sasuke and kaname and this gave a little more of what I wanted that I didn't get through the first 24 episodes of FMP so this is a must have if your collecting the fmp series. There isn't a dull moment in this collection so I recommend it to whomever is interested in the series itself.,1173571200,,387,3.911392405063291
2666687,5,B000J3FBW0,"Laugh out loud hilarious! It doesn't have the action of the first season of Full Metal Panic, but Fumoffu makes up for it in the funny and crazy antics of everyone's favorite war crazed sergeant Sousuke Sagara and Kaname Chidori. With Sousuke misunderstanding everything from haunted hospitals to flirting, the laughs are non stop.",1172016000,,331,5.148148148148148
2666688,5,B000J3FBW0,"This Anime series has laughter, action and a little romance. I love it !",1171238400,,72,4.214285714285714
2666689,4,B000J3FBW0,"Full Metal Panic: Fumoffu is sort of a spin-off of the original series Full Metal Panic.  I've never seen the original series, but I have a good idea of what it's about from friends.  You don't need to know a lot about the original series in order to enjoy Fumoffu because the hilarious situations in these episodes are funny in and of themselves, but having a bit of background does help.  Basically, Sousuke Sagara is a teenager who has been raised by various military groups and is currently working for a secret mercenary organization dedicated to fighting terrorism and protecting a special group of people called Whispereds, who have special mental abilities.  Sousuke has been assigned to protect one of these Whispereds, Kaname Chidori, because they are the same age and he can attend her high school.  However, because of Sousuke's weird upbringing, he knows a lot about weaponry and nothing about normal civilian life, leading to  many misunderstandings and bizarre situations.  In the original series, these humorous situations alternated with battles against terrorist forces.  In Fumoffu, the terrorists and other more serious stuff has been put aside to focus on the humourous parts and the characters' growing fondness for each other.  One of the things that I like best is that these weird situations actually have consequences for the characters because the people they meet often appear in more than one episode, forcing them deal with situations they helped to create and people who know just how odd Sousuke's actions are.  I highly recommend the series, although viewers should be aware that a couple of the episodes contain a fair amount of nudity (this is not a series that I would show to any young kids).  Most of the episodes are really two short episodes put together, and there is only one two-part episode.  Here is a list:

1. The Man from the South / A Hostage with No Compromises

The Man from the South:  Sousuke blows up his own locker because he believes someone put a bomb in it.  As Sousuke and Kaname study the remains of the letter found in the locker, they each form different conclusions about the writer.  Can Kaname convince Sousuke that the writer is professing her love, not threatening to kill him?

A Hostage with No Compromises:  Sousuke angers some local bullies, and they are now out for revenge.  They kidnap Kaname and use her as a hostage.  Fortunately, Sousuke has a plan to resolve the situation peacefully.  Unfortunately, ""peaceful"" can be a relative term.

2. Hostility Passing By / A Fruitless Lunchtime

Hostility Passing By:  After Sousuke takes Kaname's advice on dealing with lunchtime crowds to a new extreme and accidently causes a panicky stampede of students which destroys the food-seller's booth, the student council temporarily takes over the job of selling lunches.  However, an angry teacher is determined to teach the students, especially Sousuke, a lesson.

A Fruitless Lunchtime:  Kaname helpfully lends Sousuke her notes to help him with a difficult assignment.  But when Sousuke forgets Kaname's papers at his apartment, the two of them begin a frantic mission to retrieve them before the beginning of class.

3. Summer Illusion of Steel:  While on a trip to the beach with their friends, Kaname becomes irritated with Sousuke and stalks away to pout.  She ends up accepting an invitation from a stranger to visit his house for tea, trying to avoid letting Sousuke find out where she is.

4. The Hamburger Hill of Art / Single-minded Stakeout!

The Hamburger Hill of Art:  Kaname's art class takes a field trip in order to sketch people in a natural setting.  Kaname's group makes the mistake of choosing Sousuke as their model, and Sousuke makes the mistake of asking their overzealous art teacher what a model does.  After listening to the teacher rattle on about the duties of a model in rather confusing metaphorical terms, Sousuke becomes convinced that part of his job is to hide from the people who are supposed to be drawing him.

Single-minded Stakeout!:  Kaname meets up with an old boyfriend and arranges to meet him for a date.  As she tries to decide whether or not she still has feelings for him, Sousuke becomes worried about her preoccupied state of mind and follows her to learn more about her situation.  This leads to one of the funniest scenes in the series and an explanation of what the word ""fumoffu"" comes from and why the mascot of the series is a teddy bear wearing a hat.

5. The Pure Yet Impure Grappler / Trespassing on Good Faith

The Pure Yet Impure Grappler: The student council sends Sousuke and Kaname to tell the school's amateur karate club that their clubhouse has been condemned and needs to be torn down.  However, the club refuses to leave until Sousuke beats them in single combat.  Trespassing on Good Faith: When their rivalry between Sousuke and the karate club's captain causes them to injure the school's janitor, the president of the student council convinces them to resolve their differences with a contest to see which of them can do the most good deeds for the janitor.

6. The Hard Sell Fetish / The Patient of Darkness

The Hard Sell Festish: When Kaname's friend, Kyoko, is attacked by a strange man who forcibly gives girls pony tails (no, really), Kaname gets recruited by a slightly derranged police officer to act as a decoy in order to capture the fiend.

The Patient of Darkness:  After an evening of telling scary stories, Kaname and her friends are frustrated because none of them scares Sousuke in the least.  Determined to find something that frightens Sousuke, Kaname convinces him to come with her to an abandoned hospital that has a reputation for being haunted.

7. The Warcry of Excessiveness: The school's principal is threatening to disband the rugby club unless they can actually win a game.  The trouble is that the rugby players are a bunch of softies.  It's up to Sousuke to toughen them up.

8. A Goddess Comes to Japan: Part 1 -- The Suffering:  Sousuke's commanding officer, Tessa, who is also a teenager and one of the Whispereds, has a chance to take some leave and decides to spend it with Sousuke.  Tessa has a serious crush on him, which leads to a fierce rivalry between her and Kaname with Sousuke caught between the two feuding girls.

9. A Goddess Comes to Japan: Part 2 -- The Hot Spring:  As Tessa's vacation comes to an end, Sousuke's womanizing colleague, Kurz, convinces the group to spend a weekend at a hot spring.  Kurz recruits a couple of male students to help him spy on the girls, but he fails to reckon with Sousuke's determination to protect the women in his charge.

10. A Fancy Without Honor or Humanity: Kaname and Sousuke discover that a friend, Ren, is actually the daughter of a gangster.  She is troubled because her father is sick and his gang is being terrorized by a rival gang.  The gang hires Sousuke (in disguise) to train them to better defend themselves and their territory.

11. Uncontrollable Bluebird: Kaname's school has a problem finding room for all of its clubs.  When the social science club (both members) graciously agrees to give up its room, they use the opportunity to convince the other clubs to partipate in a flirting contest so that they can study what qualities other people find the most attractive, saying that the club which attracts the most people will receive the room.  The contest takes on an entirely new dimension when Sousuke joins in to help the photography club.

12. 5th Period Hot Spot:  When Sousuke's weapons dealer sends him a biological weapon by mistake, a classmate accidently releases it at school.  Panic sets in when everyone believes that they are going to die.  What, if anything, can Sousuke do to save them?  Moreover, who is going to save Sousuke from his classmates' wrath?",1171238400,10,7814,4.823308270676692
2666690,5,B000J3FBW0,"This is one of my favorite anime series of all time.  I've had this collection for about a month and not only have I watched it repeatedly, but I've shown it to all of my friends and now they all want it!  This thinpack boxset is a great value over buying the series individually.

One note: This has all 12 episodes of Fumoffu on 3 discs, while the separate DVDs have 12 episodes on 4 discs.  (When I saw a fourth disc for sale I got worried that I was missing something.)

I watched all of the Fumuffo eopisodes before watching the complete original Full Metal Panic and still thoroughly ejoyed them.  There isn't much carry-over between them, although the characters are the same. I love Sosuke's deadpan comic lines.  My favorite episode is the ""Patient of Darkness,"" where Kaname tries to get a rise out Sosuke in a haunted hospital.

A must have for your anime collection!",1170720000,8,878,4.512658227848101
2666691,5,B000J3FBW0,"This is a must have the price is not bad and you willl laugh from start to finish, but you should see the first full metal panic if you haven't already because you will understand it better. The first one is half comedy and half action this one is like 80% comedy and 20% action.",1169510400,3,279,4.090909090909091
2666692,5,B000J3FBW0,I found Fumoffu to be light and very humorous. It certainly kept me laughing. My son watched video with me and enjoyed it to no end. I would highly recommend same to anyone who enjoys comedy and a good laugh and light feeling at the end Great video.,1169164800,2,249,4.208333333333333
2666693,5,B000J3FBW0,"I stumbled across FUMOFFU on the internet and was hooked after just the first couple of episodes.  It is one of the funniest and most consitently funny shows I've ever seen.  The animation quality is well above par for a television program and sometimes enters cinema quality airspace.  Some of the more annoying elements of anime are kept to a minimum (fan service and one dimentional subservient women, etc.) while retaining some of the best elements (nice artwork, excellent music, fresh storytelling style, etc.)

While the English voice track is unusually well done on FUMOFFU, especially the male characters, the female leads still sound a little bit too cutesy and defy the nature of their characters.  The female voices are decidedly better on the Japanese track.  If you can handle reading the subtitles the Japanese track has a bit more comic punch.

I'm a very harsh critic of television and movies so when I say that this is an excellent comedy for even non-fans of anime, I mean it.  If you watch it I think you'll get hooked too.",1168819200,,1043,4.787709497206704
2666694,4,B000J3FBW0,"To begin, I have the original series Full Metal Panic! and this series only focuses Sosuke Sagara and Kaname Chidori (mainly)and how Sosuke always seems to blow things way out of proportion. Like when Sosuke blows up his shoe locker with C-4 (where does he get this stuff? I am in the military and i can say that about half-if-not-all the stuff he uses is almost impossible to get via mail) because he found a ""letter""-which is a love letter, no less-because he thought someone was trying to kill him. and the laughs don't stop there. And even though you don't need to watch this to understand  Full Metal Panic!: The Second Raid, its a nice little break from the series in which the roles of Kaname Chidori (who acts as a protector) while Sosuke Sagara (who always seems to start things)get reversed! In short, get the series if you want a break from the series",1168214400,3,862,4.5256410256410255
2666695,5,B000J3FBW0,"I personally enjoy the school comedy aspect of FMP more than the mech/battle part so Fumoffu was a blessing. Gut busting comedy in every episode, a couple episodes later on get a bit too fanservice-oriented for what I wanted from this series, but it doesnt detract too much, and in one episode in particular, the hotsprings, is crucial to some of the bigger laughs.",1233792000,,365,4.71875
2666696,5,B000J3FBW0,"My friends and I, all over 30 (age), really loved this anime.  There are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments in all episodes.  We are somewhat picky and mostly watch anime comedies, and this is still one of our all-time favourites!  The other FMP series, on the other hand, are really dull by comparison.  (And yes, I realise that they are no comedies and yes, I *do* enjoy other genres besides comedy!) So, if you love anime comedies, get this one, don't waste your money on the other two Full Metal Panic series!",1231718400,,511,4.582417582417582
2666697,5,B000J3FBW0,For all you be known. This series is a parody to hold fans off while the continuation to the first season was finished (i.e. FMP: The Second Raid). On that note this series was a great little distraction while waiting for the second season to release! Full of laughs and fan service (not extreme though). If your a fan or the series BUY IT! Even if not a fan u might actually like this it's along the lines of Excel Saga but u can follow the story not just off the wall antics.,1223424000,,477,4.139784946236559
2666698,5,B000J3FBW0,"This is a must-buy for anyone who saw any of the other FMP series. Even if you haven't, I guarantee you'll enjoy this one.

I liked the originals too, which were more of a mix of drama and comedy. This series is straight comedic silliness. Just fun and hilarity. Those guys definitely need a break and so do we, as fans of the series. The soundtrack is also very good; check it out.",1218067200,,382,4.232876712328767
2666699,4,B000J3FBW0,"This is a fun set of episodes based on our favorite characters from Full Metal Panic and their day-to-day antics (minus any serious drama.)  There's a lot of silly episodes and moments where you can't help but laugh out loud.

The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I wasn't drawn into episode after episode.  I'd watch one or two episodes and then not touch it again for a couple of weeks.  There's no story arc keeping the episodes connected (there is one arc that keeps 2 episodes together which happened to be my favorite episodes in the set) and each episode stands on it's own.  It's easy then to randomly watch one episode in any order and to pick up and watch this even if you've never seen FMP.  It's a lot like Family Guy or South Park in that sense and there are a lot of seriously funny moments but if you're looking for any sort of progressive development or engaging story lines, you won't find it here.

Still recommended as an entertaining set of stand alone episodes.",1216684800,,999,4.426229508196721

2666702,5,B000J3FBW0,"I love this series!

Although it is a sequel to ""Full Metal Panic"" you CAN watch it is a stand alone. It is short, hilarious, and I highly recommend it!",1203120000,,152,4.066666666666666
2666703,4,B000J3FBW0,"Full Metal Panic: Fumoffu is not a true sequel to original FMP(FMP: TSR is). If you're expecting more mech-war drama of the original FMP, you'll be disappointed. This isn't that series. It's complete comedy, and a good one at that. The upside of this diversion from the original storyline is that you DO NOT need to have watched FMP to enjoy Fumoffu. Having started my FMP experiences with Fumoffu, I can attest to this fact.

So what is Fumoffu? Simply put, 'feel good' anime. Higurashi got you disturbed? Watch a Fumoffu episode and your spirits will seem to be almost immediately lifted. Fumoffu's humor can stretch from the obviously hilarious (See: final episode) to slapstick (Chidori's violent abuses in retribution to Sousuke's unknowing antics) to the downright Japanese (the whole pony 'sex'-offender). If the last idea turns you off the series, at no time does this humor EVER become offensive (maybe a little suggestive, but nothing a 10 year old hasn't heard/seen before). The diversity of humor combines into episodes (that range between 15 and 30 min long) where only the truly stone-hearted could watch without at least cracking a smile.

Fumoffu doesn't ever take itself too seriously, and you shouldn't either. If you take it for what it is, an enjoyable and hilarious series, you may just find yourself loving it like I do. If you're expecting mech-fights or any real drama (or plot), look elsewhere.",1199318400,,1419,4.9831223628691985
2666704,4,B000J3FBW0,"This is a sequal to the previous Full Metal Panic series.  It is not as serious as the previous series.  This one is more humerous and casual.  Sousuke Sagara is a fromer Afghan child soldier that is recruited as a mercanary.  His assignment is to protect a high school student, the very beautiful and strong willed Kaname Chidori.  He is an expert soldier that was skilled and professional in the first series.  In this one he is over the top exaggerated and humorous.  The only problem is he is too inhuman.  He never shows any sign of attraction to Kaname Chidori, even though he admitted that he was scared when he thought she was badly wounded.  The series is funny, but the character Sousuke Sagara is too out of touch with his emotions.",1198281600,,743,4.526315789473684

If you are expecting tons of plot like the first FMP, DON'T buy it, you will be dissapointed j(just like that guy who gave it 1 star cus he bought it befor researching it!

2666706,5,B000J3FBW0,"Tha Full Metal Panic series is one of my favorite anime series if not one of my favorite series in general. I hate when people write negative reviews about this series just because it has nothing to do with the previous one. Fumoffu is not to be taken seriously, if u don't know that just by lookin' by the title than you are a f***in idiot cuz you should know what you're buying be4 you buy it. This is not actually part of the main series but more like an OVA dealing with Souske's and Kanami's school life. This is slapstick comedy at it's best so don't expect a deep intuitive story because that just ruins the fun of it all.

There are 12 episodes in all with 3 DVD's containg 4 episodes in a thin DVD package just like the previous box set. The price is inexpensive but I got it for 39.99 so I don't know about ya'll. There are no extras whatsoever which is somewhat of a dissapointment, the individual DVD's still barely had any extras BUT this box set is even worse than the individaul DVDs in the extras department containing absolutely NO EXTRAS, NOTHING, NADA. MY other dissapointment is the lack of episodes, they sould of added at least another DVD worth of episodes......but even so the series is hilarious and a must buy in my opinion, but I suggest you buy the first season just cuz so you can get a feel for the characters and its more funnier when you know and love the characters first before you see this.

2666707,5,B000J3FBW0,"Full Metal Panic?:FUMOFFU takes place after the events that occured in the 1st Full Metal Panic? installment. Sousuke and Kaname still go to school with each other at Jindai High, but this time, its all about the school and less about the war. The series focuses on Sousuke as he tries to fit into Kaname's lifestyle as a student, but of course 'Mr. Sagara' is clueless and takes everything out of proportion and adding his own explosives to the mix. Without a giant mech to control...what is a poor 16 year old mercenary supposed to do when he is surrounded by other teenagers?....what else other than to blow things up!

Let me go ahead and say right off the bat that it's a good idea to watch the first Full Metal Panic? set before watching this. This set has references to the first in its story so it will help in the long-run if you know what the characters are talking about. Not to mention that if your new to Full Metal Panic?, you need to watch the first installment to understand Sousuke and Kaname's backgrounds to understand why they are there in FUMOFFU.

The charatcers are just as they are in the 1st box set of Full Metal Panic, very well designed and magnificantly animated throughout the whole series. They designers made a good decision by not changing any of the characters layouts and like some other series, the same actors are there so everyone still sounds the same.

The story line I thought was hilarious! I found myself laughing non-stop throughout the series! FUMOFFU does not have any large mechs duking it out or anything like that, but there are plenty of explosions and booby traps thanks to our favorite mercenary, which just makes it that much funnier. The plot designers really went freestyle with this series by just having fun with it, which is why I think it is so funny. Good Job you guys (designers)!

The music, I am gonna bring up, was awesome! The opening and closing songs are done my Mikuni Shimokawa. This singer has an absolutely wonderful voice that could be listened to all day. This series actually made me want to find some of her other music just because she sounds that good. Good job Full Metal Panic? for another music choice success!

There really wasn't alot of, if at all, any bad points to mention. I mean there is some cussing in the series, but when dealing with gangs and still military folk, thats essential (still) to make it more natural. And with the exception of the occasional underwear shot and sexual references, its really not that bad, in my opinion just added to the hilarity.

To summarize, the series is worth getting. It's funny and all around fun for people with a sense of humor to watch. The team that worked on this still has it in them to create something thats worth a long, fun-filled laugh. I recogmend this to anyone who likes to laugh, and as with the 1st Full Metal Panic? box set, im glad to have it as part of my growing collection!",1185667200,,2922,4.535104364326376

I highly recommend this collection especially if you enjoyed the first series Full metal panic! I definitely recommend you watch all thee in order.,1272758400,,421,4.6891891891891895
8148931,5,B000J3FBW0,"I do not buy many Anime DVDs, but I really liked this particular series.  It is so good that even my wife likes it!  This is a special silly interlude between season one and two (season one is better than season two), and has no real long running plot through the set.  This is not a bad thing it means that you can just grab any of the three disks and watch any episode and be thoroughly entertained!

Buy it.",1264032000,,410,4.0875
8148932,5,B000J3FBW0,"A romatic comedy/action show. Cute body guard goes overbord protecting a whistler. She like, it's like her like Royce and Racheal.

8148933,4,B000J3FBW0,This series was very funy and full of romance. Yet it lacked the emiotional stife of the other two series. I recomended it but you should get both Full Metal Panic! and Full Metal Panic! The Second Riad collections as well to get the whole story.,1237939200,,246,4.369565217391305
8148934,4,B000J3FBW0,"If you have watched the first full metal panic and are craving for more action, this probably won't satisfy your appetite (check out FMP The Second Raid). If you saw the first season of full metal panic, and you enjoyed the antics of Souske and Chidori in the class room, then you'll enjoy the Fumoffu series very much.

 This series for the most part is pretty light hearted and mostly just school boy antics(kind of like the ""School Rumble"" anime). It's mostly about Souske adapting to the normal life of a highschooler while still palying the role of a mercenary. It's good for a couple laughs but if your a Tessa and Melissa fan like I am, then you'll be in for a let down as they only appear in a few episodes. The Fumoffu series is only 12 episodes long so it comes and goes very quickly. It actually fills more or less like your watching ""filler"" episodes that should have been mixed in with the main series, but was kicked out and just turned into a seperate series all together. Nonetheless it is still great to watch.

 There are only a few problems I had with the series. The first problem is that it is short, so there really is no main story to follow. It's more or less a collection of mini stories. This is ok, but it doesn't really advance Souske's relationship with Tessa or Kaname, so your still left hanging on that one. The second problem is that some of the scenarios are just typical anime scenes that you've seen 100 times before. Like the infamous ""Hot Springs"" episode where the boys try to take a peek at the girls and end up in a world of pain. How about the ""secret admirer"" when someone unkown likes a main character and it doesn't work out well in the end. Oh and how can I forget the ""under dog story"" where a sorry school team has to toughen up to defeat their rivals? Yeah, it's all pretty much there in Fumoffu. It's probably what doesn't make it stick out so much like it should, but it is Full Metal Panic, and it does put that Souske spin on things which makes it worth watching.

Overall If your a fan of Full Metal Panic it's worth buying for your collection. If not I'd look for it onsale. It's good, but can be skipped if highschool comedies are not your thing.",1237680000,,2202,4.322033898305085
