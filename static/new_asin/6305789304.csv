If you like anime just for the awesome animation  you can get this but...it's plot is nothing special.",961545600,,273,4.74468085106383
1071267,2,6305789304,"Perhaps the rest of the reviewers are used to the animation from Steamboat Willy, but as far as I'm concerned, the semi-decent animation doesn't make up for the lack of character and plot developement. I've seen much better  CGI animation than this in many computer games. I had expected something  far more impressive. Considering that only one episode is included on each  DVD, it is a complete waste of money. Blue Submarine is not worth all of  the hype that it is given by reviewers. If you want your money's worth of  Anime, get something else.",960940800,4,550,4.6875
1071268,4,6305789304,"Because of its extensive use of CGI, I had low expectations of this title.  Boy, was I surprised!  This is pure eye candy.  I find most CGI anime released lately to be visually repugnant, but the CGI is extremely well  done here and it melds with the cel animation flawlessly.  My only gripe is  the running time.  Only one 30 minute episode on each DVD!  I never buy  such short videos, but Blue Sub No. 6 came so highly recommended that I  decided to take a chance, and I'm glad I did.",957398400,9,487,4.195652173913044

This is a Sci-Fi anime and before I bought this anime I thought  it wasn't going to be good because of the other anime I saw ""Silent  Service"". But it turned out to be a great anime and I only wish they  make the series longer. Blue Submarine makes a good anime collection and  it's about 30 minutes a tape and there are 4 tapes total (Blues, Pilot,  Hearts, end)...",956620800,,594,4.175438596491228

1071368,3,6305789304,Blue is good anime for what it is. I bought this because I liked the idea of a submarine anime. The picture and sound are not the best compared to anime on bluray. i recomend getting the bluray version if you can. otherwise this is an ok anime.,1394755200,,244,4.104166666666667
1071369,5,6305789304,"Remember when Blue Submarine aired on Toonami? Remember how amazing it was including the CGI sequences which were breath takingly advanced at the time. The story is odd and surreal but that's part of the appeal. That's what makes it so memorable and nothing to compare it to.

Throw away, sell or donate your Bandai and Anime Legends copies. The video quality was composite and the colours looked faded. Discotek got the hands on the ultra expensive DVD and Blu-ray remastered versions for their US release. Complete in progressive scan and it's original 4:3 aspect ratio, you will be impressed by the differences you see and change in ambience with the sheer overwhelming increase of details hitting your brain.

The original Toonami dub is included. This is Discotek's golden standard of including the classic and best dubs that people grew up watching. No redubs here, Discotek preserve history. You can choose to watch in English or Japanese. The Toonami dub is uncut here as the aired version included 10 mins of footage cut out due to extreme, explicit content.

The packaging uses amazing character art and one of the prettiest covers I've seen on any release for 10 years. It really grabs your attention, showcases what to expect visually and entices to watch you immediately. It's much prettier sitting on your shelf on display than the generic Bandai version of a submarine in water.

Extras include the original Toonami commercials which are hilariously dated to watch with the out of date, over the top narration. We also have a special intimate interview the original creator which gives a new insight into the understanding and conceptualisation of the show.

1071370,2,6305789304,"I guess I'm a bit too grown up to enjoy mindless action rendered on an series of animated cels.  The CGI sub was well designed, but the beyond that, the story itself was as disappointing as could be.  When I think of other anime, say Macross as an example, I do acknowledge that there's a juvenile aimpoint for the piece, but, or whatever reason, I can still enjoy some of the older anime, like a Macross, as opposed to Blue Submarine #6.

Aliens from afar inhabit a flooded Earth and threaten mankind.  Oh boy.  I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around the inanity and impausibility of the plot.  But, again, I remind myself of Miyazaki, Dirty Pair, or again, even Macross, and think to myself that perhaps this series is for a younger generation.",1388102400,,754,4.507352941176471
1071371,5,6305789304,"I always loved this anime show simply because the colors of the animation were mind bogglingly beautiful, the story is weak and only a really intense anime buff would be interested in it, but as animation filmography goes this cartoon is just beautiful.",1387152000,,253,4.906976744186046

This series which was very short, four episodes to be exact, but it is an amazing and original story of a world where a lone scientist decided that humanity wasn't destined to inherit the earth.  Being released in the year 2000 this short Anime was released as ""The Future of Anime"" for the new millennium.  This video was an experiment to test the new world of digital editing and computer graphics.  This is a wonderful movie, you watch it and decide how they did.",1366070400,,546,4.540816326530612
1071374,3,6305789304,"I read the first review and saw the animation described as state-of-the-art. My expectations were raised, but I didn't realize that review was from over ten years ago (when the animation probably WAS state-of-the-art). At any rate, I wasn't impressed, but if you like anime and get this dvd for real cheap maybe it'll be worth it for you.",1354665600,,338,4.745762711864407
1071375,4,6305789304,"Blue sub No. 6 is an awsome anime OVA collection. I just wish that it could have been longer. I also wanted to see more character development, mainly the main character and Mutio (wont tell you who Mutio is; you need to see the anime to find out. However all in all the animation, character design, the fight scense, and music ROCK. Just remember this is one of the first animes to incorporate CGI so it is not the best CGI.

1071376,5,6305789304,"Many say that this show is just alright-not lifechanging, or whathaveyou, but for me, it DID change my life, at least in the realm of anime. I grew up watching DBZ, Initial D, Trigun, etc etc. But when Toonami aired this, it opened my eyes to a completely new sector of anime. For me it was pivotal to say the least. Albeit, it's not perfect, with the pacing being a bit rushed and the music not being the best for this series. However, the characters are well-developed, the English dub is actually pretty good, and the artwork is beautiful. Pick this one up; for the price, it's a great buy.

P.S. Get THIS collection. If you're at all having trouble deciding between this collection, and the Anime Legends Package...This is the one you want. I had originally owned the Anime Legends, but it got stolen from my car. The Anime Legends uses the SIDE A/SIDE B feature, which is completely unnecessary, especially because we don't get any great disc art. You'd think the two-side disc would mean more content, but that's simply not true. This collection, from what I remember actually has a little MORE content (DVD's can hold a lot), there is actually disc art, and the packaging is great (LOVE that frosty blue sleeve), whereas the Anime Legends collection leaves a lot to be desired in that realm. Plus they take up the same shelf-space, so no worries there either :)",1293667200,,1368,4.62962962962963
1071407,5,6305789304,"Contrary to the two previous entries, I found Blue Sub 6 to have an original and well developed plot. While some areas could be better explained (the full scoop on Zorndyke's war on humanity), most questions can be answered. For instance, the ships may have RADAR, they mat not. Who knows what state of repair they are in. RADAR is also no good for underwater targets, which is where the enemy comes from. Underwater. They have Sonar, but these are living things we are talking about. No moving parts. Quiet. Or, the it might be as simple as getting caught with our pants down. Anyway, in a city covered i water, I saw no place for a RADAR site. Any JDF radar sites would have been destroyed with the tide. It might be the future, my little friend, but that does not mean advancement. Look at the Mideval era compared to Rome. If anything, there was technological regression there...thanks to the church.",1194652800,,904,4.58641975308642
1071408,5,6305789304,"Honestly, after viewing this anime, in my opinion, this is a great anime. Back in 1998 and 1999, the technology in creating the special effects is considered as a supernova because of the impression that it led to development of similar special effects in other anime in the later years. The special effects created by computer technology is bravo. 2D and 3D can be developed harmoniously. I find the story fanastic. Solely robots or fightings can be boring in some other anime. Without the cause of the story seems vague in some other anime. Excitement is entertaining. However without the underlying meaning as a support in some other anime, the story looks dry. Blue Submarine No. 6 contains lots of elements which can give something that other anime lack. Because this is the predecessor of Last Exile so the fans of Last Exile must love this anime.",1173916800,,853,4.809523809523809
1071409,4,6305789304,"So the world is at an end due to the melting of the polar ice caps (a quite plausible scenario). A mad scientist has begun to engineer aquatic mutants for unknown reasons, and humankind is on the verge of extinction, with a last hope- a group of submarines manned by the best naval forces all over the world.

It seems a bit contrived at first, but Blue Submarine 6 engaged me in it's story far more than I thought it would. At first look, it might come off as a simple war anime series. Thankfully, the series is not as one dimensional, and far more realistic (at least in my eyes) than any far-off mecha space war (see: Gundam). The apocalyptic landscape and philosophical questions addressed were enough to hold my interest, and the jazz and blues music were a good complement to the underwater sea battles (a refreshing change from the oft-overused jpop and classical tunes of other series) as well as the more thoughtful bits.

The CGI was also done well, the animation is clean, and overall the series is worth a watch.",1159056000,3,1025,4.535135135135135

1071411,3,6305789304,"There was just nothing that grabbed me with this series.  The graphics were fine but not exceptionel.  The story was lacking the most, with nothing for me to get interested in.  As a reference:  I did enjoy RahXephone very much and loved Kino's Journey.  This may explain why I did not get into this.",1141603200,5,300,4.481481481481482
1071412,3,6305789304,"The animation was good, the bad guys were unique, but that was it. The characters are a little too basic for my taste and the only thing truly interesting is the music that holds this piece together.

The music is interesting, but still doesn't fit into some scenes (Jazz will be played in exotic fight scenes) but I will give the film props for having different ideas - the end of the world, the doctor at the end with no heart, etc. -Joeyfro.

1071413,4,6305789304,"While my expectations were not very high while viewing this anime it really grows on you. The characters are original and the story is one of a kind. However this movie may not be suitable for some kids, there is some animated nudity ( on mermaid-like creatures) and contains violence/gore. As for the animation there is quite a bit of CGI mixed in with the animation( which is good by the way), sometimes the blending of the two does not flow seamlessly but it isn't hard to forgive given the visuals. This movie also has a lot of jazz music during the action sequences, sometimes it sounds out of place but it still works for the film. Other then that there are no reasons not to give it a shot.",1123372800,10,697,4.369230769230769
1071414,5,6305789304,"I first saw this wonderful peice of anime when Toonami was showing GOOD animes like Outlaw Star and G Gundam (snif...those were the good ol' days...). I was not well educated on anime at that time, so i didn't really understand the story. But still after I saw it, i said to myself ""OH...MY...GOD!!! THIS IS THE BEST ANIME IN EXISTANCE!!!!"". Years later, I remembered that quote of mine and made up my mind: I was going to buy it on DVD.

I ordered it (via this website) and watched it for the first time in about 5 or 6 years, and it was just as I remembered it.

if you are only THINKING about buying this DVD, then don't hesitate, order it now. The CGI/2-D animation blend is remarkable, and the quirky, jazzy soundtrack makes you want to get up and break out the old kareokae machine. The story makes a overly-used storyline seem fresh and new, and the characthers, although typical, have very deep and developed personalities. This DVD is so good, you'll almost forget you're watching anime.",1115510400,5,996,4.527777777777778

1071416,4,6305789304,"Blue Submarine No. 6 is one of my favourite animes. Not only are the CG and animation smooth and well done, the characters are creatively designed and interesting (Verg and Mutio being my favourites). The funky jazz music adds a unique feeling to this already wonderful anime. It does a wonderful job of taking you through all your emotions (I got a bit teary-eyed at one point) and making you think about things.

The only thing I think could've been done differently is that 4 episodes is way to short for this series. But if you don't like stretched out plot lines that sometimes get boring, then you'll love BS6.",1093910400,5,616,4.6

1071476,5,6305789304,"Wow! What stunning animation, the fluid motion scenes are just the best (even by today's standards). Fabulous battle scenes that are genuinely exciting, and some very sad scene (bring a hanky). Some of the music has made it into my permanent mp3 collection as well ;-)
It's an eco story in the best tradition of Anime. The characters are very recognisable, but Anime is made up of such standard characters e.g. the embittered veteran, the naive young women, the mad scientist etc, but it's none- the- worse for this.
If you cannot appreciate how good a piece of work this is, then perhaps you need to stick to watching DragonBall Z.",1085616000,4,632,4.702702702702703

A decent story, Extras are good sence the storyline did not realy give us much info on the charactures.  Only main complaint is that this series is a little TO SHORT!  Still it is one of the better anime's and it gives one a good look at wars and humanity.

The story is great, and could actually become true in the future.  The action is awesome and the characters are well devoped(don't think sick).

1071481,5,6305789304,"The story of Blue Submarine #6 (Ao no Rokugo) comes to a conclusion in this extended length episode.  Revolutionary for its blending of computer generated graphics with traditional cel animation--done before but never to such extent or with such success--Blue #6 like many modern anime is a cautionary environmental tale of mankind's struggles to get along with Nature.
In prior episodes, a scientist has brought about devastating ecological changes to the Earth, flooding most of the land by melting off the polar caps and making Antarctica a habitable paradise populated with his sylvan genetically-engineered creations.  The crew of Blue #6 have orders to launch a nuclear strike on the scientist's ""base"" (a small cabin in a village, as we later see) to stop his flipping of the world's magnetic poles and subsequent extinction of mankind.
The final episode features some incredible battle sequences between the forces of humankind and those of Nature (who have an giant submarine modified from an old battleship) and a somewhat confusing at times anticlimatic confrontation between the main character and the ""evil"" scientist.  Who will win?  Will humanity survive at the expense of Nature, or can the two coexist?
The soundtrack is outstanding, performed by a Japanese big band group and includes the stunning, sultry, Jazz-club-esque closing title, Minasoko ni Nemure (literally, ""Sleep on the Sea Floor"" or ""(this thing that) Sleep Inside Everyone.""  Some may find the juxtaposition of brassy big band jazz sounds over climatic battle sequences a bit off-putting, but for me, they work hand-in-hand and offer a wonderful sensory experience.
Check out the whole series.  I saw this episode first and went back to see what I had missed (most of the story won't make sense otherwise) and am glad that I did.",1047427200,,1812,5.188356164383562
1071482,1,6305789304,"...P>The story behind ""Blue 6"" is simple, but made meaninglessly complex. Apparantly the script writers decided that instead of coming up with their own ideas, it would be much more fun to borrow a story-line that seems less in place with anime and more in line with the plot of a Marvel comic book...
The story is completely redundant. You have everything in here to make a cliche'd movie that only the Sci-fi channel would want to run. Sure, there are a few imagninative moments here and there,...
The characters are possibly the rarest to find even in bad anime....these characters don't make any sense!! Who are they? Where did they come from? Why are they in charge of this submarine? Why do they have a little kid working the communications? And why does one of their team mates resemble a more amsculine Wionna Ryder? Seriously, if you're going to spend this much time working on the overall look of the OAV, you might as well have put some thought into the characters. No matter, what happens to them or what troubles they face, you never seem to care about what happens to the crew, not enough detail was given even for that...
The music was very annoying...simply put. It sounded as if someone stole sheet music from yoko Kanno, then decided that they didn't like they way the score was arranged, so they took liberties upon changing the music into something less interesting and more...cold. The music just seems to ""start up"" without any purpose and it really throws your mind for a loop it doesn't have to go through. It's basically jazz, if you can call that, and it really doesn't have a place in the world of ""Blue Sub 6.""
The battle sequences are the only things that are well animated, and even then they seem to be borrowing ideas from anime that involve starships. So the battlescenes basically turn what seemed like an original submarine/post-apoclyptic anime into ""Macross""-underwater. They do give some thrill, but what's the point? The story is so lame you hardly understand why there are underwater battles going on in the first place.
The series is only 4 episodes long. 4 episodes=4 DVDs. That's 1 episode per DVD, so each DVD is 30 minutes long...something ain't right here. Why pay [$$] for thirty minutes? It makes no sense!! And to top it off, these DVD's don't come with any extras,

1071523,2,6305789304,"I recently watched the entire series over a few nights' time on TiVo. There's nothing overly interesting or special about the drawn out story. Our rebelious hero with a sketchy past must overcome personal issues and team up with his female counterpart to beat the scientist/enemy who has created a race of mutant creatures bent on destroying mankind.
One point of interest: The arch-evil monster, a shark-human hybrid of a sort, is over-the-top with his dramatic delivery. I would cringe from embarassment whenever he was afforded screentime. However, in the final act of the film this shark-mutant gives a wailing performance of defeat, crying ""daddy"" or ""papa"" (or something similar) repeatedly at the top of his lungs. It's so bad, it crosses the line and almost becomes good again. I can only imagine what the recording sessions were like for that scene.
More than anything, this cartoon is a vehicle for the old promise of mixing 2D and 3D animation. Seeing it now, after more technically successful 2D/3D integrated efforts like TITAN AE, IRON GIANT, ATLANTIS, etc., BS6 looks clumsy at best.
This piece could be included on 1 DVD only. Breaking it up into multiple parts is just a gratuitous effort on the studios part to milk as much return out of this below average effort. Spend your hard-earned cash elsewhere, (...).",1008028800,2,1328,4.959641255605381

Well besides my rant of getting jipped on the pricing, the entire story line is very cool.  The combination of 3D modelled animation and hand drawn is very awesome.  I like this new Era that Anime is coming into.  They're doing more on the computer and looks much cooler than it ever could hand drawn.

But, for you purists that hate bad english dubbing, you will be very pleased.  Actually, the english voice overs could have been a lot worse, but I would much rather enjoy it in its original form.

1071527,4,6305789304,"Blue Sub No. 6 is an incredible short anime series.  You can read the synopsis above, so I won't reiterate...the animation, both cel and CG, is beautiful, and the story is intriguing, although somewhat difficult to follow.  I wouldn't recommend it for someone who's just getting into anime, as the plotline and storytelling is definitely Japanese; it doesn't develop the same way an American animation or movie would (or even as most newer anime does), and if you're not familiar with the difference in style, it'll confuse you.  (Especially since you have to buy four DVDs/videos to see it all, and if you're like me, that'll take a little time!)  However, I highly recommend this series if you're an anime appreciater.  Well, maybe you truly hardcore folks won't like it, and if you're into blood, power armor, or jiggling, this won't do for you, either.  If you enjoy a good story, though, as I do, this is for you.
One of the best newer series I've seen of late, and I've been watching for a number of years.  My only real complaint is the length-to-price ratio.  Each disc is rather short for what you pay...but I was addicted enough after the first episode to shell out the cash for the other three!",990489600,7,1205,4.650943396226415
1071528,2,6305789304,"I saw the commercials for this on Cartoon Network, and I was hooked-I had my Tivo record all the episodes. The beginning was slow going, and I waited for it to get better. And waited, and waited... I don't think the characters were well-developed at all; the only characters that held my interest were the submarine itself and the fish-people, specifically the girl that saved our hero. The ending left much to be desired, since it explained even less than the ""beginning"" did. I have to admit, the graphics were excellent, which is the only redeeming thing about this series. I would recommend almost any other anime series for an ""introduction"" series, or I might bore the Newbie to death.",989452800,,691,4.766666666666667
1071529,5,6305789304,"This DVD is the edited version of ""Blue Submarine No. 6"",
for the Cartoon Network's ""Toonami"" program.
I'm somewhat
old-school when it comes to edited and dubbed anime programs. I don't
like 'em. However, the dubbing for BS6 is actually pretty good. There
are some annoying moments with the disc, such as the intro credits
popping up out of left field, and slight ""hiccups"" where the
commercial breaks are suppossed to be. Also, in the chopped version
there are characters with absolutely no development, yet you get the
sense they must be important to the plot. The ending is a bit
confusing, too.
Other than that, I was wholeheartedly impressed with
the quality of the show. The music isn't bad, the action is very
intense, and the characters interesting.
The artwork is
impressive. There is extensive computer generatated animation, but it
only occasionally jumps out at you as being obvious CGI. The
underwater battle sequences are breathtaking. The underwater
explosions take on a realistic quality, and the minisub fighters move
like jets in a dogfight. Torpedoes move in a believable fashion, and
control panels and video displays are clean, clear, and neatly
designed.
I cannot recommend the series enough, and I'm sure the
uncut version is far better. There seems to be something for all anime
fans, short of swordfights and sorcery. There is some use of mechs,
and lots of cool tech. Interesting creatures, too.
This is no poor
man's ""seaQuest DSV"", that's for sure! In fact, if
""seaQuest"" had been more like BS6, it might have fared
better in the ratings.
I really hope there's a follow-up to the
series. This is easily one of the best tech animes I've seen in a
while. For the price, I'd recommend this cut version so you can get a
feel for the show, especially if you're unsure if you'll like it and
can't rent it anywhere. If you do like it, you can then proceed to get
the four seperate volumes.",987724800,8,1910,4.7734138972809665

When will we stop polluting our Mother Earth? When WILL HUMAN STOP FIGHTING? One day, we will kill each other until the brink of human extinction. And sadly, the world appears to be going that way. These are the messages that Blue Submarine conveys.
The animation is superb, the CG is absoutely wonderfuly and the dubbing is suprisingly good. Character design are unique and  intriguing; exciting battles and an interesting story keeps you on the edge throuhgout the entire movie.
BSN6 is SO GOOD that I'm grateful that I'm alive to view it. It just doesn't get much better. In fact, I'm still shaking from having finished watching it. I CANNOT recommended it enough, I REPEAT-- I CANNOT RECOMMENDED it ENOUGH.

I highly recommend this anime, too bad it's just a movie. It's kind of like GW where it explores and tries to portray human nature at it's best and worst.  It's about a Submarine named Blue Sub. Number 6 that must save the fate of humanity from the warped destiny created by Dr. Zorndike and his ""children"". A fight for the survival and the fittest. You won't regret watching it.

Blue Submarine No. 6 features some really amazing cel animation combined (at times haphazardly) with 3D computer animation. The effect seems to work most of the time, but at times can be a little jarring epspecially when they cut from a scene with a lot of cel animation to one with mostly computer animation. Despite that, BS6 looks incredibly crisp and sounds terrific regardless of audio track.
The story however, is fairly cut and dry, cliche laden sci-fi stuff, but interesting enough to keep you tuned in.
Essentially, BS6 is a nice addition to a DVD collection for strict use as an eye candy disc. Just remember not to run to the kitchen for a beer, because the DVD will be over by the time you open the fridge.",978393600,,793,4.5524475524475525

It was so non-Western as far as plot and characters go, and truly moving.  The animation blows the mind, and even the CGI is well done.  The plot is great, but it is the characters themselves that are the keepers (as in any truly great anime--Gundam Wing, anyone?).  Especially Hayami.  Oi, kawai.  He made me think of what would happen if Heero never got together with Relena.  The whole series itself takes a piece of 'Waterworld,' uses it correctly, and mixes it with the fabulous H.G.

The answers no and Kino heads back......and that when the action starts! Two spider-like mechs speaking the words of Zorndyke (the villan who flooded the earth). The two go in a big battle of explosions across the town and soon Kino is trapped by the two. But Hiyami comes back! After throwing a gernade and exploding one of them, he rescues Kino and shoots the second one to death. Hiyami and Kino join up with Blue 6 and the two go out fighting in the small Grampus. After killing about 3 enemies, Hiyami gets his first look at the pilot of the mechs and Blue 6 takes on Musaka (a living whale ship). Whoo! Not bad for a 30 minute episode.

1071656,4,6305789304,"""Blue Submarine No. 6"" is one of the more interesting and well-animated anime series (as opposed to feature productions) I've seen in quite some time. To be sure, there's nothing particularly unique about the plot--think ""Waterworld"" a la Tom Clancy. And many of the characters are straight out of anime central casting. But the chief antagonist--that is, besides the requisite mad scientist--is a walking, talking, mutant shark creature, a cross between Ahab and Long John Silver (and, yes, somebody stuck a parrot in one scene). Throw in a bunch of mermaids (with very sharp teeth) and some real killer whales, and the series caroms back and forth between taking itself way too seriously and turning bizarrely (unintentionally, perhaps) hilarious. Sort of like George Lucas and Sam Raimi directed alternate scenes. In the end, though, close attention to detail (there's an acknowledgment to the Self-Defense Force in the credits), and the clever and compelling mix of digital and drawn animation make it eminently watchable, and often mesmerizing. ...",972259200,,1053,5.311377245508982

Even  with all the whiz-bang animation and video quality (which is quite good), I  don't doubt for a second they could fit all 4 episodes onto 1 disc.

My main reason for getting this was to own the uncut versions on hand and having the video and audio quality be top notch was hugely gratifying. Been waiting to have this excellent series in my collection for a while.

Back when this aired on Toonami, I was besotted. The animation was great, character designs unique, and the storyline is perfect for audiences today who get off on humans getting slaughtered and the world being tossed in a post apocalypse-like setting.

What's kind of a shame is that summaries of this will make it seem like it mostly takes place on the sub when Mutio and the other creations of Zorndyke get just as much screen time. The story is topnotch and even with the censored version they aired on Toonami they couldn't get rid of everything and back then, when I was a wee girl, even I picked up on the drug use and the full extent of the ""punishment"" a cute something got.
