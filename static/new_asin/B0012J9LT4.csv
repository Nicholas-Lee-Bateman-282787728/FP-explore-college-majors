8571137,1,B0012J9LT4,"This copy of the movie is poorly done and hard to watch.  The copy of Leaping Fish that comes with ""The Gaucho"" is much more professional and is a freebie add on.  The best part of this ""Leaping"" CD is Chess Fever which is different, unique and a little easier to watch.",1371254400,,270,4.173076923076923
8571138,1,B0012J9LT4,"Stay away from this version of The Mystery of the Leaping Fish. The quality is abysmal. The DVD appears to have been recorded from a 10th generation VHS tape.
I had seen bits and pieces of this film on a PBS broadcast about Tod Browning. The video quality of the parts of the film that were shown were excellent. This DVD, however, is a major disappointment. Clearly, a better/restored version exists out there somewhere that would be worth searching for.",1238716800,,455,4.7
