I watched this movie and felt that I had to have it for my collection.  The director picked great actors to play these roles.  The sense that one gets from this film is that we are all lonely soldiers fighting in the trenches of life while we are being destroyed by its loss of love.  There are many lonely lives in our world and this film shows us all the varied types of lives and how they, and us, search for the one love which will heal us all.  If you watch this movie make sure you have taken your antidepressants first.  This was on the Independent Film Channel and I saved it on my DVR.  Now I am putting it on tape as I feel it a vital film for me to have.  Another film which had this effect on me was The Man Who Loved Women, the French version.",1235433600,,928,4.027322404371585
