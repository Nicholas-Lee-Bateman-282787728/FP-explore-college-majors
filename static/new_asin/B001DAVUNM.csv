3527910,5,B001DAVUNM,"Great documentary. Of a Cambodian-American woman, who was born in a Thailand refugee camp to Khmer parents fleeing Khmer Rouge Regime. It was sentimental to me, especially since I was born in the refugee camps myself. And my parents, like hers; would not speak much about the atrocities they suffered by the Khmer Rouge. Everything was kept a secret, very hush hush. This is a great film to start the healing process for refugee survivors. This film has encouraged me to speak to my parents, and have them tell me THEIR story. So I can help them heal as well. In a Khmer Rouge regime, where being silent kept you alive; it's hard for our elders to express themselves now. I hope everyone watches this documentary & learns something valuable from it. PLS WATCH IT!",1373068800,3,763,4.659259259259259
3527911,5,B001DAVUNM,"This film is entirely engaging and heartbreaking in spots. The silence surrounding the effects of the Cambodian Revolution and its resulting genocide is shown to be so damaging in so many ways. Admittedly Cambodian culture does not encourage an outpouring of personal emotions in the way that contemporary Western culture does, but this film shows that there a thousands of untold stories from survivors that are extremely traumatic and are having strongly detrimental effects on the sufferers. The film is well structured and moves seamlessly through events; it shows that even through the most awful circumstances, humanity can prevail, but often at a lifelong cost. It is one of the best documentaries I have seen about this tragic era.",1244246400,8,739,5.218487394957983
3527922,5,B001DAVUNM,"Perhaps I should wait until my emotions calm down, and the tears are dried from my eyes, but I just finished watching this amazing documentary and cannot recommend it highly enough.  A young woman goes on a journey to Cambodia and discovers the terrible secret behind what had always been presented to her as truth - things were not as they seemed, and the suffering of her family due to the Khmer Rouge is eloquently laid out piece by by piece before the viewer at a gentle pace.  To take the story in all at once would have been difficult to bear.  Bravo.  Bravo to the grace and deep, abiding respect and love shown to her father and family by this filmmaker.  Socheata Poeuv has done an incredible job with this film, and her healing spirit can never take away all the pain her family suffered, but it certainly goes far to take some of the sting away.  A must see work of art by this filmmaker.",1409616000,2,899,4.3532934131736525

Beautifully crafted, heartfelt documentary of one family's story of how they persevered and overcame tragedy in the midst of the Khmer Rouge death camps, eventually making their way to America, and 30 years later going back to Cambodia to make peace by confronting the dark secrets in their past.
