8620480,5,B00G3ONKPE,This documentary was an excellent way to share the knowledge of a great tradition of the historically black college band mystique. I remember as a child growing up and attending a predominantly Black school where the band was truely the HALF TIME experience. They brought life to our pep rallies and infused pep into the crowd during the games. This  C D captures some of our best musician / entertainers / performers / student-atheletes as they passionately represent their respective schools. All hail to the HBC,1388707200,,514,4.976744186046512
