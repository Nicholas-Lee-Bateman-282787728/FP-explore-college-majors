2868587,4,B000RK733U,"Criterion has put out two films from the 1950s that pay homage to the Greek story of love and death they are named after, both by french directors: 'Orpheus', directed by Jean Cocteau (1950), and 'Black Orpheus', by Marcel Camus (1959).

Despite this, while both are based on the same mythologic legend, neither movie is remotely close to being a carbon copy of the other.  In Cocteau's Orpheus, the protagonist is a well known poet in France, who while still adored by his fans seems both burnt out and willing to make fun of the young poets trying to follow in his footsteps. What could be an art-house film that makes fun of art-house culture quickly turns to its mythologic roots however, focusing on the meanings of love and death. When his wife (Eurydice) is killed, and is taken by a supernatural agent of the underworld who serves as a new jealous love interest (Maria Casares), Orpheus has to decide whether he wants to stay alive or die, and whether he wants to stay on earth or live in the underworld (and with whom). The choices carry significant weight, not only for himself but the women he loves.

Access to the underworld is quite literally through mirrors, and Cocteau employs special effects that while now dated were fairly breakthrough for the time and still work extremely well as supernatural gateways made of liquid glass.  Played by handsome lead Jean Marais, the character is worthy of the original charismatic Orpheus, but the film does suffer from a lack of realistic love for Eurydice, which makes his choice between rescuing her from Hades or starting a new life seem like an obvious choice and less of a struggle. A few confusing plot elements offer much in stylization but also detract slightly from the film. Overall however a very original, visually compelling, and entertaining interpretation of the Greek myth.

This film is one part of Cocteau's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Orphic-Trilogy-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/0780023161/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Orphic Trilogy (The Criterion Collection)</a>, although it is not a trilogy in the true sense and this reviewed film can be seen as a stand alone effort. I would recommend getting this bluray instead of the Orphic Trilogy to save some money: IMHO this Orpheus is the best of the bunch, and I found the triology to appeal primarilly to those more interested in Cocteau ""the man"" rather than his movies.",1333238400,3,2439,5.148989898989899
2868588,5,B000RK733U,"I hadn't seen this in years, I have it on VHS but don't have use of a VHS player(too lazy to hook it up, plus no HDMI output etc)... so it's strange to watch this now. Cocteau used his typically novel film techniques to the point of humor sometimes, but this movie exhibits a couple of his most famous scenes that shouldn't be missed by those who love film history. I won't even go into the story/theme why spoil it completely? If you like ""art"" films then check it out. Ultimately this is a romantic film in nature with Cocteau once again weaving an otherworldly spell of sorts upon the world of cinema. 5 stars simply because it is unique for those who have patience.",1328227200,7,669,4.36
2868589,5,B000RK733U,"In French cinema, there are many filmmakers named Jean Renoir, Jean Vigo, Jean-Luc Godard, Jean-Pierre Melville, to name a few. But among these filmmakers who really never craved the spotlight was Jean Cocteau.  A proud man with humility and creative talent that extends beyond cinema.

Before Cocteau was a playwright, a screenwriter, a director...he was one of the most prestigious, talented poets living in France.

At a young age, similar to Jean Vigo who suffered through pain throughout his childhood after the death of his father, Jean Cocteau lived a different life.  Coming from a prominent family, like Vigo, at a young age, Jean Cocteau lost his father (who committed suicide).

Where a filmmaker like Vigo had cinema at a young age to escape reality, Cocteau had poetry.

In fact, his first volume of poems titled ""Aladdin's Lamp"" was created at the age of 19 and would eventually become popular through his poetry.

But it was World War I which changed Cocteau.  He would meet poet Guillaume Apollinaire, artist Pablo Picasso and Amedeo Modigliani and would later collaborate with many talents which include Russian choreographer Sergei Diaghilev, who persuaded the poet to write a scenario for his ballet ""Parade"" in 1917.

As one of the great poets, the introduction to writing for a ballet would lead him to writing and directing plays but also novels.  Among the novels he is known for are ""Les Enfants Terribles"" (1929), ""The Blood of the Poet"" (1930), ""Les Parents Terribles"" (1948), ""Beauty and the Beast"" (1946) and ""Orpheus"" (1949).

In 1930, is Cocteau's ""The Blood of a Poet"" would be the first film that would become the start of a trilogy known as ""The Orphic Trilogy"", followed by film adaptations of his novels ""Orphee"" and ""Testament of Orpheus"" (1960).  The trilogy which are not connected to each other in terms of story would showcase Jean Cocteau the writer, the poet, the novelist, the playwright and filmmaker.  Utilizing the Orphic myth to explore the relationship between artist and their creations, reality and imagination.

In 2000, the Criterion Collection released ""The Orphic Trilogy"" on DVD but recently, Cocteau films/works are now being released in the US by the Criterion Collection on Blu-ray.  While ""Beauty and the Beast"" is the first Cocteau film to be released on Blu-ray in America, the second is ""Orpheus"" (Orphee) which is also the second film of ""The Orphic Trilogy"".

A film that remains poetic and influential for many artists today.  In fact, for music fans, an image from the film is used in the Smith's single ""This Charming Man"", the music video for ""Take On Me"" was inspired by ""Orpheus"" and radio messages from the film were sampled in ""DJ Culture"" by the Pet Shop Boys.  And in 2010, the film was voted in Empire Magazine's ""100 Best Films of World Cinema"".

And while the film has its place in cinema and also pop culture, from a cultural, poetic and creative artist such as as Jean Cocteau, its the symbolic nature of the film, people who want to delve further into the life of Jean Cocteau and the era of when the film was written, to grasp how World War II had an impact in the making of the film but also, at 60-years-old, ""Orpheus"" was also a film that included elements of how Cocteau was feeling about his past-life, how he felt about his peers.

How he saw the new generation of poets being free, but at the same time, showing disdain towards how they lived their lives.  A different experience when Cocteau was younger.

But as for the story of ""Orpheus"", it was a chance for the talented artist to bring his passion but also part of his life to cinema.  In a much different style than what he had done years earlier with ""Blood of a Poet"".

""Orpheus"" is one of cinema's celebrated, visually poetic films ever created and a true representation of the creative genius of writer/director Jean Cocteau.

VIDEO:

""Orpheus"" is presented in 1080p High Definition, black and white (1:33:1 aspect ratio).  As a previous owner of ""The Orphic Trilogy"" DVD Box set, as expected from the Criterion Collection, the contrast of the film looks fantastic!  Black levels are inky and deep, contrasting whites and grays are magnificent and while there may be signs of mild flickering at the beginning, by no means does it ruin one's viewing pleasure of this 1950 film.

According to the Criterion Collection, the new digital transfer was created in 2K resolution on a Spirit 2K Datacine from a 35 mm fine-grain internegative struck from the original nitrate negative.  The restoration of Orpheus was carried out in a collaboration with the Archives francaise du film in Bois-d'Arcy, France, under the supervision of assistant director Claude Pinoteau.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter and flicker were manually removed using MTI's DRS system and Pixel Farm's PFClean system, while Digital Vision's DVNR system was used for small dirt, grain and noise reduction.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Orpheus"" is presented in French monaural with English subtitles.  The film is dialogue driven and dialogue is crystal clear through the center channel.

According to the Criterion Collection, the original monaural soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from a 35 mm optical track print.  Clicks, thumps, hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD.  Crackle was attenuated using Audio Cube's integrated workstation.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Filmmaker Francois Truffaut once asked the question, ""Do we still have to prove how important a filmmaker Jean Cocteau is?""

In 2011, there is no arguing of Jean Cocteau's place in cinema.  There is no arguing how influential and how multi-talented he was not only as a poet, a playwright, novelist, filmmaker, etc.  He was a person who embodied the life of artistic creation and a man who lived life at the beat of his own drum.  A man who lived with humility and lived a long life of being wanted because of his talent.

I use a juxtaposition with Jean Vigo and Jean Cocteau, not to compare their talent but to show how a few films created by these two individuals, would remain as an inspiration for other filmmakers not just in the '50s but also to filmmakers today.

For Cocteau, while ""The Blood of a Poet"" and ""Testament of Orpheus"" were very different kind of films when compared to ""Orpheus"", many probably were attracted or repulsed by the level of surrealism in his films, ""Orpheus"" was not surreal but it was poetic in nature, especially when you work with an actor such as Jean Marais.

You just don't see films like Cocteau films.  Others have their own way of taking on surrealism, but when you have a creative poet wanting to make poetry visual for cinema, its a rarity in cinema.

There is a visually poetic and creative way he directs his talent but also knows what to get out of them.  From the way the film is acted, it is like watching a play as Orpheus reactions when he comes home to his wife and is haunted by his exchange with the Princess (Death).  From the scene where he wakes up on top of the mirror on the sand, it's a classic yet artist shot or when we see Death coming out of the mirror to visit Orpheus when he is asleep.

It's a fantastic blend of fantasy and reality which we have seen before, especially in ""Beauty and the Beast"".  A whimsical probe of a character done intelligently, a bit of surrealism but a film that show us why Cocteau is an important and unique filmmaker with a style that can never be duplicated.

These are intoxicating images that are strong, beautiful and you feel almost as if you are part of that dreamlike environment that the characters are part of.  There have been films where one tries to reach out to their dead spouse, but the film is more sci-fi in nature because of the focus and over-reliance of visual effects.

The people from the netherworld are not shown in demonic forms.  Death is not the typical look of a robe with a hand holding a sickle, death is beautiful, death is emotional, death wants to find love in Orpheus, as Orpheus also finds love in the death.  And that is something that should not happen.

The film shows us the anguish each side feels towards the unknown.  Death loves Orpheus, who loves Death but also loves his wife Eurydice who loves him, but feels alone because of his focus is more on lady death and thus, we see one man staying with her (Heurtebise) when the other, Orpheus is consumed with his passion to find death.

Sure this is somewhat a modern 1950's retelling of the Greek myth but who else can craft something so genius and mesmerizing?  No other than Jean Cocteau.  And suffice to say, if you watch ""Blood of a Poet"" and then you go this film, you realize how far the filmmaker has come since his last film.

But when it all comes down to it, there is nothing like ""Orpheus"".  It's a great film and its exciting to see The Criterion Collection bring this out on Blu-ray but most importantly, to showcase the career of Jean Cocteau through many lengthy special features.

I know that many of the Jean Cocteau fans own ""The Orphic Trilogy"" and in some cases, typically when Criterion releases a classic that was on DVD for Blu-ray, the special features are the same.

In this case, it is not the same.  The original DVD version of ""Orpheus"" didn't come with hardly any special features but the other films included in the trilogy did.  The 1984 documentary and ""Villa Santo Sospir"" were included in the trilogy DVD box set on the discs of ""The Blood of a Poet"" and ""Testament of Orpheus"" but everything else on this Blu-ray is new.

From listening to the in-depth and wonderful commentary and just the sheer amount of well-done documentaries and also classic interviews, this Blu-ray release of ""Orpheus"" is a wonderful tribute to Jean Cocteau.

And I can tell you right now, because of the enhanced picture quality, the booklet and the additional special features, ""Orpheus"" on Blu-ray is obviously worth the upgrade, especially if you are a Jean Cocteau fan.  It's a 5-star release and I give it my highest recommendation.

But with that being said, for the newbie Criterion Collection fans who are used to more literal storylines, Jean Cocteau films, especially ""Orpheus"" is creative and is visually poetic, for some people, Cocteau's films may not be for them.  ""Orpheus"" may not be for them.  It takes an appreciation of Cocteau's work and his style to really enjoy this film.

So, for those who adore Cocteau's films, especially ""The Orphic Trilogy"", will be happy to know that with this Blu-ray release, you are not only getting a better version of the film to date, there are also a good number of special features included.

Once again, another fantastic Blu-ray release from the Criterion Collection that is highly recommended!",1323993600,23,12560,4.8658192090395485
2868590,5,B000RK733U,"This is one of my favorite films! I already had it on VHS, but I wanted the DVD version, and this copy by The Criterion Collection definitely did not disappoint! The underworld is seen clearly, and all the film's special effects of entering through mirrors are captured to their fullest impact. And the soundtrack is fully restored as well! It is wonderful to be able to hear all the voices as they were intended in the original movie theater version! I would recommend this Criterion copy to anyone who would like to see one of Jean Cocteau's best films. Truly worth buying!",1322179200,2,575,4.647058823529412
2868591,4,B000RK733U,"Jean Cocteau explored the myth of Orpheus three times. This second of his trilogy(""Orpheus"" 1949) stars Jean Marais as the young poet Orpheus; married to the lovely Eurydice. Orpheus' friend Cegeste is killed in a traffic accident, but the Princess of Death revives the young man. Cegeste and the Princess pass into the Underworld. Orpheus receives messages from Cegeste's spirit via a car radio(?), and visits from the Princess. Meanwhile Orpheus' wife enters into an affair, and is also struck down and killed. Enough drama? Now enchanted, Orpheus falls in love with the Princess, the glamorous Incarnation of Death. The narrator, Cocteau, implies ""You look at yourself in a mirror all the time. And you see Death at work. Mirrors are the doors through which Death comes and goes...""In ""Orpheus"", Cocteau escorts us through his magic-mirror portals to Hades; nothing more than modern, bomb-ravaged Paris. Reverse photography, slow-motion, and rear projection provide cinema illusion resolving back to his ""La Belle Et La Bete(1946)"", also starring Jean Marais, Cocteau's one-time lover. Jean Cocteau was a French poet, novelist, playwright, and filmmaker. Tragic himself, his father committed suicide when Cocteau was ten. Disallusioned, Cocteau became addicted to opium, and wrote ""Les Enfants Terribles"" during the worst of his drug crisis. Cocteau died of a heart attack in October 1963, and is buried beneath the floor of the Chapelle Saint Blaise Des Simples in Milly-la-Foret. This 2-disc Criterion release is a new high-definition restoration, with audio commentary by scholar James Williams, ""Jean Cocteau: Autobiography"" from 1984, a video from 2008 with assistant director Claude Pinoteau on special effects, ""40 Minutes with Cocteau"", a TV interview from 1957, ""In Search of Jazz"", another interview from 1956, and ""La Villa Santo-Sospir"", a 16mm color Cocteau documentary from 1951 that has never been seen before. There is also a photo gallery, the trailer, and raw newsreel footage of the bombed-out Saint Cyr military academy ruins, built by Napoleon in 1808, and used as a shooting location. And there is a booklet by author Mark Polizzotti, with an essay by Cocteau. Criterion previously released ""Orpheus"" in April 2000. Not a perfect film, ""Orpheus"" is yet a vibrant fantasy-film-poem from a French artist in his prime. As Cocteau says: ""Allow me to salute you my lord. It's been a long time since I've never met you."" Mark Polizzotti says it best: ""Without entirely knowing why, the poet will continue to sing of Death, to seek her out, until the day he goes to his own eternity--and even then he will not find her...""",1315612800,12,2640,5.214117647058823
2868592,5,B000RK733U,"I enjoy studying ""Orpheus"", my favorite of Cocteau's films for its sheer originality, cryptic whimsy, audio-visual conceptual risks, and superb musical score by Georges Auric.  Each time I see it, more is revealed to me, thanks to the richness of the details and the underlying subtext. The picture switches effortlessly between ""real-world life"" and ""dream world / underworld reality"".  This film features trick shots and special effects that are simple, yet state of the art for their time (as is also the case in ""La Belle et La Bte""): rubber gloves, that grant one entrance to the Underworld, by means of walking through mirrors; mirrors with watery surfaces; broken mirrors reassembling; the Princess (""La Mort""--Mara Casares) disappearing and reappearing; mysterious sequences of numbers and abstract poetry fragments emanating from the Princess' car radio.

Although all the performances are excellent, Mara Casares is the star of this film, with her strong, take-charge, no-nonsense approach. Conversely, she is also vulnerable, and ultimately pays the price, for misusing the privileges of her power, by falling in love with Orpheus (Jean Marais).  The Princess' assistant, Heurtebise (Franois Prier), is introduced as a vaguely sinister presence, but is soon revealed to be a sympathetic character; he falls in love with Orpheus' wife, Eurydice (Marie Da).  In the end, in an act of compassion, the Princess and Heurtebise  are punished for returning Orpheus and Eurydice to the world of the living.  The film closes with soaring orchestrations, followed by a coda of drums; intermittently throughout the picture, those drums provide a memorable background for the poets / ""bacchantes"", their brawling at the Caf des Potes, as well as for the Underworld, for which the ruins of the Saint-Cyr military academy provide a fantastic visual backdrop.

A second DVD of supplemental material provides a wealth of information about Cocteau, for those interested in learning more.  By way of the various interviews, documentaries and programs included on the supplemental DVD, one can become more familiar with his archetypes.  In one documentary, Cocteau talks about how people often worship the name of an artist, without even knowing their work; they worship fame for fame's sake.  So perhaps Cocteau foresaw the development of our current culture that is filled with vacuous celebrities who celebrate the mundane.  And yet, maybe hypocritically, he acknowledges the advantages of fame.  As much as he was a key figure of the avant-garde of his era, he was also interested in having as big an audience as possible.

 by Jean Cocteau

The ultimate self-centered workaholic screws up good marriage story in all filmdom. Our lead boy is a poet who happens to be married so he has a pregnant girl to ignore. His attention is centered on himself, his love of his work & fame. Admittedly he hasn't been told of the pregnancy but the movie illustrates it would've made no difference. Work of course includes applying his poetic muse to the subject of death.

This attention draws the notice of Death (played by a hetero female) who, as females sometimes do, falls in love with this new & insistent suitor. The wife becomes of course an obstacle to the desire of Death & is easily removed by the killing of the wife & her transport to Death's domain.

Now our boy notices he has lost something he cared about & with the help of one of Death's minion's crosses into Death's domain. He's a true man so he's confused about which girl he is going after. Unlike most Frenchmen, I don't know why, he doesn't admit he'd like both. There is some really nice scenery & philosophizing about death in this show & the middle portion is taken up with that.

In Death's domain her main minion turns rat & she is brought before a review board for exceeding her orders & authority. It is decided that the wife will be returned to life with her poetic husband but only on the condition that he never look upon her. This is like being offered parole with conditions attached that will get your buttinski returned to the joint ASAP. Smart people turn this kind of release down but smart isn't the subject of this movie.

The couple returns to life as we know it & they try to keep her out of his eye. Fat chance. Especially since the main minion has returned to help monitor the enforcement of the condition. The minion has BTW fallen in love with the wife as his wife in real life treated him badly, he can't resist this good woman who suffers patiently for her love.

Needless to say the man spies his wife in a mirror the minion fails to warn them about (yeah fails to warn). His wife is immediately taken from him forever & the poet gets himself killed trying to play badass, like poets & guns are a smart mix.

Death waiting for his return greets him & makes a fateful decision, in order to make him immortal (return him to life) a sacrifice is necessary so she chooses to have him smothered there in Death's domain. It's done by main minion of course. She then orders minion (against rules) to escort the poet back through time & return him to the life he had before she fell for him. This being Death's selfless act of love. The wife is of course asleep in their bed when he is returned to life & there they are none the wiser & no better off.

Death & main minion are arrested & escorted out of sight. Presumably to the hearing room again for what is described as a not nice dispensation. Great effects done here, unobtrusively & a fascinating take on death & inter-dimensional travel. I would have loved this like La Belle et La Bete if it had been set in a past or future time frame. I can just picture it set in the same period as La Belle et La Bete but that's a bit much for a director to have to adhere to since it is only my wish & he forgot to ask me for my preference.",1305849600,6,3287,4.297253634894992
2868594,5,B000RK733U,"I totally loved this, and was able to follow it in French which is much more dramatic and flowery and oddly more fitting than the subtitles. This film foreshadowed THE MATRIX in many ways that you will be able to pick out, from Trinity's costume, to agents. Cocteau is a wildly insane genius. There is a lot of originality in here. While it is not completely faithful to the original Greek/Roman Myth, See it, as ""Filme.""",1300665600,6,421,4.552631578947368
2868595,5,B000RK733U,"Familiar with the Greek myth, I found this adaptation very interesting. I first saw the final portion on TCM channel and was hooked to see it all. If I were teaching high school/college English again, I would include this film.",1295568000,5,227,4.7
2868596,5,B000RK733U,"Not as great as Cocteau's ""Beauty and the Beast"", but a fascinating film",1440115200,,72,4.615384615384615
2868597,5,B000RK733U,"Shot after successful film adaptations of his plays ""The Terrible Parents"" and ""the Two-Headed Eagle"" as director, and Ruy Blas as scriptwriter, ""Orpheus"" is Cocteau's take on that Greek myth. Set in the modern world, in an unnamed European country, with a story that could also happen all around the world as the myth is universal, Orpheus falls in love with Death as it takes away a young poet named Cgeste, then his wife. An obsession that intrigues everyone as Cgeste's death is blamed on Orpheus. Leading to events that involve Death and surreal travels into another world's.

Working with his trusted collaborators which are George Auric as composer, Claude Pinoteau as Assistant director, and Marcel Escoffier as Costume designer, Jean Cocteau displays another chance to direct his actors (Jean Marais, douard Dermithe, Maria Casares, Franois Perier, Marie Da). A talent I'd wish he could have displayed more in his career as movies/plays directed by him hit a poetic chord that goes beyond the word of his script. Displaying an energy that makes us realize how people like Cocteau are unique. Of course, other works Cocteau wrote like ""The Eternal Return"", ""The Princess of Cleves"", ""Ruy Blas"", and ""The Terrible children"", always end up displaying his magic through the sets, camera angles, and costumes. But Cocteau is like the Lynch and von Trier of this world; their works gain more with their presence as director.

Of the actors, everyone, and I mean everyone, is perfectly cast. Each portray their character the way he/she should be, with the perfect emotional impact to give the humanity and empathy they deserve. A trait George Auric's music also displays as it hypnotizes us into this other dimension. Seducing us the same way Death Charmed Orpheus; like in that scene where Orpheus runs around the streets of a large city pursuing Death as it walks through the streets, causing the astonishment or anger of some. A scene I like because it makes us crave for Orpheus to get to Death, makes us realize how some aspects of our world become so irrelevant and superficial.

On another note, It is also important to know that the movie is dedicated to Christian Brard, or ""Bb"" as Cocteau called his friend. A set designer who was capital for Cocteau's work in theater and in Cinema, Brard was the man behind the sets of Cocteau's masterpiece: ""Beauty and the Beast"". He was also the one who informed Cocteau of trivial facts that became the basis for his popular novel ""Les Enfants Terribles"". In fact, his death was so difficult that when Jean-Pierre Melville was to adapt ""The Terrible Children"", Cocteau wanted the work set in the fifties as the novel's 1920s could, as Cocteau said, only be well captured through Brard's magic. Therefore, it is with a sad heart that we see a dedication before the movie starts as this Cocteau's reminder reminds to us that Death can still catch us. That unlike their works, poets's bodies aren't immortal.

Of the Blu-Ray transfer, Criterion's work is awesome. For as the film stocks used for this movie are better than the damaged ones for Beauty and The Beast, the images and sounds are sharper. Indeed, it is as if we were watching the movie through a sharp magical mirror. And with the supervision of Claude Pinoteau, we are certain the film transfer does justice to Cocteau's intents.

Regarding its Bonus Features, we are very lucky to have among them ""La Villa Santo-Sospir, a short film in color Cocteau did that presents the work he did in that pleasant villa by the Mediterranean Seaside. Not only that, we also have interviews Cocteau did in the fifties. First, ""40 minutes with Jean Cocteau"", where he talks of his work, success, and for French society perceives him, and ""In Search of Jazz"" where he discusses of his fascination for that music style he used in Orpheus. Though the cherry on the cake is ""Autobiography of an Unknown"", a documentary where people from the Cocteau trust compiled taped discussions the poet had done before a camera. Discussions where he talked about the films and plays he did, Revealing facts that are unknown to the public, including how some of his plays like ""The Terribe Parents"" and ""The Terrible Children"" were based on people he knew.

In conclusion, Criterion gave to Cocteau's Orpheus the justice and perfect release his work should deserve. A release that makes me wish Criterion could release other works he did like ""The Eternal Return"" and ""The Princesse de Cleves"", ""Ruy Blas"", ""the Terrible Parents"", and ""the Two-Headed Eagle"" and ""the Ghost Baron"". Works that have gotten and deserve the same public attention ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Orpheus"" got.",1434153600,,4663,4.903675538656527

It is an engrossing retelling of the Orpheus myth set in contemporary times. Cocteau is always able to tell a superb visual story with very low tech effects, and this is also the case here. I especially liked his use of the bombed out ruins of Paris for his purgatorial mise en scene. And his use of slow motion (now more a cliche than a groundbreaking technique) really worked here. Apart from the craft, this is a deeply moving and heartfelt story that will haunt your memory.",1409270400,4,633,4.239669421487603
2868602,5,B000RK733U,"This is my favorite movie.

Rather than describe it, or why I love it, I'm just gonna triangulate it with other movie titles.

I would recommend this movie if you have been interested in the movies (& tv show) David Lynch, like Eraserhead- as well as possibly Lost Highway, Mulholland Dr. , Twin Peaks & Blue Velvet.

Also, if you enjoy the films of Bergman such as The Magician, Hour of the Wolf, or Seventh Seal.

Also, if you enjoy Guy Maddin, such as Tales from the Gimli Hospital, Careful et al.

Also JeanLuc Godard and Federico Fellini.

Other somewhat comparable ( or rather comparably incomparable) films would be Last Year at Marienbad, Cabinet of Dr Caligari, La Notte.

I'll add Coppola's Dracula and Plan 9 from Outer Space if you have a fetish for inventive low budget effects.

I love all these movies, but Orphee is just my personal favorite. Quirky doesn't quite cover it, ( especially when the actors had to occasionally perform long scenes entirely in reverse.)

A favorite scene of mine has Orpheus being guided to the underworld by Death's chauffeur- which performed by the actor as the guide in front of a screen of Orpheus: this makes the guide seem to glide while Orpheus floats in slow: to add some continuity clue, the guide passes an actor as a window salesman(!) who then appears on the screen as Orpheus passes him.

Yet while you process these simple stage tricks and highly irregular script, your mind pieces together a tale of metaphysical passion.

Another perfect example is Orpheus obsessing over poetry being transmitted over the car radio: "" repeat 3 times, the bird sings with its fingers "".

This movie undeniably weird but its about something: something intense and meaningful to its characters.",1408492800,3,1735,4.8047138047138045

2868608,5,B000RK733U,"For as long as I remember, I watch this film every 5 years.  Something about the imagery pulls me into its alternative world, unlike any other movie I have experienced.  (Yes, that is the right word).  Mirrors that turn into water...mirrors that can seize a life...mirrors that reform themselves after being broken.  Magic?  Not quite.  Dream? ... absolutely.

Like the Song of Songs where ""Love is as Strong as Death"", both the Biblical Poem and the Film use dreams within dreams to fuel our imaginations and desires. In Jean Cocteau's vision, Death is incarnated as a beautiful but mysterious women dressed immaculately in black and white. (These reflect her association with the ETERNAL FEMININE, the colors of the MOON). She commands - and others must obey.  But once she glimpses Orpheus (played by the impossibly handsome Jean Marais), she herself falls in love. The forbidden act of love induces Death to violate the rules of her other world, to bring Orpheus back with her, and to go so far as to orchestrate the death of his wife.  Ashamed by his lack of attention to his wife or, more likely, drawn by an inexplicable desire for death itself, the poet Orpheus voluntarily passes into the hidden underworld of Death - perhaps to comprehend the other, perhaps to fulfill his own wish to escape an ordinary life.

I disagree with Roger Ebert who opines that the female who incarnates Death should have been played by Greta Garbo or Marlene Dietrich.  Had that been so...the personality of Death would have been mixed with the personality of one of these stars of the silver screen, With Maria Casares, we experience her anew, untainted by other associations. Part of the charm of the film is that Death herself is vulnerable to but one thing, and that is love.

Maria Casares as Death does not commit any misdeeds personally.  She gives orders to two leather clad minions on motorcycles who literally take the lives of others. They remind me of Nazis, emotionless, who unthinkingly carry out the commands of their higher-ups. Nevertheless, DEATH herself is not All Powerful. She is required to obey orders from above and is even  answerable to Judges if she does not.  Orders are passed from one being to another, so that the ORIGINAL source of the orders becomes unknown or unknowable. Ultimately, then, this becomes a religious film because it involves GOD, but never shows him. As for DEATH, is she a CHRIST figure?  She sacrifices herself so that others may have life.  Or perhaps the film might be interpreted as the conflict between matriarchal and patriarchal spirituality.

There are other important symbolic references.  Although the film has a timeless feel, nevertheless it was written at a certain time and place -  The bureaucracy of the underworld is set within the (actual) bombed out remains of France's officer military academy.  (Imagine an American film set within the actual bombed out remains of West Point - and you get the idea).  One organization that gives and carries out orders replaces another organization that gave and carried out orders.  In addition, the ruin of that military school reminds the viewer of France's initial failure in the war.  Is the resurrection of the poet, at the end of the film, then a resurrection of FRANCE itself after the occupation.  The film works on so many levels.

In five years, I will see the film again.  My mirrors will show death at work.",1376352000,7,3413,4.859861591695502

They have only improved with time. You don't need the subtitles to understand these films. This is the poet as film maker. AND there is Jean Marais.

The DVD has great additional features. Interviews with two of the principal actors; interviews with Cocteau and a home movie (so to speak). It is important to remember when this film was made to appreciate some of Cocteau's film 'tricks'. Some of the extra features help put this in context with the period. This would make an interesting double bill with Black Orpheus (another of my favourites).",1359504000,3,723,4.6484375
2868613,5,B000RK733U,"""Orpheus"" was slightly adjusted but this actually adds to the experience.

The film ""Orpheus"" (1950). It starts out telling the story of Orpheus. They show how a timeless story can be applied to any time and place. I will now always think of this film when I think Orpheus. I had to use the subtitles but by the end of the film I felt that they borrowed a lot of colloquial English to make the French langrage. Either that or I could almost follow the film without subtitles.

Of the two films Orpheus is worthy of higher praise just because the visual innovation it employed was so far ahead of it's time for 1949.  The only film which has a comparable look and style is Cocteau's 1946 version of ""Beauty and the Beast.""  I consider all three of these absolutely essential viewing for anyone interested in the way a specific visual style opens up the viewer's imagination for different ways of interpreting the content.

8201114,5,B000RK733U,"Jean Cocteau's 1950 ""modern"" version of the ancient legend of Orpheus and Eurydice turns the tale into a kind of Dracula film where ""death,"" a female, is able to cause dead people to rise and obey her commands. She falls in love with Orpheus and does various things to gain his love.
The ancient legend fascinated many people and there are many versions of it in Virgil, Ovid, Plato, Boethius, and others. There are books, plays, and musicals about it, each offering different views of the plot.
The basic plot is that Orpheus is a very skilled musician (poet, in Cocteau's version). He is able to charm everyone with his music (poems). He is married to Eurydice and loves her dearly. Eurydice dies and Orpheus is distraught. He decides to travel to where the dead are kept and bring Eurydice back to earth, back to life. He charms the leaders of the underworld and is granted his wish. But there is a condition. Eurydice will follow him to earth, but he may not look at her until the couple reach earth. During the walk back to earth, Orpheus becomes unsure that Eurydice is following him. He turns to look at her. She dies again and he is unable to return to the underworld a second time to save her. Soon, he dies too.
In the Cocteau film, among other differences, Orpheus is told she will be with him on earth but may never look at her again either face to face or even see her in a mirror. Another difference is that ""death"" has an assistant, one of the men who had died who she controls, who falls in love with Eurydice and tries to help her.
The legend has many ideas that prompt people to think about aspects of the plot, such as what is death, does God control death, what is the significance of not looking back (a theme that plays also in the biblical Lot story of Sodom and Gomorrah), and can humans overcome and even charm death to do what they will.",1474243200,,1863,4.38728323699422

I first saw it with my wife at the time, who is often really good a parsing films but was at a loss with Orpheus. Some of the implications are well noted below: we have a poet who is in love with Death, who is of course a woman, and she is in love with him. And we are revisiting the old Orpheus legend. I want to add some more points, in a way more on the surface. Orpheus is a once trendy poet who has lost his mojo, and his young fans have turned on him. This is kind of realistic. In France sometimes, when they don't like your stuff, they want to hurt you. Here they attack his house. During his bewilderment at what's happened to him, a friend shows him the latest poetic trend: he opens a book of blank pages and says it's called ""Nudisme."" This brings up another aspect of the film, which is that there's a certain amount of humor. Death's henchmen are a couple of black-leather-jacketed motorcyclists, which I think is hilarious. Then there's the basic turnaround of the film, which is high-absurdist: the car radio starts emitting surreal poetry. Orpheus takes it down, hoping it can revive his mojo. In fact, it's Death calling to him. But those esoteric messages on the radio have another dimension, which French viewers at the time would have understood: they recall the coded messages the Resistance used in WWII. So yeah, I suppose this is an arty film par excellence, but it's very much involved with life, with the reality of an artist's fragile career, and with the life of an aging formerly trendy poet, Jean Cocteau.",1459036800,,1710,4.555194805194805
