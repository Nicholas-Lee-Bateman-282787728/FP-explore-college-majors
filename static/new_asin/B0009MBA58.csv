8063346,5,B0009MBA58,"I was surpised to see the good visual quality and songs
within each movie, also these films are a breath of fresh air,
not a complex plot, plus a great views of El Tigre where I used own
a home on the Sarmiento.
I lived in Buenos Aires for a few years, we came accross
Sandro at functions at El Gran Rex were he was among the
audience, we all admired him, so sad to see him go.
This DVD also encouraged me to acquire the rest of the movies,
I am waiting for 3 more to complete the collection. This is
a great preview of SANDRO'S films and songs.",1283472000,4,545,3.963636363636364

Sandro canta una serie de canciones con lindos panoramas de sus mejores peliculas y lo puedes ver junto con Iran Eori bailar.  Contiene ""Trigal"", ""Te Propongo"" y 40 canciones mas (total 42).  Me alegro haber encontrado esta joya.",1119657600,9,337,4.87719298245614
