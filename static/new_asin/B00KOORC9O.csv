6437186,4,B00KOORC9O,"Very good horror-comedy from Paul Tarnopol. It feels just like his last project, Girls Gone Dead, where he served as executive producer. Speaking of, real life ""Jersey Shore"" cast-member Jenni ""Jwoww"" Farley serves as executive producer on this feature film. So, if you're wondering what she's been up to post MTV, this gives you a good idea of how she's furthering her skills in the industry. Overall, Jersey Shore Massacre is an accurate portrayal of out-of-towners who go down the beach every summer and how they annoy basically everyone around them and make a fool of themselves. Luckily, there's a lot of blood and boobs to go along with it. And Ron Jeremy is there, too...and he's always fully loaded.",1408752000,4,707,4.9

6437188,5,B00KOORC9O,"DVD arrived in few days! No problems at all.
This was a hilarious version of horror meets jersey shore parody! If you like movies like scary movie or American pie then this is for you! Has a lot of Guido lifestyle stereotype references. If you were a jersey Shore fan you will enjoy it!",1416096000,,286,4.314814814814815

6437191,4,B00KOORC9O,"Let's be honest here.  If you're even looking at reviews for this movie, you're clearly not expecting an ""Oscar Winner"".  That being said, if you're looking for a fun, over the top, Horror/Comedy, this is EXACTLY what you're going to get!  As you probably know, this movie is produced by Jenny ""JWoww"" Farley, so that should let you know something?!  Most characters in this movie seem to be based on (and sometimes even named after) certain members of the Jersey Shore Reality show.  I'm not going to lie, I laughed quite a bit during this movie.  Being a pretty big fan of Jersey Shore, I really got a lot of the references that were put out there and whatnot.

Final Verdict:  Watch it!  The acting/story isn't great, but did you really think it would be?!",1412553600,,759,4.562962962962963
6437192,5,B00KOORC9O,"I love the goofy plot.  For the horror movie fan, there's a lot of gore and special effects.  Just the right amount of humor.  This is a great movie for people who don't take movies that serious and just want to be entertained.  There's a movie clip in the film called Fat Camp Massacre, it is hilarious.  I hope Fat Camp Massacre get's made into a full length movie.  This is a wildly entertaining movie, I loved it.",1411430400,2,417,4.282051282051282

6437195,1,B00KOORC9O,The worst acting I've ever seen.  It's like they purposely told them to NOT act and read the lines to eachother.  Still couldn't get through the entire movie. Only watch if that is all you're expecting to get out of the movie.,1410307200,,226,4.357142857142857
6437196,5,B00KOORC9O,"If you're a fan of either the ""horror"" or ""comedy/horror"" slasher-flick genre, you'll most likely enjoy Jersey Shore Massacre.  Although much about it is cliche (and sometimes even offensive), it certainly delivers potent doses of blood and gore (that are, thankfully, inflicted upon those simplistic parasitic narcissistic characters as depicted on MTV's Jersey Shore).  Additionally, humorous elements exist throughout.  The Bonus Features alone are worth the price of admission, particularly the ""short"" entitled, Fat Camp Massacre.",1409529600,2,535,6.0131578947368425

6437199,5,B00KOORC9O,"My husband and I had the honor of attending the world premiere of the Jersey Shore Massacre last week in NYC and really enjoyed this movie.  What we liked most was the combination of horror and comedy found throughout the film.  The fun filled trip to the Jersey shore takes a deadly turn that keeps your full attention from start to finish. The emotional rollercoaster ride is evident when laughter suddenly turns dangerous and you find yourself quivering at the edge of your seat with anticipation of the next gory killing.  If you like lots of bloodshed, suspense and a good laugh, then I highly recommend you watch this movie!",1409184000,3,630,4.709090909090909
6437200,4,B00KOORC9O,"I was amazed at how much I loved this genre piece. I wasn't bored for a second! First off it was hilarious the dialogue had me laughing out loud plus the gore was plentiful and well done for this type of film.

Some of the blood was over the top like in ""Hatchet"" but some of the gore effects were very well done. I gave it Four stars because it was everything I wanted it to be.it had hilarious dialogue, great kills that were creative and great production value for this type of film.

The acting was of course over the top but the timing and delivery is what made it so hilarious. I highly recommend this movie to lovers of slashers and slasher/comedies. The third act was quite clever and again hilarious. I can't wait to purchase it .",1409097600,2,739,4.271428571428571
6437201,4,B00KOORC9O,"Actually two surprises. Ron Jeremy is still alive. And this was an entertaining and humorous film. The stereotypes were perfect, beginning with the mob guys, to the Guido's that everyone loathes, and my personal favorites, the Guidette's. Everyone takes a hit including law enforcement. The gore was over the top as one would expect. I was not expecting a great film however, I found it comedic, sexy and fun.",1409097600,2,409,4.942028985507246
6437202,2,B00KOORC9O,"This movie has a great premise--let's kill Guidos and Guidas slasher style. And as a lets see young people killed movies go, has a fairly good ending. But its middle drags and produces a sound like ""MEH"" in a viewer's mind for 85 minutes easy in a 109 minute run time.

What to say of the characters we see? Tony Soprano would whack them; Chris Christie would stop traffic on a bridge just to push them off.

The middle offers scenes that just go nowhere. A verbal dispute between some Hispanic girls and the girls we will follow--blousy ones of maybe Italian extraction-- is there and then dies.  A minor character seems there just to fill time: he is a loving dad who is shamed by some muscle thugs who hook up our girls. Later he is befouled by the diarrhea deposited by one of our girls. These are the highlights of the film's middle.

The girls walk and jiggle, swear up a storm, have the intelligence and sexual appetites of minks, and flash their bodies, which appear either natural or augmented.

Something is wrong with a script when the audience begins to hope the main characters will be killed soon. Characters who are obnoxious, stupid, and boring do not possess engaging personalities and will be wished gone. Audiences are supposed to be tense awaiting the danger and startled when it happens; they should not be sitting there thinking, ""Come on. Come on. Somebody, please kill these people.""

Sex seems to be the setting that holds the gems of killing these people-- mainly with hand tools, a sander outrageously so in particular. Young people pair up and are killed--almost as payment for their deeds. Inventive killing is not really present: nothing strays much beyond what we have already seen in the Hills Have Eyes, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Wrong Turn, and that movie where the guy looks like a scarecrow only he has bat wings, a bad complexion, and can only be stopped with a harpoon.

Die hard fans of this form of horror are going to love JSM: even with all the flaws I point to.

For other viewers, I recommend JSM should be avoided until it is out in DVD, then it should not be bought, and you might consider not even renting it at all.",1409097600,,2162,4.568475452196383
6437203,4,B00KOORC9O,"If you like slasher movies, you'll like Jersey Shore Massacre. If you're not that into horror, but like to see how the Jersey Shore subculture is made fun of, then you'll love this movie - in fact, it's the humor that makes this flick really entertaining and enjoyable to watch.",1408924800,5,278,4.58
6437204,5,B00KOORC9O,"Jersey Shore massacre is a must see summer movie.  laugh and be scared at the same time with this well

6437205,5,B00KOORC9O,"I had the pleasure of attending the world premiere of JERSEY SHORE MASSACRE in New York last week. Everyone in the packed theater seemed to have a great time watching this combination of classic slasher flick and parody of MTV's Jersey Shore. I've never watched a second of that series so I have no idea how accurate the character depictions are, but based on my pop-culture exposure to cast members like JWoww (who's billed as Executive Producer here), Snooki and The Situation (oh how I wish I didn't even know that much about them) it seems like the filmmakers captured the essence of 'Jersey Shore' while creating their own memorable characters (the two female leads and 'Freddy' being particular favorites). I'm also not a Howard Stern fan but several regulars on his show make appearances in the movie and they were clearly crowd favorites at the premiere.

As a fan of classic slasher movies I have to give extra credit here for the special effects & gore. It takes a while to get to the kill scenes but it's worth the wait (with plenty of laughs along the way). I was pleasantly surprised at the high quality of the effects as well as the overall look of the film. It may not be a big-budget Hollywood blockbuster but it's one of the better-looking low-budget independent horror movies I've seen.

Full disclosure: I know a couple of the cast & crew, so although my review might be slightly biased I'm also objective enough to acknowledge that it's not a great film. Of course, it's not supposed to be, but if you're looking for a fun, low-brow horror comedy that will make you smile, cringe and marvel at the creative ways the characters are eliminated, JERSEY SHORE MASSACRE won't disappoint. Make sure you don't shut off the movie as soon as the credits roll or you'll miss a hidden surprise.",1408924800,3,1803,4.666666666666667
6437206,4,B00KOORC9O,"The movie was good as far as any slasher movie goes. It is a horror/ comedy spoof about girls that plan a trip to the Jersey Shore and things do not go as they planned. They meet some obnoxious guys and one by one they meet their demise. There were some very funny moments......especially a movie within a movie (Fat Camp massacre- hysterical). There is a ton of blood and gore!!! Lots of boobs!!  I don't want to give away too much away but there are some unusual ways the killer chooses their deaths.  If you are a Howard Stern fan there are some very funny scenes starring Sal Governale and Richard Christy. It is a silly, campy, do not take too seriously bloodbath definitely worth watching.",1408924800,5,695,4.464566929133858

8660431,4,B00KOORC9O,"This film is definitely a guilty pleasure for me! It may not be the greatest film ever made and it may not have the best dialogue but it has an undeniable charm and is actually quite funny with some inventive kills and great cameos from Richard Christy Bigfoot Ron Jeremy and a few others so it's definitely worth a watch and don't let the naysayers stop you from checking out what is actually a pretty good, fun little slasher film. And God knows, I have seen just about every horror movie you can think of, and that's no exaggeration. P.S. The lead actress is really gorgeous!",1441065600,,578,4.462264150943396

One highlight:  the actress Ashley Mitchell is beautiful and talented.  Why she wasn't featured on the poster/cover of the movie is a mystery to me.  She also deserves better parts than this.",1430265600,,339,4.775862068965517

other than the fact that none of the characters were in any way sympathetic or had any redeeming qualities thus making their deaths welcome,
it just wasn't even bad enough to be a good bad movie.
  For a low budget effort the camera work was pretty good ---- otherwise not worth the time or electricity to run.",1422748800,,459,4.440476190476191
