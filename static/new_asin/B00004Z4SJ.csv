1383509,4,B00004Z4SJ,I have to say that this is a must buy if you are a Sheen fan.  This movie shows how well the Sheens can work together.  The movie has plenty of action to keep you intrigued.,1162425600,,173,3.7777777777777777
1383510,1,B00004Z4SJ,"Bret Michaels, the legendary lead singer of that 80's band Poison, wrote, produced with Charlie Sheen (Being John Malkovich, The Chase) and directed and also starred in this dreadful action concoction about corruption and drugs and Mexico. You know a movie is bad when you got a horrible essemble cast and Bret Michaels...killing yourself off in the first 6 minutes wasn't that shocking. Charlie Sheen is the son of Martin Sheen (Catch Me If You Can, Apocalyose Now) in this movie.....wow!!!!!! That's awesome, I could swear they look alike and damn, was that Emilio Estevez's father Joe in there as well...man does Joe look like Martin..could they be brothers? Michaels failed on a major level...maybe he was setting out to do so..I don't know..I don't have all the answers. Also starring Mark Dacascos (Brotherhood Of The Wolf, The Crow: Stairway To Heaven) and Paul Gleason (The Breakfast Club, Not Another Teen Movie). Only thing their missing is Emilio Estevez himself. Good choice for staying out of this Emilio. A bomb within a bomb.",1105833600,,1040,5.017341040462428

1383512,2,B00004Z4SJ,"Charlie Sheen produced this home movie starring his father (Martin Sheen), his uncle (Joe Estevez) and himself.  This is a B-minus film about dirty cops involved in a drug deal.  Almost everything about this film is second rate.  The story is predictable and unoriginal.  The dialogue is mindless and insipid.  The photography is dull and the music is awful.  The only redeeming elements are the stunts and pyrotechnics, which are reasonably well done.
The acting is mediocre at best.  Charlie Sheen is often embarrassingly bad, leaving his dad to carry the film.  Uncle Joe is just a throw in to keep the family employed and adds nothing to the film.  The three drug goons are wretched.
Charlie Sheen's once bright career continues to grind gears with this clunker.  I rated it a 4/10.  Action lovers might enjoy it, but others will want to pass.",976924800,9,847,4.8125

7928344,2,B00004Z4SJ,"This was a bad movie. Not a 1 star but not a 3 star. The script was terrible and completely not believable. Four members of a drug ring hiding out in a van, a drug processing lab located in a building which seemed to be under construction, etc. The theme was good but the scripts to bring it across were silly or better said, preposterous.

I love Charlie Sheen and Martin Sheen movies generally but this was bad. Not as bad as ""The American"" with George Clooney though, which rated a 1 star to me. However Ed Estevez was a nice touch.  I would not recommend this movie(No Code of Conduct). Sorry charlie!",1392681600,,605,4.345132743362832
7928345,4,B00004Z4SJ,My husband had been looking for this movie for years. They filmed it where my husband grew up and he wanted his own copy.,1373068800,,121,4.083333333333333
7928346,5,B00004Z4SJ,"Please do not adjust your screen resolution as you have read that title correctly. This movie was actually written by Bret Michaels and Charlie Sheen, with Bret taking 100% control over the direction portion. That statement is almost too unreal to believe, but we assure you it's true. When the opening credits rolled telling us this information we just assumed it was some guy also named Bret Michaels. However when the bald cowboy appeared in the opening scene we realized this was actually happening. In addition to this momentous occasion is the cast starring Charle, his dad Martin, and B movie veteran Uncle Joe Estevez. All this is honestly too much to process at once, so we advise to take a moment to let it all sink in. It's essentially one of the greatest on-screen trio's since Don, Chad, & Mike in Death Ring. As you would expect, No Code of Conduct is the perfect blend of rogue cop B that we always long for. What really made it special was revisiting the film after briefly watching it late night back in the early 2000's. We didn't give it a full viewing back then and that's something we'll regret for years to come.

No Code of Conduct opens with a drug deal going down. Bret Michaels, dressed in his typical bandana/cowboy hat combo, winds up getting his throat slit after being exposed as an undercover cop. Flash forward to officer Jake Peterson (Sheen of the Charlie variety) and his partner Paul DeLucca as they're doing a practice drug bust run by Chief Martin Sheen. The great thing is in this scene Charlie looks like he just blew through an 8-ball before showing up on set, which is probably very accurate. Jake is known for his hot shot cop antics that have put him at odds with his wife and young daughter. Chief Martin Sheen plays his dad in the movie and always tries to get Jake to calm down. But as we all know, you can't control Charlie. After a huge drug bust got wrong Chief Sheen and his coworker John Bagwell (played by principle Richard Vernon) are at odds over the further investigation. Turns out principle Vernon is in bed with a major drug lord, aiding him in bringing $5 mil worth of heroine on to the streets. This becomes exposed once a van taken for evidence is pulled apart by Uncle Joe Estevez, who discovers the heroine. When Charlie Sheen see's it his eyes light up like a kid on Christmas morning. They had to keep reminding him it was only a movie and the drugs weren't real. In the end the drug lord's ring was taken down with one of the most incredible explosions scenes we have ever seen.

No Code of Conduct is a direct to video masterpiece that should be on any B action lover's list. This movie is oozing with B perfection. The only thing missing was a cameo from Emilio and the movie would be placed in our top 10. When you look at the Bret Michaels factor, the entire family Sheen family reunion taking place and a dose of principle Vernon, you simply can do no wrong. We also must credit the actor playing the drug lord for having one of the most hilarious performance's ever. This guy struggles through each poorly delivered line as if he was reading from cue cards. He also took great pleasure in the art of the tough guy whisper routine...something that takes years of experience to master. With all these great aspects you have some of the greatest explosions found in a B flick. The end explosion extravaganza is one that will go down in history. Watching the drug lab explode as the workers get launched from spring boards was side splitting funny. It brought us right back Death Ring finale with springboard perfection. There's nothing negative that could be said for No Code of Conduct as it embodies the spirit of rogue cop action B.",1341705600,4,3705,4.528358208955224
7928347,3,B00004Z4SJ,"I got this movie a few months ago and just now watched it. I wouldn't buy it again; however, it has a good message for drug dealers. It was better than I was expecting; although I wasn't expecting much. The rated R is for violence and language.",1330819200,,244,4.212765957446808
7928348,5,B00004Z4SJ,I love this movie and it was filmed here in the Phoenix area.  They used the old race tract for the explosive scenes.  It makes it a little more special to me.,1318464000,,159,3.9375
