1281425,5,B00003CXR3,"I always watch anime and love that style of movies, and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon brought those anime's to life, it has every type of movie in it, so if you like a certain kind of movie, see it, if you like a combination of types of movies, you'll like it even more, if you like anime, you'll love this movie, it's my favorite movie right now, I view the only downfall of this movie is not having a regular ending, it had a crazy ending, for some movies that makes it better, like in anime's, but I'm still not used to it in regular movies, if and when I ever do, this will be the ultimate movie, I know I will never get tired of this movie, because it is subtitled, it makes the experience new every time, you discover something new every time.",990835200,,750,4.179310344827586
1281426,5,B00003CXR3,"The remarkable thing about this movie is not its narrative.  Taken from a book by Du Lu Wang (which has been described in more than one place as ""pulp""), there are elements within that we've all seen before: the headstrong young girl not wanting to go through with her arranged marriage; the smoldering but never realized love between two friends; the ""you killed my master twenty years ago so now you must die"" plot device.  These are not original.  Doesn't matter.
Take a look at what director Ang Lee puts on the screen.  On one hand, it's just gorgeous.  Witness the first crane-shot of Peking, the labyrinthine compound of Governor Yu, the desert, the reed forest, and the peasant village.  All are presented with wonderfully composed shots, which calls to mind haiku poetry rather than cinema.  On the other hand, it's kinetic and exhilarating.  I'm talking, of course, of the wonderful fight scenes.  Akin to ""The Matrix"", yes (same choreographer), but different in a very important way.  Whereas ""The Matrix"" was riddled with bullets and explosions, ""Crouching Tiger"" works well with its silences.  The Wudan warriors are economical in their movements, whether they are gliding on air, or wielding a sword.  Thus, the fight scenes are compact and quick, rather than flashy and fast.  And they are just astounding to watch.  My favourite pits Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) against Jen Yu (Ziyi Zhang) in the reed forest.  If you can suspend your disbelief, then I guarantee you'll see nothing as wondrous in the cinema this year.  The forest bends and sways as the combatants perform a samurai-like duel as if walking on tightropes.  Not to be outdone, Jen has two magnificent fights with Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), one at night in the courtyard and one in Yu's training ground.  They are both balletic and engrossing.
The actors here are all top notch.  Chow is strong as steel, yet manages litheness unparalleled in my memory.  There's a quiet scene near the middle of the film, where he practices Tai Chi like movements (with a warrior's edge) alone in a courtyard.  It's almost as thrilling to watch his power and grace in this scene than in his fight scenes.  Throw in his thespian eyes and you've got a real charismatic star.  Only he's not really the star, is he?  He takes a backseat in terms of screen time to the two women.  And they surely deserve it.  Yeoh is all quiet dignity, fierce intelligence, and repressed emotion.  Yet she can kick your ass six ways from Sunday if provoked properly.  Contrast this with the determination and passion that newcomer Zhang brings, and you see why Chow wasn't needed all that much.  Throw in a charismatic Chen Chang as Lo (he supplies both the love interest and comic relief), and you have a fine ensemble cast.",990489600,6,2767,4.754201680672269
1281427,4,B00003CXR3,"A solid film, but if falls short of being amazing. Ang Lee has done a magnificent job with the cast and a limited budget. A little too much flying around wrecks the importance of this film, which is to tell an epic story of love and destiny. When I saw this in the theaters, I heard giggling and laughing during the ridiculous flying scenes.",988848000,2,341,4.34375
1281428,5,B00003CXR3,"This movie was originally filmed in Mandarin with English subtitles but that is GOOD!! Chow Yun-Fat (Anna And The King), Michelle Yeoh (007:Tomorrow Never Dies) and newcomer Ziyi Zhang star in a spectacular romance-drama-action movie set in a time where women were given more respect and ALL people were treated equal. The special effects really dazzled and amazed me and are EXCELLENT. This movie REALLY DEFIES ALL the laws of gravity to the extreme!!! Parents, this movie is a little too violent for kids under 12. Should've won ALL the Oscars it was nominated for. Why didn't it win Best Visual Effects?  This movie is one of those breathless roller-coaster rides you DON'T want to miss!!! This eye-popping thriller SHOULD'VE been rated PG.",988761600,5,743,5.040650406504065
1281429,5,B00003CXR3,"I can't believe how good this movie is. When I saw it, i was totally amazed at how awesome it was!!! everything is perfect. The fighting is amazing, and so is the story! This is a need to see movie! Get it when it comes out! I Will!!",987724800,,233,3.875
1281430,5,B00003CXR3,"When Ang Lee first released Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, I sincerly doubt he thought it would garnish so much publicity... the fact that it has is a testament to his almost-magical skills as a director. The movie boasts a consummate cast, including Chow Yun-Fat (Anna and the King) and follows the life of a young noble woman in china, desperately seeking the adventurous, unrestrained life of a warrior. This film contains many flawless fighting scenes which are at least tantamount to those seen in ""The Matrix"", if not excedingly spectacular.
One scene in this movie, in particular, astounded me... the ""tree"" scene, in which two warriors duke it out, flying and peddling through the lush, tropical asian flora in swaying white robes.
This movie contained all the depth and breadth of classical greek mythology, all the drama and verve of tragic-romances, and yet, remained very well acted for such a kinesthetic film.
Ang Lee's flick deserved much more than 4 Academy Awards, and if you haven't already seen this... I entreat you...please do! It is a motion picture experience you WON'T soon forget!!!!!!!!!!",985824000,11,1115,5.098360655737705
1281431,2,B00003CXR3,"I have gone to see the movie based on critics and commercial reviews that the movie is a candidate for OSCAR (best movie). I was disappointed as it lacks most of the qualities. 75% or more of the time were scenes for people fighting with each other, where is the art or creativity in that? The special effects are good but that is it. I remember I saw similar movies when I was a kid for Bros-lee and other Karatte heroes, but these were kids movies, not ones that compete for the Oscar. The acting was very unnatural and poor. And there was this long flash-back that took about 30 minutes, in which I thought I was seeing another movie.",985478400,8,637,4.316666666666666
1281432,5,B00003CXR3,"When I saw the film the first time, I thought that Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon is not a proper name for the film as the name implies a lot of ""yang"" power as derived from a large number of warriors or swordsman fighting in big battles, something like a Chinse Kurosawa samurai film, or an Apollonian epic in the westerners' sense.  So may it I should give it a four stars, I thought, as it failed to be a ""real"" wuxia epic.
Then I saw the film the second time.  I began to understand that it was a better film than I first thought.  And the title serves the film well.  It must also be a qualified five-star film and even one of the classic or masterpiece in film history.  It must be one of the best 100 films if AFI re-counted the best 100, that is, if CTHD could be regarded as a Hollywood Film.
First the casting is perfect.  Chow Yun-fat is the best choice as a romantic wuxia swordsman as he could act as Li Mubai a taoist swordsman who knows woman's feelings but on the other hand also a master of Taoist wisdom and Chinese masculinity.  It is also the film of Michelle Yeoh in which she showed she could really act well (the rest of her film wasted her talents, I am afraid), to the credit of Ang Lee who must have given her a lot of acting advice, I believe.  Then Zhang Ziyi is a knockout actress - the perfect Jen - sensitive, sensual and sensational -an upstart Saint Joan whom all masters want to disciple.
Second the music composed by Tan Dun and played by Ma Yo-yo is just a magic touch of Michaelangelo - the drum beats and the cello are just like brush of energy and emotions mixed together, a perfect balance of yin and yang; and the film, a balance of action and romance.
I have seen quite a number of reviews in Amazon and I think quite a number of western reviewers have misunderstood the movie.  It is not an action film like one from Bruce Lee and it is not a romantic film like Chow's An Autumn's Tale (which Chow showed he could be a real romantic actor).  It is actually a film in which the Director Ang Lee searched for his Chinese orign, a film of Chinese philosophy, Chinese psychology and Chinese art and medicine as embracive as the Book of Change, but intended mainly for the western audience with a message.  In this sense, I finally found the title of the film Crouching Tiger and Hiddren Dragon suits perfectly as it demonstrated the tremendous psyche exhibited by the film - a hidden power for love, hatred, self-destruction in all human being.  This is why, I believe, one reviewer compares the film to a Greek tragedy.
See it, and understand more about Chinese culture, and the message Ang Lee wanted to convey: we human being are just the same (be it Oriental or Occidental), vulerable and bigoted as the mortal or may be even the immortal as depicted in the Greek mythology.  A classic when east meets west.",985305600,33,2853,4.340225563909774
1281433,5,B00003CXR3,"As well as being beautiful, this is actually the best film I've seen. Ignore any ideas that subtitling the film makes it any more difficult to watch. I'm sure you'll agree your brain can do two things at once quite capably. I actually believe that if the film was in English, it would certainly lose the majesty and mystique it instills. This film is not overrated. Gladiator is overrated. MI:2 was overrated. Godzilla was overrated. This is as close as movies get to perfection.",984268800,10,479,4.714285714285714
1281504,3,B00003CXR3,"I am a fanatic for the old martial arts films.  Give me special
affects which are off the wall (to an extent).  In this movie
how far across the mountain over the trees and thru the woods
does a duel have to go before the action finally takes place?
Don't get me wrong the fighting (when there was some) was
excellent.  But this movie dragged on to a point where the wires
hanging from the fighters back to help them cross country finally
became so obvious it became annoying.  I mean you know the wires
are there but DAMN! The invisible wires got more of a debut then
the artists themselves!
I personally thought this movie was a waste of time. Yet, I don't
take credit away from the fighters (who were masters) especially
the females. Their skills were outstanding but displayed after
what seemed  20 minute lapses of talking, flying, and flying, and
flying across what seemed the whole universe on yes that damn
""VISIBLE"" wire!",1020643200,2,930,4.544910179640719
1281505,4,B00003CXR3,"Ang Lee did a fantastic job in this movie. The cast was great, even though Jet Li would make a much better Li Bai. The film was shot beautifully and the scenery was spectecular. Yuen Wo Ping did it again with his intricate choreography. One of the things I like about his work is that the characters never really did ""wire-fight"", but they actually fight on the ground. The score of the film was elegent and sometimes very fast in fight sequences.
One problem I have with the movie is the story. It was good, but not deep. I don't find the story that compelling. I think this is a great movie ....",1020124800,2,597,4.292035398230088
1281506,1,B00003CXR3,"Being a hug fan of martial arts and similar action movies, I thought Crouching Tiger would be another film added to my library.  Forget it.  I couldn't even watch the whole thing through without nearly falling asleep.  The sequences are ok but the flying is just ridiculous.  The story is so thin - the search for an ancient sword.  The subtitles distract from watching the footage.  How in the world did this one get these Acadmey Awards??",1020124800,5,440,4.64935064935065
1281507,3,B00003CXR3,"That's the usual comment I hear from people who have seen this movie. And I agree.
Personally, I enjoyed the visual appeal and technical merit of this movie.  But I felt rather unsatisfied when I had finished watching it for the first time.  Probably because of all the hype surrounding the movie.
The appeal of this movie to a younger audience is obvious (although its not suitable for very young children). And its good entertainment for everyone else, its got something to appeal to everyone.
I would highly recommended seeing the movie and making your decision.",1017446400,3,565,4.875
1281508,4,B00003CXR3,"I'll be brief - it was a believable storyline (when I finally
understood it ), and the fighting sequences were right on the money. What spoiled this movie for me was TOO DAMM MUCH flying through the air; not even the best Shaw Brothers movies relied
on that much aerial antics (and those of us who know the name ""Shaw Brothers"" would understand).
Moral: ""The Matrix"" is slowly becoming a double-edged sword
where special effects are concerned (in my book).",1013212800,2,456,4.7125
1281509,3,B00003CXR3,"Heck with the story...Greek tragedy? What are the editors of amazon smoking, anyway? Nonetheless, a very pretty chopsocky flick with flying kung fu out the wazoo, mostly done by women. You can get up and watch your popcorn in the microwave or do your dishes thru the mid-movie romance fugue, too. How considerate of Lee, though he might have done as well with the word ""Intermission"".",1013126400,2,384,4.833333333333333
1281510,2,B00003CXR3,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (Ang Lee, 2001)

I feel like something of an apostate saying this about a film directed by Ang Lee (The Ice Storm and many other  fine films), and starring Chow Yun-Fat (The Corruptor and many other fine films) and Michelle Yeoh (Tomorrow Never Dies and many other... oh, well, you can't win 'em all),  nominated for more academy awards than Steven Spielberg has teeth, and ranked at one time at #6 on IMDB's all-time top 250 (as I write this, it languishes-- relatively-- at  #27) but Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon left me cold. Worse yet, I think the very reason the film had so little effect on me is the exact reason most of those who loved it so did--  the choreography. The fight scenes were so impossibly over-the-top that the film lost anything that could be considered realism after the first ten minutes. Even the worst Jackie  Chan movie retains at least a modicum of realism (note I do realize while saying this that that's because Jackie Chan does his own stunts, and if we didn't all know that,  etc.).

Were it possible to divorce the surrounding film from the fight scenes therein, you'd still have a pretty flat  movie. The plot takes a few amusing twists now and again, but the script is written with a jaundiced eye towards the ""You! Killed! My! Brother! Now!... I must!... kill you!"" dialogue parodied so many times by so many films, and it never gives a hint that it's not taking itself seriously.

If you thought The Matrix would have been a far superior film without the special effects, you really want to avoid  this. The Corruptor will do you one better. Trust me. **",1012521600,9,1625,4.607638888888889
1281511,1,B00003CXR3,"OK, there was a hint of a good story in here, but this turkey was way more style than substance.
Totally odd looking effects....you could almost see the wires lifting the actors and actresses.",1012262400,9,192,4.676470588235294
1281512,4,B00003CXR3,"This was truly a wonderful film. The storyline was everything you could want in one! Fantasy, in its most stunning form, was presented here. There were some unneeded parts - like the ""bedroom"" scenes, but other than that, this film was amazing.",1012003200,3,244,4.833333333333333
1281513,5,B00003CXR3,"While I won't pretend to know all there is to know about Eastern Philosophy and the Martial Arts, I do know what I like and what feeds my soul and this brilliant film does that in spades. Directed by Ang Lee with a touch of magic, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" has the feel and pacing of a Shakespearean tragedy, but packs more action into it's exquisitely staged battle sequences than a thousand tired Hollywood retreads. The acting of stars Michelle Yeoh, Zhang Ziyi, and the legendary Chow Yun Fat anchors this beautifully told story (to me, the underlying love between it's two main characters is the real story here) and manage to strike a stunning balance between the violence of the fight scenes and serenity of thier quiet longing for one another. The story itself is fairly simple, but the execution is astounding.
""Crouching Tiger..."" also features some of the best special effects ever seen in modern cinema and will surely capture and enrapture all who are blessed to witness it. One viewing is all it takes, and the barriers of the language, culture and politics of the setting will melt away, and you're left with one of the greatest cinematic experiences ever. A Modern Classic.",1011139200,2,1196,4.810679611650485
1281610,5,B00003CXR3,"I just wanted to say, this was one of my favorite movies. I went to see it before it was released at regular movie theaters. It was at a local theater that shows films that may or may not come to the big screen. I took my fiance, and he had no idea that it would be in subtitles. I wasn't sure if he would be able to appreciate it with the subtitles. I chose to wait and let him find out on his own. We were both fascinated with the movie. We were at the edge of our seats, with all the action. It even had some romance. After 5 minutes, I didn't even realize I was
reading subtitles. I swear, I speak and understand Mandarin.",1010188800,4,626,3.937007874015748
1281611,5,B00003CXR3,"Wow. I cry everytime I see this. Be warned however, this is no lifetime flick, you have to be deep yourself to understand the depth in this movie. But whatever you do, DON'T GET THE DUB! Seeing this movie dubbed is far worse than not seeing it at all. The english dubbers even to bad chinese accents- it's awful!",1007424000,,312,4.305084745762712
1281612,5,B00003CXR3,"""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" brilliantly shows the Chinese culture dealing with the martial arts. The flying scenes during battle exemplify the belief that once a martial arts student has reached mastery, they gain extraordinary powers. This belief has been handed down through centuries of stories depicting the great martial artist of China.
Also, the use of the straight sword by the protagonist is correct. According to ancient beliefs, the straight sword is the weapon for masters. However, this mastery not only deals with martial art skills, but also a mastery of moral character. This is shown in the film by Yun-Fat Chow who is a moral and upright citizen who demonstrates the proper way to live. This is the main reason why the Green Destiny must be returned to Chow.
If you are looking for a wonderful film that shows part of a great Chinese tradition, look no further!",1006819200,3,884,4.939597315436242
1281613,5,B00003CXR3,"Jen is at first a delicate flower with hidden talents and an exciting past. Her passion for fighting and adventure almost consume her. Her forbidden love with Lo holds everything she wants in life, yet by custom she must follow the path her parents set for her and resigns herself to their wishes and an arranged marriage.

She then meets Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) who is in love with Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat). Yu Shu Lien and Jen (Zhang) alternate between being friends and enemies, but hold a deep respect for one another. Their sword fighting scenes are incredible. The sheer power they seem to possess as women would be astonishing in real life. This is of course fantasy and the flying scenes never for a minute seem out of place once you put them in a fairy tale perspective.

Subtle tensions burn slowly in the characters causing them at times to burst into flames as the action awakens to new heights. The canyon cave with a hot tub warmed with heated rocks and horse riding in the dessert add such romantic appeal.

When Yu Shu Lien says: ""To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger."" Li Mu Bai replies: ""You're right. But I don't know what to do."" They seem to have no restrictions in life, yet their hearts are chained. Not even the Green Destiny sword can cut through these chains wrapped around their hearts. Throughout the story, the sword makes its appearance and empowers the fight scenes.

What I loved about this movie was that women can be strong yet feminine. They can reach for the stars and still enjoy the pleasures of love.

For those who have always dreamed of flying through a forest or bathing in a hot tub heated with rocks from a fire nearby. Let your imagination travel to a different time and place. Become a character and you will never forget this movie. Some of the lines are filled with deep emotion and spiritual beauty.

Only those who see beauty in the hearts of others will see the true meanings. If you have always received everything you wanted in life, this movie will hold little meaning for you. The final scene is one of the most beautiful and inspirational moments in any movie I have ever seen.

Watch by candlelight and have herbal tea nearby. ;>

1281614,4,B00003CXR3,"There's no other word to describe this film other than beautiful.  Despite that sounded clichd, it's very true were 'Crouching Tiger' is concerned.  Ang Lee revolutinises the martial arts film by making it accessible to a much wider audience.  He does this through making the plot similar to that of a thousand films these days - the feminist standpoint, love through the social classes etc.  Conventional this may be, but it's entirely absorbing and you will find yourself mesmerised by the entire spectacle of it.  The tale of love never fufilled is gorgeously played by Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh (who proves that she's much more than a Bond girl).  Also impressive is the stunning photography of empty deserts, solitary mountains and lush forests.  Obviously stand-out though are the fight scenes, which are choreogrpahed by the same guy as in 'The Matrix', and it shows.  Especially impressive are the fight scenes between Zhang Ziyi and Michelle Yeoh and the fight in the treetops.  Yet what is most memorable about this is the fact that it is, quite simply, cinema at its very best.  It goes all out and it delivers in style.",1006300800,2,1136,4.839378238341969
1281615,4,B00003CXR3,This movie was fun as it brought you into the world of Chinese legend. It was a wonderfully made movie although quite confusing at times. (I'll have to admit that I couldn't follow all the Chinese names and I couldn't follow exactly what was going on.) I'm sure this movie has a more symbollic sense but I failed to make it out. The ending was especially confusing to me. Other than that it was a great movie with great fight scenes.,1005955200,,433,4.3580246913580245
1281616,5,B00003CXR3,"Being a fan of Asian cinema it was great to see that an Asian film finally recieved the praise that so many are deserving. Director Ang Lee has created a fantastic tale of love and he had the good taste to incorporate numerous fight scenes in it as well. These fight scenes have, quite naturally, become the center of attention in virtually every single review of the film. My review is no different. While it is essentially a love story, it's the fantastic fights that really make it stand out.
The fights are in no way realistic, with people running on walls, jumping from rooftop to rooftop - or treetop to treetop - while at the same time fighting with hands, feet, swords and anything else that comes in the way. Even more impressive is the fact that no digital altering was used to create these scenes. These incredible effects were made using wires attached to the actors, making it possible for them to perform these gravity-defying stunts.
For more action of this kind, check out some of Jet Li's earlier films (before he made ""Lethal weapon 4"") like ""Last Hero In China"", and the ""Fong Sai Yuk""-series.",1003795200,,1112,4.621212121212121
1281617,3,B00003CXR3,"I love Crouching Tiger, it's one of my very favorite movies, but it gave me a nasty shock when the first line came out as ""Li is back!!"" not in Chinese.
It got worse from there.  While the voices for Shu-lien and Li Mu Bai were alright (they were probably done by Michelle Yoah and Chow Yun-Fat, who can speak english), Shao-Long's (Jen) and Lo's and pretty much everyone else's were really bad.  It also became confusing. Jade Fox was not only referred to as 'Jade Fox' but as something in Chinese as well, an attempt at retaining bits of the original, I suppose, but a pretty pathetic one.
This is a movie that deserves to be kept as close to the original as possible, not Americanized in the slightest.  Dubbing destroys it.",1003622400,2,727,4.451127819548872
1281618,5,B00003CXR3,"This film has an excellent theme, photography and acting. When I first saw it, I was completely amazed due to the incredible message and the beautiful settings shown. It has all the details needed to make an extraordinary film, from the fighting scenes to a hidden love story. It is not an ordinary movie thanks to the profound oriental massage it holds.",1003276800,,354,4.725806451612903
1281619,4,B00003CXR3,"but then it happened AGAIN to me, Incredible Shrinking Movie! Which is to say, some movies need to be seen on the big screen because when you rent them, they seem a lot less significant than in the theatre (see my review of Kate Winslet's ""Titanic"" for another entry in this category).
So that's part of the reason I cannot give it 5 stars. The other reason is that the film goes off on a major tangent when we learn about the Young People's love affair. Time to get out your scissors and edit it yourself to keep the momentum going.
All that being said, I enjoyed ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" much more than I ever thought I would. I was curious to see it solely because it was directed by Ang Lee, who did such admirable work with ""Sense and Sensibility"", a great favorite of mine. When I tried to organize an outing among my friends, I was met with great resistance because they wouldn't see an Asian movie or a martial arts film starring nobody they ever heard of. The two people most inclined to go declined as they had actually seen it already, but applauded my wishing to see it, as they enjoyed it. So in the end, I went with three people who were more interested in the promised Mexican dinner afterwards. EVERYONE WAS SURPRISED to FIND THEY LOVED IT! Yes, it was effectively acted and superbly filmed in breathtaking outdoor locations. Art direction first rate. And the fighting was choreographed in a balletic style which was utterly graceful. The much-talked about flying sequences gave the movie a fairy-tale feeling, like something out of the Arabian nights. And, except for that trip to the Young People's Love Affair, the story line was very good. I was surprised to see that it was really a Women's Picture, with most of the fighting concerning them and the storyline featuring them almost to the exclusion of the male characters.
So, I would recommend ""Crouching Tiger"" heartily to folks who think they never could, ever would like a martial arts movie. There's a lot more hidden than just the dragon!",1002931200,7,2023,4.622222222222222
1281660,3,B00003CXR3,"A combination of impressive fight scenes, a not-that-original story, and a lot of really long, really boring periods.  When I see a movie, I want to be entertained, and I'm sorry, but I'm just not entertained to learn about the intracacies of the personal battle that Chow Yun Fat's character is having, or the rest of them.  And another thing, that fight in the trees?  Pfffff... with all the capabilities they obviously had for action in this movie, why would you waste it on a piece of tripe like that?  This movie would have been much more successful as a movie if it was about an hour shorter and, therefore, 2 times faster.  If you're looking for a ""work of art,"" plenty of ""artistic"" buzzwords have been attached to this one.  However, if you're looking to be entertained at the movies, I would recommend any number of martial arts movies that don't slow you down with lame character development attempts or the facade that this one exhibits that it's something more than the action.  Big Trouble in Little China comes to mind.",1002758400,,1034,4.648351648351649
1281661,3,B00003CXR3,"I think like a lot of people, by the time I saw this movie it had been built up so much that disappointment was inevitable.  I liked a number of things about it.  I actually did like the fight scenes, and the flying didn't bother me at all; I thought it was rather lovely, really.  Michelle Yeoh's dignity and grace magnified her beauty; I saw her in Tomorrow Never Dies and didn't think much of her but here she was just wonderful.  So much has been made of the strong women in this movie, though, that one of the things that disappointed me was that she is so often the one to screw up and then be bailed out by Chow Yun Fat.  Now, he's another of the disappointments.  I loved him in Anna and the King, but he's a little flat in this.
Here's the thing:  it's well-acted.  Many of the fight scenes are wonderful.  But it's clearly supposed to be deep and moving, and for me it was neither of those things.  If it hadn't been billed as a life-changing movie I probably would have liked it more, but because that's how it was talked about, I can only feel like it ultimately fails.",1002585600,4,1081,4.203883495145631

I'm reminded of another movie that had a COMPLETELY extraneous character in it . . . Star Wars Episode 1 and ole Jar Jar Binks.  You could completely delete the entire desert prince and desert scene from the movie, and it would make absolutely no difference to the outcome, character development, or anything else.  Here's my recommendation, get the movie, edit out the middle 45 minutes of the movie, and then disregard any references to this love interest, and you'd have a pretty good movie.",1000598400,,738,4.7421875

1281667,5,B00003CXR3,"Forrest Gump over Pulp Fiction.  Titanic over L.A. Confidential.  To a very long list of mistakes, the Academy can add its most grievous offense yet:  naming Gladiator best picture over Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.
It isn't so much that Gladiator is a shallow, shoddy piece of work that shouldnt be within a ten-mile radius of the best picture category; its more that Crouching Tiger, Ang Lees visionary martial-arts epic, is the sort of blazing masterpiece that seems to redefine the purpose of movie-watching as an activity.  It is that good.
Since its rapturous critical reception and its overwhelming popular success, Crouching Tiger has suffered the inevitable backlash by people who choose to call it an unremarkable twist on the wuxia genre, a movie that seems impressive only because we haven't seen all the similar movies that came before it.  If this is true, if Crouching Tiger is indeed just another wuxia film, then we might as well call Gone With the Wind just another romance.  We might as well call Double Indemnity just another film noir.  We might as well call The Godfather just another Mob movie.  You get the picture.
Not that Crouching Tiger doesnt echo genre conventions.  On the contrary, director Ang Lee freely and unabashedly flirts with clichs; the difference is that rather than merely rehashing them, Lee breathes new life into them with the sort of bold, breathtaking imagination you only encounter in an artist at the peak of his powers.  He tweaks them with a sort of childlike glee thats half-mischievous, half-enchanted--and the result is a seamless entertainment that manages to fuse several elements at once without ever losing its shape.  Its as fluid and controlled as anything Lees directed, the rare film that you admire as much for its careful craftsmanship as for the way it makes your spirit soar.
It begins with two powerful warriors, Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) and Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), who have always restrained their feelings for one another out of respect and honor for Shu Liens slain husband, who was Li Mu Bais friend.  A stolen sword, a secret manual, and an evil assassin eventually figure into the ridiculously elaborate plot, and by that point you can tell that Lee is having a lot of fun with the details.  The most volatile catalyst in the story turns out to be Jen (Zhang Ziyi), a young, vivacious beauty who longs to be a warrior and demonstrates
incredible fighting prowess.  Unfortunately, shes trapped by her aristocratic upbringing and is being forced into marriage, even though shes secretly in love with a roguish bandit named Lo (Chang Chen), which is revealed to us in a long, absorbing flashback that would indeed be ponderous and distracting if it weren't so deliriously entertaining.
Lee juggles these elements with astonishing skill, moving from humor (the scene in which Jen single-handedly destroys the restaurant may be one of the giddiest sequences in comedic history) to drama (the films final scenes, which are haunting beyond words) without dropping a stitch.  What elevates Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon above the roots of its genre, and what short-sighted critics seem willing to ignore, is the superb ensemble cast, from which the film derives its considerable emotional power.  The most notable are Yeoh, who can kick the ... out of anyone and still look elegant, and Ziyi, who more than deserved an Oscar nomination for her supremely hot-headed ingenue.
Its the brilliance of Crouching Tiger that these actors manage such surprising depths of emotion even while they're spinning out one unforgettable fight scene after another.  If Crouching Tiger were merely the derivative, one-dimensional flick so many people say it is, it would still be a viscerally dazzling entertainment.  Theres just something about the sight of Yeoh and Ziyi soaring from rooftop to rooftop, clashing swords with enviable grace, that inspires and gratifies like nothing else.  The word intoxicating comes to mind.  As it is, the action sequences are only one recommendable aspect of a film that attempts everything and nails everything, without a single false note from beginning to end.
Just another wuxia film?  Ha.  They should all be this good.",997833600,17,4215,5.0519480519480515
1281668,5,B00003CXR3,"I must say I knew nothing about Chinese Films or Martial Arts, and my husband brought this movie home several times from the rental place before I took the time to actually watch it.  But boy was I surprized!  What I expected to be a long, tedious, boring Chinese martial arts film with subtitles (yuck, I said), turned out to be one of the most beautiful, action-packed cinematic treats I'd seen all year!
I must say I was initally taken aback by the almost immediate display of roof-top flying and acrobatic martial arts ( I recognized Matrix-like effects right off the bat--but I couldn't stand that movie because I couldn't follow the story)--in Crouching Tiger these fighting scenes become a wonderful medium to showcase the talents of the stars and the unbelievable techniques now being seen in quite a few films (called 'wire-work').  In CTHD the wonderous ballet and martial arts displays highly enhanced the intricate and sublime emotions surrounding honor, women's roles in 1920's Peking (could be in ANY time), and the intense grip that love of a magical sword and Chow Yan Fat has on each of them.  Once I realized that the movie centered around obtaining the magical ancient sword and it's incredible powers it became much easier for me to understand and I could focus on the charismatic performances and breathtaking scenery.
Someone had said that the sequence in the desert depicting Zhang Zi Yi's romance with the wild bandit was boring--far from it!  I thoroughly enjoyed this small slice of romance/love-making!  It reminded me of the old westerns or perhaps Clint Eastwood meets Katharine Hepburn...a tough, beautifully smart and tough well-bred woman with the spirit of a unbroken filly takes on a wild-west gunslinger (no guns, here actually) and falls in love with him despite her hell-bent intent NOT to. Their love story is just a tangent off the main story surrounding the sword, but once it is introduced it becomes an integral part of the movie and the backbone of the intense emotion of the girl and her desire to keep going, keep the sword the win out in the end.
All in all I was throughly delighted with this movie, and became oblivious to the Mandarin and didn't mind reading the subtitles at all.  I almost forgot about it, actually...which is proof that the movie is so well made that the language barrier becomes completely insignificant and shouldn't scare off people who think they would not appreciate a Chinese movie with subtitles.  It is sooooo much more than that!  If you like action a la Indian Jones, love stories and beautiful cinematography--get this movie!  Being a woman, I also must say I was entirely pleased to see a movie about incredibly strong women and loved the fact that it centered on these women and their strength, emotionally and PHYSICALLY.  No wimpy women here, or men either.  This movie kept my attention the entire time and I was still thinking about it for weeks after, entranced by it's beauty and magic. It was probably the only foreign film I saw all of last year, and it had to be the best.  A beautiful experience!",996796800,5,3087,4.80188679245283
1281669,5,B00003CXR3,"Shot entirely in mainland China, and using the most modern technical effects, this video has the best martial arts action scenes I have ever seen.  Subtitled in Chinese, the story is simple to follow.  Yun-Fat Chow of ""Anna and the King"" is cast as the hero who is searching for the killer of his master.  But the film belongs entirely to the women.  Michelle Yeoh is cast as the woman warrior who has not married him because of family complications; not only is she an accomplished martial artist, but this role calls for some serious acting. There's an older woman Pei-pei Cheng, another fantastic martial artist who plays the villain.  But the most memorable performance of all is by the young Ziyi Zhang in the role of the young teenager who steals a sacred sword and flees from her arranged marriage.
The fight scenes are absolutely spectacular!  Choreographed with exquisite artistry, they mostly feature the women.  You have to suspend a bit of belief in the real world though, because these sword fighters have the ability to walk up walls,  leap a dozen stories high, and even fly.  But it's all done so well, that I just sat and watched in amazement, the story merely a backdrop to this action.  Feminists will applaud this film;  it demonstrates women's physical strength and endurance like no other.  Yes, it is violent, but the fact that it is fantasy dilutes that effect.  And themes of love, honor and vengeance drive the story forward.  Highly recommended.",996364800,2,1472,4.7896825396825395

I felt like I was going to go to sleep alot of times in the movie. It seemed like I was only alert when they were fighting. And then there was a 30 minute flashback. It was unnecssarily long. I recommend seeing this movie only once unless you didn't understand it the first time.,996019200,,455,4.3023255813953485
1281731,4,B00003CXR3,"Ok, I am here to praise and to criticize this movie. First, let me make a very clear point. This is a ""Wusia"" (martial art fantasy) film, not a kung-fu movie. If you expect to see Jet Lee or Jackie....go to another place. We are talking about ""Fantasy"" here. I believe most of Chinese have seen Martial Art Fantasy novels. Characters in those novel not only can fly, can jump higher than Michael Jordan, they can also break rocks by their Chi (Internal Power). So judging this movie with some third-graded Hong Kong Martial Art films (well, there were some nice ones I wouldn't deny, but lots of them are just like Die Hard, but with a hero who can fight in style).........you got to be kidding me.
This movie is about the art of motion, background music and poetic dialogue (not including little tiger, he is the worst actor I have ever seen). It is hard for people to understand, not even today's Chinese (they have been ""hollywoodized""). I also like the conflict between each characters. For example, how Little Dragon (Yu-Jiou-long, or Jenn) struggled with Little Tiger, then Li, Mu-bai (Chow, Yan-fat) and the Sho-lien. For Little Tiger, Little Dragon hated him for stealing her stuff, then accepted the affection. For Sho-lien, Little Dragon first admired her, then fought Sho-lien because of different belief, jealousy and embarrassment......(tired of explaining, just watch the film few more times)
No film is perfect, including this movie. First, the accent of Chow Yan-fat, Michelle Yeoh (from Hong Kong) and Chang Jan (from Taiwan) are soooo bad compare to Zhang's. And the suicide at the end, Little Dragon was trying fake death (at least in the original novel) and the film said nothing about it. Then horrible acting by Chang Jan just made me laugh. Also, the bamboo scenes were not very good, because both of them were not balancing well (even a real wu-shu master will scare of height?)
Otherwise, this film is very entertaining and poetic. Even some parts are so disturbing, I will still give it a four-star. By the way, wanna see a really good movie from Asia, check out Taiwan owned Confuscion Confusion (Du li shi dai), and City of Sadness (bae ching chun shi).",995414400,10,2181,4.787798408488063

- The extremely fake action scenes. The sword parts were okay, but flying, jumping from buildings, and walking on trees was a little to much.
- There was NO PLOT. It was hard to understand what was going on, when there was no story behind it.

The first time through, I got a kick out of the fight scenes and took pride in a woman who stood up to injustice and struck out with the familiar bitterness of a star crossed lover. But later while taking a course at a local college, I was angered at the movie's choice potrayal of feminism. Yes, the fight scenes were graceful, elaborate, and well staged, and yes, the Chinese country sure did look purdy, but it showed a totally unrealistic picture of Jen's struggle. If this particular form of martial art was so hard to manage, Jen could never have escaped a fleet of guards instilled by her father. She would never have been ""let go"" by a skilled and trained master of this art. The director could have just as easily shown Jen, years later, trapped in a marriage she never wanted, refusing to let an unwilling daughter be married off. This would keep the message intended in the plot.  I did however, love the ending and the possibility that lay waiting for the watcher. it did leave a lot to contemplate, one of the reasons I was able to leave both experiences with a love for this beatifully made film.",994982400,,1229,4.41409691629956

1281736,4,B00003CXR3,"In China at the dawn of the 20th century, the lovely Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) agrees to convey a fabled sword to Peking as a gift from its owner, the legendary warrior Li Mubai (Chow Yun Fat) to their mutual benefactor, Sir Te.  Both Li and Yu are warriors, veterans of a life of battle against China's organized underworld which has both scarred them and yet turned them into the master warriors (restless and regretful) that they are recognized for.  The gift of the sword, and Yu's bringing it to Peking, are symbolic acts in both Yu and Li's lives, turnposts at which they might intersect free of their destinies and finally realize their mutual affections.  When the sword, called ""The Green Destiny"" is stolen by a masked warrior who can leap tall pagodas in a single bound, plans are put aside and the hunt is on, not so much to reclaim the sword, but to repay a debt to the evil Jade Fox, a warrior who betrayed and murdered Li's teacher.
Director Ang Lee supposedly crafted this elaborate art-house film as a high-minded tribute to the martial-arts epics of his youth, in which single warriors fight off an army of lesser fighters, while more-equal-matched bouts have the fighters hurtling through the air, as if rocketed from the planet Krypton.  But ""Tiger"" goes further, delving into the regret of its characters.  Besides Lee, we have Yu-Jen, the elfin faced girl who's prosepctive marriage to a highly-placed noble makes her pine for the life of a brigand, one she ""claims"" to know only from books, and Lo, a desert brigand with whom she has fallen in love.  Then there is the evil Jade Fox herself who puts in an appearance.  Unfortunately, Lee doesn't devote enough time to any of these compelling characters, though he does work them up excellently.  The ""Green Destiny"" itself is too quickly relegated to an object that doesn't quite hold our attention (Like that suitcase in ""Pulp Fiction"", it's quickly overshadowed by the characters that kill for it), and the mysterious thief and her awesome fighting skills take center stage.  A subplot linking the seemingly innocent Jen with the wildly exotic Lo is dropped in midway and threatens to steal the movie away, but its more than made up with by the depth brought to Lo and Jen's characters which seemed to have amassed the regret that Jade Fox, Yu and Li have taken their lives to collect.

1281816,4,B00003CXR3,"I felt sorta bad about giving this movie only four stars, because they movie itself is so awesome.  The fighting is lightning quick, the weapons and costume detail amazing, and the actors do very well. The story line is pretty cool too, this girl(a governors daughter) wants to become a warrior, and she steals this special sword, The Green Destiny, and with it she is an almost unbeatable fighter.  These two other people, one of whom the Green Destiny really belongs to, go after the girl, in hopes of getting the sword back and possibly even taking the renegade girl as a student.  There is also romance, though it is rather unlikely in the case of the governors daughter.. a bandit in the desert takes her comb, so she runs off to try and get it, and while fighting for her comb they, out of nowhere, just start kissing eachother and then they fall in love.  Its really just a pretty much basic story.  The movie was done very well, though with some rather cheesy parts in it.  I got the dubbed version just due to the fact that I didn't feel like reading the subtitles, but that was a mistake.  The dubbing is moderately well done, but in some parts it doesn't work well at all. For example, the resturant scene, where the girl is talking the whole time while fighting.  It worked very well in Mandarin, but with the dubbed voices it didn't look at all like she was speaking it, and that really sorta ruined the scene.

I'd read SO MANY raving reviews saying it was the best movie ever made, I expected to have my socks blown off -- which is a perfect setup for a letdown.
The subtitles were not a serious disadvantage; the dialog and plot were easy to follow. The acting was good, the scenery was incredible, and the fight scenes (despite the very obvious use of wires) were engaging in their way.
What detracted from my enjoyment of this movie was my inability to empathize with the focal character, Jen.  Her role as the beautiful, flawed heroine should have made her an incredibly interesting character, but I found her hard to cozy up to.  Everyone around her seemed nearly worshipful of her, able to overlook her willfulness, her duplicity, and her self-centeredness.  With that much adoration, she didn't need mine... so I felt emotionally disconnected from her.
This was, in my opinion, a fatal shortcoming.  A movie is about more than gorgeous scenery and incredible battles - it should, first and foremost, have characters we care about.  The supporting characters, though imperfect, were sympathetic in their own ways (even the villainess, who only wanted, after all, to be loved).  Yet, they circled this petulant, selfish girl like planets orbiting the sun.  It was all a bit hard to swallow.

I felt like I was transported into a dream,and I didn't want to leave. How could the academy give it to Gladiator? I believe that this will go down as a classic. If there is anyone who hasn't had the privelege of seeing this,it has everything. But I believe it is about finding yourself in life. And it revolves around two very different love stories,one is tragic,and the other is uplifting.  There is nothing more to say,again Ang Lee,you are a true genius. Thank you for giving us this great work.",990921600,2,669,4.528925619834711

7917776,5,B00003CXR3,"CTHD combines an exciting story, great stunts, beautiful cinematography, lovely women, and a complex story that is by turns mysterious, suggestive, and incomprehensible. Michelle Yeoh is a good actress in addition to her physical talents as a martial artist. Zhang Zi Yi is a sexy vixen. Chow Yun Fat is an aging warrior who seems to be going through a mid-life crisis. He loves Michelle Yeoh, but can't get around to telling her, and is attracted to Zhang. The unanswered question posed by Zhang is, ""Did you want me or my sword?"" The two women dominate this movie; their martial arts scenes are spectacular; Yo Yo Ma's cello is sad and fetching; the scenery is spectacular; the fate of Chow and Michelle is heart-rending; the fate of Zhang is puzzling and ambiguous.

7917780,5,B00003CXR3,"I almost never saw this movie. Growing up, my dad had a fascination with those really awlful martial arts film. Between the bad voiceovers, the horrible dialogue, and the laughable fight scenes, I swore that I would never watch another one again.
However, as this movie began to garner more and more praise in the United States, I began to pay more and more attention to the previews I was seeing in the theaters. Finally, I went to see it.
And I am very glad I did.
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon raised the bar on martial arts films. The choreography was absolutely stunning and fluid. The special effects were awesome. And the acting, dialogue, and poetic feel of the movie was second to none.
I have seen this movie several times now, and each time I develop a better appreciation for it. It took a couple of viewings to be able to take in both the English subtitles and the action on the screen without getting lost. But it was well worth the effort.
Indulge yourself with this movie. It is well worth the calories it will give you. :)",1023408000,4,1040,4.478947368421053
7917781,5,B00003CXR3,"Ang Lee and the gang were robbed at the Oscars by the lumbering ""Gladiator,"" a film which seemed to be the result of a studio meeting where the question was posed ""what genre could we update with blood and guts?""
Thank God this was not made in Hollywood. The entire cast is excellent without having to resort to some white guy moseying on the set to find the missing sword. In the hands of others, this could have been another ""The Golden Child,"" or a Pauly Shore vehicle (""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Wea-sel,"" anyone?). Instead, we get an actual plot, full of characterization, long flashbacks, and a story that moves.
Those seeking nonstop action scenes were probably disappointed (like Bruce Lee's films never get slow?), but the film makers should be applauded for sticking to their guns and telling a story without overwhelming it with constant action set pieces that do nothing but stop the plot and employ a herd of stunt people, like any Pierce Brosnan 007 film. The sword fights here will go down in cinematic history as some of the greatest, the ballet-like rooftop chase scenes were wonderful to behold, and the ending that I did not see coming (or maybe did not want to see coming) left me shaken. ... I strongly recommend this film.
This is rated (PG13) for physical violence, some gore, and some sexual content.",1022803200,4,1322,4.7272727272727275
