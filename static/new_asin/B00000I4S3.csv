7909588,5,B00000I4S3,"I have NEVER been truly disappointed by ANY of Boyd's Hoppy outings, and this is my very favorite of all  the great Sherman/Boyd productions.
Hoppy goes undercover as a wimpy, sappy eastern dude to  (what else?) infiltrate an outlaw gang that's after a young girls' ranch.  (sound familiar?)  The situation gives Boyd a chance to really ham it up  and its a wonder to watch.  Throw in Andy Clyde (Hoppy's best sidekick  outside of Gabby) and a really cool villian and you've got an UNBELIEVABLY  entertaining matinee oater.
Highly recommended!  AL",952905600,5,547,4.923076923076923
