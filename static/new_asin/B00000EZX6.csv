7906050,3,B00000EZX6,"Hour long DVD from some of the early '70's biggest heavy-hitter's best known songs. It's been awhile now since I've seen most of these like Deep Purple - ""Highway Star"", James Gang - ""Walk Away"", Alice Cooper's ""Under My Wheels"", Free with ""Alright Now"", Nazareth - ""Morning Dew"" among several others. More than likely than most of you have seen these snippets before on Mtv's Closet Classics, VH1 Classic, etc.",1237507200,,411,4.885714285714286

7906052,2,B00000EZX6,"I watched this DVD last week and the best thing about it was that i could remember watching some of these performances on tv in the early seventies when i lived in Holland and watched the German live music show Beatclub on saturday afternoon, beatclub later on became musikladen, but i think the majority of these clips were from the beatclub era. From memory there should be much better material available than what we get here. Some of the clips are ok, but on the majority the sound is dreadful and it only has historical an sentimental value. I was thinking of buying other musik laden titles  but after this I think i'll give them a miss. If you want good sounding historical stuff buy Woodstock orthe Great Whistle test compilation. Highlights for me were Santana and Procol Harum with an outstanding performance by BJ wilson, their drummer.",1056499200,,847,4.722972972972973
7906053,5,B00000EZX6,this is a great dvd if you never got to see a lot of bands you like live you can look at this very good bands in the early days,1012867200,,127,3.2666666666666666
7906054,4,B00000EZX6,"Featuring great sound and crystal-clear picture, this compilation of 1970-1972 live performances from the German music TV show Musikladen has some great moments.  Tops is a blistering version of Walk Away from the James Gang, Joe Walsh looking for all the world like Kurt Cobain, and the 3-piece dynamics on this cut rivals any power trio one could name.  Another standout is Nazareth's electric cover of the folkie classic Morning Dew - an eye-opener to anyone who has heard only the Hair Of A Dog-era heyday material.  Not to be missed.  The Procul Harum reading of Simple Sister has the incendiary playing of Dave Ball, successor to Robin Trower, and drummer BJ Wilson has to be seen to be believed.  Jethro Tull and Santana also make good showings.  Booby prize goes to Humble Pie for their interminable acoustic cover of the Yardbird's For Your Love.  Steve Marriot over-emotes his way through this one; bassist Greg Riddley looks like he'd rather be anywhere than on that stage.  Truly awful.  Overall, a fun purchase worth the money.  I just ordered Best of Vol. 4; where's Vol. 3?",979084800,9,1088,4.832432432432433
