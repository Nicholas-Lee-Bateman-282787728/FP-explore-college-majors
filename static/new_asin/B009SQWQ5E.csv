8544140,5,B009SQWQ5E,"I have been listening to heavy metal for over 45 years and have been to countless concerts, but a couple of months back I listened to a band that I casually heard and forgot about them until my son told me that it was Kai Hansen's (Helloween) band.  Since good metal is so hard to find these days, I gave them a good listening to and was blown away by their Power Metal style.  Then I came across Skeletons and Majesties and had to have it.  It is one of the best live performnces that I have ever bought/seen.  The uniqueness of their approach to deliver their music is a relief to how most bands just get up and play (although good) tunes, but Gamma Ray are successful at a much more relaxed setting while assaulting you with their heavy style of power metal.  Musically they are tight with an excellent selection of songs from their catalog of and personally just have fun playing them.
If you are looking for something refreshing in live Heavy Metal, I believe that you will find it here.",1467158400,,992,4.369565217391305

8544144,1,B009SQWQ5E,"like the another review above mine, this is a huge deception, I don't know why amazon offer dvd / blu rays that we cannot play in Canada or US. do not buy it because you will end up returning the video and wasting your time.",1376611200,3,224,4.0
8544145,4,B009SQWQ5E,"I've been a fan of Kai Hansen since Helloween first came on the scene. I own all the Gamma Ray album and dvd's, and had big expectations about this being a ""skeletons"" tour. First misses are the fact that they decided to do Rebellion in Dreamland (one of my favorite GR songs) and Send Me a Sign acoustically. They just pale in comparison to their original versions and I'm not quite sure why they chose to do them like this. The next miss is the inclusion of the duet w/Kiske of A While In Dreamland (boring!). Video quality was not as high as I would have expected with some pixelation present on the DVD, maybe it's not present on the Bluray.

That's not to say it's not worth getting. Notwithstanding my criticisms above, it's an outstanding performance! The sound is great, the performance of the ""electric"" songs are great!",1370304000,2,829,4.563758389261745
8544146,1,B009SQWQ5E,"I had a huge deception about this product. Can't write a review about it as I couldn't watch it.
The blu-ray disc simply doesn't play, I tried it in several devices and there's nothing on it, it starts and keeps hang in Title 5 with 00:00.",1368748800,3,239,4.217391304347826
8544147,5,B009SQWQ5E,"Skeletons & Majesties Live, released in 2013, is a concert Blu-Ray from the legendary German Power Metal band Gamma Ray, taken from their 2012 performance in Pratteln, Switzerland. Like fellow Power Metal band Stratovarius' recent Blu-Ray, this concert captures the last time the band would play with their longest serving drummer, in this case the superb Dan Zimmerman.

It's a brilliant looking and sounding concert that clocks in at 2hrs 12min. The mix and sound in general are absolutely spot-on and really suits the band's style. Everything is perfectly clear and balanced and it's a real joy to listen to. For example, the keys are neither too overpowering or indeed inaudible, the vocals are just the right volume, the kick drum is loud and punchy and overall it all just has a nice powerful sound as a whole. The only nitpick is that the audience aren't audible often, so when the band gets them to sing along it looks a bit like the audience don't know the words, but with such a brilliant product overall that's scarcely a problem.

The whole thing looks great too. They even put a lot of effort into the stage design, lighting and dry ice, this is no cheap affair. The picture for the most part is absolutely crystal clear (unless the stage lighting is interfering with the cameras).

The best thing about the whole affair is the tasteful and clean editing style. It isn't bogged down in fancy effects or screen overlays too much, the shots don't change so frequently you get motion sickness and miss all the guitar solos, and it never seems like the visuals just serve the director's artistic vision rather than giving the fans what they want. Best of all the video and audio are perfectly synced. Sometimes concert films can get a little spoiled by the editing, but this one was handled just perfectly.

The performance from the band is absolutely brilliant and the band seem to be absolutely loving every minute, it's a really fun performance, with a great atmosphere. Kai is a good front-man and gets the crowd involved as well as making little fun comments here and there about his bandmates. Dan hammers away at the drum kit energetically and the guitarists pull of some amazing solos and complex riffs and time shifts masterfully. Henjo even breaks out some high quality lead vocals briefly.

Kai's former Helloween bandmate Michael Kiske comes onstage for three songs, adding his distinctive singing to 'Time To Break Free' 'A While In Dreamland' and a cover of Heloween's 'Future World.'

The rest of the 20-track setlist (19 and an intro) is a mixture of stuff from all eras of the band's career, including the piano driven ballad 'Farewell,' and characterful acoustic reworkings of 'Rebellion In Dreamland' and 'Send Me A Sign.' The band mix fan-favourite tracks and some more obscure material, serious stuff and quirky stuff, fast stuff and slow stuff and it's a real treat to watch altogether.

The bonus features include 22-minute of behind the scenes interviews with the roadcrew (in German), a 32-minute collection of archive footage from the early days, a six track additional concert from Zeche Bochum Germany (Tracklist: The Spirit, Wings Of Destiny, Farewell, Gamma Ray, Time To Break Free, Insurrection) and the Skeletons & Majesties EP as audio.

As to the Blu-Ray specifics, this version is Region 0, Single Layer Blu-Ray, English Subtitles are available, the sound options are Dolby Stereo 2.0 or Dolby Surround 5.1, its standard is PAL and the aspect ratio is 16:9. My copy came in one of the slimmer Blu-Ray cases.

Overall, this is a superb and hugely enjoyable Blu-Ray concert with a fantastic main feature and some nice bonus features. If you are a fan of the band I absolutely recommend it. To be perfectly honest I highly recommend this even if you aren't a fan of the band yet. If you find that you like Metal concert films in general, this is a worthwhile investment. It drips with effort and conviction and you couldn't realistically ask for a higher quality release.",1361750400,4,4012,4.853801169590644
