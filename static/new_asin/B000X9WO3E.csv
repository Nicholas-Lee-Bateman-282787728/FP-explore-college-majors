8227439,3,B000X9WO3E,"I purchased this as part of the process of learning Korean, and while this show is fairly entertaining, it is useless for this purpose. The subtitles seem like they've been translated directly from Altavista, then transcribed by a high school student who has been taking English for two semesters. I have no idea what it's going on. Sometimes this makes the show unintentionally hilarious. I'm not sure why they refer to the drug kingpin as ""the cow,"" or a reward for catching him as ""the price,"" but during the odd times I manage to understand these mangled subtitles, I do enjoy them.

I don't have the DVD in front of me, but here's a bit what it's like watching.

Here's the scene after the lead detective has lost the ""price"" after chasing ""the cow"" for two years because some idiot police academy student decided to get into the action.

-You lose the price you are sounlucky!""

-EH it is the chance""

-The scale on boat lescue save hinm.

Understand? Neither did I. Oh well. It was inexpensive, and I'm getting a kick out of trying to understand this gobbledygook, but if you don't speak fluent Korean I can pretty much guarantee incomprehension.",1206576000,2,1153,4.683168316831683
