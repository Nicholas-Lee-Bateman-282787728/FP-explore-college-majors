604023,5,6303209866,"Can never watch this movie enough. The dwarf trying to think of ""ostrich"" still brings me to tears laughing.  The first time I saw it,I continued to burst into laughter hours after the end of the movie just thinking about it.  Best fun I've had in many years.",971913600,4,259,4.375
604024,4,6303209866,One of the funniest 'spoofs' on a western movie.  Each time you watch it you will find something you missed before.,944956800,2,115,4.476190476190476
604171,5,6303209866,"OK!  This is hilarious, silly, a lot of fun.  I had been looking for a personal copy of this movie for a long time.  I think a cable movie channel produced it, but I never found it in the listings.  Several of my friends star in Sodbusters, and I went to Toronto for a few days during the filming.  That was a treat!  Knowing the characters has a lot to do with my giving this five stars because I really don't know anything about scripts or movie making or directing.  One probably has to have a goofy sense of humor to like this.  I imagine that  a high-brow intellectual may find it uninteresting--or maybe not.",1404172800,,614,4.269565217391304
604172,5,6303209866,"I remembered this one from some time ago when it played on tv.  The premise is very funny.  The supporting actor has a wife that is a, let me see how do i put this, she has a roving eye for just about everyone.  Even a guy that died named dill (who did not have a last name) so was buried as dill doe.  Fun movie.",1403049600,,313,3.696969696969697
604173,5,6303209866,It is a great movie and  they got it to me in good time. They even threw in a copied version on dvd for good measure.,1396224000,,117,3.5
604174,5,6303209866,"This is a really old movie, I watched it years ago and wanted to see it again! It was as funny as I remembered! Ya gotta like slapstick tho!",1365465600,,140,3.8620689655172415
604175,5,6303209866,"This movie is absolutely slapstick hilarious. the whole cast really fits together and  Kris Kristofferson, Fred Williard and John Vernon are at their low key comedic best. The Midget jumping out of the tree and getting hung on the branch is as funny as Martin Short in the bank robbery scene of ""The Three Fugitives"" or the clown scene in ""Ruthless People"". Don't have any drinks in your mouth when you watch it! If you can find this movie on DVD, get it. IT is a must for your classic Comedy Collection.",1329177600,,504,4.478260869565218
604176,4,6303209866,I think this movie is hilarious. I can't believe it did not do better when released. I highly recommend it.,1278892800,,107,4.4
604177,5,6303209866,"A western comedy with Kriss Kristopherson, Max Baer and many others.  This spoofy comedy will have you in stitches.",1241740800,2,115,5.052631578947368
604178,4,6303209866,"This caught me by surprise being much better than I anticipated and a very likable film. Yes, it had its bias but the comedy was consistent, the profanity low (it was a made-for-TV film) and the story very interesting.

It was a takeoff on ""Shane"" with Kris Kristofferson plays the low-key gunman (Alan Ladd's role in ""Shane."") Fred Willard is the farmer who stands up to the local land-grabbing bully (John Vernon, who played a lot of villains in his day). It's nicely filmed, too.

Wendel Medrum is a pretty woman whom I have never seen before or since. Even though this was a TV movie, I would not recommend it as ""family viewing""  because of a few sexual innuendos, characteres and sceens.  Oveall, though, it's a fun movie that exceeds expectations.",1240876800,2,754,4.6893939393939394
604179,5,6303209866,"This movie makes me cry from laughing. Sort of in the tradition of Blazing Saddles but better! The whole cast is great! It must have been one of the most fun movies to make, but I can't imagine how anyone ever kept a straight face to get through a scene.",1131321600,4,254,4.1
