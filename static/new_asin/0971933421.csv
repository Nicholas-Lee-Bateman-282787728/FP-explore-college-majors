173784,5,0971933421,"The Sedona Method is the most useful tool available today for letting go of all problems. The Release Technique is another version on offer teaching the letting go philosophy. Both are excellent but their teaching methods are different and have their own followers. I have been using it for 18 months and it has changed my life . I have also recovered from an incurable disease. My relationships have improved beyond belief. Don't knock what you have really tried. I have tried everything. Spent $1000's on books seminars etc. This one speaks for itself, as myself and 10's of 1000's of others around the world can attest to the same. The proof is in the pudding. My advice is to start by letting go of someone's laugh bothering you. Behind the joyful laugh is the treasure that can transform your life. Try it you'll like it, if you want to be happy that is. They (The Sedona Method) also offer money back for 6 months if unsatisfied with the audios. You cannot loose. This book would be a great introduction to the Method.",1258848000,12,1024,4.601092896174864
173785,1,0971933421,"I bought this video because I want to know about Sedona.

The video only tell you that you can remove your feeling like dropping a pen and never outline the method. The author just wants you to buy his $100+ audio collections by introducing this useless demo video and I still have to pay for this useless video which never tell me how to solve my emotion problems. I also find Hale Dwoskin laughter very uncomfortable, everytime he laugh in this video.

I complain to Amazon that I have watch the same thing in Youtube and Amazon refund my money back.

I would have given it a zero star if the rating allows. Don't waste your money. Watch it in Youtube.

Release Technique and Sedona originated from the same teacher Lester Levenson. Somehow I found Sedona lacks of the visualization technique that Release Technique has.

Update (Jul 2011) : It has been years since I bought this CD. At the time, I just started on my quest to find a way to eliminate the negative emotions in me. For those who are interested, the following are my findings since.
1) Release technique : I used this technique in places where there are other people so that I can release my negative emotions without moving a single finger. Read my review on the release technique book.
2) Faster EFT : I find this method better than EFT. You can watch faster EFT videos in youtube.
3) Chinosis : This method is similar to EFT but uses massaging instead of tapping the body points. I find massaging works faster on me. Using EFT tapping or Chinosis massaging has an added advantage : the tapping/massaging on body points improve my health by strengthening the organs. Thus I only used EFT/Chinosis on headaches and not release technique.
4) Byron Katie ""The Work"" : The method is ""The Work"" which you can find in the author's website. The book title is ""Loving What Is"" and a few others. I used Katie's method to eliminate the thoughts and belief behind each emotion. Once I did that, the similar incident will not arise any emotion. Powerful.
5) Donna Eden Energy medicine also contain a few method to stop endless thoughts. Read my review on energy medicine for that method. A must have for people like me who are always feeling short of energy.
6) Lefkoe method : This method needs a partner to apply. I prefer to use Katie's ""The Work"". I went through Lefkoe's confidence course and Occurring course. Both course helps remove useless beliefs through re-framing. I do recommend the 2 courses.

If you have other methods, pls feel free to comment. I am still searching.....",1250985600,23,2542,4.6252771618625275
173786,3,0971933421,"ya this about the Sedona Method. It would be better to read the book. I think there is something to Letting Go but I don't seem to be a able to let go. I worry to much. No I can't let go of that. This
DVD is an hour long about the Sedona Method and Hale tells some stories. There is also a second feature that is about 10 min. long that is also about the Sedona Method, The main feature is Hale talking in front of a crowd.",1217721600,6,423,3.764044943820225

173789,1,0971933421,"I was so hopeful to find some useful information on letting go of anxiety, bad feelings, etc. when I ordered this. It's repetitive, confusing, and didn't teach me a single useful thing. I also found his laughter creepy and irritating and his attempts at humor overdone and hammy.

173790,5,0971933421,"The Sedona Method is hailed the world over as a successful method to create a better life for yourself, but I didn't really understand it until I bought this DVD.  I had purchased the book, and as a voracious reader and lover of turning pages, I was surprised that I couldn't even finish reading it - it made no sense to me.  But, this DVD makes everything easy to understand and absorb.  Hale Dwoskin is a delight to watch, and in watching the movie you will get just as much benefit as the people in his seminars, and come away with far more understanding than from the book.",1366243200,12,577,4.324074074074074

While this Dvd is a wonderful introduction to the method... to really dive in either get the Sedona Method book or some of the in depth audio cd's.
From my personal experience and others I know who have been so fortunate to find Hale & the Sedona Method ...This work is truly life changing. If you want to be free of all limitations this Method will show you the way.",1316390400,4,515,4.548387096774194

173793,5,0971933421,"I suppose everyone has wished that they had learned something that is good for them when s/he was younger, because it would have changed a great deal for them in the best possible way. I wish I had known this information about releasing when I started high school. Releasing is the kind of thing that seems too good to be true, and for that reason, many people pass on it. I've had other experiences with techniques such as NLP and Emotional Freedom Techniques that also are able to make personal changes of which allopathic medicine and talk therapy can't even dream. Miraculous seeming, it's really science that has been rejected by our drug oriented medical model. For those people willing and capable of thinking outside the box of our culture's beliefs, don't miss this chance to check releasing out. This DVD can get you started onto a system that will not disappoint. I am talking personal experience here, not belief or wishes.",1297900800,17,935,4.777777777777778

173795,5,0971933421,"Letting Go is based on the Sedona Method, which has been taught for over 30 years.  Sort of one of those ""best known secrets"" --people usually find out from a friend, just as I did.  This DVD is a great ""booster"" to the method--the Letting Go process is easy to do but not simple and new habits need boosters.  I loved this--a right brain process to help give me some relief from my analytical side.",1288656000,19,399,4.293333333333333

7794442,5,0971933421,"I found this DVD, along with the included companion printed guide, to be an amazing tool for making a very big change in my life. It goes way beyond what positive thinking and other methods did for me. I can now give away most of those books in my library. The letting go method is so simple and is easy to do. You don't have to do a lot of introspection nor do you have to spend hours in meditation or years in therapy.

 I have also had a lot of success with FEFT (Faster Emotional Freedom Tapping) and find the Sedona method to be compatible with that method, though I don't mix them. These two techniques are the best help I have had in all my decades of searching for solutions to the pain and trauma stemming from years of childhood abuse.  I am deeply grateful and feel I am discovering my true self at long last. It is a good feeling indeed.",1399334400,5,849,4.164634146341464

7794444,5,0971933421,"Wow. What an Amazing Dvd!!

I live in the UK and found out about the Sedona Method last year. I have a few of the Sedona Method CDs and also the book. This Dvd adds to what people may already know or is a great starting point for those wanting to learn the Sedona Method. Hale Dwoskin is a warm host and explains how this process can change your life. I would put this alongside the Secret, Abraham Hicks and Deepak Chopra Dvds as life changing. Great Bonus extras too.

5 Stars!!",1391558400,,480,4.206521739130435
