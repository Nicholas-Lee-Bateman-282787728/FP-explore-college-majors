8186406,5,B000OQAJDI,"Terrific CBC production of Expo 67, the grand World's Fair in Montreal. Great memories of the fair itself and the 60's decade in general.",1400457600,,137,4.75
8186407,2,B000OQAJDI,"The DVD was scratched, and froze / skipped in a number of places.  I thought I was buying a new one.",1386028800,,100,3.761904761904762
8186408,3,B000OQAJDI,"OK, I get that Expo 67 was some sort of watershed historical moment in Canadian society. Sadly, I was too young and far too interested in the Apollo space program to care about this. This DVD helps fill in those blanks, but I really wanted more on the pavilions and to see much much more of what Expo 67 was like architecturally. Not that the DVD is bad at all, but it could have been so much better.

The extras are pathetic as all we get the original TV broadcast of the opening which other than the camera panning over the site and some info on what was what, it is a total snoozefest watching dignitaries speak.",1355788800,,615,4.256410256410256
8186409,5,B000OQAJDI,"This was a trip down memory lane for me having attended this fair. The video was VERY well done, I usually don't care for memory type interviews but this film made them interesting. This DVD is expensive but if you were there or are really into Worlds Fairs, It's well worth your time and money. It left me wanting to borrow Marty McFly's time traveling Delorean and go back and see it all again.",1262736000,,396,4.364864864864865
