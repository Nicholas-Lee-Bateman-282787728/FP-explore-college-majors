1871153,5,B00008YLU4,"""Food of Love""  is a very fine film of sexual politics set in the cosmopolitan world of the classical music concert business.
Paul Porterfield (played by Kevin Bishop) is a talented 18-year-old piano student from the San Francisco Bay Area who wants to make it in the concert world.  He takes lessons and wants to go to Juilliard in Manhattan.  The film begins with Paul getting to be a page-turner at a concert being performed by his touring hero, Richard Kennington (played by Paul Rhys).  At the event, Paul also meets Kennington's manager, Joseph Mansourian (played by Allan Corduner).  Both Mansourian and Kennington take notice of Paul.
Shortly Paul and his divorcing mother, Pamela (played by Juliet Stevenson), vacation in beautiful Barcelona.  Paul finds an ad for a recent Kennington performance and tracks down the pianist.  Paul and Kennington get along extra well.  A chance incident lets Pamela, Paul, and Kennington be buddies in Barcelona, touring about.
Six months later, Paul attends Juilliard.  Paul has a gay roommate from back home, Teddy (played by Naim Thomas), and a wealthy boyfriend, Alden Haynes (played by Carlos Castanon).  It turns out Mansourian lives in the same building as Haynes, and impressario Mansourian still has his attractions.  The problems are that Kennington and Mansourian have a long-term relationship and that piano teacher Mme. Novotna (played by Geraldine McEwan) is starting to have doubts about Paul's talent.  When Pamela starts getting clues that something is up, she decides to take drastic action, and the cat-fight begins.
It is a pleasure to watch such good acting in the service of a literate script.  All of the main characters find themselves in false positions and try to spin their ways out of it.  Each has to decide what is really important to him or her.  The character who actually grows the most is the mother, Pamela, who starts out oblivious to anything other than her routine self and her son's initial dream, and who has to cope with a number of shocks without messing matters up for good.  On display from many characters is an ability and desire to overlook others' untidiness, no matter what the initial bluster might suggest.
Kevin Bishop does a fine job of balancing his projected motivations.  With his character in repeated high-stress situations, one cannot be sure whether Paul is a victim of others, a gold-digger, or a weak-willed, go-with-the-flow guy.  He is certainly an aggressive flatterer of successful pianists.  There is some room for interpretation.
There are substantial skin scenes with Paul and with Kennington, not necessarily together.  All is tasteful.
The exterior scenes in Barcelona were especially beautiful.  I wish there had been a special feature telling the audience about these shots.
The DVD has excellent special features.  There is an interview with director Ventura Pons, coupled with behind-the-scenes shots.  The main actors (Stevenson, Rhys, Corduner, Bishop, and McEwan) provide five terrific interviews, especially when they discuss the characters they played.  A third feature is an interview with David Leavitt, the author of ""The Page Turner"", on which the movie is based.  He discusses his feelings about the relationship between the book and the movie and about the current state of art by and about gay people.  Finally there are trailers for ""Food of Love"" and for five other films.  These were useful features, well done.
Finding fault, one might debate whether Paul would leave the clues he did for his mother to find.  I have a memory that the screen version of the movie had a bit of subplot for Juilliard roommate Teddy that does not appear on the DVD.  Lastly, I found the fonts used in the chapter listings and in the special features difficult to read.
Still a ""Food of Love"" good movie that shows sensitivity to a variety of characters going through crises and trying to get along and to move up to the next stage of life.",1055203200,17,3953,5.010719754977029
1871154,4,B00008YLU4,"""Food of Love"" is primarily a coming-of-age story about a 18 year old aspiring pianist, concerned about his professional aspirations as well as his repressed homosexuality.  It is also a very compelling story about relationships and the conflicts they can cause, including the relationships (1) between the boy, Paul (Kevin Bishop), and his mother (who is recently separated from his father, and becoming a bit codependent on the son), (2) between Paul and his idol, Richard Kennington (Paul Rhys), a 39-ish famous concert pianist who also becomes Paul's first lover, and (3) Kennington's longtime relationship with his older lover/agent/mentor Joseph (Allan Corduner).
The story begins in San Francisco, where Paul had been recommended by his piano teacher for the honor of serving as the ""page turner"" during one of Kennington's concerts.  Both Kennington and Joseph separately express their admiration of the adorable young man, but Mother whisks him away after the performance.  Shortly thereafter, Paul and his mother go on vacation to Barcelona (Spain), and Paul finds that Kennington is there as well, tracking him down to his hotel room, where they have sex for the first time.  Their affair develops further in Spain, but Kennington ends it.  Fast forward six months to New York City, where Paul is going to Juliard and having an affair with another older man, who happens to live in the same building as Joseph (and Kennington, when he is not on tour).  Joseph renews his interest in Paul, and Paul tolerates the attention to a point for possible professional assistance.  Subsequent scenes shift to CA, where Paul returns home for Christmas, his mother discovers he is gay (Tsk ... bringing home gay magazines in your luggage?  What were you thinking??), and also puts together what had happened between him and Kennington, but assumes it is still happening.  When Paul becomes uncommunitive and talks about quiting Juliard, his mother makes a trip to see him in NYC. Uh-oh!
I'll admit I did not read David Leavitt's ""The Page Turner"", the novel from which this screenplay was adapted, so I can't tell you where it deviates from the book.  However, the DVD ""extras"" include an interview with Leavitt, who states that the screenplay essentially tells the same story, with a few minor changes.
I thought the film was excellent, especially that the director managed to make a somewhat predictable story so interesting, as well as having gotten great performances out of the (mostly English) actors, especially Juliet Stevenson as the mother.  Talented Kevin Bishop (as Paul) has some rear nude scenes (rated ""R""), though the sex scenes with Kennington are rather tasteful and somewhat romantic, though clearly showing the basic conflicts in their relationship and individual needs.  The situations portrayed (including the mother going to a PFLAG-like meeting once she found the gay magazines, unsure if she should risk admitting she ""snooped"" and found them) were quite realistic, and the production quality was excellent considering the limited budget. I was also surprised to learn (in the DVD extras) that the ""California"" scenes were actually filmed in a small town in Spain, a further testament to the director's magic.",1054771200,6,3233,5.172413793103448
1871155,3,B00008YLU4,"David Leavitt is a fine writer and his novels sell well around the world.  One, The Lost Language of Cranes, was made into a successful film some years back, but FOOD OF LOVE ( the title comes form the line ""If Music be the food of love, play on...."") was a slim novel (The Page Turner) and the resulting film adaptation is even more slim.  If you love Barcelona, then this is a beautifully filmed travelogue.  The story has problems: an 18 year old aspiring pianist is asked to turn pages for a famous middle aged gay pianist and falls in lust and love and begins an affair in Barcelona where Paul (the tennager) and his mother (who has just been discarded by her husband ) are visiting.  Richard (the famous pianist) has an agent/lover back home in New York, a secret kept from young Paul.  When Richard finaly realizes he must return to the US, Paul feels deserted and eventually returns to the US with a confused, frustrated mother and moves to New York to attend Julliard.  Paul quickly finds another older lover, rooms with a young student who (oddly enough) is also gay and is the son of the women his father deserted his mother for!  (I'm not making this up...), and has a brief affair with Richard's agent/lover.  Mother, spurned by Richard in an aborted attempt to seduce him, gradually discovers that her son and Richard have had an affair, attends a Self Help class for mothers of gay sons (hosted by her exhusband's new wife!), and travels to New York to confront her son about his past AND his present.  This hyperkinetic mother actually is the one character in the film with whom we can identify - the others are just too off the wall.  The cast is capable, given the material, and the film is well photographed with some nice classical music tossed in for effect.  Not a bad movie, this, just a disappointment that Leavitt let his thin book THE PAGE TURNER become a film before some of his other fine stories saw cinematic life.",1054771200,,1944,4.50997150997151

1871181,5,B00008YLU4,"This was a lovely film, although the acting by Paul Rhys I thought a little wooden.  I didn't really like either his character or that of his manager/partner (which was probably the point)  as they were simply using the young man for their own gratification.

When the partner claimed that he had been ""seduced"" I felt like throwing something at the TV but I imagine this happens al to to justify being unfaithful to one's partner - blame the other party.

I did not know the actors, with the exception of Geraldine MacEwan who had played Miss Marple on TV and was surprised when I heard their real accents during the interviews.

I like to think the young man four someone of his own age (although he seemed to be in some sort of relationship with the older man in the pianist's apartment block) and lived happily ever after - but I'm just a romantic softy!",1405123200,3,858,4.4743589743589745

1871184,2,B00008YLU4,"A film for drama and histerical performances' fans. And for people who loves Barcelona (nice pictures).
If you are not any of them, skip this one.
I am trying to figure out what irritated me the most - the acting or the plot? I think it's the acting that is ""as nice"" as a sound made by a nail against a blackboard.
The actress playing Paul's mother is histerical. It is painful to listen to her lines and watch her behavior on the screen. In fact the second part of the movie is played in such manner by each of main characters.
A lot of scenes look and sound fake - like the gays mothers' meeting or the the part, where she hits on Richard in his hotel room or (you can add here your own)...
As far as I am concerned, this film is a huge disappointed. Second star for pictures of Barcelona and music.",1305504000,,802,4.147435897435898
1871185,1,B00008YLU4,"I'll skip the plot, since it's already well-discussed in the other reviews here. This production is beautifully photographed, technically slick and the acting very good. What the movie isn't is coherent. It's like trying read a book with pages torn out. Just when you have pieced it together, it ends, because yet more pages are missing. The script must have been inspired by a Psych 101 course that somebody cut too many times. It is difficult to feel any sympathy for the characters, since almost all are self-absorbed liars and users. I can't think of a single facet of the gay community, including PFLAG,  that wouldn't be insulted by this jerky misbegotten epic, except maybe lesbians who, fortunately for them, are absent from this movie's flailing about.",1290297600,2,761,4.9921259842519685
1871206,3,B00008YLU4,"If you have read ""The Page Turner"" and liked it, this movie may confound you.  The heart of the original is there:  a sensitive young man confused by his sexuality and the scheming of those who take interest only in his beauty, the self centeredness and arrogance of the artist, and the lecherous like underworld (or overworld) of the big city artiste god makers.  Kevin Bishop is at once the embodiment of the original character, and more so.  His physical beauty, understated but emotive confusion, and ability to remain convincing both as victim and when he fully realizes that what he has to offer give him advantage fills in the holes that the original did not.  He is the reason to watch any scene, even if it is agonizing to watch any scene with Juliet Stephenson in it.  Both the director and her poor judgement as actress are not assets to the film.  If Faye Dunaway in ""Mommie Dearest"" has become the embodiment of ""camp"", Ms. Stephenson has surely created her own tour de force of a performance so painful to sit through that she deserves her own fan following for this movie.  Ironically, the only confusion I had about the character of Paul is why this bright, talented young man didn't leave his mother at twelve years old.  The upside is that Mr. Bishop is so watchable that the movie brings you back to re-view occasionally, and the fast forward button through Ms. Stephenson's over the top, scene destroying, look at me performance makes it worthwhile.",1235952000,3,1469,4.684824902723736
1871207,4,B00008YLU4,"I don't normally watch gay-themed movies because the few I have seen were mostly dreadful.  This was recommended by a straight lady friend who loved it and assured me I would too.  She was right.  There was tenderness and reality on multiple levels.  The travelogue scenery deserves special acclaim.  At my advanced age I have known people who grew from a life much like this young man's to a later life not distinctly different from the older characters.

I didn't see much distortion of reality.  The most exquisite part was the acting by the young man.  I forgot this was filmed in a room with cameras<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Food-of-Love/dp/B00008YLU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Food of Love</a>and film teams and sound technicians.  I was riveted by the young man's hunger, pain, ambition, and optimism.  The situations presented were subdued compared to what they might have been.  I saw authentic conflict, credible inter-action, and more restraint that we should expect.  It was, at times, almost matter-of-fact.

In the end i was grateful there wasn't a sugar-coated ending.  However, I would love to see a sequel where we see a satisfying career for the young pianist that may lack the glamor he hoped for but include a rewarding life and someone to care for who cares as much for him.  Is that asking too much?

While I'm waiting, I'll watch the movie again and look for the first tour operator to offer vacations to this region, based on the sites in the film.  Sorry to say that, although I have been to Barcelona several times to catch cruises, I've never before been tempted to explore the rest of that part of Spain.  (I've always been more of a Madrid/Malaga kind o' guy.)  The new movie, ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" also features this region gloriously.  Someone at the Spanish Tourist Office is doing a good job of promotion!",1221004800,3,1888,5.068181818181818
1871208,3,B00008YLU4,"I checked out this film because I'd just watched Allan Corduner in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-White-Countess/dp/B000ERVJQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The White Countess</a>&nbsp;and also really enjoyed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/De-Lovely/dp/B00067BBLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">De-Lovely</a>.  Allan plays Mansourian who is the manager of the main character Richard Kennington.  Corduner gives an excellent performance, telling in the DVD special features how much he enjoyed the role.  Richard Kennington is a concert pianist with engagements around the world and is played by Paul Rhys.  Rhys recently played the Eqyptian Pharoah in ""The Ten Commandments"" (2006).  As Kennington, he's rather unsympathetic.  The best moment in the film is after Paul tells Richard that he loves him and we see the pianist looking through the blinds as the young man leaves the hotel.  There was a nice bittersweet feel to the moment.  Otherwise, Kennington does come across as taking advantage of a young man, although the dialogue says otherwise.  Kevin Bishop has the lead as Paul Porterfield.  Bishop starred as Tom in a film with Marrianne Faithfull called ""Irina Palm"" about a woman who can please people with her hands.  I could see him doing a lot of emotions in the film, but I never felt like they hung together in a way that seemed to let me really know this 18-year old man.  His anger with his mother made him equally as unsympathetic as Pennington, perhaps redeemed by the final moments of the film as mother and son look at stars on the ceiling of Paul's apartment.  British stage actress Juliet Stevenson who played Evie in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Being-Julia/dp/B0007G89FK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Being Julia</a>&nbsp;plays the mother as an emotional scatterbrain.  It was hard for me to accept her as a real person.  There is one nice cameo by Sue Flack who plays a brassy mother at the support group for mothers of gay children.  Spanish director Ventura Pons wrote the screenplay based on a book ""The Page Turner"" by David Levitt.  I can't say that the film gave me any reason to search out the story.  Overall, this was a fairly unsympathetic portrayal, although the film was recognized at several film festivals.  The film is the cinematic equivalent of a one-night stand.  Enjoy!",1219363200,,2442,5.844632768361582
1871209,1,B00008YLU4,"I suppose that I shouldn't be too hard on this movie because it did cause quite a stir of emotions on my part.  I know an artist will tell you that if his or her painting causes ANY type of reaction--good or bad--then they have been successful.  It's when you look at their art and feel nothing that they know they've failed.

""Food of Love"" (based on the novel ""The Page Turner"" [which I have not read]) supposedly deals with the love story between an 18-year old fan and his 39-year old piano idol. However, director Ventura Pons managed to make this movie completely void of any emotion except lust.  Paul (the student) did no more than stalk his idol.  And the adults in this movie (save the mother) did nothing but take advantage of their status:  everyone slept with anything they could get their hands on with no remorse for their actions, then lied to one another to keep their ""relationships"" intact.  This  movie didn't show one facet of love--much less what loves embodies.  All that was here was a bunch of leacherous old men preying upon younger students as they (pardon the expression) dangled a carrot in their faces.

""Food of Love"" had many problems.  First, director Ventura Pons (who is Spanish), managed to cast just about all British actors and actresses to portray Americans.  Isn't it nice to know that Pons sees American mothers as whimpering, pill-popping messes who can't do a thing for themselves?  Secondly, Paul (the son) is turned into the total embodiement of a spoiled smart-mouthed punk who you just wanna' slap--repeatedly.  He is portrayed as an uncaring, unsympathetic troglodyte when it comes to his mother, telling her repeatedly ""stop crying; you cannot cry.""  And he had about as many morales as a hooker at a Shriner's convention.  He was nothing more than a status f****r, and I felt no more for him that I did for the call-boy that came to visit Richard's lover while he was away.  At least the call-boy was up front about why he was there.  Paul had no problem sleeping with older men to better his career, but still treated his mother as if all his problems were her fault.

I have seen very few gay movies that have ever portrayed true love, and this one has kept the record intact.  Everybody sleeps with everybody and consequences be damned.  This movie made me ill and if relationships such as these are the ""food of love,"" then I'd rather starve.",1212364800,7,2396,4.643705463182898
1871210,5,B00008YLU4,"This is an excellent film, with fine acting.  It's a very human story about assumptions and the disasters that can follow by leaping before you look...

In a homophobic society, and yes, America is that, it can be very dangerous for anyone to make decisions and act based on assumptions, which each of the main characters does in this film.  It is a film which every gay person should see, as well as anyone who cares about someone, young or old, who is questioning her/his sexual identity.

The usual cliches are used, which is the very reason it should be seen.  As a gay man who wanted to be seduced by his high school teacher, I know that his kindness in helping me come to terms with my sexuality was a gift that could have cost him dearly.  But he dared to show me the love I needed, and it was a major turning point for me.

It took time, but eventually I managed to come out of the closet, and today I am an openly gay musician; but the horrible self-loathing that members of any stigmatized group can feel, be it sexual, racial, religious, or anyone, in fact, who is different than the norm, brought me to the point that, at age 19, I wanted to kill myself.

Do yourself a favor and watch this film.  It could change your attitudes about same-sex love, and the added wisdom you carry away could very well be a life-saver for someone you love who is in need of support, rather than judgment.  All people should have the freedom to live an honest and happy life.

Out and proud doesn't mean that we are proud of being Gay.  It means we are proud of who we are in the world and are willing to risk a great deal to help others who may be struggling with their sexuality, whatever it is, to embrace their lives and live them to the fullest.

Whoever you are: If you are contributing to your society, don't let your sexuality stand in the way of feeling good.  Be whoever you really are, and be proud.",1210377600,5,1904,4.282122905027933

It would have been nice to explore Paul's character a little more to find out the whos, the wheres and the whys of him.  Sure we know he has a thing for older men...he's looking for a father figure....but we know nothing of what leads up to the breakup of his parents.  His mother comes off as an irritating shrew .... especially in a scene where she comes on to Richard Kennington, the man her son is fooling around with.  But the acting is first rate.

1871212,5,B00008YLU4,"WOW! This is one time I wish I could add a few stars to the rating system. I absolutely love this film. ""Food of Love"" introduces newcomer Kevin Bishop who gives a riveting, flawless performance as the lead character. The very beautiful Bishop plays the part of Paul, a young aspiring musician trying to achieve his dream of becoming a concert pianist. As Paul gets the chance to meet his idol, pianist Richard Kennington (Paul Rhys), hero worship and attraction lead to infatuation. When he discovers the attraction is mutual, the two share a steamy affair in Barcelona, and Paul falls madly in love for the first time. He is on his way, but his search for real love has only begun. Juliet Stevenson portrays Pauls mother, recently dumped by his dad for another woman. She is a basket case until she sees her son struggling to find himself. Her concern for him helps her deal with her own problems, and the two confront life head-on to discover real love by facing the truth neither have opened their eyes to alone. Both Stevenson and Bishop are very much British actors, with VERY British accents. They portray an American mother and son with absolute clarity, losing the accent and sounding very American. Real professionalism! This had to be a very difficult task to perform. You will understand when you watch the extras on this DVD and see their interviews, where they are very much themselves. Only one time did I notice Bishop pronouncing a word with hint of a british accent. Can you find it? This young man has a bright future ahead of him as an actor if he so decides to continue his career. I look forward to seeing more from him. You certainly won't be offended by his looks, or his body. If you hate classical music, this is probably not the film for you, but if you can muddle through that, the film has a very strong plot. It will hold your interest all the way through if you enjoy films of this nature. ""Food of Love"" is based on the novel ""The Page Turner"" by author David Leavitt. Casting and directing are excellent. Acting is superb. As with any film there are a few spots that are less than perfect, but give the production a realism that doesn't in any way seem faked.

At times there are scenes that just sort of pop up out of nowhere, but the main story is easy to understand and does provoke thoughts around love, lust, etc.",1159747200,6,439,4.214285714285714
1871214,2,B00008YLU4,"A very mediocre adaptation of a David Leavitt novel, ""Food of Love"" never takes off as a film, despite beautiful location footage. Some of the blame is on the English actors straining to speak with American accents (we can tell), but that pales compared to the Spanish actors whose dialogue is dubbed in.  It amazes me that we can simulate explosions in film, but nobody has successfully figured out how to dub in dialogue without it sounding stilted.

This film has moments of unintentional comedy (pay special attention to the ""sexy"" fluttering bathrobe Allan Corduner wears while entertaining a hustler; it looks as though he stole it off a Jedi Knight) and unmitigated horror (fluorescent lights and bad makeup turn poor Paul Rhys into a vampire in a record shop scene - yeesh!)  And despite a shot of Lincoln Center here and the view from the Brooklyn Bridge there, it's obvious the actors never set foot in New York. I was disappointed in this film and by the end of it, I was bored.",1158105600,3,989,4.672413793103448
1871215,5,B00008YLU4,"Getting its title from a Shakespeare quotation-- ""if music be the food of love, play on""-- and based on the novel THE PAGE TURNER by David Leavitt, this film is a delicious surprise. Paul Porterfield (Kevin Bishop), an aspiring musician, meets his hero, the concert pianist, Richard Kennington (Paul Rhys), when he is drafted to turn pages for him at a recital. Paul and his mother Pamela (Juliet Stevenson) later meeet Kennington in Barcelona where the beautiful eighteen-year-old is deflowered by the soon-to-be-forty Kennington. In the concert pianist's defense, however, Paul is a most willing candidate to lose his virginity.

Under the most capable directorship of the Spanish Ventura Pons, what might have been a disaster becomes a beautiful nuanced love story as well as a tale of betrayal, growing up and self discovery, particularly on the part of both Paul and his mother. Pons handles with delicacy an older man's relationship with a teenager (actually in this instance three older men). The actors, through British, portray American characters without the slighest trace of a British accent, no small feat. My one quibble-- and a minor one-- is that Pamela for most of the movie doesn't have a clue as to her son's sexual orientation or that he is having an affair with the older Kennington. What could she have been thinking-- or not thinking-- when she discovered her son's boxer shorts in Kennington's bathroom? The DVD contains interviews with the director, principal actors and the author David Leavitt, as well as a section of the actual shooting of the film. The scenes in Barcelona, particularly the architecture of Gaudi, will make you either want to visit that magnificent city or make a return trip if you have been before.

1871236,1,B00008YLU4,"The awfully titled ""Food of Love"" was Catalonian director's Ventura Pons first English-language film, adapted from a not very good book (""The Page Turner"") by American David Leavitt.  The result, I regret to say, was Pons' worst film to date.

The story concerns an 18-year-old aspiring gay pianist, his recently-separated mother and an older pianist with whom he has his first gay sexual relationship during his summer vacation in Barcelona (with his mother).  However, this is not a ""coming out"" film; all the problems are generated by the mother's feeling due to her divorce and, especially, the intergenerational conflicts between the two leading men.  (Sex is fairly tame too, and the nudity consists of shots of the young man from behind.)

Unfortunately, the movie is poorly scripted (the lines of dialogue are quite laughable at crucial moments) and, worst of all, badly acted.  Kevin Bishop, who plays Paul, the young man at the center of the story, gives a really terrible performance.  He is cute, though (the blonde, blue-eyed boy type), which may explain why he gets compliments in other reviews and even by David Leavitt (in the interview he gives on the DVD).  I'm sure if he were ugly everyone would comment right away on his bad performance. Paul is not a very likable (save physically) or believable character, either. (He also doesnt seem to be having much fun in his sexual relationships and he really mistreats his mother... and she lets him get away with it.)

The other male leads give bad performances as well, with zero nuances or depth.  To be fair, their dialogue is pretty bad to begin with.

The film's only saving grace is the great Juliet Stevenson, who is truly wasted in the poorly written (and cliched) role of the mother who is clueless about her sons (and his lovers) sexual orientation.  Still, Stevenson is such a talented(and funny) actress that she manages to make you care about the character by the end.

I recommend you skip this and rent any other of Ventura Pons' films.  He's an interesting director (hence I checked out this movie) but this film was a misfire from beginning to end.",1144886400,8,2129,4.845303867403315
1871237,2,B00008YLU4,"What should we have expected?

David Leavitt's novella ""The Page Turner"" (really a long short story) has been inflated into a feature film reset from Rome to Barcelona, which also stands in for California and New York. Its characters are all Americans here played by English and Spanish actors affecting Yankee accents (few successfully) and, in one case, a vaguely Russian one.

Its Barcelona-based Spanish director, Ventura Pons, for the first time is working in a foreign language, English. His tech crew has somehow botched the sound recording so that the dialogue is almost always out-of-synch (you can't switch on English subtitiles because this DVD has none).

Leavitt's story is set in the world of classical music, a subject the author admits (in a disc extra) that he knew nothing about when he began writing. It's real subject matter, however, is gay relationships, something Leavitt knows a great deal about and which this film treats with delicacy and understanding.

Any film with the great Juliet Stevenson and Anna Massey (in major and minor roles, respectively) cannot be all bad, and indeed this one isn't. Barcelona has never looked lovelier, nor has the sturdy, blue-eyed leading man, Kevin Bishop, whose character by the end has learned a thing or two about love, talent and ambition.

You know a picture is in trouble when the director has to rename it because he suspects that ""The Page Turner"" in Spanish wouldn't sell in his native country (""Food of Love,"" now there's a saleable title!) But the title isn't the only thing about this earnest but muddled movie that's hard to buy.",1117152000,6,1604,4.970149253731344
1871238,3,B00008YLU4,"This is an interesting, if slightly difficult film to see.  It features descent scenery (both landscape and the human kind) as well as reasonably decent acting, editing, and dialog.  (Okay, the dialog isn't much to brag about, but it's okay.)

Where this film goes wrong, I believe, is in the casting of several creepy, older men whom the princial lead, played admirably by Kevin Bishop, is supposedly head-over-heels in love with.  I didn't like any of them, who seduce, lie, cheat, and manipulate him in every way possible.  Not that a young man couldn't find love with someone older than him, but I doubt it would be with any of these three.  Perhaps he is just a really bad judge of character, but in any event, it leaves you with a sad and kind of creepy feeling that colors the many virtues of this film and spoils it.

There are some great plot twists and a hysterical mother that does her best to manipulate events around her too.  Eventually she does ""come clean"" with her son, and him with her, but it doesn't provide much in the way of a resolution, and the film ends with a dull ""thud.""

If this film was called ""Lust for Boys"" it would give you a better idea of what it is about.

Three stars for the generally interesting plot, the editing, scenery, and Kevin Bishop, who makes the film the best it can be, given the limitations of the casting and writing with which he has to work.  I wouldn't rush out to rent this one, but it's interesting enough to watch on a rainy day.",1116979200,6,1488,4.413919413919414
1871239,3,B00008YLU4,"This disc promises much and delivers an entertaining, if poorly acted plot, for those seeking a film with a less likely storyline.

Rather that tell you the story...since I still believe this is worth the price and time...I will say that most of the acting is awkward. The dialogue is strange and conversation simply doesnt mimic life. The maestro Kennington is odd and I found him difficult to like. His uncomfortable scene with our protagonist, a young, blonde, buff, blue eyed Paul and the massage...pronounced by Kennington as ""Mass-ahhhge"" creeped us out as we watched. We were struck as though Kennington was more predator than love interest.

Someone took a left at central casting and found the creepiest, most bizarre character for Pauls teacher...a yoda-esque woman of the corn who takes more than she gives in this performance.

Mom, on the otherhand, is almost camp. She is dotting on Paul, looking for control and love and all the while smothering everyone. Making for an interesting character.

The locations are stunning. The extras on the dvd disclose a cast that is mostly English...so kudos for their American accents in this reasonable, entertaining average movie.

Had Kennington and his lover/agent been more likeable, this movie would have been a crossover hit.",1113091200,7,1283,5.119617224880383
1871240,5,B00008YLU4,".This is a moving and well-made film about a young music student (Kevin Bishop) coming to terms with his sexuality, and his coming of age amid the world of professional music.  Juliet Stevenson is brilliant as the boy's mother, who experiences an awakening of her own.  It was filmed entirely in Barcelona with British actors, though most of the characters are American and the story takes place primarily in the US.  A top-notch cast and production, augmented by an excellent musical score of classical music.  This is a movie of subtle nuances and inevitable truths, and is not to be missed.",1092441600,9,593,4.841584158415841
1871241,4,B00008YLU4,"I caught part of this film on pay-per-view and was so intrigued I ended up buying the DVD.  It is a very complex coming-of-age story about a young pianist, Paul Porterfield (Kevin Bishop), who falls in love with his idol and mentor.
Certainly NOT a typical gay-themed film filled with quirky, offbeat sidekicks.  What a relief!

Shot entirely in Spain, which stands in for San Francisco and New York, the first half of the film is very visual. Some of the stilted dialogue can be attributed to the all-European cast and their ""American"" accents.
The DVD transfer is a little grainy, but it is in letterbox format.  Some great interviews with the cast and director are included as extras on the DVD.",1067299200,5,698,4.69672131147541
1871242,4,B00008YLU4,"The acting was good and the scrip believable. The quality was top grade on video and audio. The story was seductive,Sexy, twisted and disfunctial. (Not unlike the real world) It was a good film and I recommend it. Because of a few very suggestive shots, I recommend this film for mature viewers. It has a good deal of Classical music however even if you dislike Classical music, I believe you will enjoy the story. The only negitive thing about the film is a scene where Kevin Bishop is confronting his mother, the scene appeared forced and failed to flow smoothly as it should have. Overall the film was good and would be an excellant addition to your collection.",1063152000,3,664,4.635593220338983
1871243,4,B00008YLU4,"A study in deception.  Aspiring concert pianist Paul (perfectly played by Kevin Bishop) is the only character that displays even a modicum of honesty or integrity. The beautiful, earnest eighteen-year-old is duped and used by everyone he encounters.

When the film opens, Paul is turning pages for his idol, turning-forty concert pianist Richard Kennington (ghoulish Paul Rhys).  Sparks fly during the Beethoven.  After the concert Richard invites Paul out, but his strident mother thwarts them. Richard's manager, Joseph, hit on the tempting young man before the concert.  Unbeknownst to popular Paul, randy Richard and geriatric Joseph are long-time lovers.

Vacationing with his mother in Barcelona, Paul meets Richard again.  More determined this time, the older man beds the bonny boy within five minutes via that venerable 'sine qua non' of seduction:  a back-rub.  In a rare moment of candor, Richard wonders if he made a mistake by hopping into the sack so precipitously, but spoils it by adding he just assumed that was what the boy wanted.

They begin a one-week stand and, between some rather lovely rolls in the hay, explore Barcelona with Paul's histrionic mother.  Blind as well as boisterous, she takes a shine to Richard and attempts to seduce him. It doesn't work, of course, but her ghastly flirtation does succeed in making the pianist flee the country without so much as a word of explanation or farewell to the hapless boy.

In New York, Paul moves in with rich troll Alden on Central Park West where he runs into Joseph.  More determined this time, the agent promptly seduces the eager boy with concerts, fancy dinners, and the hope of management.  But, even when questioned about all the pictures of Richard in his apartment, Joseph does not come clean about their relationship.

Though it could just be the appalling acting and insane script, from all the hemming and hawing it seems that Alden and Joseph have also been 'friendly' in the past so -- let's see -- all four male protagonists have slept with at least two of the others!  Paul and Joseph have slept with all three.  Only the neurotic mother has been excluded from the sexual merry-go-round, not that she didn't try her best to hop on.

Though he's slept with every man over forty in the film, Paul is closeted to his mother.  While snooping, she comes upon some rather 'personal' reading material, has a light-bulb moment, rushes off to an outlandish gay mothers' group, and hops a plane to New York.  She confronts Joseph and Richard (at his birthday party, no less) with one last shrill whine of consternation.  Suffice it to say, actress Juliet Stevenson hasn't left a shred of scenery unchewed anywhere.  Now, at least, everyone knows about the spicy sexual potpourri.  As for the luckless lad, the reasons for all his needless suffering finally become clear.

Kevin Bishop is adorably preppy in Burberry from head to toe, with a lovely body and incandescent blue eyes.  He is ingenuous and sincere . . most of the time . . but, bewildered by the inexplicable and overbearing behavior all around him, he does become a tad truculent.  Who wouldn't?!  Extra stars for the seductive stripling.  His beauty makes it possible to watch this high-flutin' pot-boiler despite all its goofiness, disjointed dialogue, musical ineptitude, and unintentional hilarity.",1061683200,26,3345,4.9891696750902526

I have watched many gay/coming of age movies and was often disappointed in almost all of the qualities I listed above. I now have to get the book the movie was based on, because I have to experience it. I've found a lot of the books movies were based on to be richer and more revealing of the motivation, and of course the one thing that actors try hardest to portray, the feelings of the characters. I would recommend this movie to anyone, and particularly to the LGBT youths that are so confused and scared and tend to withdraw or worse instead of sharing their perceived problems and worries and self-doubt.
