4891825,3,B005TMXZ74,"Not one of Eastman's best. They tried to make a narrative storyline and failed. This robbed the film of the usual refreshing quality of Eastman documentaries. When it falls back to the usual style it succeeds, so we endured through the unfortunate segments to enjoy the typical Eastman gems.",1390089600,,291,4.959183673469388

4891827,4,B005TMXZ74,"Gordon Eastman was certainly no movie director.....It looks like he tried to make a movie with this story. He is however an excellent documentary film maker!
  This film is an awesome story of his adventures in the Canadian wilderness raising some wolf cubs that he took from a wolf den that he found. The scenery and his many adventures are just a bonus to this very well made documentary. I wonder if the cabin he built is still there at that lake?
  If you love far north adventures then this film will not disappoint you at all! Wolves, brown bears, caribou, moose, trout.... This one has it all! When you come to the end of this film, you'll be envious of the tremendous opportunity that Mr. Eastman had in this remote wilderness! I'd have rated this five stars for sure had Gordon not tried to make this into a movie.",1375228800,2,823,4.466666666666667
4891828,3,B005TMXZ74,"The movie opens up with a real live wolf hunter flying over Alaska with a rifle in hand as he searches the wilderness for something worthy of shooting - with his rifle literally bandaged together with white cloth tape.

""Is he a good hunter?""

""Must be.  He killed over 500 wolves and lived to tell about it""

And that sets the pace for this glimpse into life in the Yukon circa 1970.

Visit a local fur traders shop where you can get hand made muckluck boots.

Then on to the local tavern where women dress up like 1800's burlesque and dance to old school rock and roll.  They must have imported the women, because I don't think you could fill a whole room with young attractive white women in most Alaskan towns in 1970 even if the beer was free.  In fact, I think the total number of young attractive white women in Alaska in 1970 was something like... seven.

Then, finally we get a good look at one of these women when, for some reason, Mr. Eastman figures he should have some musical fill and includes a full length song sung by what looks like a woman until a close up reveals it is really a beaver with lipstick and a dress... just kidding, but not a lot kidding.

We get to see an original old Skidoo snomobile in action which was cool but apparently not much faster than the guy following him on snowshoes.

The scenery is majestic and if is cool to see old school winter camping with wooden showshoes and canvas tents.

The attitude toward nature seems to have changed from Mr. Eastman's movie High, Wild, and Free of only two years ealier.  Now, it isn't so cool just to kill animals for sport.  NOW, the wolf hunter is the bad guy.

Good scenery.  Seems like Mr. Eastman was trying to develop some kind of plot in this film - an astray from his previous films that were more documentary in nature.  Perhaps a LITTLE less low-budget than his ealier films, but still home-made enough to make you think that it is the kind of thing your Dad could have done if he put his mind to it.  Entertaining especially for nostalgia camp and outdoor enthusiasts",1323388800,,2060,4.376315789473685
