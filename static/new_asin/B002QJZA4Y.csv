8377815,1,B002QJZA4Y,"This concert aired in 1995 as a ""pay per view"" special. At that time, I recorded this show on a VHS tape.

18 years later, believing this show was an authorized release on DVD, I purchased it.

This DVD is nothing more than a German made bootleg... Someone placed a video camera in front of a TV set and pushed the record button.

The picture is cloudy, grainy and washed out. The audio is somewhat clear but recorded in MONO not stereo.

My 18 year old VHS copy is of better quality than this DVD.

If you just want to see the show and absolutely nothing more, this DVD should easily work for you. If you have any level of expection regarding this DVD, you are going to be disappointed.",1375228800,3,687,4.253846153846154

8377818,1,B002QJZA4Y,"I recently did purchase the Van Halen - Live From Molson Amphitheatre In Toronto Canada DVD. Although this DVD was is presented with very professional
artwork on both the DVD Disc and DVD Insert, the sound and visual quality was exceptionally poor.
Fortunately the seller did promptly reply to my complaint, and did advise that my copy could be faulty?
A replacement was offered and sent but never arrived, which then resulted in a further apology and a full refund.

As a big Van Halen fan I was very disappointed.. This concert would be so good if presented professionally....
If any one else has recently purchased this DVD could you please respond and advise what both the sound and picture quality is like....
If my copy is faulty as suggested by the seller, then I would risk another attempt to purchase this concert...

We can only hope that we get something officially released from this current Van Halen tour.... ???",1333324800,3,926,4.78125
8377819,5,B002QJZA4Y,I received my dvd van halen today. I want to think you for your fast and wonderful service. I thought it was with david lee roth instead of sammy hagor. I already have sereral other van halen dvd with sammy. Its my fault for not paying more attention. On the other hand I will be looking forward to doing business in the near future. Great and wonderful service. Keep up the great work.,1329696000,,386,4.301369863013699
