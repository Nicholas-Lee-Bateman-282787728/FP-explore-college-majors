However, I understand how thirst for knowledge of our Father's Kingdom and the joy of wanting to bring others to it could lead to gnostic writings.  Suffice it to say that Jesus always describes our Father's Kingdom with parables.  John describes the Kingdom of Heaven symbolically, in the book of Revelation.

The kingdom of God cometh not with observation but by loving one another. (My paraphrase of Lk 17:20b-21;  the book of James;  the Gospel Saying of Thomas 3; Jn 13:34; jn 15:12; jn 15:17; Romans 13:8; 1Th 4:9; 1 Peter 1:22 and 1 Jn 3:11; 1 Jn 4:11-12 Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.  No man hath seen God at any time.  If we love one another, God dwells in us, and his love is perfected in us.",1449878400,,907,4.448484848484848

Not all of us agreed with the information that was presented. The questions that were provided were very useful! They came up with much better questions than we could on our own. Very challenging! We have really enjoyed this DVD.",1373155200,,378,4.8307692307692305
8153754,2,B000K144OW,"This idea would be good for defending Christian faith but this film it does not reveal secret Gnostic knowledge. This is Ensign Media which is a very small family film company and it does not have people with strong historical knowledge. It is poorly made all of my copies are worn and they barely been used. I am not a  supporter of Gnostic faith actually I think it is a self serving religion to make one a Christ not Christ like. It does not teach Salvation and redemption it is works base which is a dangerous path. Many of the books written by Gnostics in the 2nd and 3rd century were not written with first hand accounts which is why they are unreliable two hundred years after Christ died to write a book about him with out quoting a person who was there is not a good way to write a Bio. Just saying. However poorly presenting the facts and having unrecognized professors who are not in the field recognized is not the way to go either.
 If you know nothing on the facts of Gnostics my first suggestion before you buy a DVD buy a dictionary and find out what they are then decide if you wish to know more.
The fact is there are well over a 100 gospels but of that number only 4 where written by people who either were there or spoke with someone who was there.

John: present at the time of Christ death, Matthew: a follower , Luke: Doctor who lived during the time of Christ later follower and traveled with Paul, Mark wrote his gospel toward the end of Peters life from Peter

Police do not wait 2 weeks to investigate a crime scene would be tampered with so as soon as reported they document a viable witness. Our court system has followed this process for centuries. Now National Geo says look at what we found 200 hundred years later written by a Gnostic and I am expected to be worried, faith changing I don't think so.

This documentary was quickly produced in response to National Geo. film which is a nice film but come on a text is found in 2006 translated in less then a year and they made a film on it. Many of these text take a life time and still are badly in need of 2 or 3 more sets of eyes if people believe this mess then they have no faith.",1351555200,,2167,4.212048192771085
8153755,2,B000K144OW,"Some decent ideas, but it was harder to fully grasp them because of the poor production values of this dvd.  It looked like it was made on a very low budget with home video equipment and a lot of ""blue screen"" type scenes representing people in the 1st and 2nd centuries.",1342051200,2,271,4.313725490196078
8153756,3,B000K144OW,"This DVD is not bad, if you're a Christian, looking for backup to show why Gnosticism was inappropriate. But if you are looking for open, unbiased information on the Judas Gospel and other Gnostic Texts, buy the National Geographic society's DVD instead. I also question the scholars used in the video. Only one of them was familiar. Why didn't the makers of the DVD contact Dr. Elaine Pagels or Dr. Bart Ehrman for interviews, or even Dr. Marvin Meyer? These are the top people in the field. I really feel that I wasted my money on this DVD and a will NOT use it for my lectures and classes on Gnosticism",1171843200,27,605,4.45945945945946
