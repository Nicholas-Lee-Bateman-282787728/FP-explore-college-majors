2283301,5,B0009E32RA,Great add to my anime collection. It was kinda pointless to put millers report on its own disc. But still a good watch,1503100800,,118,4.173913043478261

2283305,5,B0009E32RA,"This is some solid storytelling within the Gundam franchise. I watched a few episodes of this during the middle of my run with the original series, and although they were different, I was not disappointed. Rather, it gave me some aha moments. The events in this story are gold, and it is one of my favorite series of all time that is Gundam. Yeah, it's annoying at times, and yeah, it's kind of sad at times too, but this is the Gundam show to watch--especially if you want to keep up with the Universal Century and watch it in order or basically in order. I liked it better than 0080 War in the Pocket--unlike most people.",1500940800,,623,4.379310344827586
2283306,4,B0009E32RA,"This was great on VHS, it is better on Blu-ray - must have for anyone who does not have 08th MS Team yet and a nice upgrade for anyone who has the VHS or DVD copies. This is Gundam as it was meant to be - not a one off special mech but as a practical replacement for traditional military hardware.

2283308,5,B0009E32RA,One of my favorite mid-90s Gundams. Gritty story and down-to-earth totally believable characters squabbling about the day-to-day things most people do. Not to mention great action in animation that is aged well more so than others. A must buy!,1499817600,,243,5.256410256410256

2283322,5,B0009E32RA,"This is a very nice HD release of what is one of, if not my favorite Gundam series to date. It feels more realistic than other series (yes, it still has giant robots--I said MORE realistic), and still has the great characterization I've come to love from Gundam. There's no prodigy child or New Type piloting a machine that is leaps and bounds above anything else: this is war.",1497139200,3,377,4.478260869565218
2283323,5,B0009E32RA,An excellent blu ray remaster of the series.  The old DVD version of 08th MS Team was poorly handled but this blu ray version is a proper HD transfer of the original film print with fantastic picture and sound quality.,1496448000,,218,4.45

2283326,1,B0009E32RA,"Just wanted to let everyone know that this review is of the bly ray disks not the series.  The problem is that the 2ND blu ray disk has an error in the picture.  During episode 9 at about 16 minutes in the image pixels out for about 2 seconds.  I have tried 2 copies and have the same problem.  Looks like a manufacturing error.  Great series, but I hope right stuff corrects the error and offers free replacement disks to the fans who purchased this great series.",1494720000,10,464,4.287356321839081
2283327,3,B0009E32RA,Hi this copy of gundam I noticed that this is the same as they had on TV years ago. One of the bad things about it is uncut so there is a lot of video that you have to skin over to watch it through.,1494633600,,198,3.422222222222222

2283329,5,B0009E32RA,"Been waiting for some good gundam titles to come on blu ray and this one was always one of my favorite underdog. The series is short about 12-13 episodes, but i love the animation ( when it came out it was very unique to the time) and the story is very laid back, bit of comedy and romance and a lot of action.",1494288000,,310,3.9365079365079363
2283330,5,B0009E32RA,"The best part of this Bluray set was definitely the 10 minute animation short, ""Battle in 3D"". It's presented in 16:9, and has a pretty good battle sequence with Shiro (It fits into the timeline when Eledore is hospitalized, and possibly when the 08th Team is on their way to find the testing ground for the Apsalus prototype). Excellent! The other Extras, however, are just the usual stuff, nothing exciting: Promos, adverts, cleaning opening and ending. If I remember correctly, the old DVD set had more interesting materials, like background story on Zeon and Earth Federation, mobile suits development and designs, etc.

With my setup (4k tv, 4k player, japanese surround audio with subtitles), I noticed a few glitches here and there. There were a few points in the 1st disc where the audio would drop out here and there during scene changes. These lasted very briefly, like a millisecond each. I didn't mind this audio issue so much as the minor video glitches I noticed on the 2nd disc during fast moving sequences. Pixelation and ghosting, in the muzzle flashes, or around the Gouf when it is swinging through the air. And during those Aina shots with ""MS 08th Team"" title, inbetween part A and part B of certain episodes. These video issues were infrequent, less than 10 instances in my copy, but annoying enough to stand out in my mind.

Other minor issues to grieve me -- one that comes to mind is that the subtitles had weird spellings for certain names, like Kiki ""Logita"" (Rosita), and Apsaras (Apsalus), for example. Why change those spellings?? They were fine for Cartoon Network broadcasts and for the DVD set, so why?? And the inclusion of the 3rd disc, which was Miller's Report movie = POINTLESS. You know that it basically serves no real purpose except to recycle old scenes. I guess one can argue this movie's importance in hashing out Shiro's resolve to fight in his own way, or emphasizing the trust and loyalty within the 08th Team. And yes, fine, it probably should be included in this set to make it as complete as possible. That's all good and well, but that Miller character is just annoying, and she and the movie add nothing significant to the storyline. Karen Joshua should have beat her up at the end, and that would've been a way better ending to the Miller's Report movie. Certainly makes a more interesting movie that way, in my opinion.

But hey, I still give it FIVE stars. The things I mentioned above are minor flaws, and does not detract from the fact that The 08th MS Team is a fantastic series, and its presentation in Bluray a must-have. Despite the ridiculousness of a mid-war onsen sequence (onsen > life-and-death struggles of war, so why not use a beam saber to make one?) and the no-nip Aina (no, they did not /could not change that, not even for the Bluray release), I did not hesitate in pre-ordering this Bluray collection... since this is the Gundam series that got me hooked on everything else Gundam. And I wholeheartedly recommend this collection to longtime fans and future fans alike. It's an under-rated series within the whole mashup of the Gundam universe, and a real gem.",1494115200,5,3133,4.7344322344322345
2283341,5,B0009E32RA,"Got my blu ray copy a whole month early and already marathon all 12 episodes with Miller's Report a day later. It's a 3 disc set with 6 episodes each on the first 2 discs and Miller's Report on the 3rd disc. The video is super clean and what I like most is you can switch audios back and forth without having to go to that menu screen. You can also switch subtitles with the remote. There's nothing to really say about this series other than it's a short and fun series. My only gripe is I only wished it was longer as they could have really flesh out the characters more but with only 12 episodes, that'd be hard to do and still tell a nice story.",1491696000,,648,4.0703125

2283362,5,B0009E32RA,"If you like gundam then this is a must have. Probably the best series around. It focuses on a more realistic aspect of gundam combat and has a pretty great plot too. It's super hard to find, but completely worth collecting.",1389830400,,223,4.463414634146342
2283363,5,B0009E32RA,"I honestly think this is the best Gundam Anime. The art is incredible, the story is very unique and they took that realistic approach which I enjoyed so much more than what the other Gundam stories took.",1385683200,,203,4.513513513513513
2283364,2,B0009E32RA,"When I saw 08th MS Team I thought I was gonna see a realistic war drama, but what I got instead was a very cliched and subpar anime. First of all, for a side-story that focuses on the 08th MS Team, they really aren't that interesting:

Shiro: A very bland main character who says that he hates Zeon but never really proves it.
Michel: Comic relief butt monkey who had way too much screentime which seriously messed with the tone.
Karen: She was a former medical student and her husband died and... that's it. She has virtually no character.
Sanders: The ""Shinigami"" but since the anime is so light-hearted and cliche you know no member of the team is gonna die.
Eledore: Almost died... then came back as if nothing happened.

The first episode was great, but then the plot lags and nothing really happens for like six or seven episodes until finally Aina comes back, then some other things happen and then we have the Norris's Gouf Custom episode which is really the only really outstanding thing about this OVA and then we have a stupid Apsalus fight which was not ""realistic"" in the slightest followed up by a rather bizarre and surreal final episode. Ginias is whatever, the Federation is portrayed as incredibly dumb for the sake of forced drama (telling the GM Sniper to shoot Shiro's EZ instead of the freaking Apsalus which was the real threat), and none of the good guys die. Seriously. Only the bad guys die... Shiro and Aina receive a point blank laser beam attack from the Apsalus and they defeat it with... a punch. So much for your realistic and griitty war drama. Very, very disappointing and seriously overrated. Even 0083 with its horrendous ending is twenty times better than this.",1384560000,,1698,4.656666666666666
2283365,5,B0009E32RA,"Short but sweet, if you could only have one series from the Gundam universe this is it.

2283367,5,B0009E32RA,"This was a great series! Gundam is one of my all time favorite series! I got it withen 6 days of ordering, in excellent condition and was tons of fun to watch. Gundam The 08th MS Team is what happens when you combine a U.C. gundam series and Platoon. Great action and a beautiful love story! I highly recommend any anime fan to watch for that matter everyone should see this masterpiece. It has a good bit of bad language and some nudity (One scene where a character is bathing topless in a pond) but is without doubt one of my favorites!!!",1354406400,,540,4.303921568627451

Shiro Amada is an idealistic young Ensign assigned to a team on the forefront of the war between the Federation and Zeon on Earth.  Great character to watch develop.  Plus the whole situation between him and Aina Sahalin makes for a very interesting take on what can happen during war.  Check it out!",1346544000,,574,4.367924528301887
2283381,5,B0009E32RA,"Wow! What a great series! I am truley sad that there is only one season of this Gundam series, as this is definantly one of the best in the Universal Century timeline.
This series follows Amuro-...er...Shiro Amada and his squad of MS pilots otherwise known as the 08th MS team. Shiro, being a brand new leutenant in the E.S.F.S. (I think.) must prove himself to be a competant leader for his squad. Having next to no experience but a keen sense of duty and a little luck allows him to show his teamamtes what he is all about. However, the REAL theme of the series does not really become known until about half-way into the story. Allegiance and the idea of what an enemy is seems to be key plots in the story.

Without a doubt, this is one of the best Gundam series ever made.",1345161600,,776,4.315068493150685
2283382,5,B0009E32RA,A nice little spin off from the original Mobile suit Gundam.  Follows the 08th MS Team for a few missions while the bigger battle is off elsewhere.  Can't go wrong with this.,1344643200,,174,4.40625
2283383,5,B0009E32RA,Probably my favorite gundam series of all time.  This series adds a sense of realism to how the gundams fight with tactics and weaponry rather than the lone wolf killing machine common in most of the other types. The gundams are far from indestructible and the close quarters mech fights gives a nice and personal feel to the combat knowing that there's real people piloting them.  Would love to see a live action version of this series on the big screen,1343692800,,454,4.592592592592593
2283384,5,B0009E32RA,"This entertaining, if shot, series is a must have for fans of the original Gundam series. Set about 9 months into the One Year War, the show follows the exploits of Earth Federation forces of the 08th MS team fighting in South East Asia against the Zeon forces there. The characters are all well written and will draw you in with their own stories. This product also includes the movie Miller's Report, though this film is little more than a clip show. The positive side of this film is that it fills in the gaps that occurred in between episodes. The animation is great, using styles common to anime from the mid 1990s.",1340323200,3,620,4.495575221238938
2283385,5,B0009E32RA,"I own almost every series, and this one has always been my favorite. The fight with norris packard and the gouf b-3 should be considered the most tactical fight between a zeon ace and feddie pilots.

as with every gundam series, the ranks of soldiers are very off. RX-79(G) Pilot Karen Joshua is 26 years old and is apparently a Master Sergeant/Master Chief Petty Officer depending on the translation. In the modern japanese military it can be almost 20 years before and enlisted person makes Master chief/sergeant.",1336780800,,515,4.919540229885057

2283387,5,B0009E32RA,"One of the best Gundam series ever made, in my honest opinion. This one offers you up mainly ground battles(guerrilla mobile suit warfare) instead of outer space battles. If you want to get the overall best Gundam experience, you really need to watch the old school series like this one. The old school Gundam series offer you deep character developement, a lot of political intrigue behind the scenes, and a realistic depiction of emotional situations caused by and come along with wars/battles. Anyway, since this is an OVA(original video animation) series, the animation quality is very good, since OVA series usually has a higher budget than TV series. The soundtrack is very good and really fits the setting and feel for the show. The character designs are top notch and was done by Toshihiro Kawamoto, whom also did character designs for Cowboy Bebop, among others. So, if you're looking for a high quality Gundam series or just a good mecha anime in general, you should definitely give this one a shot.",1307836800,10,1009,4.906432748538012

2283389,5,B0009E32RA,"The series takes place during the One Year War as events occur simultaneously with the original Mobile Suit Gundam. It's 13 Episodes long and features fantastic English dubs and a polished look more reminiscent of other animes rather than cartoonish like that of the original show (very Gundam Wing-ish). Great action and story make for a perfect (and fair-priced) dvd set.

I ordered this through FYE (when I worked there w/ 30% employee discount) when it first came out. I'm thoroughly pleased that you can finally have the entire show without having 5-6 dvd cases. It's short enough to be enjoyed multiple times during ownership (meaning you won't be intimidated to watch it more than once due to length so it retains extra replay value).

2283402,5,B0009E32RA,"If you have not seen Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team yet, then why haven't you? What I think attracts fans to this series is that in a way it is similar to the way wars are faught here in real life. Aside from the giant robots, you have fighter jets, ground tanks, soilders on foot using regular guns with real ammo not laser blasters, innocent civilians and even guerrilla soilders caught in the middle. But on the surface its the same from what you would expect in a gundam series with two star-crossed lovers caught in the middle of a war.
  Ensign Shiro Amada is the new commander of the 08th Mobile Suit team on earth in Southeast Asia and is quick to prove himself in the eyes of his fellow commrads. But he quickly finds out that both life and war on earth can be much more different in many ways than life in the space colanies. And if these harsh battles aren't bad enough, Shiro meets a woman named Aina Sahalin who he slowly but shurley falls in love with. Likewise, Aina warms up to Shiro over time as well. So whats the problem here, Shiro fights for the Earthe Federation Forces and Aina is daughter of a noble family from the Principality of Zeon and is the pilot of the enemy's new experimental mobile armor that Shiro and his team are assigned to destroy allong with the enemy base in the region. So now the two of them are practically backed into a corner and must decide who there hearts belong to and where there true allegiances lie: with there armies, or with each other.

If you're into a decent animated romance series with action and plenty of humor, I recommend picking this up if you don't already have it.

Made in 1996 and released in a 12-episode OVA (followed up by another OVA titled ""Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team - Miller's Report""), the series was directed by Takeyuki Kanda (""Kiko Senki Dragonar"", ""SD Gundam Musha, Knight, Commando"") and Umanosuke Iida (""Origin ~Spirits of the Past~"", ""Vandread"" and ""Hellsing"") and a screenplay by Akira Okeya (""Grenadier"", ""Kodocha"", ""Transformers: Armada"") and Hiroaki Kitajima (""Noein"", ""Vision of Escaflowne"" and ""Witch Hunter Robin"").

The OVA series would feature a talent crew such as music by popular anime composer Kouhei Tanaka (""Ah! My Goddess"", ""Gate Keepers"", ""Dirty Pair"", ""Gunbuster"", etc.) and character designs by Tomoaki Kado (who worked on series such as ""Fullmetal Alchemist"", "".Hack/Sign"" and ""Infinite Ryvius"") and Toshihiro Kawamoto (who worked on series such as ""Fullmetal Alchemist"", ""City Hunter"" and ""Macross Plus"").  Mechanical designs are by Hajime Katoki (""Mobile Suit Gundam Wing"", ""Gundam Evolve"", ""Super Robot Wars OG Divine Wars"" and the ""Patlabor"" movies), Kimitoshi Yamane (""Cowboy Bebop"", ""Infinite Ryvius"" and ""Spriggan"") and Kunio Okawara (""Armored Trooper Votoms"", ""Mobile Suit Gundam"", ""Gravion"" and ""Super Robot Wars OG Divine Wars"").

The series takes place during October U.C. 0079 through December U.C. 0079 (during the final months of the one year war) and from reading online reports, 08th MS Team director Kanda Takeyuki wanted to deglamorize Mobile Suits because they were being mass produced and also wanted to focus more on ground-troop level combat.

The 08th MS Team is lead by their Commander Shiro Amada, a man with a unique style of leadership.  Shiro is a leader who wants to accomplish a mission without bloodshed. He respects human life no matter if it's comrade or enemy.

Thus in the first episode, he goes after a Zeon pilot and after the fight ensues between him and the Zeon warrior, instead of killing the soldier, he ends up rescuing and bandaging the soldier.  The soldier is Zeon pilot Aina Sakhalin.

Aina is shocked that a Federation officer has tried to save her life and he is nothing like other Federation soldiers.  This is a person with compassion.  Needless to say, in order to survive, both must work together to rescue themselves from danger and that time alone, the two form a respect for each other.

As we get to learn more about Shiro, from episode two through five, these episodes are more or less introductory episodes to each key individual of the 08th MS Team.

The team consists of:

Terry Sanders: In episode 1, Shiro saves Sanders life. But to many others, he is rumored to be bad luck because each team he has been a part of, everyone has died.  Shiro doesn't believe in any ""bad luck"" nonsense and puts his faith in Terry.

Karen Joshua: Karen is a muscular woman, a pilot, mechanic and very headstrong member of the team. Throughout the series, you learn why Karen is fighting and so passionate in fighting.

Eledore Mathis: Eledor is in charge of driving the tank. He seems to have a fascination towards Karen but his carefree style gets on her nerves. Eledore is also a songwriter and really doesn't want to be in the military but to create music.

Michel Ninorinch: Michel is the youngest member of the 08th MS Team. He's not very military savvy but he assists Eledore in maintaining the tank. His inexperience on the field tends to get on the nerves of the other team members but they regard him as part of the team nonetheless. Each day he sends a letter to his girlfriend BB every day to let her know that he is alive and well. But always worries of the day he won't be able to send a letter and being killed during combat.

Kiki Rosita: Kiki is not an official member of the 08th MS Team. She's part of a guerilla group of villagers who side with the 08th MS Team but only partnering together in order to rid of the Zeon in their area. But she grows fond of Shiro and takes part in their missions.

The twelve episodes for ""Mobile Suit Gundam - The 08th MS Team - Complete Collection - Anime Legends"" are on a total of four discs and the special on the fifth disc.  Included  are:

DISC 1:

  * EPISODE 1 - War for Two
  * EPISODE 2 - Gundams in the Jungle
  * EPISODE 3 - The Time Limit on Trust

DISC 2:

  * EPISODE 4 - The Demon Overhead
  * EPISODE 5 - The Broken Order to Stand By
  * EPISODE 6 - Battle Line on the Burning Sand

DISC 3:

  * EPISODE 7 - Reunion
  * EPISODE 8 - Duty and Ideals
  * EPISODE 9 - Front Line

DISC 4:

  * EPISODE 10 - The Shuddering Mountain (Part 1)
  * EPISODE 11 - The Shuddering Mountain (Part 2)
  * EPISODE 12 - Last Resort

DISC 5:

  * Miller's Report

The first five episodes are more or less getting to know the characters, more character development type of episodes focusing on each key member and their challenges during the war. You also see a side of the war such as the strategies to combat the enemy and also, unlike Gundams that can withstand hits and attacks, these Gundams can easily be damaged or even destroyed. Also, to show that pilots are not always strong. They have their weaknesses.

Once you get to episode 6, the humorous nature of the anime series suddenly turns serious as it sets up the battle between the 08th MS Team and the Zeon team headed by Aina.

During their battle, Shiro and Aina are taken far away and must depend on each other for survival and you learn that from the day they first met, the two have wanted to be together and are indeed in love with each other.

This sets up the final half of the OAV series sets up the stage as Shiro is being accused as a spy for Zeon and he has put his 08th MS Team at risk and for possible execution as accomplices.  In order to redeem themselves, the Federation puts them in a mission with a 38% survival rate and that mission is to destroy the Zeon base.  This also a mission that pits Shiro and Aina in opposition. Will they remain true to their side of the military or will they remain true to their relationship?

Miller's Report:

As for Miller's Report, back when it was released, many people debated whether or not to buy this special episode because it was more or less a rehash of the series but it did come with a few minutes of important footage.

In Japan, with the success of a television series or series in general, there tends to be a special that focuses on clips from the series. Sometimes you get additional footage and fortunately for ""MILLER'S REPORT"", you get footage covering Shiro Amada's trial as he is standing trial on being a spy for the Zeon.

Alice Miller, an officer of the Federation Intelligence Division has been dispatched to find the truth of why Shiro Amada a) Let a Zeon officer go free (not once but twice) b) Why he did not capture the enemy mobile armor when that was his primary mission.

Of the 55-minutes of the special episode, five minutes or maybe less is actual additional footage.  It may be a rehashing of clips from the series but the fact is that there is additional footage that has Amada explaining to Miller of why he did what he did, more on Eledore and also the Federation's perspective of the whole situation.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

The video quality is what I expected from an OVA series that took place back in 1995.  For those expecting that sharp, vibrant digital look of today's modern anime of course may be put off by the clarity of anime back then.  But this is how it was and personally, the transfer quality of this classic anime onto DVD was pretty solid.  I didn't catch any excessive dust or scratches.  Also, digital compression artifacts. It helps that there are only three episodes per DVD as well.  So, you really get cool action-packed fight scenes and good lighting that shows daylight and darkness throughout the jungle or desert. Aspect ratio is: 1.33:1 full frame, not widescreen.

As for audio, both English and Japanese dubs are featured in Stereo 2.0.  I originally watched the complete series in Japanese with English subtitles but I watched it this second time around via the English dub. The English dubbing was pretty good and for the English dub, one can expect the use of profanity.  But  it does work because these soldier's are fighting in a war and are on the battlefield.  And also this time around, I watched the anime series with my receiver set for all channels in Stereo and it definitely sounds much better the second time around.

Subtitles are only in English.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Having now completed my viewing of the entire series, I can't help but recommend this OAV series.  Also, for it's price, you are getting all 12 OVA episodes and also the Miller's Report special.

At first, I questioned the lightheartedness of the crew, the comedy and humor and their abilities as pilots because the early episodes focused on their personal naivety and to see them bested by villagers and to see Mobile Suits being easily destroyed, I really didn't know what to expect.  But the build up in storyline and how they prepare you for the final battle is just exciting, action-packed and you can't help but root for Shiro and Aina in their Romeo and Juliet romance and the final episode ""Last Resort"" (which takes place months after the final battle and the end of the war).

I've read that in the US, the final 12th episode ""Last Resort"" was not aired on television because children were featured.  For those not familiar with the MS Gundam series, a lot of the adults and men were killed in action on both the Federation and Zeon side. So, women and children were put into the battlefield as soldiers.  Also, a side not in terms of the final 12th episode. ""Last Resort"" was released 3 1/2 years after the 11th episode after the death of director Kanda Takeyuki who died in a car accident. The series was completed by GONZO's Iida Umanosuke.  But for those who have watched the series on television and haven't seen ""Last Resort"", it's imperative to watch the final 12th episode only on DVD because you get to learn the fate of the Shiro and Aina.

And again, for those who missed out on ""Miller's Report"" can now own it along with the other 12 OVA episodes.

Overall, ""MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM: The 08th MS Team"" is just a remarkable OAV series in the Universal Century world of Gundam. You really get a sense of how sick war is and how both sides (Zeon and Federation) and even the non-military villagers have suffered from it.  But also, how MS Gundams were not indestructible. Almost like in real life, even with the most modern of technology, may it be tanks or aircraft, they can be easily destroyed.

This was a very big difference in contrast to the ""Mobile Suit Gundam"" films (and I'm guessing as shown in the earlier episodes) where the Zeon was just in awe of how Amuro Ray's Mobile Suit hardly suffered any damage.

Also, you get to see a bit of strategy by the 08th team and of course, where Federation and Zeon are just at each others throats in many Gundam storylines, for this storyline, you have a Federation commander and a major Zeon pilot who have fallen in love with each other.  It really is a Gundam ""Romeo and Juliet"" storyline with an impressive ending. A great payoff for those who have watched the OVA's overtime.

""Mobile Suit Gundam - The 08th MS Team - Complete Collection"" via Bandai Entertainment's ""Anime Legends"" is highly recommended!",1249948800,54,14534,4.659448818897638
2283408,5,B0009E32RA,"The best Gundam anime series I've seen. It has many differences with all the other Gundam series out there. First there is the great story that only focuses on two main characters and five or six secondary characters, and the story is far reaching, taking place in one place through out the series. The second thing that separates this series from the rest of the Gundam series are the characters. There are only two main characters in Aina Sahalin and Shiro Amada and about six supporting characters. Other Gundam Series have five or six main characters and a bunch of supporting ones. With so few characters the anime and focus on them and give them life, which creators of the show did. Finally there is the action, which is unlike any other Gundam series you'll see. It's actually believable. No overblown battles, no super Gundams, just gritty down to earth war combat, that gets you excited and drawn into the battles.

So in conclusion if you want to see a Gundam series for the first time or see a different kind of Gundam series this is it. The only other series that compares is the original Mobile Suit Gundam.",1240704000,8,1121,4.633165829145729
2283409,5,B0009E32RA,"This was one of my better recent Gundam purchases.  I never felt as if there were any ""filler"" episodes (except for maybe the Miller's report and the last episode) like I encountered with Zeta.  And this being the newest of my purchases, the animation is a lot better.  As Zeta I felt was too long, this was a little too short.",1238284800,,327,4.327868852459017
2283420,5,B0009E32RA,"MS Gundam: The 08th MS Team - Anime Legends Complete Box is great overall.
It is actually 355 minutes long, NOT 335 minutes.  It comes with alot of bonus clips that run an average of 3 minutes.  These bonus clips are about how the UC colonies started building in space, how The Principality of Zeon started, their Zeon mobile suits, and about an overview of Mobile Suit Gundam series.  It also has the Mobile Suit/Vehicles/Characters Encyclopedia of the 08th MS Team series. The box set is thin, like a regular single DVD box, but contains 5 discs. 4 discs contain all 12 episodes, and the 5th disc contains Miller's Report.

The animation itself is awesome, and in my opinion, is better than or on par with the animation of Gundam Seed or Gundam 00.

The only thing that disappoints me is that it does not have Widescreen.",1237161600,15,823,4.571428571428571
2283421,5,B0009E32RA,"This is the Gundam series most grounded in realism.  Though still far from realistic, it's close as a giant robot show will get.  It's good old fashioned ground pounding with the use of tactics and strategy because their mobile suits aren't indestructible. My biggest complaint about Gundam Wing was that many of the battles were the same thing (including the same animations over and over again) and all the gundams did was stand there and shoot while all the bad guys die.  That doesn't create a lot of tension or excitement.  This show, in particular the fight against the gouf ace is tense and very dramatic.  What Japan needs to do is more realistic war stories from the Universal Century story line.",1218758400,,705,4.745901639344262

My DVD set was delivered earlier than the date that Amazon said was the minimum time expected. Aside from that, this is a great series. It is not too long, only twelve episodes. Then there is the fifth disc that includes a documentary style account on the hardships and controversy that the 08th Team and Kojima Battallion had to face. This is all you need to know: If you are a Gundam fan, you can't die until you have seen this series. It is well worth this low price for a great series. The animation style is outdated, yet still visually stunning. This series does take a more practical process of animation, as the Mobile Suits do take damage and lose fuctionality, and other real life element to an almost impractical science fiction.

2283428,5,B0009E32RA,"The 8th MS Team is my single favorite Gundam series. I've always loved the plot of the original Mobile Suit Gundam and the ideas it presented about warfare, but the art is somewhat painful in this day and age. The 8th MS Team holds true to the original ideas of the series while updating the one year war with absolutly gorgeous animation. The Gundums are just advanced models of existing units, they're not the miniature war winning gods presented in other series. This uniformity lets the cast shine through. That's a good thing, because the struggles of the men and women of the 8th MS Team against all the death around are the most interesting parts of the series. For a show that combines gut-searing action with thoughtful depth, you can't beat the 8th.",1150070400,17,759,4.6716417910447765

2283451,5,B0009E32RA,"I've only been seriously into anime for a few years. When Toonami started to use high calibre stuff like 08th MS team, Gundam Wing, and Outlaw Star I slowly started to get hooked. With all of the other Gundam series aired I was repelled by the crappy animation and long, drawn-out stories. Maybe I'm just not serious enough... or am I?

As stated before: the other series just weren't up to snuff with this one. The rich colors and crisp, clear animation are eyecatching. They truly emphasize the greatness of the series. I like how the mechas keep true to the fact that they are metal. In the original Gundam 0079 the Mobile Suits' sholder plates bent and the armor folded like skin around the joints. And when one of them got hit they ALWAYS exploded into dust. When an enemy Zaku II gets hit in this series you SEE it go down and burn. There is incredible attention to detail in everything this series does.

This series shows a lot of humanity. In earlier Gundam installations it was Good Guy/Bad Guy. Federation was ALWAYS good and Zeon was ALWAYS evil. In 08th MS Team they show an un-biased view of the One Year War. You feel for both sides of the conflict because they are shown as humans; not just soldiers. Same goes when Eladore gets drunk and thrown in a Zeon prison. It shows that he is more than just a Hovertruck operator. He makes mistakes and errors.

The story is also VERY excellent. The series shows EVERY aspect of the story so you know whats going on. It helps you understand stuff you wouldn't understand if they just showed action sequences. Some series like to do that. While the action is ample a love story is delicately nestled between the death and war. It shows that ""love can bloom on the battlefield""(Metal Gear Solid reference^_^) I like the realism that Shiro and Aina have. Their missions come first. I like how later, when they realize that it's ""now or never"" they risk all to be together... touching(sniffle)

2283457,5,B0009E32RA,"I am new to anime but I ordered this brick because I had seen a very cool music video that used footage from it.

This anime is essentially a mix between a war film, Romeo and Juliet and a mecha - a strange combination but it works. The love story is between the optimistic and compassionate feddie, Shiro Amada and the beautiful and caring Zeon, Aina Sahalin. Although there is love at first sight, the war gets in the way of any relationship.

  Excellently we see war from both sides and it is not a biased perspective. Aina's brother (a Zeon scientist) seems a reasonable man at first, but his belief that a super weapon will bring peace sends him into madness. Although the Zeon's are a little more brutal than the Feddie's they are just normal soldiers and this is put forward several times.

  08th MS team's story is not complex or philosophical like for example Evangelion and this will be a relief for many who find complex ramblings a turn off. This is a tale about ordinary soldier's and their experiences. This realism is what I like so much about this series. The MS team are not amazing pilots and they make mistakes. The Gundams look gritty and realistic, moving like machines and having a weighty feel to them, not flying around as though they way nothing. Several times in the series we see repair's being done to the Gundams, a touch I really liked.

  All the characters in the series I liked and I thought they were realistic, funny and I warmed to them. I implore you however to watch this in japanese in subtitles because the English dub is cringe worthy.

  Animation is really excellent, the best ive seen outside of films. This really helps make the action scenes explosive and powerful.

  The intro and outro music are both quite catchy J-pop songs whilst the footage is overlayed with a good classical score.

  The DVD has some good extras but ive liked to have seen some interviews. The layout is very cool as well.

  In conclusion if you like high quality action tied in with a warming love story this is for you. Even if you don't like anime i'd still recommend this. Suit u",1126828800,15,2108,4.506596306068602

If one wishes for ""realistic"" portrayals within this series, one would look no further then 0080 War in a Pocket. Even the original TV show had more realism than this piece of cow patty. Sweating in a space suit (normal suit) down in the damp turgid bowel of the jungles in the Amazon? Keep in mind that what his wearing can brush off (aiming low estimates both ways here too!) -200 ~ +200 levels of temperature in space!

Try standing just to the side a little bit in front of a tank or artillery barrel. And those; just two examples of the idiocy that is displayed throughout the show. When it came out, the creators boasted that they where trying to portray a grittier side of this sprawling saga. But in the end, all they showed was a parade of squinting clowns shambling about with meaningful intent.",1126396800,,1060,4.554973821989528

Other then that the collection kick's ass and it is suprisingly lose for Gundam. I my favorite suit in that series and second favorite all togather was the Gouf Custom used by Norris Packard in the second last war episode, by that I mean the last episodes based during the One Year War. The voice acting is awsome and the detail in the drawings and the story are perfect for the anime era. There is great character developement in this story and great mech disigns. Im trying not to spoil the story like my last reveiw {Mobile Suit Gundam Encounters in Space for the PS2} I saw these DVDS should have comintary and all the other Gundam DVDS but there are little bonus features that give back ground info on the war in Japanese though but with subtitles. This is a great series for all gundam fans and maybe Veitnam fans to.",1125100800,,965,4.396648044692737

8059470,5,B0009E32RA,"I am a big Gundam fan, Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team is my favorite of all the Gundam anime shows. I've watched it on Hulu multiple times and wanted to buy it on Blu-Ray but was hesitant due to all the latest reviews receiving copies without the discs inside, I'm happy to report my set arrived with discs inside, all brand new. Unfortunately Amazon shipped this per usual in just an envelope so it arrived pretty banged up and cracked, but the discs survived just fine.

This show was made in 1995 and debuted in 1996, the animation, music, and subject matter are all top notch. '95 was kind of a great year for anime, some great stuff came out that year like Ghost in the Shell and Neon Genesis Evangelion. This show isn't super action packed, but when there is action it's great. I'm a big fan of the military aspect of this show, as it follows the 08th team using RX-79 Ground Type Gundam Mobile Suits, and sometimes get help from Gorilla warriors aiding to fight the Zeon off of Earth. I love the Mobile Suits in this OVA the most, the RGM's, the RX-79G's, the Zaku II, just some really great design aesthetics. I've even got a few of the great Bandai Model kits of these to build. It's just a really awesome series with good characters and story and action. And it's all executed brilliantly.

8059474,5,B0009E32RA,"The 08th MS Team Blu-Ray is a wonderful addition to the Gundam library.

The story is great. Set during the One Year War, it follows the grunts on earth. The Mobile Suits break down, the environment is harsh, and the characters are deceiving.

The Blu-Ray looks great and does the series justice.",1514592000,,296,4.673076923076923
