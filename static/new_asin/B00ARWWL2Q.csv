5495151,4,B00ARWWL2Q,"Granted, there is some time traveling in this movie, but the science fiction element is really just a means to an end.  This fact becomes pretty obvious as it only takes a few seconds for the shedding of clothes to begin.  Leon and Daria are apparently serving on some kind of spaceship, one that houses the newly invented ""exotic time machine.""  They quickly decide to mix business with pleasure (more his pleasure than hers, as it turns out), and Daria sort of accidentally sends Leon back in time to mediaeval France, where he pops up sans clothes in the very boudoir of Marie Antoinette.  After watching Marie and her serving girl entertain each other, Leon finds his own ticket being served by the lustful queen; when the king shows up unannounced, Leon quickly finds himself shackled to a wall in the Bastille.  Back on the ship, Daria's first attempt to find Leon and bring him back fails, as she finds herself hobnobbing with a sultan and his harem girls.  Eventually reunited, the time travelers accidentally pay a visit to Al Capone and his lady friend in the hours following the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.  Arriving back on board ship, they realize that one of them has changed history quite radically, so they have to head back to mediaeval France to resolve the source of the unfortunate temporal dislocations their unapproved time traveling has caused.
The production value is actually quite good for a movie of this type; it even has a little of what I would call an artistic nature to it.  The acting, what there is of it, is actually pretty good, the sets acceptably represent the different historical eras fairly well, and Gabriella Hall is exceedingly easy on the eyes.  I just wish Daria had gotten as much screen time as Marie Antoinette did.  The adult content of the movie, of which there is a somewhat surprising amount, places it somewhere along the border of NC17 material, so don't expect to see this movie turn up on the Sci Fi Network any time soon.",1044921600,19,1981,4.699421965317919

8557203,4,B00ARWWL2Q,"For this type of Skinemax movie, this is decent. The female lead, Gabrielle Hall, is well above average in acting talent for these types of films. Don't expect much acting from the rest of the cast, who were chosen more for their great bodies. LOL",1464825600,3,247,4.511111111111111
