8681660,5,B00O2LMU56,"I got introduced to Trot music while watching the Korean reality series ROOMMATES.  One of the roommates was taught trot music in one of the episodes.  This piqued my interest because TROT LOVERS came up as a suggested series on my Dramafever account on a regular basis.  I finally decided to view it and was hooked.

The story is about a young woman and her ever so cute little sister Byul.  They lived with their father who got in trouble with loan sharks and went into hiding leaving the two girls to fend for themselves.  What happens after that are all of the funny antics and events of trying to survive and pay back her fathers debt so he can come back home.  Add to the mix a couple of crazy loan sharks, a fallen kpop idol, a mysterious CEO and his weird son, a misguided rival female singer and her very evil mother, lots of singing and dancing along the way as several storylines unfold and you've got this series.

I loved this series it so much that I had to buy it.  I got the OST also, but was disappointed that it really didn't have any of the songs by the main female lead on it.  She has a fantastic voice and this style of music suited it very well so it was a huge disappointment for there not being any of her on the OST, but at least I can re-watch the series over and over again to hear her sing.",1426982400,2,1319,4.15748031496063
