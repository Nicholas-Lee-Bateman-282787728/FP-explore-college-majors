2824154,5,B000PKG7CK,"You get your money's worth on this film-noir double feautre.  Let's start with the more entertaining of the two films:

THE BIG STEAL - As a team, Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer are pretty well-known, at least to classic film fans, for their pairing in ""Out Of The Past,"" but I thought they were a lot more fun to watch in this particular film noir, which I waited a long time to see on a nice DVD transfer.

This movie is almost one long chase scene, with people in three vehicles all on the move....with a neat twist at the end. There is the typical 1940s budding romance in which the two parties do nothing with insult each other until the end. Sometimes that gets really old but in here it isn't, maybe because Greer has so many good lines.

It's also fun to see the old cars racing around hairpin curves, although the special effects are really dated. The fight scenes didn't look too realistic, either. Hey, I didn't say it was technically a great movie.....just a fun one to watch. Equally entertaining were two of the other people in on the chases: William Bendix and Patric Knowles.

ILLEGAL - This movie may not look like a film noir, but there are some great film noir-type lines here, like the one I used in the subject head. I heard at least a dozen that I almost laughed out loud at because they were so good and/or clever. This is a not a ""B"" film with its dialog and terrific cast.

I agree it's not one that is terribly exciting, either, but it has more than its share of good points. One good starting point is the star: Edward G. Robinson. It's tough to knock a film with him in the lead. It's a little talky but there are some dramatic, surprising moments, too, with Robinson's ""Victor Scott,"" doing some things you have to see to believe.

Nina Foch, Hugh Marlowe and Albert Dekker are all good in key roles, but I found it more interesting at times to see familiar faces in the supporting characters. Actors such as Ellen Corby (""Miss Hinkel""), DeForest Kelley (""Edward Clary""), Edward Platt (""Ralph Ford""), Jayne Mansfield (""Angel O'Hara""), Henry Kulky (""Taylor), Jan Merlin (""Andrew Garth"") and a few others, were all fascinating. I liked Corby, in particular. You may not know all their names, but you know their faces. Kelley starred for years on ""Star Trek"" and Platt was the boss in ""Get Smart."" In Mansfield's case, you know more than just her face!",1233273600,2,2377,4.5011600928074245
2824155,4,B000PKG7CK,"I bought this recently released double feature mostly for ""The Big Steal"", so I'll start with that. Just a fun fast-moving film, dominated by the reluctant unfolding romantic duo of Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer, but with a fine supporting cast, headed by William Bendix. While Bob is chasing Jane(so to speak), the long car chase through mostly rural Mexico adds to the feeling of exotic fun. The commentary version, featuring Richard Jewell, is well worth listening to. We learn this film underwent considerable revision during production because of multiple censor board problems, thus explaining some of the lapses in plot continuity. Thus, it ended up a chase thriller-scewball comedy combo rather than the film noire it apparently was supposed to be(I'm glad). During production, Mitchum spent a short stretch in jail in connecion with his drug possession charge. Apparently, it was hoped the judge would not sentence Mitchum to jail time during shooting.  Howard Hughes was forced to cast Jane Greer as the female lead despite his desire to end her career for spiteful reasons. No other potential female lead approached would risk her career to play opposite Mitchum after his much publicized drug bust. As it turned out, the movie-going public immediately forgave Mitchum, perhaps because it seemed to fit his typical screen persona as a devil-may-care rebel. The sizzling on-screen chemistry between Mitchum and Greer demonstrated in a prior film sizzled again in this one, as far as the censor board would allow it.
  I'm not much into Eddie Robinson films, except for his mesmerizing performance in ""The Sea Wolf"". However, I found ""Illegal"" to be moderately entertaining, if sometimes bewildering, with too many convenient coincidences. Don't expect any big overt romances, although Eddie clearly has feelings for Nina Foch's character.  Robinson plays
a pretentious lawyer, bent on winning every case, no matter how low he has to stoop to get the job done. Obviously, he has a severe Napoleon complex. After sending an innocent man to the electric chair, as a prosecuting attorney, he decides to become a defense attorney. In most cases dramatized, he knows the defendant is guilty, but sometimes resorts to unbelievable courtroom theatrics to convince the judge or jury otherwise. In other cases, he weasels a victory from questional legal or arm twisting tactics. He is a marked man in his last and personally most important case, when he is sure the accused is innocent...Jayne Mansfield appears in her first film role, with limited screen time. It's nice to see her portrayed as freshly naive and musically talented, before her conversion into a vulgar MM-mimic sex siren....The commentary version, featuring Nina Foch, the female lead, is worth going through, especially for a glimpse of the limitations of the filming technology of the times.
  Both DVD transfers are of excellent quality and the special features are a plus. These two films are also now available in a 10 film package for 3X the price.",1186617600,25,3022,5.144602851323829

2824157,5,B000PKG7CK,"I really like the movie ""Illegal"" because is has a good rhythm to it. The main character is driven to be the best at what he does and move up because of where he came from and I think that idea is relatable. Then he disappoints himself and his confidence is shaken which leads him temporarily in the wrong path. That's relatable too.  I like seeing a fresh face Jane Mansfield too. Getting back to the main character, I enjoyed the drama of his journey. The second feature; ""The big Steal"" I was most surprised to note that I enjoyed this on the road  drama too! Mitchum living up to the man's man ideal. I also enjoyed getting some background information on both this actors in relation to the films. I found it interesting. If You are a lover of old film noir movies; I think you'll like both of these.",1422403200,2,804,4.317880794701987

I was fascinated by this as a child and no less so today even at the chilling rate I paid for this old Warner Bros. crime thriller. Very little of my fee went to the entertainers as it should have,  now did it?",1397692800,,387,4.608695652173913
2824159,2,B000PKG7CK,This is the second copy of this film I have bought (from two different sources).  The Big Steal simply would not play on either copy I purchased.  The supplier was quick to refund my money.,1395360000,,189,4.371428571428571
2824160,4,B000PKG7CK,"THE BIG STEAL (1949) is B-movie at its most no-nonsense. It's film noir dressed up as a chase film. We eyeball the rugged hero nursing that touch of moral ambiguity and the tough-talking dame and we absorb the hard-boiled dialogue. It's based on Richard Wormser's short story, ""The Road to Carmichael's,"" and don't even pretend you didn't know that. Don Siegel directs in one of his earliest efforts, but what that means is that you're in for a taut crime thriller. The script is tight and well-paced. It's surprisingly funny.

The story kicks off in Vera Cruz, Mexico. There, we glimpse Army Lt. Duke Halliday (Robert Mitchum), him what just got framed for stealing the U.S. Army's payroll. Duke is caught in the middle of a risky daisy chain. He's tracking the actual thief (Patrick Knowles) while trying to stay one step ahead of U.S. Army Capt. Vincent Blake (William Bendix), the officer bent on bringing Duke in for military justice.

In Vera Cruz, Joan Graham (Jane Greer) has cornered her dodgy fianc, James Fiske (Knowles). She wants back the $2000 she'd loaned him. Does she get her money back? Didn't I just say the guy was dodgy? Will your jaw gape when you find out (fairly early on) that Joan's fianc is whom Lt. Halliday is doggedly trailing? So here's Joan and Duke Halliday, initially at loggerheads but then finding that one commonality. Off they race back in pursuit across the breadth of Mexico, finding an accord in their condemnation of that slippery knave, Mr. Fiske. And once Mitchum and Greer join forces, the movie elevates another notch. If you'd seen them in that film noir classic,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Out-of-the-Past/dp/B000244EYW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Out of the Past</a>&nbsp;(1947), then you know about their electrifying chemistry. And when Halliday later on laments - ""A spot like this, a guy's better off lonesome."" - we all know he's fibbin'. He sure gets plenty of mileage calling Joan ""Chiquita.""

What else is left to say? I'll just regurgitate. Don Siegel's expert direction keeps things moving. Mitchum and Greer sizzle in their interplay. I happen to think that Jane Greer is dynamite in film noir, her calling cards a redoubtable sense of moxie and that enigmatic expression that spurred RKO to advertise her as ""the woman with the Mona Lisa smile."" I don't even think she did that many film noir pictures. But she's so memorable in Out of the Past and so good in The Big Steal that she's left an indelible mark. As for Robert Mitchum, he's aw-ight if you like them sexy, laconic sorts. I don't want to slight the supporting cast. Patrick Knowles is slick and hateful. Ramon Novarro as ""Colonel Ortega"" provides a smidge of comic relief while never undercutting his character's competence. William Bendix is ferocious as the implacable Army captain. Whenver he and Mitchum share a scene, the audience is treated to onscreen combustibility. But don't twist it, I'd rather bask in the crackling heat that Mitchum and Greer generate.

Oh, and I haven't seen ILLEGAL.",1389398400,2,3067,5.067326732673267
2824161,4,B000PKG7CK,"Take heed of the other reviews, this is barely a noir if that is your cup of tea.  It takes place in the daytime (j/k), there is some gunplay and fighting but it's minimal, it's more of a madcap chase by 3 parties across Mexico.  If I were to guess, I'd think that either someone at RKO had connections in Mexico so it could be shot for pennies (or owed Mexico a favor), or the Mexican government made a deal to shoot it there since it's practically a travelogue.  It's frantic nonstop action, starting from scene one, and those poor old cars are put through great distress.  The car scenes are quite well done considering the likely low budget and time constraints and lack of special effects.  It's one of the first films directed by Don Siegel of Dirty Harry fame and he acquits himself quite well.  It pops up on TCM now and again if you have one of those new-fangled DVR thingys.",1389139200,2,884,4.359756097560975
2824162,4,B000PKG7CK,"Edward G. Robinson stars in ""Illegal"" as Victor Scott, a sharp, silver-tongued, moralizing district attorney who has no qualms about sending men to the chair. When he discovers an executed man was actually innocent, he quits. He laments, ""I'd rather see a hundred guilty men go free than convict another innocent man. He becomes a private citizen and eventually turns to the bottle as he struggles to find new work. His former protg (Nina Foch) continues working at the D.A.'s office and plans to marry a young lawyer (Hugh Marlowe). Some romantic tension brews between the two but that is nothing compared to the trouble the two face when Scott becomes a mouthpiece for a mob kingpin and one of them faces a seemingly false murder charge as well.

Like Allen's other noir b-movie classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Suddenly/dp/B0001UZZPY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Suddenly</a>, the film features a top notch performance by the A-list lead but some corny and poor acting on the behalf of actors in smaller and bit roles (such as the murder victim at the film's start). Robinson's character is an interesting lad; he is loosely based on real life criminal defender Bill Fallon. Nina Foch did well in her role and it was interesting to see Jayne Mansfield in her very first film. The dark cinematography at night paired with 1950s sets and costumes provides an interesting city of sights and atmosphere. The story is intriguing as this uptight former D.A. finds himself knee deep in criminal activity as well as a dilemma involving his past personal life. This is not the best film for anyone involved but it is a solid blend of stylish noir, mystery and corruption in melodrama.

Robert Mitchum stars as army man Duke Halliday in ""The Big Steal."" His payroll stash is stolen and he pursues Fiske, the man he suspects stole the loot, when his superior officer accuses Duke of the theft. On the chase to Mexico, he encounters Joan Graham (Jane Greer), Fiske's squeeze who was also ripped off by Fiske. Feelings of uncertainty and lack of trust between the two ensue as they play cat-and-mouse with Fiske as well as local authorities. The betrayals, threats and twists keep coming as the film reaches its climax and Duke and Graham will need a lot to cheat Death and recover the big steal. This film features a repairing of Greer and Mitchum, the ultimate noir heavy, from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Out-of-the-Past/dp/B000244EYW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Out of the Past</a>. ""The Big Steal"" pales in comparison but it is a solid caper with slick noir-style and thrills.

This DVD combo features a lot of neat features, particularly from films released decades ago. Film commentaries included feature actress Nina Foch and film historians Patricia King Hanson and Richard B. Jewell. New featurettes made for this DVD are also featured as well as the original theatrical trailers.",1347062400,,2974,5.296610169491525
2824163,5,B000PKG7CK,"If you are a fan of Out of the Past and love to watch Mitchum and Jane Greer together in Mexico, this is your kind of film.  Much more light hearted than Out of the Past, The Big Steal offers comedic touches and vignettes of old Mexico through characters and romantic scenery of a bygone Mexico.  Especially beautiful to see is the old Penafiel Hotel in Puebla, replete with flowers girls strewing the pool with roses from a canoe and charming backdrop shots of the hotel property. A must for fans.",1311638400,2,498,4.461538461538462
2824164,3,B000PKG7CK,"""Illegal"" is a story about an ambitious District Attorney, Victor Scott (Edward G. Robinson), who prosecutes an innocent man, Ed Clary,,  for a woman's murder.  He soon finds out he was wrong and tries to stop the execution.  He calls the prison to stop the electrocution but is a few minutes too late.  He realizes he made a terrible mistake and blames himself.  He was planning on running for Governor, but now that dream is dead.  He resigns as prosecutor and decides to enter private practice.  However, he cannot stifle his will to win cases.  His intelligence and reputation draws the attention of Frank Garland, a mob kingpin.  He succeeds in bribing Scott into representing one of his gang on a murder rap.  Scott, as usual, uses dramatic tactics to win the case.  He drinks the poison that is supposed to be the murder weapon and shocks the jury into declaring the mobster innocent.

As Scott digs himself deeper and deeper into mob politics it has affected his former protg (and love interest).  She is charged with a murder that seems to implicate her as a ""rat"" for the mob.  Victor decides to defend her and keep the mob appeased as well.  He has used theatrics before and the final scene is odd, surprising and unbelievable.",1294272000,,1238,4.666666666666667
2824165,3,B000PKG7CK,"1955's Illegal isn't so much a noir as a potboiler. Edward G. Robinson plays hard-charging district attorney Victor Scott whose wrongful conviction of Edward Clary (played by Star Trek's DeForest Kelley) sends an innocent man to the electric chair. A brief dalliance with the bottle is followed by rebirth as a criminal attorney and eventually a mobster's mouthpiece. The plotting is not particularly suspenseful, and while the dialog (co-written by W.R. Burnett who'd written the novels&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Caesar/dp/B0006HBLUK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Caesar</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Asphalt-Jungle/dp/B000244EWO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Asphalt Jungle</a>) has a few snappy lines, it doesn't sustain a hard-boiled tone.

Robinson's starring role, even in this B+ picture, was a plum in 1955, as a HUAC-styled whisper campaign had dimmed his appeal to Hollywood studios. Robinson's co-star, Nina Foch, had been busy with both television and film since the mid-1940s, and from her comments on the bonus track, she was happy to be working with Robinson (who was a friend of her father's), but is none too impressed with the film. Her lengthy Hollywood career, and her post-acting work teaching directing (first at AFI, then as a professor at USC), supplies plenty of unfiltered opinion and dish. She adds insightful details about the mechanics of film making in the mid-50s, and the limitations it placed on actors and directors.

The story's original incarnation, as 1932's The Mouthpiece, had the leads playing love interests, but Robinson and Foch's age difference motivated a rewrite as a foster parent/child, with hints of more. There are interesting threads to that latter conflict, but 1955 was not a year in which the complexity of the leads' relationship could be explored. Jayne Mansfield's debut, and supporting roles by Ellen Corby and Edward Platt add to the film's worth.

1949's The Big Steal has a few moments of intensity in its climactic scene, and the characters' corruption follows one of noir's central themes, but much like Illegal, this film is more standard drama than full-on noir. Actually, it's a combination chase, whodunit and screwball comedy, as Robert Mitchum is both pursuer and pursued in a race through picturesque locations in Mexico. Directed by Don Siegel (who would later helm the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Invasion-of-the-Body-Snatchers/dp/0782009980/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Invasion of the Body Snatchers</a>, the remake of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Killers/dp/B00007ELDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Killers</a>, and the first&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dirty-Harry/dp/B0015XHQTO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dirty Harry</a>), the film doesn't expose its plot until thirty minute in, and even then, a noir-like uncertainty clings to the character's motivations.

Mitchum is reteamed here with Jane Greer, but the intensity of their work in 1947's classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Out-of-the-Past/dp/B000244EYW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Out of the Past</a>, is leavened with romantic comedy. Siegel keeps the action tense throughout, but the film-length arc of animosity-to-love played between Mitchum and Greer keeps the characters from ever becoming truly desperate or hopeless. Some of this can be attributed to the film's production circumstances, as explained in the commentary track by USC professor Richard Jewell. In addition to shooting around Mitchum's 50-day absence on a pot bust, the screenwriters had to maneuver around a particularly censorious standards committee. The result is a script that's stripped of its original darkness. Ramon Novarro, a matinee idol from the silent era, provides a superb turn as a Mexican inspector general.

Both films are accompanied by modern featurettes and original trailers, and the prints are clean. The Big Steal is the more compelling of the two, for Siegel's direction, the location shooting, and the snappy chemistry between the leads. Both film's commentary tracks are well worth a listen.

8191983,4,B000PKG7CK,"No question the later actor Robert Mitchum was built for heavy lifting, was built to take a punch and give a few too with those big broad shoulders and that jutted-jaw. No question also that he would not lack for a little companionship under the sheets if it came to that (and it would) from the ladies drawn to guys with dangerous eyes and dangerous thoughts (bedroom eyes to the ladies and you can figure out the thoughts yourself because after all I don't want to get in trouble with Will Hayes Hollywood censorship operation even fifty plus years later). Yeah back in the 1940s and 1950s, maybe later too, old Robert gave as good as he got as the film under review, The Big Steal, demonstrates. Although this effort is miles below his previous classic performance with Jane Greer as the gun-simple mobsters girl in Out of The Past.

Of course in Out Of The Past Jane Greer was nothing but a fetching if trigger-happy gangsters girl femme fatale who has that mobster (played by a young Kirk Douglas) and a hard-nosed P.I. (played by Mitchum) mumbling to themselves (and liking it) before he lower the trigger on the pair (and who knows who else on her way up in the world. The whole film was a thing of beauty as they all rush like hell to their twisted fates. Here the pace as befits a film using the backdrop of Mexico as its locale is slower, the game for mere filthy lucre.

Heres how it played out and once you know that you know that old Mitchum was glad as hell that he drew this ending rather than the couple of slugs he earned in Out of the Past for his efforts. Seems this grifter named Fiske, a guy who thought he knew all the angles stepped up his game a bit and robbed a U.S. Army payroll (a big payout of 300, 000 dollars by the way) leaving a certain Army officer-in-charge holding the bag. Leaving Duke holding the bag (Mitchums role). Like I said Duke/Mitchum wasn't built to take the fall no matter what the situation looked like at the beginning. Back then, now too probably robbing anything from the Army is going to cause waves and so Duke is on the trail of Fiske into sunny Mexico to get the loot back. One way or another. Along the way he runs into Joan, a good looking gringa who knows Spanish played by that previously mentioned Jane Greer. Joan has her own axe to grind with Fiske since he sweet-talked her out of a couple of grand before he blew town on her.
Eventually Duke and Joan cross paths in their respective hunts for the grifter who as it turns out is heading into the interior of Mexico to fence the 300k since Army dough is too hot to handle in the States. But Duke and Joan are not the only ones looking for the lost el dorado a certain Captain Blake, U.S. Army and Dukes boss is looking for him , and the dough. Blake figured that the robbery was an inside job and Duke was looking for his payoff. So we have Duke (and after some not so subtle verbal foreplay between the pair a now smitten Joan) chasing Fiske and Blake chasing then both in dramatic car chases and sleigh-of-hands until Fiske gets to the max daddy fence who takes a big chunk of dough for taking big risks. But just as the deal was being consummated Duke (and don't forget Joan okay) and Blake show up. Turned out Blake had a more than passing interest in his confederate Fiske. But justice, rough Mexican justice, maybe rough Army justice to boot won out in the end the good guys, Duke and Joan, win.

Still I, all the way through the film. kept silently urging Duke to be careful as he let her get under his skin around a woman previously known to be a trite bit gun crazy.",1458345600,,3587,4.311111111111111
