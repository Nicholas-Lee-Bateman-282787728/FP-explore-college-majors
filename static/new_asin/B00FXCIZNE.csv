6035773,2,B00FXCIZNE,"I am a barre workout junkie with a sprinkle of yoga and kickboxing. I thought this would be modern due to the cover.  It is like an 80's b film with a very limited toning part and a kind of goofy at home ballet class.  Odd dvd.  If you like physique 57 or booty barre, this is not what you are looking for.",1397520000,26,306,3.8253968253968256
6035774,5,B00FXCIZNE,I love this workout video.  Stephanie takes her time and go through each technique so that you are able to grasp! I get up early mornings and stretch to this video and before I go to bed at night! Its definetly great before dance rehearsals!,1395878400,11,241,4.355555555555555
6035775,5,B00FXCIZNE,"I use ballet conditioning for my exercises! I am always hunting for new or different types of ballet workouts. I honestly didn't have over the top expectations for the experience of this DVD. Let me tell you this DVD is my absolute FAVORITE ballet conditioning workout!!!! You don't realize the immense work you are doing to lengthen & build leaner muscle because stretching is intricately woven within each workout. I mainly work out to the Body Stretch & Flow exercise. The music, your ballet teacher, & the sequence of movement creates a powerful workout - minus confusion, frustration, or ridiculous frequent transitions between each exercise. Are some movements challenging? Of course...you need a realistic goal to remain motivated. However, each movement can be modified. By the time you get through any of the workouts on this DVD at least twice, you too will feel like a prima ballerina...walking with more confidence, leaner, stronger, looking fabulous!!!!!! Buy this DVD today!!",1393804800,28,989,5.226415094339623

8619170,2,B00FXCIZNE,Boring. This is mainly Pilates based workout. Graceful Pilates set but honestly disappointing if you looking for a danced based workout,1450915200,2,135,5.476190476190476

8619172,2,B00FXCIZNE,"This is NOT for beginners.  She does not explain how to do the exercises correctly, particularly in the first part.  That is critical for any exercise DVD, and is especially so for something like ballet.  Unless you have ballet training, this is NOT the tape for you.  It is assumed that you know ballet terminology and movements and none of that is taught.  Ballet done incorrectly has little to no benefit and can actually harm you.  If you have ballet training, you can get some exercise ideas; but the blurbs claim this is for beginners and it absolutely is not.",1421280000,3,566,4.61
8619173,5,B00FXCIZNE,I love these workouts.  They are a little dated but I knew that because I had the VHS Tapes.  Feels good to do these and I really feel my muscles are elongated afterwards.,1411689600,5,171,4.151515151515151
8619174,5,B00FXCIZNE,"Eventhough it an older VHS workout recently made in DVD format, I absolutely love this for the mat stretching exercises. It is one of the best videos on the market for full body stretching, and it leaves you feeling so good afterwards.",1408665600,6,235,4.619047619047619
8619175,4,B00FXCIZNE,Very different. I use sometimes.,1406764800,,32,5.6
8619176,3,B00FXCIZNE,"The first 90 minutes of this workout is an exact duplicate of ""Dance with me"" workout with a picture of Stephanie  in a white costume  I sure wished the production company had mentioned this in the description.  It's not anywhere on the video. It is called Muscle workout.  The last hour is an old VHS print copied onto a disc.  Do not think of this as a toning workout, but a stretching workout with light aerobic and light toning.  I will put this in my cardio dance section for when I want a light workout with a lot of stretching.

Don't think I will buy anymore SH workouts until they describe accurately how much video material is duplicated from other workouts.",1406505600,12,668,4.471074380165289
8619177,5,B00FXCIZNE,"I was favorably impressed by this ballet set.
The host knows ballet and teached this fitness
program knowledgeably.

I saw improvement in my posture quickly and am now
noticing a flatter tummy to.

Nice price and quick delivery from amazon.",1399161600,7,240,4.975
