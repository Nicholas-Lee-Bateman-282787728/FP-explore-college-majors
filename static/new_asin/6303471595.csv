It is one of my all time favorites. You can't go wrong with a cast like Ben Johnson, Iron Eyes Cody and Alex Cord. It is an all around good old fashion movie.",1200355200,7,326,3.6714285714285713
671784,1,6303471595,"Groan. This low budget oater is full of every ""noble savage"" cliche in the book (who can forget Scar offering 3 horses for Beth and then fighting Grayeagle for her). The best that can be said for this movie is that their hearts were in the right place, and the scenery is gorgeous. Plus they did cast Iron Eyes Cody as one of the leads. The lead actress, however, can't really act, and whoever cast Alex Cord as Grayeagle should have their head examined. He is an adequate actor in Western roles but at the time this movie was made there were some American Indian actors perfectly capable of playing this role. Vies with Winterhawk for worst '70's picture in this vein.",1200182400,4,669,4.491803278688525
671785,3,6303471595,"This late-seventies movie had lovely cinematography and haunting music, but beyond that there's little to hold the viewer's interest.  The film lacked direction and important plot details were sketchy or entirely missing.  The transition of the girl from kidnap victim to grateful granddaughter was hazy; it took a couple rewinds for us to figure out what the heck the old man's relationship to her was, and we're no slackers when it comes to following a storyline.  There just seemed to be no discernible direction; it felt like a vignette rather than an honest film.  Grayeagle came across as an ambitious movie that overreached itself and fell flat.  Its political correctness made it even less palatable.  The acting was fine on the part of Alex Cord and Ben Johnson, as well as many of the Indians, but the girl was awful, unable to evoke much from the viewer except annoyance or pity.  The only reason we watched it is we're big Alex Cord fans, but felt like this movie was a waste of his talent and our time.  It did have hints of romance but went absolutely nowhere in that area, either, leaving us puzzled instead of edified.  Recommended only to huge fans of Alex Cord or Ben Johnson.",1096329600,2,1194,4.701923076923077
671786,4,6303471595,Great movie showing indians as people with a great story. Daughter of a white trapper is kidnapped by a Cheyenne High Warrior: Grayeagle.  Trapper and his indian friend pursue. But there is a twist. See this movie ! It is poignant and fun !,1069027200,4,240,4.454545454545454
671787,5,6303471595,"A trapper, his beautiful daughter, and an Indian servant live in peaceful isolation until they begin to spot evidence that proves they are not as alone as they thought. After a few days of worry and watchfulness, the trapper decides to investitgate. Leaving his daughter at home, he and his servant begin to hunt for the brazen Indian brave who has watched them every evening...just out of firing range. The hunt proves fruitless and the two return home only to find Beth (trapper's daughter) missing. And so we watch as those two take off in a pursuit that will lead them deep into dangerous Indian territory.
Meanwhile, Beth, who is terrified of her Indian captor, tries desperately to gain her freedom. However, as he takes her farther and farther from the only home she has ever known, he shows her unbelievable kindness and understanding. Beth, almost unwillingly, falls for the man she comes to know as Grayeagle, but their different heritages and the mystery of why he kidnapped her will have to be overcome before they can be together...if they can be together.
A really romantic and engaging western. It has its imperfections, at least by the standards of we modern viewers who are used to equally modern technology, but considering that it rather an older film, it's really quite remarkable and can easily be forgiven a lot.",1053302400,28,1334,4.855263157894737

It's also dated (1977) but the cinematography and locations are genuinely great, and there are fascinating details of 19th century Shoshone and Cheyenne life.  The music is peculiar, and some of the characterizations are bizarrely dark (others are predictably 'cute').

672069,4,6303471595,"Released in 1977, ""Grayeagle"" is a Western about a man (Ben Johnson) whose daughter (Lana Wood) is kidnapped by a Cheyenne brave (Alex Cord). The man teams up with his Native partner (Iron Eyes Cody) and a friend (Jack Elam) to get his daughter back. Along the way that must tangle with a Shoshone hunting party, including a crazy brave named Scar (Jacob Daniels).

While the plot is reminiscent of 1956's ""The Searchers,"" it's different enough to not be a rip-off. ""Grayeagle"" is not a big-budget Western, like ""The Searchers,"" but I like it better. However, it's not a cheapie either and it genuinely surprised me for a number of reasons. For one, it's not a typical Western; it's just as much a Native American film as it is a cowboy Western; and the Natives are portrayed pretty good, considering the time period. Secondly, everything about the film is totally over-the-top, like the acting, the (melo)drama and the blaring score. Speaking of the score, it plays like the bombastic music of the original Star Trek TV series, but updated to the mid-70s and fitted for a Western. It's quite good -- sometimes even moving -- albeit decidedly dated.

The plot similarities to ""The Searchers"" is interesting in that Lana Wood's sister, Natalie, played the kidnapped girl in that film. Speaking of Lana, she's just gorgeous. You might remember her as Bond girl Plenty O'Toole in 1971's ""Diamonds are Forever.""

Believe it or not, the annoying, half-crazy character Bugler was played by the director, Charles B. Pierce.

Shot in the Helena National Forest Northeast of Helena, Montana, the landscapes are picturesque.

FINAL WORD: ""Grayeagle"" is full of gusto and must be respected because the creators gave it their all to entertain the viewer; however, the film is so overdone it sometimes borders on ridiculous. So while it's often supremely entertaining the sacred words are fitting: ""Just because you like a movie doesn't mean it's good.""

The film runs 104 minutes.

GRADE: B",1418860800,,1978,4.957703927492447
672070,5,6303471595,"Though I know some people tout this as a lower grade ""The Searchers"" movie, I cannot refrain from giving it five stars. Think with me now, at all this film has going for it: it stars Ben Johnson (that alone is sufficient to place it head and shoulders above many), a noteworthy musical score which enhances the magnificent location footage shot exclusively at the Helena National Forest, and the ethereal beauty of Lana Wood. Personally, I see little similarity between Grayeagle & The Searchers; both stand well on their own two feet without need of comparison. Ben is fantastic as John Coulter, a loving & vengeful father - consumed with his daughter's safety. Iron Eyes Cody does admirably as Coulter's right-hand man, and Jack Elam brings a bit of levity to a predominately suspenseful theme. Completely appropriate for the entire family - I highly recommend it!",1414540800,2,866,4.938356164383562

672353,4,6303471595,"Another great American Indian wild west story with the venerable Ben Johnson and Iron Eyes Cody starring. Bring in the icing on the cake, in the super hunk  Alex Cord and it makes for a good guilty pleasure!  It is the story of the Cheyenne warrior Gray Eagle who is charged with filling the last request of his aging chief, Running Wolf.  The dream is that he bring to him the daughter he fathered years ago that doesn't know of his existence.  She lives in the foothills of the mountains with her supposed father and her mothers brother Standing Bear (Iron Eyes Coty).  The capture of Beth and her fathers and Standing Bears search for her return makes for an interesting story shot in beautiful surroundings.  It has enough action to appeal to men with a muscle to muscle challenges and enough eye candy in the virility of Gray Eagle to appeal to women. Add in the wonderful horse handling by Cord and all in all a good story with real characters. Of course it wouldn't be a western movie without Jack Elam, who can pull more characters out of his head than many actors with more star power!

Try as they may it was no use but that is a whole different subject. i like the part in the movie where grayeagle takes beth to her real father running wolf. it had a good ending but really they should have made it longer. i was kind of disappointed when you cant see if grayeagle is in love with beth or not but then again he did save her from the shoshone well that about sums up this reveiw,1246665600,4,627,4.190082644628099
