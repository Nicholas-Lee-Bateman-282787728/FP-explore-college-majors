8088159,5,B000BKVLIY,When I saw the title of this movie I was hoping to God that it was what I thought it was...and it is. I bought this movie in the hopes that it would be an offensive politically incorrect comedy that the liberal establishment in Hollywood just doesnt have the stones to create. This movie did NOT disappoint! If this were a just world this is the type of movie Seth Rogan would really be starring in. This movie is so hilariously and deliciously offensive even I was offended. At a time when we are surrounded by special interest groups and typical predictable liberal orthodoxy this movie is a cool drink of water in the middle of a desert of political correctness. Yes I was offended by it but did I call up Jessie Jackson or some lame special interest group? No! I laughed my bag off. I would love to see Bill Zebub make more movies like this. Dont expect this to be a big budget Hollywood comedy. Hollywood could never make this kind of movie(unless by some miracle Hollywood casts off the shackles of the special interest groups and liberal orthodoxy). This movie is low budget but in a charming way as youll see with the black guy lol. The black guy in this movie is so hilarious. Cherish your freedom and ability to still purchase something like this in stores and buy it ASAP!,1259884800,,1283,4.440677966101695

It is a thriller loosely based on a novel by Ian Wishart entitled ""The Paradise Conspiracy"". In short, someone purchases a used computer with precious data still on it and mysterious persons try to recover it. This is not the 2006 documentary ""Spooked: The Ghosts of Waverly Hills Sanatorium"".",1153872000,,414,4.928571428571429
