Five stars for production value and non-sugar-coated approach. BUT, I believe Christian documentaries must be held to a standard that is higher than mere artistic and professional capability. They must not compromise THE Truth (Jesus Christ), thus the three star rating, as you will see should you continue reading the following:

I just finished watching this documentary for the first time. I am one who holds truth and realism at a premium, regardless of how discomforting it may be, and this doc. certainly delivers an unvarnished look into the life of a very conflicted man.

When I was a kid, my mom had Larry's record, Upon This Rock. I had a keen fixation on it, more so for the apocalyptic vision and trippy nature of some of its songs rather than its Gospel message, I must admit, but I can definitely see what a great record it is in that regard too, now that I have become a child of God. I bought the two-disc reissue from his site two years ago for my kids and they love it.

His other record I really enjoy is, Only Visiting This Planet, which is remarkable for its juxtaposition of social commentary and spiritual truth.

Regardless of how Larry deviated from the path later in life and went into denial about his sins, his early work is testament to the grace and power of our Lord.

Where I fault this documentary is in its desire to approach Larry's denial and wrong doings from the vantage point of the pseudo-science of psycho-babble. As someone who has had numerous friends and even a sister go through the mill of clinical treatment for what they term as disorders, I see how blatantly this industry tries to usurp the Gospel in favor of a ""scientific"" works-based salvation. You are not a liar, you are not self-centered, you are not giving yourself over to the controls of lust, fear or greed, you are merely suffering from a ""disorder."" Calling sin a ""disorder"" is essentially claiming that we can cure ourselves.

I was disappointed to see the makers of this doc. consulting shrinks (which you can see in the extras under ""Larry"" on the second disc) who labeled Norman's delusions of grandeur, denial of culpability and failure to take responsibility for his actions as """"Narcissistic Personality Disorder,"" instead of SIN.

No self-help program is strong enough in any real and lasting way to break the bonds of sin. No fallen nature-coddling psychiatrist can give better answers than are found in Scripture. They can only address symptoms and put proverbial band-aids on proverbial bullet holes. Only Jesus Christ can do that when he convicts your heart of sin and draws you to repentance. I, a man as proud by nature as any who has walked this earth, was broken by the grace of God and brought to the recognition of my sins two years ago. When I confessed my wrong, even to those whom I had justified in my own mind how it was THEY who had wronged ME, I felt immense burdens fall from my soul. Immense loads of bitterness and anger dissolved into the spiritual freedom that only comes from the very source of life: Jesus Christ.

This tendency among many in the modern church to rush to psychiatrists, ""experts"" and ""professionals"" for help instead of getting real with Christ, has much to do with why there is so much apostasy, heresy and delusion within the ranks of those professing salvation in Jesus Christ, especially evident in the liberal, prosperity and Emergent church movements. If your god (intentional use of lower case g) is not big enough to give you REAL answers about ALL of life's problems, what good is he? Is he just another course on your plate? Take a little evolutionary ""science,"" mix with a little psycho-babble and add a touch of God and that is Christianity? Au contraire mon frere. Christ does not yoke to Belial and light has no fellowship with darkness (2Corinthians 6:14-18). My God is great. He is ALL-powerful. He gives me faith and strength even when I am at my weakest. He can carry ANY burdern...IF only we will LET Him.

""Let go and let Him."" Is how I heard it put in simple and beautiful language.

You can see in the photos the burden on Larry's soul from the monumental weight of unconfessed sin. The older he got the more noticeable it is on his countenance. I see the same thing in my old man who also claims to be a Christian. Actions DO speak louder than words. None of us, even those under the blood of Christ, can do ANYTHING on our own to free ourselves from the entanglements of giving in to sin. Only Christ can do that when we confess and repent. True repentance carries with it a desire to abandon our former ways.

Where I see Larry's downfall, I also see the potential for all of us to fall if we do not follow the teachings of our Lord in His word. Luke 9:23, ""And he (Jesus) said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.

In 1John 3:16&17 (the OTHER John 3:16! :) it is written, ""Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.
But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?""

It must be an incredible spiritual battle to be a ""Christian entertainer."" Inevitably, when you are onstage, the focus of some, or even most, will be on YOU, yet as Christians, we know we are but tools in the hands of the Master Craftsman and all glory is His. Larry got this right in his early ministry when he pointed upward when given applause. He got this wrong when he began to fashion such symbolism as marketable icons and made merchandise out of the Gospel.

At the beginning of Christ's ministry (as you can read in John 2), He took a whip made of cords and drove those selling animals for sacrifice from the temple saying, ""Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.""

Keith Green was a man who understood this principle and lived it out (I highly recommend watching his life story in the doc. ""Your Love Broke Through: The Keith Green Story"" as a counterbalance to this one). Somewhere along the line Larry lost sight of it and the more he re-enslaved himself to the cruel tyrant of Self, the more his relationships and testimony crumbled around him.

I still have a great respect for Larry's talent and the Godly wisdom he infused into the lyrics of many of his songs. God has used him in my life and in the lives of many others, there's no denying it. But his story is to me also a cautionary tale that I would do well to take heed of lest I give the devil a foothold.

8494519,1,B006835NIC,"An interesting tale of half truths spun by bitter hanger-ons mostly sour over publishing rights they had signed with Norman and later wanted to back out of. Contrary to video, one can YouTube his last years  to see he was still productive and sought after. Www.thetruthaboutlarrynorman.com provides documentation that this video doesn't tell the whole truth. Larry Norman had far greater influence and talent than all of those who rode his coat tails and his latter work was very good. He died well loved and surrounded by friends and family. He was far from perfect, but I'm sure had some redeeming qualities not mentioned in the film. I question the motivation of those making a film designed to kick down a dying man.",1416700800,4,720,4.853658536585366

I've also spoken at length via email with the director.
I knew Larry Norman in 93-94. My experience with him completely falls in line with what I've seen of the dvd, and I felt that way years before the dvd came out. I had a band back then. We worked with Larry for a  couple of months that he was in town with us. He left town with our band having been divided and destroyed, along with our hopes of a fruitful music career. He did concerts asking for money for his heart surgery then spent that money on studio time to record songs for another album. He made promises to us in exchange for helping him record an album, then left town and we never heard from him again. He was nice, and kind, and a liar, to me, members of my band, and the people that came to see him perform while he was with us.
If you did not know him, you are not qualified to defend his honor against this dvd.

He spent quite a bit of time with one member of our band, who still defends his honor to this day. That is his prerogative.",1359849600,5,1158,3.9656652360515023
8494522,4,B006835NIC,"I followed the careers of Larry Norman and Randy Stonehill since I first listened to a Solid Rock record in the 70's. I've had the privilege to speak with many early Jesus movement artists which knew Larry. I've conversed with Randy as well, seeing the pain in his face as I brought up my love for Larry's music. Randy never spoke bad about Larry, he was always aware of the positive impact Larry made in the hearts of the fans - but you could see the gap that had formed between the man who lead Randy to Christ and was largely responsible for giving him his start in Jesus Music.

The reviews of this movie as being fake or angry are untrue.

Larry was very human, and very protective of his image - and created a bit of a fantasy picture in the minds of his fans. The harsh reality is he was as full of sin as us all. This narrative is not fake or made up, it is important, so we don't fall into idolizing the man, but his story is like ours - one of grace, where God uses us in spite of ourselves.

Be forewarned:  most positive reviews were FAKED.

Take a look at most of the positive 5-star reviews (click on ""See all my reviews"" next to the reviewer's name).
The VAST majority of them were all done within a few days, by a person who had never done any OTHER reviews of ANY sort -- before or after.

Since I have watched it,I have spoken with 7 people who appeared in the film. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM told me their words were taken out of context,and they had mostly good things to say about Larry. This so-called ""film maker"" needs to repent and apologise to the Norman family and the other artists he used nd abused in making this film ONLY to line his own pockets. Larry is no longer with us to defend himself,yet his music is still touching the lives of many.
