8717690,3,B00Y8BNQ6W,"It's interesting, but I had a hard time figuring out what was going on from the start.  The young lovers had a joint suicide pact when they first meet in the motel room?  Yes, the dialogue was hard to discern from time to time.  Evidently, the actors were not miked close enough.  Actress Tinsel Korey (a Canadian singer) was quite good as Kate and very attractive.  It was hard to not to take your eyes off her throughout the film.  Didn't know Kevin Sorbo was an immortal assassin until I read the plot summary.  Yes, he was underused.  But, a much better film than what the reviews say.  Worth watching, just confusing at times.  Did Kate give up a baby??  She imagines seeing one at the end.  Hmmmm.......",1454284800,2,709,4.453125

8717696,1,B00Y8BNQ6W,"The acting in this movie is so poor in this movie.  I could not continue to watch it even halfway.  Also the audio, the speech, sounded muted.  Overall the filming of the movie came over as very amateurish.  In my opinion it wasn't even a worthy B film.",1441756800,,253,4.208333333333333

8717698,3,B00Y8BNQ6W,"I am a huge Kevin Sorbo fan,but this movie fell short of expectations for me. For one thing,he had no lines,aside from the opening and closing narratives. The plot made very little sense-A black box changing hands every so often and the person having possession of it willing to do anything for what is in it-the thing the person needs most. I would advise skipping this movie unless you are a fan of weird Sci Fi!",1440374400,3,414,4.4605263157894735
