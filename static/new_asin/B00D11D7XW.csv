Bruce was an ant, and the screens were so small, you could only see one person at a time-totally lacking the whole band experience. I came 2300 miles one way, and came home in tears. Saw him in CT when I was 16 (I'm 55). It was my one and only vacation in a lifetime. Still trying not to cry or whine. Just sent the MF to West Texas.
Love,
Tania

This about half of a concert Bruce did in Toronto probably around 1985. The DVD doesn't say. The performance makes me regret I didn't see him on this tour. There's no question the band was at the height of its powers. Every song rocks, and he and the band end the concert with so much energy with ""Detroit Medley"" and ""Twist and Shout.""

The video was professionally shot and edited, but because it was shot on video and not film, or because of generational loss, the quality is about a 7-8 out of 10. The sound is about the same. I wish it was the entire concert. There's a little less than two hours of footage here, leading me to believe there's about an hour or so lost somewhere. I hope the Thrill Hill Vault folks someday release this in its complete form.

Get this video. This is not just for the completist. It also is for the casual fan. However, don't expect the video to compare with ""Live at Hyde Park.""",1357171200,4,1150,4.364485981308412
