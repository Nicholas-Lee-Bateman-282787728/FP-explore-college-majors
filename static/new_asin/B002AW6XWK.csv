3892521,5,B002AW6XWK,"Good, strong, real picture. It portrays a real and raw President who did not care who and when he step on his 'enemies'",1393545600,,119,4.217391304347826
3892522,4,B002AW6XWK,"This Dvd is based on the book by the same name.  It is part fiction part reality.  Gives you an inside look at some of the not so nice stuff that Mr. Trujillo did along his political reign.  The movie is very interesting, but like I said before it is part fact part fiction, so if you wish to learn a bit more about this character, you will need to read a bit more about him, this is just one man's interpretation of him.",1364601600,2,421,3.988095238095238
3892523,5,B002AW6XWK,My dad was telling me about his country and the things he had to deal with growing up haveing this book he was able to tell me if the information was accurate.,1355788800,,159,4.0
3892524,4,B002AW6XWK,"For those who are interested in the Trujillo era in Dominican Republic this is a must have.  I wish more motion pictures would be made of the bygone era of military dictatorship in Latin America which beats today's opportunistic crooks and demagogs. Latin America is not the United States and people respect order not an imposed quasi democracy.  With the military in power there was law, respect, order and definition.  Now many of those country's are simply floating aimlessly like a log in a bog while the elected leaders prostitute the county's politics and enrich themselves with complete impunity and to their hearts content.  Interested in a liberal view of what was...  definitely buy it, it's what we have.",1350691200,,715,4.974789915966387
3892525,2,B002AW6XWK,"Movie is weak and watered down. I guess the producers/directors thought transferring the hardcore events within the book to the movie was too much. Why? I have no idea. But what a waste! They focused on his lite whore mongering NOT on his unsatiable appetite for young flower girls, or his hate for Blacks coming in from Haiti or the notorious house of horrors 'La Cuarenta Prison'. THe best movie is Tropico De Sangre and second to that is Time of the butterflies. Honestly the BOOK IS THE BEST.",1322092800,7,496,4.584269662921348
3892526,5,B002AW6XWK,"This film gives insight as to some historic events during the Trujillo era.  It left me spelled bound and I wonder how people permit these kinds of atrocities to go on.  It also left me wondering as to what goes on in the makings of monsters who are capable of committing these kinds of atrocious crimes.  Question:  Why did they named him ""El Chivo.""  Does anybody out there know?",1318032000,3,381,4.463768115942029
3892527,5,B002AW6XWK,I had heard neither of the film nor of Rafael Trujillo (shame on my narrow education) until I saw the movie at a museum in New York City a few years ago. Isabella Rossellini spoke afterward about how important the story was to her and why she readily took a tremendous salary cut to perform in the film. The movie is beautifully shot and all performances are stellar. I searched for this film for quite a while and I am delighted to have finally acquired La Fiesta Del Chive in English as I first experienced it and I will enjoy watching it many times.,1280620800,14,552,4.3173076923076925

8360449,1,B002AW6XWK,"it is not so much the movie, but I received a really crappy copy, supposedly made in Mexico. The DVD was unwatchable. The picture a blur, the sound has a bad slow echo. The voices are dubbed in English? And then subtitles added in Spanish? Into the trash with it.",1436227200,,263,4.28
