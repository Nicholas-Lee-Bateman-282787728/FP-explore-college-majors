8670183,5,B00M482XFG,"Important note to buyers: This product is a Region 2 DVD. Which means that to view it properly, the best solution would be to either buy a Region free DVD player or to download a free software called VLC player. A wonderful software which has allowed me to view on my computer or laptop movies from all over the world.

Although the only Christmas out of this DVD is the cover and the animation in the menu, this Shaun the Sheep new set of episodes is wonderful to watch.

Of my favorite episodes in them, I adored ""the Caught Short Alien"", ""the Genie"", ""DIY"", ""Happy Brithday Timmy"", and ""Fossils"". As bonuses, we have promos for the 2015 movie of Shaun the Sheep and a sneak peek of a scene from the movie. Of what I watched, I can't wait to see what Shaun and his flock will do in it. But I wonder if they won't take the time to release all the Championsheeps episodes done for the 2012 London Olympics. I loved those one minute shorts and found their interpretations of the Olympic feats quite wicked.

As a final note, I still think that as Pidsley is not in this set, that maybe the farmer decided to give the cat to his niece's family as she loved playing with him, putting decorations and dressing him up. But maybe I'm mistaken. As of now, I can't wait to see Pidsley's return as I find him quite a nice match as the three pigs and the bull.

See you next set.",1437696000,,1369,4.253846153846154
