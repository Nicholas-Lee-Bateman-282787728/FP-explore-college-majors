8672631,4,B00MIKP0AU,"Surprisingly good for the budget! The character essentially appears a mosh of Marvel's Daredevil and DC's Batman. For those who don't know, Black Bat was actually a comic her dating back to the late 30s and debuted the same time as Batman, with the publishers of both claiming the other was a copy. Whitney Ellswoth, one of DC's editors at the time, use to work for Black Bat's publisher, however, so it's a safe bet just who was really copied from who. Alot of fun!",1516147200,,466,4.4941176470588236
8672632,1,B00MIKP0AU,"Loosely based on Dynamite Comics Black Bat this 90 minute movie could be cut down to 30 minutes and possibly turn into an ok movie.  There are parts of this movie that will put you to sleep before the actual action get started.

I do not like to give negative reviews on comic book movies, but this strayed so far from the source that it soon became clear that they were trying to cash in on an ""Asylum"" type Batman movie.",1467849600,,422,4.197530864197531
