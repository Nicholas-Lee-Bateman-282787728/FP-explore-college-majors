The only thing you learn about Vedic Math is this person's mystical connection with it. There was nothing about Vedic math methods or practices, NOTHING!!  This was a complete waste of money and time and it should be taken off the market because it is a rip-off.  Even getting back my money would not be enough because it can never replace the time I lost watching this horrible, horrible piece of crap.  PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING THIS JUNK!!!",1269129600,7,593,4.566037735849057
