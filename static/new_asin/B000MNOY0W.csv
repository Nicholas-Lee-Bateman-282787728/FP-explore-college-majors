2737543,5,B000MNOY0W,"bob fosse is regarded as a genius.  although he won oscars for directing caberet and his movie on lenny bruce, his genius is universally acknowledged to lie primarily in the field of choreography.  All that Jazz contains his best choreography on film, no argument.  what else needs to be said?",1189987200,2,293,4.82
2737544,5,B000MNOY0W,"Bob Fosse's 1979 ALL THAT JAZZ is perhaps most famous for the extreme reaction it provokes: you either love it or you hate it.  There is no middle ground.

Joe Gideon (Roy Scheider) is a celebrated stage and film director famous for creating dance numbers with a super sexy style--and truly chaotic professional and personal life.  Even as he edits a film he has recently directed, he begins rehearsals for a new Broadway show.  Even as he duels with his acidic show-biz ex-wife over the needs of their daughter, he cheats on his girl friend with any lovely chorus girl who wants to fall across his bed.  He goes from crisis to crisis in a round of late nights fueled by nicotine, caffine, alcohol, and drugs--and he loves every ego-gratifying moment of it.  What he does not love is the heart attack he has in the middle of it all.

What divides viewers is not so much the plot as the overall style of the film.  Like Joe Gideon, Bob Fosse (1927-1987) was most famous for his musicals, which were often akin to beautiful but distinctly dark hallucinations of super-stylized motion showing lots of skin.  With ALL THAT JAZZ, Fosse takes his unique, highly surrealistic musical style and combines it with the similarly surrealistic approach of such master directors as Fellini.  The result is a film that shifts between past, present, and future with glittering musical numbers that leap from the mind of Gideon himself to make wry comment on his egocentric madness--and in which beautiful show girls become the personification of death.

As Joe Gideon, Roy Scheider (perhaps best known for his tough-cop role in THE FRENCH CONNECTION) truly gives the performance of his career; he is amazing in the role of the driven, egocentric director/choreographer who will stop at nothing to pursue his desires, professional or otherwise.  The film also gives us two performers who rarely appear on screen: Leland Palmer as Gideon's ex-wife Audrey Paris (a role based on Gwen Verdon) and Ann Rhineking as Gideon's long-suffering dancer-girlfried Kate Jagger (a role, ironically, based on herself.)  Both prove extremely memorable--as does Ben Vereen, a performer I do not usually like, appearing here in as the emcee of Gideon's final and most memorable hallucination.

The cinematography by Giuseppe Rotunno is sharp, clean, disquieting, and manages to convey the New York of the late 1970s in remarkable detail; the editing by Alan Heim (who also worked on such memorable films as NETWORK and STAR 80) is also memorable.  Indeed, be it lighting, costumes, casting, or overall art design it is virtually impossible to fault the film at any level.  Even so--ALL THAT JAZZ remains as likely to divide viewers today as it did in 1979.  Movie musicals have changed a great deal over the past decade or so, but ALL THAT JAZZ remains a unique offering.  You either get it or you don't; you either like it or you hate it.

There are at least two DVDs on the market.  One is a no-frills edition with a good transfer; the other offers several bells and whistles that fans of the film will enjoy.  Recommended in either version.

""To be on the wire is life.  The rest is waiting.""

The above is said by the main character, Joe Gideon (Roy Scheider), in this movie.

This movie is a semi-autobiographical fantasy based on the life and career of dance man, Bob Fosse (he was also a choreographer, director, screenwriter, and actor).  Fosse directed, co-wrote, and was choreographer for this movie.

We follow Gideon's (Fosse's alter ego) life where at this point in his life he starts each day with Vivaldi, Visine, Alka-Seltzer, and Dexedrine (a prescription upper).  Gideon has to start each day like this because he is a chain-smoker, a womanizer who cheats on his wife, drinker, takes drugs, and is a workaholic on the road to self-destruction.

This is a movie you either love or hate.  For me, I found the dancing frenzied, the dialogue piercing, the photography superb, and the acting first-rate.  (Actor Roy Scheider gives a brilliant performance.)  This is a great-looking film with some humorous parts that sometimes is not easy to watch.

There are ten song and dance numbers in this movie.  Don't worry!!  These pieces are integral to the movie, are short and sweet, and in a word are...fantastic.  I especially enjoyed these songs (accompanied by dance):

 ""On Broadway,"" ""Everything Old is New Again,"" and ""Bye-Bye Life"" (part of the lyrics is given in this review's title).

In 2001, the U.S. Library of Congress deemed this film ""culturally significant"" and thus selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.

As well, this movie won four Academy Awards.

Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2007) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has eight extras including a ""Musical Machine"" (that's why this DVD is called the ""Special Music Edition"").

In conclusion, this is a movie like no other movie I've seen and proves that ""there's no business like show business!!""

2737579,5,B000MNOY0W,"The movie *All That Jazz* starring Roy Scheider came out in 1979. It is based on the life of Bob Fosse, a Broadway choreographer and director. Scheider plays the role of Joe Gideon, Mr. Fosse's alter-ego.

I love movies focused on dancing. Did I go see this movie in the theater? No. Did I eagerly wait for its release on VHS? No. Ah! I was waiting for the DVD. Ah! Again, no.

I refused to see this movie. Come on... Roy Scheider playing a dance choreographer? Like wtf? Was Clint Eastwood busy that day?

In my mind, images of Roy Scheider in *The Seven-Ups*, *Marathon Man* and *Jaws* did not exactly lend themselves to forming a credible picture of the ultimate cheesy Broadway choreographer. Hence, the Clint Eastwood reference.

It wasn't until early last year, thirty years after its initial release, that I finally revoked my refusal and purchased a DVD copy. I was absolutely stunned. Roy Scheider was absolutely the quintessential Bob Fosse. He played Joe Gideon as perfectly and as cheesy and as like no other actor could have. Not even Clint.

The final hospital/death scene is the ultimate in cheese. I don't think any other choreography will ever outwhey Mr. Fosse's genius. Mr. Scheider's performance was truly a lip-curdling viewing experience.

I have watched the movie at least a dozen times and expect to view it several more times. It is one of my favorites.

Scheider gives a dazzling performance and is a talented dancer.

2737586,5,B000MNOY0W,"I've been dying to see this movie ever since I saw `Cabaret' and deemed it the greatest musical on Earth.  I still feel that way about the fabulous Minnelli classic, but Fosse proves yet again with this film that he is the master (was the master) of the genre.  Keeping this one a little more personal and making it somewhat autobiographical, Fosse has created an intimate look into show business and the business of showing up, showing off and showing out.

Roy Scheider stars here as Joe Gideon, Bob Fosse's alter ego so-to-speak.  Over the top, eccentric and consuming; Gideon prepares to get his next show on the road, as well as do some overdue work on a behind-schedule film, but health problems, studio problems and person problems all seem to get in the way.  Using an interesting method of song and dance (and some visions) to relay this intriguing story, Fosse creates an unforgettable picture that is as stunning as it is haunting.

The film is propelled by the utterly fantastic performance given by Roy Scheider.  He captures every ounce of reality within this man.  He finds the soul where there appears to be none and delivers to us a real person, complete with flaws yet never devoid of character.  This is possibly his finest performance and arguably should have won him the Oscar (although he was up against some really great performances, and Dustin Hoffman was utterly brilliant in `Kramer vs. Kramer').  He dives in with reckless abandon and plays against type here, demonstrating his wide range of talent.  There is always a glimmer of sadness that permeates this man throughout the film, but within the realms of his first love (dance) we see the hope that emerges in his soul.  Scheider capitalizes on that marvelously.

He is aided by a few sublime supporting performances, most notably from Ann Reinking who just shimmers as Gideon's love interest Kate Jagger.  She is stunning to look at, mesmerizing to watch and utterly unforgettable.  She finds the right balance of frustration and admiration to make her relationship with Gideon appear real and genuine.

`All That Jazz' is a musical superior to many, for it actually grounds itself in genuine and important realizations of life, death and love.  Having Joe bounce his own perspective off Angelique, an angel in his mind, we can see where this man is headed and just who he hopes he's become.  It's a very smart and expertly crafted journey into the man behind the talent and a very divisive and intriguing character study that speaks volumes to the audience.  Fame and show business has it's ups and downs, but this dark tale of abandonment helps us to see just what sort of toll the pressure to be the best can take on an individual.

With stunning musical arrangements and flawless dance numbers, this is as entertaining as it is profound; a truly inspiring piece of art that one is bound to enjoy each and every time.",1233273600,,2902,4.777555110220441
2737587,4,B000MNOY0W,"I am a huge fan of Bob Fosse in general, and of this movie specifically. However, the current Special Music Edition DVD (which replaces the now-discontinued original DVD release) has several flaws that prevent me from giving this a full five-star rating.

(1) Incomplete picture: this film deserves to be viewed in a letterbox format that delivers the full picture as the director intended; pan-and-scan is unfortunately the only format provided here.

(2) Dark picture: there's a lot of murkiness in the shadows, much more than in the previous released version. This renders some of the action (especially in Scene 5 with Victoria) nearly invisible.

(3) Commentary thinness: the commentary provided by editor Alan Heim is fun, but could be so much more. Why isn't the scene commentary provided by the late Roy Scheider from the prior DVD release also included on this one? And why haven't other leads (particularly Ann Reinking, who has played such a big part in the resurgence of popular interest in Fosse's work) been tapped to be a part of this?

(4) Special Features filler: unfortunately, there just isn't a lot here. We've got two short featurettes of Fosse colleagues talking about his dances, intercut with numbers from the movie. The rest of the special features menu just raises questions. Why is there an interview with George Benson about recording the opening song, ""On Broadway?"" It's unnecessary and not at all illuminating. Do we really need a direct menu to all the musical numbers? I thought that's what the scene selection menu was for. And a singalong of ""Take Off With Us?"" You've gotta be kidding me; what a waste of time and menu space. In their place, imagine what could have been included: how about an overview of his choreography for film, from ""Kiss Me Kate"" and ""My Sister Eileen"" forward? Or even better, a non-fictional look at Fosse's life for comparison -- couldn't somebody have talked to the folks at PBS and included its Emmy Award-winning hour-long biography on him, which aired in 1990 but remains unreleased?

I hope that one day, ""All That Jazz"" finally receives the DVD release it deserves. Until then, the Special Music Edition will have to do.",1230595200,19,2188,4.91869918699187

2737589,5,B000MNOY0W,"Fosse's ""All that Jazz"" is one of my all time favorite movies and I don't generally enjoy big production dance movies.  In this movie, Fosse, through his actor, Roy Scheider, gets to play himself with all his talent, weakness, brilliance, stupidy, self-indulgence...and...evil.  He lets us feel the phrenetic pace of an overcharged life and he shows us the fears, along with the associated thick skin, that come along with being a choreographer and playwrite.  Without an effort to justify himself, he shows his opportunism in seducing young women trying to make it big.  He shows us something of the women and child that he has injured but who are, at the same time, trying to save him from himself.

He shows a man dying of overwork, drug abuse and guilt.  He shows us a man who simply doesn't care.  He has a heart attack but lives...for a time...but a man like Fosse/Gideon simply doesn't live for long.  They burn up like a short burning match.  The movie is great but the last scene is even better.  Death comes to him in the form of the hauntingly beautiful Jessica Lange.  There is a truly remarkable dance routine centered on a jiving Ben Vereen.  Everybody is there...everybody from his past...the strippers, whores, wife, child, girl friends, angry business partners.  The rockin' tune is ""There goes my Baby"" and the rhythm is that of Fosse/Gideon's beating heart.  Vereen's perfect eulogy is on the mark,  ""And you AIN'T nobody's friend.""  Bomp, bomp, bomp...bomp.  Sweet death gets closer, closer, closer. Fosse/Gideon--or whatever is left of him--are brutally zipped up in a body bag.  Terrific.  Terrific and brilliant.

2737591,5,B000MNOY0W,"All That Jazz (Bob Fosse, 1979)

Even at the tender age of ten, I was already both a ravening cinephile and a hardcore music fan. Cabaret was one of my favorite movies as a youngster (and doesn't it strike you, too, as odd that I would be exposed to such a movie repeatedly at such a tender age?), so it seemed to me, at the time, that All That Jazz, Fosse's other huge musical blockbuster, was a natural. My parents, however, were not so sure; stills from the movie combined with it being rated R for ""graphic depictions of surgery"" convinced my mother that there was some form of weird, and nude, interpretive dance going on with surgery as its theme. Well, mom, I'm here to tell you, finally, that a chest spreader is not an interpretive dance-- that really is a graphic depiction of surgery. (However, it's worth noting that nowadays, you see this sort of thing on shows like ER all the time, so don't let that stop you.) But, yeah, like the man said, ""will there be [censored for Amazon consumption]?"". Yup. Of course, as a ten-year-old, that's the other half of why I wanted to see this movie. It's twenty-nine years later, and I finally have.

The story: this is basically Bob Fosse's autobiography, through his alter ego Joe Gideon (Roy Schieder), a workaholic philanderer. We see him in the throes of putting together a stage show while at the same time overediting an epic film about a standup comedian (in real life, this is his 1974 flick Lenny), having flings with a bunch of starlets, trying hard, but in vain, to connect with his daughter (Erszebet Foldi, who never acted in another film), and indulging in the vast overuse of, well, just about everything he can get his hands on. I have to say that all of this leads to a pretty predictable outcome, but I also have to say that man, I did not see that ending coming. Maybe I should have, but wow.

It's a truism that, seeing a film thirty years after its release, you're going to be looking for different stuff than you would have thirty years before, and such is the case here. One of the great parts of this movie, for me, was seeing actors who have grown into brand names early in their careers (most notably John Lithgow and CCH Pounder), but the spectacle of this thing is just as amazing now as I'm sure it was then; I say this, mind you, as someone who generally can't stand musicals, despite my love of both film and music. Fosse obviously did this one from the heart, and it shows in every frame.

From the very beginning right down to an extremely over-long final rendition of ""Bye Bye Love"" (I think I'm gonna die!) you will undoubtedly be begging for the privilege of turning off Roy Scheider's life-support system just to put him out of YOUR misery!

Directed by Bob Fosse, (and supposedly semi-autobiographical), this whole piece is literally nothing but a framework for the insertion of multiple dance routines, all bearing those unmistakable moves associated with Fosse, but having so little to do with anything else.
Several of these are quite clumsily incorporated, bearing little on the supposed story, and not advancing the narrative...(such as it is), at all.

It's just a long, long increasingly depressing ever downward spiral of self-destruction by the lead man.

If Scheider didn't already have lung cancer before, he most certainly would have after making this movie. He is never without a cigarette dangling from his lips, and only puts one out to light another!
You could be in danger from passive smoke just watching!
That, along with the constant ingestion of Dexedrine and bottles of booze.......and you can see where this is going long, long before it gets there, ...and the journey is not all that engrossing.
And all for what?
So ""the show must go on"" of course!
Now just exactly why this must be is of course never explained.
The world probably won't end if some Broadway show doesn't open......

From time to time the movie attempts to get all metaphysical, with Scheider's character talking to ""The Angel of Death""....here played by Jessica Lang in various over-the-top white outfits, who really should have done her assigned job so MUCH sooner and put us all out of our misery.

Obviously made in the same genre as ""A Chorus Line"" and all those other Broadway musicals about Broadway musicals featuring casts of dancers in sweaty lycra, Fosse's efforts now come across as monumental self-indulgence. The moves have become so familiar and so clich as to almost constitute parody in our minds. The ""jazz hands"", the top hats, the lifted knee, the angular contortions, .....even ""Cabaret"" gets a reprise here complete with bentwood chair.
Then there's that odd sequence that is supposed to be ""sexy"", where all the dancers strip down to very little and writhe about in male/male, woman/woman and male/female pairs.... trying to sex up a tedious song about air-travel, but although performed well by the cast, it just doesn't fit comfortably into the movie at all,, and again you suspect it was just something Fosse wanted to choreograph, then had to find a place to insert it.

In a nutshell, the movie is just WAY too long, and there's not enough rapport with any of the characters, or the lead man in particular to hold your interest, or make you care whether he dies or not.
In fact he's SO un-engaging that you just want him to hurry up and get it over with. Dammit, go towards the light already!
As mentioned before, the last ""big number"" is so prolonged by repetition that you will be tempted to reach for the fast forward button.

Scheider tries valiantly, but he's not given much material to work with , and he's also burdened by a bizarre wig that changes back and forth between blond and dark. This is no ""Jaws"" for him that's for sure!
VERY dated, and strictly for lovers of archival Fosse dance moves now.

The story?
Broadway director overworks and drinks/drugs himself to death. That's it...interspersed with those Bob Fosse production numbers. Performed in dance rehearsal gear of course!
