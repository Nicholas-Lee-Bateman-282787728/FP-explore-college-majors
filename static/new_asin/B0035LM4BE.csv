8389133,5,B0035LM4BE,"I got this to try to understand punk drumming to sequence decent loops. amazing tutorial and treatise on the mechanics of punk rock, as well as the differences between the punk style vs. traditional hard rock.",1504742400,,209,4.833333333333333
8389134,3,B0035LM4BE,"So I got this DVD thinking,""who better to teach me how to be a cool punk drummer than Mary Ramone."" The DVD showed up, I got all excited, I put it in, and........ nothing. Well, I guess you can't say nothing, but as far as instructional... forget it. Entertaining? sure... we'll go with that. I found myself laghing at the DVD instead of learning anything. If someone came to me and said... ""HEY, I was thinking of getting Marky's DVD to LEARN to play the drums.""..... would I recommend it?  NOPE!  But to a Ramones fan would I say ""Hey pick up Marky's drum DVD it's kind of funny.""  YES!",1319587200,3,588,4.327272727272727
8389135,4,B0035LM4BE,"I am a new drummer, and a HUGE fan of punk rock in general and the Ramones in particular.  Marky gives grooves from simple to ""oh man"" and fills to match.  It really is a great beginner's DVD, and I use it far more than the other DVD's I've bought for learning purposes.  I only give it 4 stars because Marky is no television personality...so...yeah, there is that.",1312070400,2,365,4.338235294117647
