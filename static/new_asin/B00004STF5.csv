1348529,5,B00004STF5,"If you are a Techno head like myself you might have a hard time tolerating American MTV. The alleged Music Television Network seems to have very little desire to showcase electronic music on the same scale as 'clay combat' or so called 'reality shows.' But this DVD shows that there is more out there than boy bands and bimbo blonde teenagers. This collection of various industrial, drum & bass and house is a refreshing look into the world of electronic music. I have seen here how people have called the content less than ground breaking. Let's face it though, the fact that it exists at all has broken some new ground. Have you seen any other DVDs like this one? I have looked pretty hard and have yet to find another.
The musical content is interestingly eclectic. From ""Fat Boy Slim"" to ""Diesel Boy"" you can see a fairly decent cross section of the electronic music scene at large. Don't expect to be blown away, it is not epic making, but it is well worth having if you want to add something different to your collection.
Ever since I got me DVD player I have looked for ways to maximize its potential.  DVD is definitely where the future is going, there is little doubt of that, but how can one expand the DVD experience? Well, these music videos seem to be an unlikely answer but it works well.  The high fidelity digital output sure does make the videos fun to watch and a new way to disturb the neighbors. If you want to try something really wild you can put this DVD on when entertaining for some light background visual and audio. At my last party it was an interesting conversation piece.
But what do I know? Check it out for yourself and make your own determination of its value. :)",981331200,8,1696,4.45016077170418
1348530,4,B00004STF5,"What is it about record/video companies that means they just don't seem to market video compilations? There is some stunning stuff out there but the majority of it is only seen a few times and never freely available. This disc starts to redress the balance. Music-wise, it contains a good cross section of current dance styles, and a variety of video production approaches too. On the musical side you have commercial breakbeat pop from Jacknife Lee, Fatboy Slim and Josh Wink; heavier breaks from the Chemicals and Prodigy; Drum & Bass in various forms from Dieselboy & Tech Itch, Photek, Mocean Worker, Roni Size, Goldie, and Adam F; and house/club from Underworld and Deep Dish/EBTG. Not to mention Talvin Singh, Sly & Robbie and others besides. The videos vary from garish pop (Jacknife lee) to moody black and white (Photek) with cleverness ratings that vary from the inspiration of ideas (Deep Dish, Photek) to the technical digi-tricks of Underworld and Reprazent. With beautifully rendered cartoons from Sly & Robbie, and high speed cut up clips from Mocean Worker, a huge range is represented here. The videos to be honest are not as groundbreaking as the best that Dance Music has to offer (see Bjork , Aphex Twin for inspiration in this area), but just to have a collection like this on the market is refreshing.  My one remaining question - why is this not available outside the US except by mail order? - But overseas buyers take note, this disc is not region coded!",970185600,17,1479,4.822834645669292
1348531,5,B00004STF5,"There isn't anything groundbreaking about this DVD. What is does have is a great selection of techno music and all their respective videos. If you  have a sweet sound system this DVD will really push it to it's limit. High  points are the Chemical Brothers, Josh Wink, Roni Size, and the Crystal  Method. I'm looking forward to Vol. 2!",966470400,5,335,4.6440677966101696
1348532,5,B00004STF5,"Besides the perfectly chosen videos, I think what makes this compilation a  must have is its amazing sound quality. If you have an AC3 home theater  system with this DVD you will know it was worth every penny. Add to this  awesome visuals and great concepts (like the backgammon of love life  depicted in ebtg's future of the future) and you'll agree with me that  this DVD deserves the 5 stars.",965001600,3,395,4.507042253521127
1348533,5,B00004STF5,"This video is so awesome, From a techno musicians point of view. With bands like prodigy and the chem. brothers it is worth it, but when you through fatboy slim, goldie, and roni size into the mix it is more than  worth it. In short this dvd rocks. And its not industrial you idiot.",964137600,,282,4.222222222222222
1348534,5,B00004STF5,"What the Hell is Dean Halpern talking about!  You dope, this DVD is Freaking Awesome!  The videos are all awesome!  And if you knew anything about Electronica, You'd know that these videos are not geared towards  ""Industrial"" They are geared towards ""Drum 'N Bass""  I  mean C'mon: Dieselboy, Goldie, Photek, Adam F!  Hello!  This DVD is very  worth while, and is highly recomended, I have seen a ton of Techno videos,  and I own about 600 Techno cds, so I know what is good, and this is!  The  Dieselboy and Technical Itch video for ""Atlantic State"" is alone  worth the full price of this DVD. Along with Chemical Brothers and Fatboy  Slim, oh yeah baby! And to see the Prodigy in full DVD quality, Priceless!",962841600,17,709,4.568

1348536,4,B00004STF5,"This DVD gives a good sampling of the different genres of electronic music. Especially good are ""Poison"" by Prodigy and ""Brown Paper Bag"" by Reprazent....P.S.-anyone who knows what  ""industrial"" music is will know that this selection isn't!",960854400,,240,5.486486486486487
1348537,4,B00004STF5,"Pretty cool disc, my funk soul brutha.  Some great tunes on here, and some good tunes on here.
The Mothership has to be SUPERTHRUSTER though, which has a fine sound split across the 6 audio tracks.  I love that  track.
This disc finds its way into my DVD player more than most.",958089600,4,277,4.288461538461538
1348538,2,B00004STF5,"Wow - how could this DVD be boring?  I jumped at the chance to own the first ""trance"" video DVD.  At $13.96, I mean, what a deal - right?  No, not really.  This DVD has two main drawbacks:  The musical  selection is geared much more to industrial music than to trance, house, or  electronica.  So the music is darker and more repetitive.  That is my main  complaint.  If you're into the industrial sound, you'll probably be pleased  with this selection.  My other complaint is that the music does not always  appear to be well-synched with the video.  Many videos left me wondering if  the band had anything to do with the visuals, or if some outside company  just threw together some visuals at their own discretion.  And the visuals  are not really all that good.  I expected some really fascinating visual  treats, but mostly what you get are cloaked people walking through the rain  and through the forest, etc.  Not my cup of tea.",957744000,6,935,4.567073170731708

7921995,5,B00004STF5,"It was a gift to a very special friend. He loved it. I was worried about getting the order on time. In spite of the Christmas season rush my order was right on time.

GOOD JOB.",1169078400,,176,3.888888888888889
7921996,4,B00004STF5,"This is a  great electronic videos collection. But I can see why some people only give it 2 stars.  As I read some people reviews, it seem like they don't know what they are talking about.  These are not your daytime ""MTV videos"".  You would only see these videos on MTV if you are an insomiac who watches AMP around 2 A.M.  For the trance listeners who made a complaint, what do you people expect on this dvd? Paul Okenfold, Paul van dyke, Sasha & Digweed?  I think it is bias to write a bad review just because you are not a fan of a specific electronic genre like Drum N Bass.  One reviewer trashed the dvd just because he wasn't interested in DnB. Any REAL drum n bass fans would appreciate Roni Size, Diesel Boy, Photek, Talvin Singh and Goldie even if some have better tracks than others.
I give this 4 stars because of my personal tastes. Eventhough I think Fat boy slim, Chemical brothers, Crystal method, and Prodigy are great on the DVD. I think their videos on this DVD are for a mainstream purpose since they target the average listners.  This dvd would have taken a step further if it was to have Aphex Twin, Bjork, Portishead ect. But that is just me, i'm just a snob and going for that Indie/Break Through videos mentality.
Do buy this dvd or just stay up around 2 am hope MTV plays electronic music.",1029196800,21,1315,4.338775510204082
7921997,2,B00004STF5,"'Sound & Motion' is a collection of music videos that features some of the biggest names in Electronica today.  It starts out with two of the year's biggest tracks, 'Block Rockin Beats' by the Chemical Brothers and 'The Rockefellar Skank' by Fatboy Slim.  The 4th video 'Simple Man' by Josh Wink is extremely entertaining, followed by the pulse-pounding track 'Busy Child' by Crystal Method.  By the time you reach 'Poison' by the Prodigy, you'd be thinking that this DVD has real potential.
However, it's the 6th video all the way up to the Underworld video (that's 6-14) that is reason to give 'Sound & Motion' a low score of two stars.  This is where the viewer slips into the Jungle/Drum & Bass slot, and these music videos are the absolute worst.  The Goldie track is extremely stale, the Photek's 'Ni Ten Ichi Ryu' is highly miss-able, Talvin Singh's music video is downright annoying, and I've never been a fan of Roni Size.  The Dieselboy w/Technical Itch video is the only Jungle track on here that is tolerable.  Then it's the last video, 'Future of the Future (Stay Gold)' by Deep Dish and Everything But The Girl that helps to redeem this colossal mess of a video compilation.
If you want to get my honest opinion, don't invest your time or your money in 'Sound & Motion'.  I know it sounds harsh, but I mean it when I say that this is a giant mess.  There's too much of an imbalance between good tracks ('Block Rockin Beats', 'Busy Child','Poison', 'Future of the Future') and bad tracks ('Temper Temper', 'Jaan', 'Superthruster').  The teardown comes from the Jungle/Drum & Bass tracks, and although there is some GREAT Jungle music out there, these ones just don't cut it.  My philosophy is that if the songs are bad, there's no way you'll want to be sitting through the video.
I think if a 'Sound & Motion 2' is ever planned, the people in charge should definitely do more research on what the audience wants to be seeing.  I mean, it is surprising to find no Trance videos on here, and Trance is the most popular style of dance music in the world.
Two stars for weak video selection and having little to no bonus features on the DVD.

7921998,3,B00004STF5,"I can understand the limited freedom to do a proper collection of eye-catching music videos on DVD due to label and license limitations, but maybe we could have dug a LITTLE bit deeper here?  You have the obligatory ChemBros and FatSlim videos, and a nice selection of drum & bass videos which most people would never have seen before (including the nifty Sly & Robbie ""Superthruster"" video and Goldie's ""Temper Temper""), but a little more diversity in electronic music styles would have been nice. Some house, some trance?  But for what it is, it's a welcome addition to any music video DVD collection.",1025222400,2,603,4.844660194174757

7922001,1,B00004STF5,"While the music on this DVD is ok(Dieselboy, Goldie, etc), the actual video part is lame.  Most of the videos on this disc are the type you would see on MTV with real people and places. If you are interested in something more closely related to that of a party or rave, look elsewhere.  If anyone knows of discs that are computer generated with a techno background please email me.",985651200,2,381,4.428571428571429
7922002,4,B00004STF5,"This is a really cool DVD simply because it is like one of those compilations of popular ""electronica"" with the videos included.
