8750326,3,B01BIHWCCW,"Magical Girl offers the viewer something entirely different from what the title suggests. It's cold, dark, and sterile. Most of the characters are depicted without much feeling, almost devoid of personality, something that gives the film a schizoid tone. It contains much less action than one might expect with a slow-to-build beginning and an emphasis on drama rather than on thrills. The director uses maximum restraint in the telling of his story, much more restraint than what most viewers are accustomed to. The story is centered around a father's attempt to please his only daughter. In doing so, he sets off a chain of events which initially intrigues the viewer, but by the second quarter the situations become increasingly improbable and forced, stilting the drama in such a way that the viewer is no longer hanging in suspense, but losing patience. This is where the director focuses on Barbara, a character who acts more like a zombie reenacting scenes from another movie. If you can stick it through the fabricated hodgepodge of Barbara and make it to the last quarter which consequently happens to be the most captivating part due to the (director's) decision to enlist veteran actor and old reliable Jos Sacristan to carry out the ending.

If it hadn't been for the forced, far-fetched middle with the director trying too hard to crypticize the Barbara character, needlessly dragging out the story, this would have been a 4-star film. In order to enjoy Magical Girl, or, at least get the most from it, one has to accept the fact that the director completed the film with the intent to leave some parts without explanations. If you have little or no interest in making interpretations for the unexplained, then I suggest passing on this one.",1519430400,,1754,4.945762711864407

8750328,5,B01BIHWCCW,"""The Magical Girl"" is an imaginative, captivating Spanish thriller that manages to be chilling and sardonic.  Directed by Carlos Vermut, ""Magical Girl"" has won many awards, including best film and best director at the San Sebastian International Film Festival and best leading actress (Barbara Lennie for her portrayal of Barbara) at the 2015 Goya Awards.

The film centers around a dying 12-year old girl who loves an anime character, the ""Magical Girl Yukio"".  Her love for the Magical Girl gradually entangles the three primary characters in the story.  Her father, Luis (played by Luis Bermejo), is an unemployed literature teacher who becomes obsessed with getting the large sums of money necessary to buy his daughter an expensive ""Magical Girl"" outfit.  After failing at legitimate means of raising the money, he meets and blackmails Barbara (Barbara Lennie), the emotionally disturbed wife of a psychiatrist.  Barbara in her turn reverts to activities of her earlier life and gets the money by engaging in sadomasochistic activities of deep brutality which are not shown on screen.  The third primary character is Damian (played by Jose Sacristan), a secondary school teacher of mathematics who has recently been released after serving ten years in jail. Damian becomes involved in bringing resolution to the situation of the Magical Girl.

The film develops slowly and works to a climax. It is atmospheric in its pictures of city life in Spain and of the people that are drawn into the web of the story. The dramatic tension in the film is palpable.  The acting is convincing and the characters are complex and multi-dimensional. This film was an unexpected find.

The film is in Spanish with clear, unobtrusive English subtitles. The print is of excellent quality and  the ambiance, color and musical score enhance the story and characterizations.  First Run Features, the distributor of the film, kindly send me a copy for review.

Total Time:  122 minutes
