6937647,4,B00RZXWU6C,"The plot along with the story line was really good.  There was some good acting as well.  This was a low budget film and that was obvious.  I gave it a four because the plot and side stories were solid.  The characters were gritty and realistic.

The downside... if it were me I would clean it up a little and do away with some of the sadism that was shown.  It was excessive.  Sometimes just the implication of torture and sadism is enough to keep the interest of the audience. The sadistic killers were very realistic in their actions.  Enough for the viewer to double check his/her doors to make sure they're really locked! However, not everyone obtains pleasure from viewing such violent explicit scenes.  Too much is too much.",1434326400,,731,4.561538461538461
6937648,2,B00RZXWU6C,"The film starts with scenes near the end, then uses flashbacks and then continues on. It opens with Mila (Vannessa Vasquez) taking a shower as the camera gives us a close up of her nose, a characteristic the director seems to like as the film is filled with cut off faces. We then have an investigation of a crime scene of an apparent murder/suicide with Salinas (Melissa Mars) a detective who has relationship issues which provided a short lived dead end subplot.

We quickly find out the dead pair were serial killers as we flashback into the the events.

To clear things up, there is no woman with a baseball bat in the film. I don't know why that is on the DVD cover. I liked the plot, but the presentation of the story left much to be desired. The sound quality was not top notch. The dialogue doesn't give the actors a chance. The crime scene investigation attempted to look real as they managed to get surgical gloves, but when you gather evidence you take a picture of it before you pick it up and then you label the bag with a number and place a number at the scene. Without a chain of custody, the evidence is useless.

I liked the twist, although it was poorly done like the rest of the film. The film was written, directed, produced, edited, and sound supervised by Millie Loredo. A woman in charge of the film accounts for relationship discussion (fireplace scene) which would have a female appeal in a film that I would expect have a large male audience.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Women being abused, ripped clothes. 2 1/2 stars",1431216000,2,1550,4.46643109540636

6937650,1,B00RZXWU6C,"Just another bad c-horror microbudget horror video. Save your time and money.

Bad acting, bad sound, bad directing. I got to roughly the halfway point and just couldn't sit through the rest.",1430352000,6,191,4.96875

6937660,1,B00RZXWU6C,"Indiscriminate kidnappings, indiscriminate murders. Enough dead bodies (why??) to have the whole State coming after you, but NO.  Actors who you think may be central then disappear - poof.
?Mom finds daughter in home w/ bad guys there and they are both so happy they cry loudly.... uhhh, not smart.
Story line is fragmented and nonsensical.  I don't blame the actors here (although it is not good), because the best actor couldn't redeem the lines these people were given.

I'm trying to find some low budget films to watch and support those film makers who, with their limited budget, still manage to make a decent movie.  This was just a bad decision on my part.  Save yourself 1.5hrs.  Move to another movie.",1437436800,2,711,4.786885245901639

6937662,5,B00RZXWU6C,"I was very surprised, it was a great movie, had me on the edge of my seat from the start.  I am giving this movie a 5 star, because it is a 5 star movie.  These actors played their parts very well. I am very convinced that all these actors will get far in life and one day win an Oscar!!!!  I recommend this movie to everyone.",1436140800,,326,3.8358208955223883

6937665,1,B00RZXWU6C,"There's something wrong with a crime movie, where the police DON'T want to investigate the crimes of murder, abduction, rape, There's something wrong with a police department with an interrogation room that's done up in plywood.. There's something wrong when murder happens in a town and nobody next door reports the screaming and yelling. There's something wrong with a movie whose actors cannot act. there's something wrong with a plot that's thinner than tissue paper. AND YET this ""movie"" is rated 3 stars. This is probably the biggest crime in Amazon movies.
It drags...it stinks...the VICTIM is hounded, and harassed, by the POLICE...and the worst thing is I wasted an hour and a half of my life that I will NEVER get back. If you have ANY SENSE, you will back away QUICKLY and run away, never to look back at this thing that is disguised as a ""movie"".
I believe I will go get a sedative, preferably something that will make me FORGET that I was dumb enough to watch.",1435881600,2,973,4.695906432748538

8696557,1,B00RZXWU6C,"Amateurish drama about a pair of knucklehead serial killers found dead in their blood-drenched home filled with torture devices and DNA evidence and booby traps and a mysterious female survivor who disappears from the hospital before the police could question her.  Sorrow is pretentious drivel that feels like a faith-based remake of Last House on the Left crossed with a public access television soap opera.  The writing is so bad it's easy to give the actors the benefit of the doubt and say nobody could look good with material this dreadful.  I've seen a lot of horrible movies this year, but Sorrow might actually be the worst--it's the kind of film that makes lousy movies feel good about themselves.",1448841600,,707,4.92436974789916
8696558,3,B00RZXWU6C,This movie was confusing without a straight storyline. Different scenes would just pop up out of the blue and it was tough to follow. At the very end you kinda of got what was going on.,1445644800,,185,4.166666666666667

8696560,2,B00RZXWU6C,Congratulations Sorrow you have officially been named the worst movie of 2015 by Movies & candy. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The sets are horrendous and the story makes no sense. The acting is atrocious and this movie will have you screaming and begging for yourself or someone to stop the movie. Its just so painful. Some movies are so bad their good but this is the most frustrating and annoying time Ive had this year so far. I will say I will never forget this dubious movie and it currently carries the dishonorable title of just the absolute worst of 2015.,1442620800,,584,4.416666666666667
