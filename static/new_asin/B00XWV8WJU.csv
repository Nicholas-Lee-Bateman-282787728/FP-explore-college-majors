7202457,3,B00XWV8WJU,Opening credits too long. I enjoyed performances by Amin Joseph (mirror scene); Marcus T. Paulk (Lil Danger scenes) and Brooklyn McLinn (handsome secret admirer).,1441065600,,162,5.791666666666667

7202479,2,B00XWV8WJU,Not good at all. No offense but celebrities need to stick to what they know. Everything is not for everyone.,1447804800,,108,4.45
7202480,2,B00XWV8WJU,The acting was not bad at all but the ending  could have been much better.  This movie would have definitely  received more  stars from me had the ending been different.,1447545600,,169,4.533333333333333
7202481,1,B00XWV8WJU,Big disappointment. The story was all that interesting and I was hoping for something better because I know the actresses are better.,1446422400,,133,5.090909090909091

7202487,1,B00XWV8WJU,It does not work. It shows the previews then the intro. You can't watch anything after that. The review should actually read zero stars as you can't watch the movie.,1442966400,,165,4.533333333333333
7202488,5,B00XWV8WJU,All good,1442793600,,8,3.5
8716958,3,B00XWV8WJU,"Sweet ,funny movie.
Amber Rose wasn't bad.
Erica Ash is beyond funny...love her",1515974400,,79,5.153846153846154
8716959,5,B00XWV8WJU,Great movie!,1480118400,,12,5.5
8716960,4,B00XWV8WJU,"The shipping was fast & packaging was great....... the movie was ok, a little disappointed",1476316800,,90,5.066666666666666
8716961,5,B00XWV8WJU,"Great story.  Showing a close sister bond, where although trials and tribulations will occur, that family line will remain uncut.",1468627200,,129,5.45
8716962,2,B00XWV8WJU,"SISTER CODE is a predictable comedy-drama that has some funny moments, but is hampered by a script that is too lightweight and unrealistic to carry any dramatic weight. Eva Marcille, Amber Rose, and Drew Sidora give decent performances, but their characters are one-dimensional and badly under-developed. Marcus T. Paulk (as rapper ""Lil' Danger"") and sadly under-used Essence Atkins contribute some funny bits, and Erica Ash is hilariously over the top as Lil' Danger's harpy-shrew ghetto-fabulous wife. The ending is very poorly handled. Duane Martin is wasted in his two scenes with Miss Rose, whose tattoos often distracted me from her performance. With a better script and better direction, this could have been an interesting story. Ultimately, SISTER CODE is probably worthy of a rental or a ""free"" viewing on Netflix if you keep your expectations low.",1457136000,,858,5.3161764705882355
8716963,5,B00XWV8WJU,I like  the family theme in this movie and the sisterhood part of the 3 foster sisters who took sisterhood to another level. You don't have to be blood to be family.,1456704000,,165,4.15625
8716964,1,B00XWV8WJU,"The writing and directing were TERRIBLE, which made the actors' jobs more difficult.  This movie is ok if you just need some background noise.",1456185600,,142,4.916666666666667
8716965,1,B00XWV8WJU,Sad that BET even thought to give Amber Rose chick an opportunity to be in this movie when there are so many black aspiring actresses out there. Smh.,1453248000,,149,4.357142857142857
8716966,2,B00XWV8WJU,"I just watched the trailer and it did not look like something I wanted to spend money watching.  I liked seeing Essence Atkins and Eva Marcelle, though.",1451952000,,152,4.62962962962963
8716967,4,B00XWV8WJU,Feel Good!!,1451260800,,11,5.0
