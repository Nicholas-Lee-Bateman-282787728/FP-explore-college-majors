6254324,5,B00I9BU3L8,"Great noir. With Raft reliable as always and with a pre-Perry Mason Raymond Burr as a creepy villain, lots of noirish shadows, and an interestng theme about revenge and redemption, who can ask for more?",1398384000,16,202,4.8

6254334,1,B00I9BU3L8,"Image quality is soft and the movie is poorly written. The dialog is incredibly corny and Tiompkin's score is equally corny and could be one of his worst. I like George Raft, Virginia Mayo and Raymond Burr but they couldn't save this thing.",1410566400,,240,4.604651162790698

I enjoyed it and was very surprised by how good this b-movie was. A definite re-watch for me.",1515974400,,294,4.086206896551724
8640053,3,B00I9BU3L8,"Quality is good, but the film itself is so-so. While I love George Raft, Red Light's use of Catholicism is a little heavy-handed. It still, however, is a beautifully shot film. Raft is miscast but watchable.",1511222400,,207,4.777777777777778
8640054,4,B00I9BU3L8,"George Raft (1901-1980) started his career as a dancer, as in Taxi in 1932 and Bolero in 1934, but is remembered now for his strong-willed acting as a criminal in many films. He plays a strong-willed unrelenting man in this uncomplicated film. The suspense in the movie is will Raft find the Bible he is trying to find and what is written in it. His brother, a priest was murdered by a man hired by Raymond Burr who is extremely fat in this film. Raft only knows that his brother tells him while he is dying, after being shot several times, that he should look in the Bible. Raft understands that his brother named his killer in the Bible, and he searches to find the Gideon Bible that was stolen from the hotel room., and get revenge for his brother's death",1508371200,,758,4.382978723404255

8640059,3,B00I9BU3L8,"POSSIBLE SPOILER:  A member of the Film Noir family, this film features tough guy George Raft who is out for revenge since his war hero brother was murdered.  Raft was one of those actors whose range was limited.  He acted not from A to B, but from A to C, with as much expression as Jerry Mahoney.  Mayo is featured, but her role is limited.  She has more to do in WHITE HEAT in her '40's career, blooming more fully and more attractively in the 50's with her musicals.  The real focus of the movie is on Raymond Burr who is the obvious villain. How producers saw him as Perry Mason in all his roles in the 40's is amazing.  Weight loss must do wonders.  Harry Morgan shows up in a supporting role.  Both actors went on to greater careers in TV than the principals.  Anyway, the film is a crime drama that is pretty interesting, with Raft trying to find the responsible killer, though the ending leaves you wondering why bad guys always seem to climb up structures like mountains or in this case an overhead sign when they are cornered.  Does that ever happen in real life?  How is escape possible when one is a easy target from below?",1442620800,2,1136,4.331753554502369
8640060,5,B00I9BU3L8,"This 1949 movie shows two important future stars in their early years - Raymond Burr and Harry Morgan, as well as then current stars George Raft, Gene Lockhart, and Virginia Mayo. The plot begins with Raymond Burr being sent to jail for embezzling from George Raft's trucking company. In prison he sees a newsreel of Raymond welcoming home is brother Jess from WWII after serving as a chaplain in a POW camp. Burr hires Morgan (just finished his sentence) to murder Jess in revenge. The bulk of the film consists of efforts to find clues left in a Bible by Jess. Eventually Raft finds Burr and Morgan, kills Morgan in a shoot-out and Burr is killed when chased up onto the roof where he's accidently electrocuted.",1436486400,2,713,4.666666666666667
