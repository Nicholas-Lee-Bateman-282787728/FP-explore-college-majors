338267,5,6301599918,"Ali: Fear Eats the Soul is a wonderful story with a strong socioeconomic message that can be compared to Douglas Sirk's All That Heaven Allows (1956) and Far From Heaven (2002) by Todd Haynes where an older woman loves a younger man from a different ethnic group.  Fassbinder's film takes place in Munich in the shadow of the 1972 Olympics when Arab terrorists took part of the Israel Olympic team hostage, which ended in a blood bath.  Nevertheless, Ali: Fear Eats the Soul is a completely unrelated story to the bloodshed that took place in 1972 as it is told around Ali, a Moroccan guest worker, and Emmi, an older German woman, who fall in love with one another.  Ali and Emmi come across each other at a local Arabian bar as Emmi seeks shelter from the rain outside.  Ali and Emmi dance, converse, and Emmi invites Ali home for a nightcap as she is suffering from loneliness.  Together they have to confront prejudice and racism as their relationship progresses since Ali looks and speaks differently than the German people around them.  During their struggle they decide to go on a short vacation in order to escape the intolerance that surrounded them and as they come back Ali and Emmi begin to have their own doubts of their relationship.  Fassbinder's film is a brilliant story and it uses some interesting cinematography that elevates the cinematic experience.  However, the sound quality of the dialogues removes the realistic tone of the environment which sounds recorded and the characters are sometimes awkwardly portrayed by the cast.  Nevertheless, Fassbinder created a truly unique cinematic experience as he colors the environment with his own touch and it leaves the audience with a great feeling.",1076544000,16,1717,4.913494809688581
338268,5,6301599918,"The movie starts out with groups of people staring at each other which would make anyone feel awkward or different. The directing style reflects distance by showing people far away and then bringing them up close in tightly cramped spaces. The fear is what separates people and eats at you. This is symbolized by Ali's stomach ulcer. In order to connect you have to stand together against all the prejudice and ugliness out there and treat each other well. The more we treat each other with respect the more we can stop the fear growing inside of us. At least this is the way I perceived the film. The director filmed this in 14 days and it was a very small project compared to other movies he made with big budgets. The Arab husband was really the director's lover. The director himself was gay and probably experienced prejudice himself. The movie is slow and awkward but I think it is meant to be this way. A definate must see for anyone who likes foreign film. It is probably one of the best as far as the message it displays and projects on film.

338269,5,6301599918,"In `Fear Eats the Soul` Fassbinder examines a range of social prejudices that divide and stigmatise people. The central plot strand concerns Emmi, an elderly widow who falls in love with and marries Ali, a Morrocan guest  worker. This relationship gathers a cluster of hostilities before itself  imploding as the two partners fall back into conventionalised patterns of  prejudice and desire. The film ends with a moving image of doomed  reunification, which itself symbolises the entire relationship.  Fassbinder`s achievement in this film is  showing how a spectrum of social  tensions reinforce and amplify each other. The scene in which the newly  married couple clumsily try to navigate through a menu in a high class  restaurant, with the aid of  a sneeringly contemptuous bourgeious flunky of  a waiter, is an example of Fassbinder`s sophisticated handling of his  subject matter. Similarly, the unravelling of the relationship, as Emmi and  Ali revert into familiar patterns of loyalty and exclusion, is sensitively  handled.  This is a superb film that never falls into lazy  sentimentality or cynicism. It is a testament to the ability of the  cinematic medium to explore social issues intelligently. Highly  reccommended.",958780800,5,1232,5.394736842105263

The love affair between the 60 year old German char woman and the much-younger Moroccan mechanic in the context of a disapproving and racist  German society is convincing, and alternately funny and sad.  Even more  funny and sad, however, is how easily each of the two characters can forget  the lessons they learn from each other and revert back to old habits.  Ali  forgets about love and acceptance and goes to someone who will provide him  with couscous.  Emmi forgets about what it means to persecute someone  because of ethnicity and rejects a Yugoslavian girl that comes to work  with her.  Brilliantly filmed, short and concise, and powerful, a great  movie.",957312000,,747,4.975609756097561
338360,3,6301599918,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Werner Fassbinder's 'Ali: Fear Eats the Soul' is loosely based on American director Douglas Sirk's 1955 soap opera, 'All That Heaven Allows'. Where Sirk's tale is about a middle class suburban housewife falling for a lower-class gardener who she employs, Fassbinder has bigger fish to fry. His tale focuses on Emmi, a 60ish West German cleaning woman who one day strays into a bar populated by Moroccan immigrants and ends up dancing with Ali, a dark-skinned Moroccan who works at an auto body shop. Fassbinder's strategy is to expose a deeply prejudiced German society who react poorly to Emmi and Ali, after they end up as a couple.

For awhile, Emmi is the true hero of the piece, as she endures all kinds of rejection from friends and family, who can't stomach the idea of a good German woman shacking up with (in their eyes) a 'lowly' Arab. The hostility is so intense from the German side that one wonders if Fassbinder has created a coterie of bad stereotypes. Fassbinder himself plays Emmi's son-in-law, a dyed in the wool neo-Nazi if there ever was one and his hatred of all immigrants may represent the bigoted voice of a certain group of reactionaries that still probably exist today, all over Europe. But when one of Emmi's sons smashes a TV set in their first encounter with Ali and they all walk out (including Emmi's daughter and other son) and vow never to talk to the mother again, it's a little too much. The same goes for Emmi's gossipy neighbors and the grocer who Emmi has patronized for years--they too end up shunning her after meeting Ali for the first time. Only a reasonable landlord and a group of even-keeled police officers refuse to play the nasty race card, as Fassbinder suggests that there are only a few good eggs amongst all the bad apples.

Are people who have such bigoted inclinations, so blatant about their prejudices? In real life, I say no. They would naturally try and project an image to the contrary, that they're actually tolerant when deep down they're not. Fassbinder's bunch of German nasties become much more palatable in the second half as they now do a 180 and try to suck up to Emmi. Fassbinder makes it clear that their big turn-a-round is hypocritical, because they act entirely out of self-interest and not because they've developed a humanitarian bent. A neighbor now needs Emmi's extra space in her apartment where they can store some extra clothes belonging to a relative who has just come into town. And one of Emmi's sons want her to watch their children as he and his wife need to be at work. There's also the grocer who realizes he's losing business from a good customer and now pretends that he has no problem with Ali and Emmi as a couple. The second half machinations in which friends and family make much more of an effort to accommodate a couple that they deep down despise, rings much more true than the blatant bigots Fassbinder tries to pass off as real people in the first half.

Fassbinder wisely brings Emmi down a peg or two in the second half, suggesting that her Nazi past (she reveals she was a Party member ""like everyone else"") is not entirely behind her. After all the hatred brings her to tears in the first half of the film and the unexpected acceptance occurs once she and Ali come back from a vacation, now she's more than willing to join forces again with her unprincipled neighbors (the gossipy women), to the detriment of a new apartment dweller, a cleaning woman from Yugoslavia, who ends up automatically ostracized and the new punching bag for the apartment ladies from hell. Emmi shows further signs of corruption, when she treats Ali as an object, showing off his muscles to her new found fawning friends and attributing his mood swings to a ""foreigner mentality"".

While the bulk of German society is taken to task, Fassbinder refuses to even things up on the other side. Heaven forbid that Fassbinder would ever suggest that there's a dark side to the immigrant experience in Germany. Ali is such a non-descript 'good guy', one can only dub him the 'Marty' of the New German Cinema. Despite being put off by all the racism he encounters everyday, he's willing , out of the goodness of his heart, to take Emmi for his wife, despite her physical unattractiveness. The more saintly a portrait Fassbinder paints of Ali, the more you get to sneer at the horrible racist German society, responsible for his lack of acceptance and outright ostracism. Sure, Fassbinder, will throw in a few 'imperfections'--he goes running back to the German barmaid and has a sex with her because Emmi won't cook his favorite 'cous-cous'. But in the end, he'll take that last dance with Emmi before collapsing from a stomach ulcer, brought on by all the stress caused by the bad, bad Germans!

The height of irony is our German 'Marty', the actor Ed Hedi ben Salem, ended up in prison after stabbing three people and then committing suicide. Salem was Fassbinder's lover in real life and it's obvious that his fictional character, 'Ali', is nothing more than a completely idealized vision of immigrants as victims. That is not to say that xenophobia in German society doesn't exist as well as outright racism--but Fassbinder, in his zeal to prosecute the failings of his own people, is unable to strike a balanced tone, where the foibles of both sides are dealt with fairly and impartially.

In its strongest moments, 'Ali' represents a plea for tolerance of people with different customs. In her strong performance as 'Emmi', Brigitte Mira represents the individual who's willing to 'go it alone', fighting a misguided establishment bent on living in the past by rejecting those who embrace 'alternative lifestyles'.",1343001600,8,5730,4.764350453172206
338361,5,6301599918,"FEAR EATS THE SOUL is an offbeat film.  Its premise is preposterous, but nonetheless the viewer is drawn into the story and comes to care about characters who are not glamorous or very exceptional on any level.  But somehow Emmy, this sixty-ish, somewhat dumpy cleaning woman, who had been a member of the Nazi party in her youth, and a very fit Moroccan ""guest worker"" named Ali, who is more than twenty years her junior, meet, fall in love, and marry.  They are reviled by the society in which they live. As long as other people are against them, their relationship is strong.  But gradually those who rejected them realize that they need the couple for economic reasons and (at least on the surface) accept them.  Then the couple's relationship falls apart.  The camera is objective and rather coldly observes the characters and the world in which they live.  The characters inhabit the German petit bourgeois, where kitsch is the reality.  Emmy's wardrobe consists primarily of jersey dresses with bold colorful patterns.  The pictures on her walls are seascapes that are perhaps ""Paint-by-number.""  But there is nothing campy about the point of view.  characters are respected.  Their feelings are real.  The film is in many ways like a play.  Some scenes look as if the characters were placed upon a stage while the stationary camera filmed them from the audience.  There are a lot of tableaux.  The whole story is told very simply and straightforwardly.  But the whole effect is compelling and somewhat disquieting.  I've seen it many times in theatres, television, and recorded video, so I was blown away by this DVD's fabulous quality.  You can really appreciate the clean, crisp photography of this film that was not evident on the VCR or the worn-out prints shown in revival houses.  I'll say the same for the soundtrack, which is a revelation after decades of hearing warped soundtracks.  The wonderfully restored film alone is worth the price of the DVD, but a second DVD is included that gave even me, a long time fan of this film, some new insights.  I was surprised that I was impressed by Todd Haynes' introduction because I do not like his films.  Based on this short film, I think he is a much better critic than director.  I especially loved the interview with 93-year old Brigitta Mira, as well as the short film ""Fear Eat Soul,"" in which she also appears.  Also included is a British television documentary, ""Signs of Vigorous Life: New German Cinema from the 1980s which features Fassbinder, Volker Schlondorf, and Werner Herzog.  In addition there is an interview with the film's editor, who says she had a nervous breakdown over it, and an excerpt from Fassbinder's film THE AMERICAN SOLDIER, in which the story of Emmy first appeared as the subject of a monologue related by Margarethe von Trotta.  In addition, a 16-page booklet is included in this Criterion Collection package that features essays ""One Love, Two Oppressions"" by Chris Fujiwara and ""All that Fassbinder Allows"" by Michael Toteberg.  Five stars.",1335225600,2,3038,4.892367906066537
338362,5,6301599918,"Having returned to this film after not having seen it in a few years, I saw much more this time.  Either that, or my life experience gave me easier access to its levels.  The optimist and the humanist in me wants to believe that Ali falls in love with Emmi--and vice versa--because both are essentially good people.  As opposed to dwelling on the improbability of such a relationship ever working out--as several characters in ""Ali Fear Eats the Soul"" allude to.  Emmi enters the grungy bar in the opening sequence where she'll met Ali, and the scene is dominated by red tablecloths (a key visual detail, as are the yellow tables in a later outdoor scene).  The gritty ambiance of the characters' various worlds, and their suspicion (""Them""), is juxtaposed against the fundamental goodness, simplicity and compassion of both Emmi and Ali (""Us"").  The cynic in me doesn't want to believe that people are as good as Emmi and Ali.  Because what a price one can pay in our cruel world for being that way.  In the commentary on CD 2 there is some discussion of this film functioning as a ""fable""--IE the nosy neighbors and co-workers in ""Ali Fear Eats the Soul"" whose portrayals are so ""over the top"".  But fable comes closest to describing the essence of the film--if one chooses to, there is something to be learned here.  The POV introduced in the film RE the themes of racism and interracial marriage had to be controversial at the time, and of course, those issues are still problematic.  The soundtrack is used sparingly, only as needed, and it works well in this manner--the Arabic music being a particular highlight.  In the supplemental CD (CD 2), some of the commentary refers to Fassbinder's still tableaux of motionless actors (as ""judgmental voyeurs""); those tableaux immediately reminded me of Fellini (specifically as they manifested in ""Juliet of the Spirits"")--although in Fellini's case, those tableaux are more often comical.  Of the additional supplemental material on CD 2, I especially enjoyed Thea Eymesz' memories of her experience editing the film with Fassbinder, as well as the excerpt from ""The American Soldier"" (an earlier film of Fassbinder's) in which actress Margarethe von Trotta tells the story, in a monologue, on which ""Ali Fear Eats the Soul"" is based.

338363,5,6301599918,"This is a film about a much older German cleaning woman, Emmi, and a younger Arab man, Ali, who meet and fall in love with each other.  We see a great deal of the reactions from the people around them, which are nearly all negative at first, until after Emmi and Ali go away for a short vacation.  When they return, people seem more accepting, but ironically Emmi starts to objectify Ali (she has her friends touch his muscles, for example) and tells him he has to start eating German food.  This sends him on a sort of jag, and yet we see that they can still make it.  It does sound a bit melodramatic, but it doesn't play that way at all.  The dialogue is very natural and everything flows and makes sense within the movie.  The actors are all completely believable and I found myself engrossed by the movie, which shows the prejudices of German society against Arabs in a non-preachy way.  This is a movie that is just as relevant now as when it was made.  If you love film, you should watch this.",1291420800,3,1000,4.310160427807487
338364,5,6301599918,"This movie has to be in my opinion the best love story I have ever seen on film. The story is believable and the dialog is realistic. Most hollywood love stories are blown way out of reality and at times I know I am watching a movie because what is written in the script is just not what people would say. Although Fassbinder movies usually have this oddness of characters to them and sometimes the stern German personae of each character seems too cliche, that is essentially how his movies are. A great movie to open your mind about love and leave you thinking more about life.",1287705600,,579,4.420560747663552

My first concern, however, was that the Arab protagonist is shown speaking in pigeon-English (e.g. in pigeon subtitled German) which makes him seem quite simple.  Addditionally, this film is slowed down by extended periods of silence and inactivity (e.g. people staring into the camera endlessly with no visible affect).

338366,5,6301599918,"Ali: Fear Eats the Soul is a film that intelligently blends social commentary with the lives of two individuals whose paths unexpectedly cross. Emmi Kurowski is an older widow who finds herself going through the motions of life without any meaningful relationships to share it with. To avoid a rain shower one afternoon she takes refuge inside a local bar and it's there where she meets Ali, a Morrocan mechanic who's much her junior. The two share a dance and their improbable relationship begins. What ensues is a union that sparks widespread aversion towards the couple and their resolve to overcome such animosity.

Fassbinder takes the cultural prejudice of a post war Germany and creates a film with universal appeal - one that is just as relevant in today's modern world as it was when it was made. He uses the central characters to depict the fears of not only themselves, but also of society in general. The pace he creates has a unique minimalistic quality and maintains an effortless flow throughout the entire film. Bridgette Mira's portrayal of the humble but enduring Emmi is outstanding and she anchors the film with great realism. A true understated classic of world cinema.",1246233600,2,1190,4.920398009950249
338367,5,6301599918,"German Rainer Werner Fassbinder directed this sweet and sad film about an older woman who falls in love with a much younger man. Ali: Fear Eats the Soul is loosely based on Douglas Sirk's All That Heaven Allows starring Rock Hudson and Jane Wyman.  Unlike All That Heaven Allows, which features a mature but strikingly beautiful not-much-older woman in Jane Wyman, Brigitte Mira, who plays the MUCH older German housecleaner--in Ali: Fear Eats the soul--gives new meaning to the phrase ""robbing the cradle."" Her love interest, El Hedi ben Salem, is Ali, a Moroccan guest worker and auto mechanic. Intensifying their age discrepancy is race: Brigitte Mira's character is white and El Hedi ben Salem's character is black. That she and her late husband belonged to the Nazi Party further intensify their unlikely affair.

Ali: Fear Eats the Soul begins as an old woman enters a bar. Outside, it's dark and wet; inside the bar, it's warm and dry. The tables in the bar are empty; a few patrons clustered at the bar--including the bartender, a tall, voluptuous, blonde--greet the old woman with hard cold stares. Besides the white bartender, the people clustered at the bar are black. Their strong looks ridicule and isolate the old woman--she becomes self-conscious and feels old and out of her place. As a joke, one of the women at the bar dares one of the men, the most attractive man, to dance with the old woman. That young man, Ali, approaches the old woman. He buys her a drink and they dance. The young women at the bar look in envy upon the slow-dancing couple, the young black man and the old white woman. They are very comfortable in each other's arms. He walks her home. She lives in an old apartment building. It's very late and it's still raining.  She invites the young black man in for a moment, for a drink, and to dry himself a little. They talk. He asks her what she does for a living. She's embarrassed. Reluctantly she tells him that she's a cleaning woman. He seems impressed. She opens up to him. She's lonely. She has children in town but she only sees them on holidays. All of his family is back in Morocco.

After a drink and a small--but warm--conversation, the young black man prepares to leave. He lives on the other side of town where he shares a small room with five other men. The old woman invites him to stay at her home in her guestroom. He could leave in the morning when it's dry. Sometime in the night, the black man becomes restless. He knocks on the old woman's bedroom door, and she allows him inside. Thus, begins their unlikely--bittersweet--relationship.

This is a sweet, understated, and beautiful film. There are no bad police--a la Spike Lee, no Hiroshimas, and no confrontations with the Klan. Ali: Fear Eats the Soul shows the unseen side of racism by juxtaposing the outward emotions of the interracial couple. The white woman freely expresses her torn feelings at being isolated by her own kind; on the other hand, her young black husband is stoic and seems unconcerned with and unaffected by the racial hostilities directed at he and his wife. Through this couple is shown the safety of emotional expression against the danger of emotional repression and indifference, hence the film's sad soft conclusion.  Fear, anger, pain--all these does eat the soul. This is a beautiful film.

338368,5,6301599918,"The New German Cinema that flowered in the 1970's had many directorial wunderkind -- Herzog, Wenders, Volker Schloendorff. But with this film, Rainer Werner Fassbinder nosed ahead of the pack with the international arthouse audience. In many ways it's a very accessible film, largely because Brigitte Mira is so wonderful in her heart-breaking portrayal of sad, lonely Emmi who knows that to love and be loved is more important than anything else. But for some viewers, Fassbinder's development as a filmmaker from his roots in theatre make his work seem strangely artificial and 'stagey'. This film is no exception. Trademark Fassbinder techniques are all over this one, from his lurid color palette; the even, slow movement of his edit; the slightly stiff, delayed-reaction mannerisms of the actors; the mirror shots; the carefully orchestrated dialogue. What cannot be ignored is how bold and forceful his filmmaking had become by this mid point in his career. Fassbinder tells a story of racism in German society, and its lingering connection with Nazism, that is shocking and terribly moving. I know some viewers feel that the way the story turns mid-way is contrived, but again Fassbinder is taking a brutally realistic viewpoint; that people will hide their true feelings when their self-interest is at stake. What is truly refreshing, and something that could never be done by a Hollywood director, is the way Fassbinder ends the story. It's an incredible mix of hope, optimism and despair that refuses to tie things up in a nice, ""happy' parcel. By disdaining an ending that puts the world right again, Fassbinder created a film that lives in the memory and which rightfully makes a claim to greatness.",1195257600,,1711,5.114285714285714
338369,5,6301599918,"A scathing satire on romance, racism, and German-Arab relations, Fassbinder's ""Ali"" is a brilliant reminder that love can soothe only when it is sanctioned by a social community. Inspired by Douglas Sirk's 1955 ""All That Heaven Allows,"" the film deals with human vulnerability and the alienating effects of isolation due to age, class, and one's skin color, glimpsing a tender but troubled relationship between two outcasts. Mira, one of Fassbinder's favorite actresses, is simply heartbreaking as Emmi, a 60-ish woman with a realistic outlook on sex and love. Achingly intimate and peppered with poignant humor, ""Ali"" is one of the writer-director's most soulful works.",1183420800,2,670,5.451923076923077
338416,4,6301599918,"This powerful and gentle film tells the story of love and marriage of Emmi, a 60+ widowed German cleaning lady and Ali, a Moroccan immigrant mechanic who is more than 20 (I think close to 30) years her younger. Their affair and the decision to marry shocked everyone who knew Emmi: her grown children, her neighbors, coworkers (mostly, middle-aged widows as herself) and even the owner of a neighborhood grocery shop where she has been a loyal customer for years. The way clever and observant Fassbinder looks at their struggle to keep the relationship is deeply pessimistic - the couple could survive the obstacles that society would create for them. They can survive disapproval, misunderstanding and prejudice but at the very moment they think all problems are in the past, they find the emptiness inside and two lonely hearts together are even worse than one. The more I think of it the more I realize that ""Ali: Fear Eats the Soul"" is among the best, the most poignant, gentlest and heartbreaking descriptions of unavailability for happiness ever filmed. What makes the movie even more poignant is the fact that both Fassbinder and El Hedi ben Salem, the man whom Fassbinder loved and who played Ali committed suicide in the same year, Fassbinder - a few weeks after El Hedi. The film is also a love letter to El Hedi. In one of the film's most moving scene, Emmi looks at the man with whom she so suddenly and desperately fell in love with admiration, longing, and wise sadness while he dries himself after the shower. It is not only Emmi looks at Ali, it is Rainer looks with love and affection at the man he loved through the lenses of his camera.

338417,3,6301599918,"The movie is misnamed.  The title makes you think that it is a horror flick, but there is little fear and no soul-eating going on.

A dark skinned Arab man from Morocco lives in Germany in the 1970s.  The German people, just one or two generations from that happy Nazi Generation we were all so fond of, detest all foreigners and call most of them Ali.  The greatest shame would be for a German woman to marry one, God Forbid.  That would make her a whore.

Enter Emmi, a middle aged German widow.  Enter Ali, a young Arab man who turns out to like middle aged German widows who are nice.  They dance, they talk, they go to bed, they get married.  It is an impulse marriage.  They hardly know each other, and the engagement is a matter of hours, not months.

Much of the impact of the movie comes from the reaction that Emmi's neighbors, co-workers and children have to her apostasy.  They shun her.  One of her sons kicks her tv set in.  It really doesn't pay for someone to be non-German in Germany.  It gets you despised.  A generation or two after murdering every Jew in sight, these lovely people are two minutes away from doing it again, to other foreigners in their midst.  It reminds me of how proud the German people are of themselves in those beer commercials, and those car commercials, as they boast of their German heritage.  I've never once seen a Toyota commercial boasting of its Japanese origin.  On the contrary, many Toyota commercials are more American than apple pie, French fries and baseball.

It surprised me that a German language film would be propaganda against the German people.  I'm not exaggerating.  For half the film, you can't help but hate Germans because of how they are portrayed here.

The movie takes a sharp turn later on, and stops being a propaganda film against the German people and their racism.  It starts to be about our happy couple, Emmi and her forbidden husband Ali.  Each of them begins to show a fault or two, like Emmi's crotchety ways, bullying Ali about not eating couscous and becoming more German, and Ali's reaction, to seek out some solitude and an old girlfriend.

As for the German people, they stop being ""haters"" and start being ""takers"", as they decide to stop harassing and shunning poor Emmi because after all, they need a favor or two.  For example, the son who kicked in her tv set now needs babysitting services, so he apologizes to mom.  The store owner who threw the apostate couple out of his store changes his ways after realizing that he sure could use her patronage.

This is an eye opening movie.  I had heard that the German people are extremely racist still, and hate Turks and other foreigners, and in fact attack them every chance they get, like German shepherds who were brought up badly.  Well, now we get to see it, and from a German director no less.

I think it is an interesting touch that Fassbinder has his heroin Emmi going to Hitler's favorite restaurant.  This is symbolic of the whole movie.  She really has no aversion to Hitler, though she is warm and tolerant of foreigners if they just ease up on the couscous.",1160697600,3,3107,4.538738738738739
338418,4,6301599918,"The influence of director Douglas Sirk on the output of Fassbinder is notable. Like Sirk, Fassbinder utilised the melodramatic form (a form often dismissed by critics) to take apart and satirise the society he was a part of. ""Fear Eats the Soul"" is one of Fassbinder's more transparent efforts, as he shows the prejudice and jealousy eating away at the heart of society. But unlike ""All That Heaven Allows"" Fassbinder's subject matter deals with a very sensitive and touchy issue in German society at the time. The racial bigotry evident in the film is particularly disturbing, for it shows that the foundations of Nazism, which were after all based initially on racial prejudice are still very much alive. Interweaved into these concerns is a very human tale, which is very affecting on an emotional level. Relationships in Fassbinder films are regularly flawed and miserable prospects and he takes this to an extreme in this film, a doomed quality permeates every scene as does the decadence and apathy, reflected in the dull dcor and sleepy character behaviour.

338421,3,6301599918,"An old woman walks into a bar to get out of the rain.  The city is Berlin, the woman is German and the bar serves a predominantly Arab clientele.  The woman, Emmi (Brigitte Mira) meet a younger, at least twenty years younger, Moroccan man named Ali (El Hedi ben Salem.)  They strike up a conversation.  He walks her home in the pouring rain and she invites him up to her apartment until the pouring rain ends.

  Rainer Werner Fassbinder's ALI: FEAR EATS THE SOUL is a love story with a difference.  Emmi LOOKS like a 60-plus year-old cleaning woman, while Ali is a virile, good-looking, forty-something, dark-skinned garage mechanic.  Emmi is a German and Ali a Moroccan.  Brigitte Mira can act and El Hedi ben Salem cannot.  About the only thing the two characters have in common is a gnawing loneliness.

  Their friendship quickly blossoms into love.  When Emmi introduces her new husband to her adult children the news is met with a stern silence followed by an eruption of violence.  In short order Emmi is estranged and disowned by her family, rejected by her friends, more isolated than ever save for the companionship of the man she loves.  Ali's course through the movie is harder to chart, and not just because ben Salem is an inferior actor.  This is a German film about western racism - and ageism - and it is the Germans who undergo the greatest change.

  Fassbinder's film is quite moving in places, but there were too many times when I felt the message of harmony and acceptance overwhelmed the story and pushed it into places it didn't fit.  There are times when the plot contrivances feel too... well... contrived.  A nice story with a nice message, but, for me at least, not much more.",1110931200,5,1705,4.62876254180602

338425,5,6301599918,"Ali - Fear Eats the Soul is a somber German tale by Rainer Werner Fassbinder of racism in Munich of the 1970s. An older woman, a widow, happens into an Arab bar to escape the rain. This is post-1972 Munich, where the bombing of the Olympic games by Islamic terrorists is still fresh in peoples' minds. But this woman is Emmi, who married a Polish worker years ago despite her own family's prejudices. She raised 3 children with him before he died of an ulcer. Now she's ready to love again.
And love she does - she falls for Ali, a Moroccan worker with a gentle soul and a partial command of the German tongue. Ali is 20 years younger than her, but he falls for her gentle ways. They sleep together on the first night, and despite the hostility of her family, her co-workers and local group, she marries him quickly. They are very happy together, but the anger of all around her wear her down. Finally she goes off on a vacation with Ali, promising him that when they return everything will be better.
An in an amazingly bizarre plot device, things ARE better. Suddenly everyone who was mean to them before finds reasons to be nice - selfish reasons. The grocer wants her money back. Her son wants her to care for the granddaughter. The apartment-mates need help moving equipment. Emmi doesn't care - she's just happy that everybody is being nice again. But Ali is getting frustrated. He gave up his soul to be with Emmi, and while Emmi is regaining her friends again, Ali has nothing. He is still stuck with a foreign tongue, living in a foreign landscape. All he asks for is some cous cous to remind him of hime - and Emmi harsly tells him to get used to German cooking.
So Ali, who is a drifting reed through most of this story, drifts back into his Arab world. He hooks up with a female Arab friend of his who cooks the food he loves and who snuggles with him at night. He plays cards with his Arab buddies while listening to Arab music. Emmi realizes her loss and comes after him. She tells him it's OK if he has other women, other friends. All she wants is his love and his presence, to fight off the loneliness. And Ali admits to her that he loves only her, that he doesn't know how this got so confusing.
Then Ali collapses with an ulcer, just like Emmi's immigrant husband did. The doctor tells Emmi that he can't help Ali at all - he can only fix him for now, send him off and expect him to return in 6 months with another ulcer. But Emmi promises that she will make this work - she will reduce the stress so Ali is happy.
I really enjoyed this movie, especially in modern day times with all the arguments going on about gay and lesbian marriages. It wasn't that long ago that the color of your skin was enough to bar you from marrying. It's very scary to think that, with so many people hoping someday to find happiness, that we would put barriers in the way of any two human beings who have managed to find it, even if they are years apart in age, or shades apart in color.",1078444800,27,2985,4.284955752212389
7813035,5,6301599918,"Douglas Sirks 1955 All That Heaven Allows and Rainer Werner Fassbinders 1974 Ali: Fear Eats the Soul (Angst essen Seele auf) are both exquisite films worthy of the highest possible recommendation. They represent the respective directors at the very peak of their powers and are widely (and for me correctly) acknowledged as masterpieces. Fear Eats the Soul is oft-described as a remake of All That Heaven Allows and I thought Id review both here in a comparative piece which tries to look at the exact relationship between the two because for all their similarities, they are very different films. Fassbinder certainly does not copy Sirk and his film is no straightforward remake. What follows will range across both narratives and will therefore be riddled with spoilers. Dont read if you haven't seen.

All That Heaven Allows is one of several glossy womens melodramas that Sirk made for Universal Studios in the 1950s which used to be derided, but have now attained classic status. If Written on the Wind (1956) and Imitation of Life (1958) are widely acknowledged as the very best of these, All That Heaven Allows has also achieved a lofty position in Americas artistic heritage and was selected for preservation in the United States Film Registry in 1995. The film initially arose from Universals desire to cash in on the success of Magnificent Obsession (1954) by casting again that films stars (Rock Hudson and Jane Wyman) this time as the mis-matched couple, Cary Scott and Ron Kirby. Cary is a wealthy but lonely widow who falls in love with her gardener Ron. The film is centrally about the hornets nest of xenophobia, class prejudice, snobbery and materialistic greed which their affair stirs up both in society and in the family and friends who inhabit that society. Quite deliberately set in the small New England town of Rockingham (not too far from Concorde one senses), the film transparently contrasts 50s American values with the values of the 19th century Transcendentalists deliberately citing Henry David Thoreaus Walden in a hymn to Shakespeares adage from Hamlet, To thine own self be true. Cary realizes eventually that she has let what others think dictate her actions and the film finishes in a blaze of hope made truly intoxicating by Russell Mettys glorious Technicolor cinematography and the simple but highly effective narrative arc in Peg Fenwicks screenplay (adapted from a novel by Edna and Harry Lee). Sirk gave Universal what they wanted in the shape of a simple love story, but the focus of the film is actually sharply biting as he lacerates the prevailing repressive values of the day. Universal expected a celebration, but Sirk delivered a veiled excoriation and the studio execs were too dumb to realize: The studio loved the title All That Heaven Allows. They thought it meant you could have everything you wanted. I meant it the other way round. As far as I am concerned, heaven is stingy. (Sirk in Sirk on Sirk)

Stinginess is also central to Fear Eats the Soul, one of the high points of the New German Cinema of the 1970s. Fassbinder had come to a creative impasse brought on by the realization that his previous 9 films had not caught on with the public. Beware of a Holy Whore (1970) dramatizes his anger at this and in the 8 months of silence that followed it Fassbinder explored a possible route to an audience as lying in the melodramatic style of Sirk. He visited the old man in Switzerland, helped organize a Sirk retrospective and wrote an essay eulogizing his new-found inspiration. He based the central character of The Merchant of Four Seasons on the Robert Stack character in Written on the Wind, and in Fear Eats the Soul he takes All That Heaven Allows and reproduces the same scenario but transposed to a different cultural milieu. Small town New England becomes big city Munich, the rich older widow becomes the poor much older but equally lonely widowed cleaning lady Emmi (Brigitte Mira) and the walking personification of good old American Transcendentalist values (Ron as Mr. Nature) becomes a Moroccan gastarbeiter Ali (El Hedi ben Salem). Following Sirk, Fassbinder focuses mainly on the tight knot of xenophobia and prejudice present both within society and in the people that represent it. Friends, neighbors and family are united in their disgust as Emmi and Ali are scorned and bullied. Fassbinder refers explicitly to Sirk in the scene where the oldest son kicks in Emmis TV in anger at learning that she has married an Arab. In the Sirk film the son buys a TV as a substitute for the man Cary is not allowed to have and theres a wonderful image of her reflected in the screen, imprisoned in middle age loneliness. Also as in Sirk, people come to understand and accept the central couple and love is allowed to win through in the end with both films finishing with the ladies holding the hands of their bed-ridden men with the promise of a loving future ahead of them.

In outline then both films are similar, but Fassbinders alteration of milieu and class makes for a very different effect. We recognize Fassbinders interest is not in the lush, superficial coziness of a tacky love story, although he does borrow something of this. Rather, as Sirk did, Fassbinder recognizes the very essence of melodrama which is that it is about individuals (one on one) repressing each other. He saw Sirk coding this repression in a syrupy sheen in order to please the studio. In Fear Eats the Soul he scuffs up the sheen and presents the various layers of repression naked, cold and harsh. The interesting thing is this does not dissipate the glowing warmth of the central love affair at all. On the contrary, it makes it realer and even more remarkably affecting. While Cary and Ron are clearly two-dimensional movie characters molded by a studio anxious to make money, Emmi and Ali are absolutely three-dimensional characters who could be real people and their story has an integrity which accurately reflects the personal lives of everyone involved in making the film. In essence both films are products of their time. All That Heaven Allows was in effect all that Universal Studios would allow Sirk to make in terms of being a squeaky clean love story. The central couple are not real because 50s Hollywood wouldnt allow them to be. The films social attack had to be coded and we have to learn how to read it to see how biting the attack actually is. Fear Eats the Soul on the other hand is a product of the whole modernist project and reflects the new freedom the 70s brought. The attack is therefore allowed to be made very explicit. Furthermore, the attack is given a relevance which transcends time by Fassbinders retention of Brechtian techniques. It looks fresh and revelatory even today now that the great modernist experiment has ended and cinema everywhere has reverted back to the old universal zero-style of traditional Hollywood filmmaking.

The crucial difference between these two films lies in the varying distribution of hope in the human species that each director espouses. Sirk remains centrally optimistic despite the veiled assault on 50s American values, while Fassbinders optimism remains qualified at best even though his film is tender innocence itself set beside the prevailing cynicism of his other films. For Sirk, the nasty bitchiness of Carys rich social circle etched out principally by her friend Sara (Agnes Moorehead) who affects support but is openly pleased when Cary calls off her marriage, various gossip-mongers down at the local country club and by her two grown-up children Kay (Gloria Talbott) and especially Ned (William Reynolds), is off-set by a whole group of enlightened people based around Mick and Alida Anderson (Charles Drake and Virginia Grey) who harbor very different all-American values. Micks Bible is Thoreaus Walden and although Ron hasn't read it, he actually lives it without knowing. Cary is given an important scene where she reads the book, title and author clearly displayed to us: The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. [What is called resignation is confirmed desperation]. Why should we be in such desperate haste to succeed [and in such desperate enterprise]? If a man does not keep pace with his companions perhaps its because he hears a different drummer. Let him step to the music he hears however measured or far away. Ron enshrines this Transcendentalist thinking (his occupation makes him at one with nature) and gets to tell Cary various philosophical homilies like Dont lead your life for others, Home is where you are, Nothings important except us and [Dont] keep up with the Joneses. Ron is presented by Sirk as a paragon of natural virtue and Carys eventual decision to promise her life to him is worded as a virtual conversion to the Transcendentalist cause. As Ron lies possibly dying she says, [He] was so secure within himself because he refused to give importance to unimportant things. Why did it take me so long to understand it? In addition to the disciples of Transcendentalism, Sirk also shows human warmth to seep through other key characters. Kay tearfully urges Cary to marry Ron once she learns how sad her mother is, and crucially the doctor (Hayden Rorke) explains the cause of Carys headaches (Youre punishing yourselffor running away from life. The headaches natures way of making a protest. Do you expect me to give you a prescription to cure life? You were ready for a love affair, but not for love) before recommending her to let Ron take care of her. The daughters change of heart and the doctors wisdom can be put down to hollow Hollywood womens weepie convention, but the stress on Transcendentalism is interesting for being so sincere in the sense that we have no reason to doubt Sirks belief in it, just as we have no reason to doubt the Christian charity lying behind Magnificent Obsession. For this director there really was an alternative lifestyle to the prevailing desperate haste to succeed.

Fassbinder characteristically offers no positive alternative at all in Fear Eats the Soul. Sirk offers us upper middle class materialistic values mixed with further members of the upper middle class who prefer to live contrary to these values. Fassbinder offers us working class values mixed with the classless milieu of the gastarbeiter world. If the prejudice on display in the Sirk is rooted in snobbery and materialistic keeping up with the Joneses, the prejudice on display in the Fassbinder is crude racism coupled with ageism. Sirk offers a 40 year old older woman (Wyman was actually 38) having an affair with a man in his 30s (Hudson was 30), and the age gap isn't actually that wide. Carys children want her to marry, but of course to a rich widower (like Harvey) who will maintain the materialist values of their late father. The film doesnt focus too much on Ron and we aren't shown his loneliness (although we do hear about his fathers death and learn that he builds a home in the vague hope that Cary might live there), but certainly Carys loneliness is heavily stressed. In Fassbinders film Emmi is 60 and nobody expects, let alone accepts, her romance with a much younger man in his late 30s. The loneliness of both is strongly delineated and the film addresses the isolation of both old people and foreign people living in modern Germany. Further to that, their efforts to alleviate their loneliness by reaching out to each other only causes more pain because society simply won't allow them to be happy. Not for nothing is the films epitaph: Happiness is not always fun.

Between them Emmi and Ali espouse through action a value system which is freely accepting of everyone irrespective of class, age and race. Importantly, Emmis family name is Kurowski and she was married to a Pole which makes her three hypocritically xenophobic children half-foreign whether they like it or not. A fundamentally kind soul, she has always believed in relationships across social divides. The fact that Ali has chosen to work in Germany and loves Emmi also shows he is willing to accept another culture. This mutual open-mindedness is countered ominously by only one other alternative value system  that of Nazism. Emmi is kind, but she is not very intelligent. She probably has no idea about the Holocaust and thinks nothing of admitting that she was a member of the Party back in the 1930s along with everyone else. Her ignorance is most revealing in her wish to go to Hitlers favorite restaurant for their celebratory wedding lunch  I have always wanted to eat here, she says. I don't mean to suggest Emmi is a Nazi (her ignorance coupled with her open mind clears her of that charge), but I do think Fassbinder is drawing a connection between Munich (a traditional hotbed of Nazism) and the racism we see exhibited by all the characters around his central couple. When faced with Ali the reaction of her children says it all. In a long slow pan we see in close-up a series of faces filled with hatred, first Bruno (Peter Gauhe) then her reptilian son-in-law Eugen (Fassbinder himself), her daughter Krista (Irm Hermann) and lastly her second son Albert (Karl Scheydt). Bruno kicks in the TV and storms out speechless with anger, Albert disowns himself quickly following Bruno, and the other two also cant leave soon enough the pigsty home of a whore (Kristas words). We saw earlier Eugens dictatorial behavior in his own apartment overlooked by Jesus Christ on a giant crucifix (staunch Catholicism and Nazism are connected historically). Nastiest of all is the icy stare one of Emmis colleagues fixes on Ali when she meets him. She looks at him as a death camp guard might view a Jew about to be exterminated  That woman had death in her eyes, says Ali. Fassbinder is fully aware of the connotations a setting evokes and here nods very firmly towards Sirk. Just as New England is connected with Transcendentalism, so Bavaria is connected with Nazism. There is also a connection between ignorance and xenophobia, and this is underlined throughout in the behavior of all the characters, but especially in the last part of the film as Emmi and Ali start to repress each other. Tellingly there is only one character in the whole film who doesnt object to Emmi and Ali  the son of the landlord named Gruber (Marquard Bhm) and even he is dismissed by Ali as not a nice man early on. All of this exists in stark contrast with Sirks comparatively fun-filled evocation of New England with its cosy Transcendentalist enclave.

Also standing in contrast is the treatment of marriage in both films. Sirk stops short of allowing Cary and Ron to marry. He shows their affair, societys disapproval, Carys learning of Transcendentalist values, societys eventual tacit approval (the doctor, the daughter) and a final commitment to be married in the future. There is every chance their future marriage will be free of prejudice and that everyone will live happily ever after, in other words, marriage is the happy goal of the narrative. Fassbinder goes much deeper with his couple. He has them marry early on so that neighbors, work colleagues, the local shopkeeper, friends and family are confronted with a fait accompli which they all react against with virulent disgust. After a vacation to get away from the ferocious bad-mouthing they return to find the situation changed. Everyone accepts the couple once they realize they can use them to get something for themselves  the neighbors need someone to help move stuff in the basement and so prevail on Ali to help; the racist shopkeeper who had previously refused to serve them now acts with fawning friendliness to regain their custom; the oldest son who kicked in Emmis TV pays for the damage and accepts Ali because he needs Emmi to mind his kid while his wife goes to work; and in a particularly pointed scene Emmis work colleagues start to include her again in reaction to the arrival of a new worker, a gastarbeiter from Yugoslavia who is frozen out in exactly the same way (and in exactly the same camera shot) as Emmi was frozen out earlier. On the surface everything is fine, but underneath the xenophobia continues to seethe unabated. Unfortunately, Emmi allows herself to be bought by the fakeness and even comes to assume some of their racist attitudes. She thinks nothing of showing off Alis muscles to her workmates, defends her colleague who shot Ali an Auschwitz glare and finally resists cooking him couscous when he asks for it  I don't like couscous  why don't you eat German food? While being ostracized she was forced into the role of foreigner because of Ali. Now she is taken back into the fold she regains her German-ness. Most trenchant of all is the scene where Ali returns home drunk and probably suffering from his stomach ulcer. He collapses on the floor before the door of Emmis apartment. Emmi opens the door, watches for a moment and then coldly closes the door without so much as offering a blanket.

Ali also starts to repress Emmi when they return from vacation. His reaction to being refused couscous is to go off with the bar-owner (Barbara Valentin) and when he is humiliated by having to show his muscles he responds by sleeping with the woman and sliding into heavy drinking and gambling. When Emmi is forced to look for him at the garage where he works he laughs along with his colleagues joke that Emmi is his Moroccan grandmother. The couple eventually have a moving reconciliation in the very bar where they met. Both parties are genuinely sorry. He admits his adultery and she forgives him with astonishing generosity. She simply asks that they be nice to each other. At the end it is loneliness they both feel most acutely of all. For Sirk the onus is much more on romantic love in the final scene where Cary cares for Ron and a deer looks in the window behind the bed seeming to inspire Ron into waking up. Loneliness is certainly a big theme of the film, but for Sirk the love story is the thing as per the soapy corn studio remit. For Fassbinder in his final scene the absence of the deer is very telling along with the contrasting words of the two doctors. Rons doctor tells Cary that with plenty of tender loving care Ron will recover, whereas Alis doctor tells Emmi theres no cure for his perforated ulcer. Like other gastarbeiter Ali will recover, but not allowed time to convalesce properly within 6 months he will become sick again and will return and keep returning until he dies. Emmi says she will take care of him and their marriage is still alive, but we aren't convinced their happiness can be lasting even half as much as we are by the corresponding scene in Sirks film.

The success of both films rests on two quite superb narrative structures. In one sense they are very similar in the way they incorporate the traditional 3 acts. In the Sirk Cary and Rons lyrical courtship (act 1) leads into a tempestuous breaking up as all the external pressures take their toll (act 2), and then finally (act 3) to reconciliation courtesy of warmth in key characters and a fortunate accident which wakes Cary up to her senses. In the Fassbinder a speedy courtship between Ali and Emmi (act 1) leads straight into the central marriage where the external pressures take their toll (act 2) and then (act 3) on to a relaxing of this aversion and the marriage beginning to break up from within itself. A reconciliation is reached and sickness brings the couple close together again.

Within the 3-act structures the various scenes dialectically reflect on each other. In the Sirk Cary entertains two suitors in her home, first the family choice Harvey and then Carys choice Ron. There are two party scenes, one depicting the waspish snobbery of the country club and the other depicting the bohemia of the Transcendentalist enclave. A third party has Transcendentalism meet xenophobic materialism where Cary introduces Ron to what until this point has been her social world. The fight that ensues in the long term marks her transition to Transcendentalism, but its delayed by two tearful scenes, first her son strongly objecting to Ron (I think all you see is a good-looking set of muscles, he says vindictively) and then her daughter who is hurt by gossip concerning her mother. There are two scenes with Xmas trees, one on the street where Cary meets Ron and is happy and then one at home where she is alone and miserable because her children have missed their train to come and see her. We notice each act is dominated by visions of Rons old mill. In act 1 its derelict and bare to reflect the inner emotional state of both Cary and Ron. In act 2 it is halfway homely with Ron preparing for Cary and himself to live there. This is the scene where Cary calls off the wedding and the emotional fallout is symbolized by Cary breaking the Wedgwood pot which Ron has so carefully repaired. Then in act 3 when Cary rushes to tend her wounded man we see the house is beautifully restored and waiting to be inhabited by the now ready couple.

In the Fassbinder the dialecticism as per his Brechtian won't is more overt. The film has a cyclical structure framed as it is by two bar scenes in which Ali asks Emmi to dance, she sitting at the same table with the same music playing. There are two scenes in Emmis apartment separated by a temporal ellipse. In the first Ali spends the night with Emmi and in the second the two (having been living together for an unspecified time) are visited by Gruber who thinks Emmi is sub-letting. Her half-joking excuse that Ali is going to marry her leads to a real proposal and the next thing we know they are married. We see Krista and Eugen twice, once before Emmi is married and once to introduce her husband, and we see her son Bruno twice, once at that introduction where he kicks in her TV and then later when he visits to ask Emmi to mind his kid. Indeed, Fassbinder makes societys attack and societys acceptance mirror each other dialectically across the boundary between acts 2 and 3 when they go on vacation. Scenes with the shopkeeper has him attacking and then fawning for their trade, the neighbors attack and then accept, Emmis colleagues first exclude and then include, but only when they find someone else (the Yugoslav gastarbeiter) to exclude. There are two restaurant scenes, one (in Hitlers favorite joint) where they are happy and then one (in a park caf) where they are sad; and there are two breakfast scenes, one where they are happily in love and the other when they are miserable. Ali collapses twice because of his stomach ulcer, the first time Emi coldly ignores him and the second time she reacts with genuine loving concern.

I said Fassbinders Brechtian predilection makes the dialecticism more overt in his film. Actually, the artificiality of structural concerns (the way the narrative develops) is made visual wholly along the lines of Brechts idea (outlined in a 1930 essay) of Epic Theatre, something which contrasts completely with the Dramatic Theatre we see exemplified by Sirks film. In All That Heaven Allows there is a clear plot in which the spectator is implicated in the situation of Cary and Ron. We give in to the sensations that are evoked which involve us in the story of these people. The social critique is suggested so as to preserve our instinctual feelings as we are placed squarely in the middle of the experience. The plot sweeps forward with all eyes on the finish, one scene leading into another with a linear development which mirrors (mimics) natural evolution. All the time we are encouraged to feel as opposed to reason and are eventually fed the happy end we all want and expect. In the Epic Theatre of Fear Eats the Soul plot is exchanged for narrative which turns the spectator into an observer placed outside the story of Emmi and Ali. We are alienated from the narrative so that we are forced to take decisions and judge what we see. Emmi and Ali are objects of an inquiry so that the social critique is placed at the center of the argument, our instinctual feelings are disregarded and our intellectual capacity for action is aroused. The narrative advances in jumps and curves in a series of jarring tableaux with all eyes on the process rather than the finish.

Interestingly, the visual schemes of both films rely on the use of frames within frames, characters always framed within doorways, staircases, arches, through windows, through screens, reflected in mirrors and other reflective surfaces. Sirk and Fassbinder both use these images to voice their social critique, but where Sirk merely suggests his attack (Cary imprisoned behind latticed windows watching carol singers, or trapped as a reflection in her wretched TV screen), Fassbinder states his attack strongly and clearly, his frames actually stopping his film momentarily to force us to think through what we see. As per Dramatic Theatre Sirks frames never impede the onward flow of the mimetic plot, the framing actually aiding the fluidity of the story-telling. A good example comes at the beginning just after Cary is attracted to Ron. She puts a vase of tree cuttings given to her by Ron on her dressing table and regards it, her image captured in a mirror. We sense the romantic attachment continuing on from the previous scene in a smooth transition, but her children enter her room with their reflection in the mirror coming between Cary and the vase. We are given the rationale for the whole film in a single shot, her children (and others) coming between Cary and the man she loves. The seamless storytelling is breathtaking as the film flows swift and true as we are involved completely in Carys situation.

Contrast Sirk with Fassbinder. Early on Emmi is talking to her colleagues in a stairway while they have lunch. She has just spent the night with Ali and is still excited. She tries talking about it, but in code. Ali becomes a foreigner who touches her in the bus on the way to work. This unleashes a ferocious torrent of racist comments from her colleagues which places Emmi in a moral quandary. From the start Fassbinder frames the group in the stair-well which is in turn framed by a window. At the end of the conversation the ladies go back to work and Emmi moves into close-up, the camera dollying in to frame her exactly in the wooden frame of the window. Then Brigitte Mira stops acting and simply freezes in a tableau for about 7 seconds (a long time on film). We register in the conversation that she is thinking about Ali, but with this frozen tableau Fassbinder is asking us to evaluate her emotions and evaluate our emotions to her emotions. These frozen tableaux punctuate the film at regular intervals and is especially interventionist when groups of people stare unnaturally. In the films very first scene the gastarbeiter community all stare at Emmi who has just come into the bar to escape the rain. Emis family all stare at Ali as he is introduced as their new father-in-law. A waiter stares at Emmi and Ali in Hitlers restaurant before the couple stop acting and simply sit there frozen, framed in a doorway. What do we think about them eating here? Most moving of all is the scene in the park caf where the couple are sitting framed by empty tables. It is the films highest point of pathos with Emmi crying at everyone hating them. They declare their love to each other and we are moved, but two things distance us, objectifying our response. First the entire caf staff stand in a group staring at them, and second as Fassbinders camera tracks away, the couple stop acting and freeze again. The frames within frames and the frozen tableaux impede the natural flow of the narrative, making us aware that we are watching a film, not real life. Fassbinder factors in two other distancing devices  the unlikely notion of a 60 year old ex-Nazi party member marrying a 38 year old black Arab, and the casting of two not exactly beautiful actors in the main roles. Sirk follows convention in making his couple younger and using popular good-looking stars who have faces which have screen charisma. But what we see in Fear Eats the Soul is much closer to real life. The constant distancing paradoxically brings us closer to the central characters, especially when they played as marvelously as they are by Brigitte Mira and El Hedi ben Salem. Mira in particular lights up the screen with an inner luminosity which is truly touching.

The acting for Sirk is equally accomplished within the set limits of 50s melodrama. Wyman and Hudson give identical performances to those they gave in Magnificent Obsession  thats what audiences wanted and thats what they got (so goes commercial studio logic!). In essence, Sirks film is pure Hollywood melodrama in which repression and suffering gives way in the end to a higher, more lasting peace. Fassbinder realized the falsity of this notion. While society is divided by class and dependent on the exploitation of one group by another, lasting peace is impossible. So what he does in Fear Eats the Soul (and in virtually every subsequent film right through to Veronika Voss [1982]) is he uses melodrama to suck the spectator in, offers them gratification on a certain level (Fear Eats the Soul is one of cinemas supremely eloquent love stories, let us be clear about that), but constantly punctures this comfort with his alienation devices which force us to stand back and assess the emotions of the characters and our reaction to these emotions. Sirk realized the falsity of the melodrama he was forced to make (after all he had originally wanted Ron to die at the end), but ultimately he had to operate under studio constraints. Both films under discussion are quite simply the best prevailing conditions would allow and are both masterpieces of their type.",1510704000,,29760,4.806873657488771

7813042,5,6301599918,"I've seen most of Fassbinder's films.  I would agree with critical consensus that this one's at the top of the pack, and that it's an entertaining film.

The story's not terribly pointed, but the writer/director's empathy with his characters, and his ability to put their point of view across, is masterful.  This is high art, delivered in a melodramatic format, at a low budget.  It's guerilla filmmaking at its finest.",1402963200,2,420,4.957142857142857
7813043,5,6301599918,"1974 was a pretty great year for Rainer Werner Fassbinder.  He released three pretty diverse films that showed off his talents in different angles and really helped to create a rather vivid portrait of who he was as a director.  Ali: Fear Eats the Soul was his most intimate and ultimately most effective films released that year.  Telling the story of an older German woman, Emmi, who falls in love with a younger Arab during a time when it was socially thought to be in poor taste, Ali: Fear Eats the Soul is a stirring social commentary that builds strong characters and leaves a lasting impression on the audience.  Emmi is immediately abandoned by those supposedly close to her, even chastised and treated as a sinner, but she is determined to be happy in her relationship, even when that relationship is difficult.  Both Emmi and Ali find themselves separated not only by the judgmental eyes around them but also by their own social and racial differences, and soon they are fraying.  This is a sharp look at racism but also at the human desire for happiness and the lengths one will go to avoid the loneliness and fear that eats the soul.",1388707200,2,1145,4.643564356435643
7813044,5,6301599918,"This is my favorite of all the Fassbinder films I have seen thus far. It is the story of an older woman named Emmi played by Brigette Mira. I would guess she is around 60 yrs. old. Emmi falls in love for a much younger Moroccan man nicknamed Ali, (El Hedi ben Salem). They meet one rainy night in small bar after Ali's friends dare him to ask her to dance. They end up spending the night together and find they are very comfortable and happy as a couple. They compliment each other and are truly soul mates in a harsh world full of gossip and ethnic tensions. Everyone around them includeing their friends, family, and colleagues are shocked and disgusted when they marry. Although this film is heralded as a melodrama, closely resembling the melodramas of Douglas Sirk, I looked at the film as more of a societal look at an unconvential relationship whose bond of love was much stronger than any rules of marital, societal or so called moral convention could break. The acting, the directing, and in particular the symbolism of each scene are astonishingly powerful. I have seen this film three times now and each time my awareness of the subtle and not so subtle undertones of the film become more vivid and impressive. Two scenes in particular stand out. First, the scene which takes place in one of Hitlers old favorite restaurants, which Emmi takes Ali to celebrate after they get married. The true naivete of Emmis character stands out and we begin to see the contradictions in her nature and it gives us a glimpse as to the contradictions of post-war German society. Second, the scene in a park of yellow tables where Emmi finally breaks down from all hostility that has been aimed at her since they first became a couple. Beautifully filmed with a wonderfully powerful performance by Ms. Mira. The plot is simple yet the relationship between the two main characters is complex and profound. If you haven't seen any Fassbinder films yet this is a great one to start with.",1351555200,,1978,4.654285714285714
