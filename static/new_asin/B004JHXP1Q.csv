8431874,1,B004JHXP1Q,why would you buy this,1509667200,,22,3.6
8431875,5,B004JHXP1Q,"Like the previous reviewer stated all of this is in Japanese but what he or she misstated was this is just a Japanese import which can be purchased at a much lower price from other sites or stores that cater to foreign films in this case Japanese LOL! Near $600? Only a moron would pay price, no offense if that other reviewer or if anyone else did. I'm 3rd Gen Japanese American and can speak,read and write in Japanese so a set like this is no problem for me nor my family as I taught or had all my kids learn Japanese, my wife is also from Japan. Of course the name I use on Amazon is not Japanese (I get this a lot from rude or unstable people) it's of course fake, a practice I think everyone should do btw.

Anyway there is NO dubbed or subbed version of this series (In fact most Anime are not western friendly EG: no English versions in fact only a fraction Anime is translated or sold in western or US versions) and bear in mind its pretty old and hard to find as like anything, the Anime world moves very fast so even the Japanese versions are getting hard to find. I'm no Otatku but I do collect amongst many other things and hobbies, Anime and Manga and have so for decades. This set being an import should not cost you any more than a $100 I paid $60 at my usual longtime anime shop. I don't list links as Amazon doesn't seem to like that. But go visit some anime forums etc and most there will help you out. Also try Comic Com etc its like the E3 or CES of Anime and comics etc.

Also the previous reviewer is also incorrect on many points the game was made after the Tv series not before it has NOTHING to do with WWII, Nazi's or other such things. Why that other reviewer mentioned Schindler's list or the Jews is beyond me. I can see the Darcsen story being a very remote resemblance but not to me, it resembles the disgraceful incarcerations of Japanese Americans during WWII. I've had family in many of those concentration camps. But proudly also had 3 relatives (since passed) who fought,wounded and decorated during WW2 fighting for their right to be treated as equal Americans. From then on many of my family have been in the military and LE. Those in the military have fought in ever major and minor war since, my dad in Korea, cousins in Vietnam (lost one there in fact), Panama,Somalia and other horrible places. We even have relatives defending us right now in Iraq and Afghanistan. Sorry I'm getting off base here. I'm also a Federal LEO/Pilot for a Govt LE agency which for privacy reasons I can't say which. But my point is the reason why the US is powerful and is one of the greatest country's on earth is mainly because our country is made up of different ethnicity's. Well that's my opinion on comparing this cartoon with real life history. I just get heated at times as I hate politics and religion 2 of the major causes of wars.

Anyway back to VC no offense but easy to tell the other reviewer aka he or she is not of Japanese decent, this amine series is an alternate reality world based series which many anime series are based on. Imo it mirrors star wars more than anything imo. Regarding the game many of the Japanese voice actors reprise their roles in the game btw which also holds the world record for most RPG's sold on the PS3 so the game speaks for it's self and please use the original voices and subtitles if you're not a Japanese speaker its way better than any dub the subs may not be all that close as the majority of Japanese words do not translate direct to English hence why even subs that come with official films are way off the original language. In fact to a Japanese speaker the subs are quite laughable as many change the story at times. But I guess its the best thing next to learning a new language. The series and game are highly recommended if your a fan. My comment really isn't a review but just some advice and some off topic rants but hope it helps as I at least talked about the pricing and language issues and some hints on where to look for it right? lol. Btw I don't even play console games. My daughters love anime and this series. My hobbies are flying, car's (911 Porsche's),gun collecting,Anime, comics and building high powered PC's and NO I'm not showing off and hate those that do just saying what I or we like to do that's all. Yup even tho were very busy like any other family, we are very much into having fun and living life to its fullest and we all love anime. opps sorry going off topic again. :)

So do NOT pay more than $60+ for this or any box set use a Japanese site or store. Near $600 new or $300 used, man still can't believe the crooks they have online Ebay, Craig's list all the same.

Anyway like the title states look for it at Japanese movie or item shops or even Amazon Japan etc which we use all equally as well. It's near 5 years since its original release, in the Anime world its pretty much over with so don't expect any future releases. Lastly I of course have family in Japan some of which work in the industry and word was they were trying to get funding for a 2nd series but its been over 4yrs so guess it didn't pan out. Same as Cat S*** One (no joke true title) they lost funding as well so we only got the pilot.",1382054400,8,5222,4.249496981891348
8431876,5,B004JHXP1Q,"First, a warning, this Blu-ray set doesn't come with English Subtitles.  But I sure wish it did.

This anime is adapted from the PS3 classic of the same name and is a rarity among video game adaptations in that it actually surpasses its source material to become a good story in its own right.  It's streaming on Crackle until the first of July, (Edit, the show is still available on Crackle), so get on over there before it's gone, because who knows when these American shores will be blessed with a good subtitled, or dubbed release.

Still with me? I first saw this title in 2009 and thought it would be an instant shoo in for Funimation since it has all the hallmarks of a Trigun, or Cowboy Bebop hit.
1) Non-Japanese names; check
2) Psuedo-european fantasy setting; check
3) Exciting action and plot reveals; check

The most unique distinction of Valkyria Chronicles is its gently told, historically derived theme of racial prejudice that revolves around something called the Darcsen Calamity.  This story element draws upon World War II history involving Jews and Nazis.  This is no Schindler's list, but the effectiveness of its drama is not lessened for lack of brutality.

If you are looking for a first rate title like Trigun, but want something less mainstream I can't offer a better alternative.  This little gem is still waiting for a licensor, but that's no reason for it not to find a warm place in your heart.",1371772800,5,1425,4.713709677419355
