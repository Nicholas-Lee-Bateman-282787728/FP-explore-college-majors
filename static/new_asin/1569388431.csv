That's right.  I genuinely thought I would vomit.

I was laughing that hard.

Yes.  The editing could've been better.  Yes, it's missing some A-list talent.  Even so, I spent more than half of the movie actively laughing.  Maybe it's that I'm 22 and enjoy vulgar humor.

If you don't enjoy vulgar humor, don't watch the condemned movie, and spare me the fornicating sanctimony.

It's as vulgar as advertised.  YOU HAD TO KNOW IT WAS COMING.

Even so, I thought it was quite funny and interesting.  As mentioned by others, Drew Carey's ""punchline to the punchline"" is enjoyable.  Gilbert Gottfried is as funny explaining some of the physical mechanics of another comedian's telling as he is telling it himself.  Seeing Bob Saget tell it was a priceless contrast--his image and the images he evoked.

Regardless--if you can handle the content and enjoy offensive humor, it's as good as (or better than) you likely expect.

If you don't like that stuff--clearly not the choice for you.",1137715200,19,1020,4.905882352941177
187770,4,1569388431,"This movie is extremely difficult to review because of most people think it is. Most people think this is a movie about a very, very, very dirty joke. That it's a barrage of profanity that only the immature would find funny, but it's far from that. You will get 20-30 minutes of comedians telling parts of the joke, followed by 10-20 minutes of analysis from comedians about the joke.

Other reviewers say they've walked out of this because of the obscenity, and certainly that's true. If you are easily offended or don't like crude language, this movie is NOT for you. You'll never make it past all the obscenity to truly see the movie.

If you are looking for a movie that'll have you rolling in the aisles, this movie is NOT for you. As one of the comedians in the movie note, the joke ""The Aristocrats"" is a joke that no respectable comedian would tell. The joke is so predictable, the punchline so obvious (and well known), that it's a bad joke.

What this movie IS, is a documentary. It's about how comedians keep each other amused with this joke.  Indeed more than a few comedians in this film talk about groups of comedians in hours-long sessions doing this joke, one upping each other. It's about how the joke has evolved over time and how its obscenity and bad taste has also evolved. It's about how this joke is adapted by different people for their audience.

And that is why this movie is so difficult to review. It's not what most people think it is. It is a documentary about one joke and how and why it's so vile.",1137542400,11,1529,4.446428571428571

187772,5,1569388431,"I like this film for what it says about free speech and the face/state of comedy in America.

By any measure the language is rough and the joke appalling, but only if you think of this as something *other than* comedy one-upmanship. My only complaint with the film is that it wasn't long enough and some comics were just face time (like Jon Stewart and Chris Rock). Here's my highlight reel:

BEST DELIVERY Martin Mull, laid back and hilarious. Taylor Kegan, smooth and articulate.

DADS TALKING DIRTY: Andy Richter and Doug Stanhope with their infant sons. Funny and freakishly disturbing.

MOST OBNOXIOUS: Mario Cantone, Andy Dick

VETERAN GREATS: Jay Marshall (who also has a terrific joke in the end credits) and Pat Cooper, the misanthrope.

COSMIC COMIC CHICKS: Carrie Fisher, Sarah Silverman, Wendy Liebman

NICE TOUCHES: The Joe Franklin-Sarah Silverman ""relationship""; the very last comic in the end credits (can't say who he/she is, or I'd spoil it for you); comments by journalist Frank DiGiacomo; all the extra goodies on the DVD version.

187773,5,1569388431,"I saw this film at a college theater in Ann Arbor, because I knew it would never come to the area where I live. It is the funniest and filthiest documentary ever made, about the funniest and filthiest joke ever told. One hundred comedians either tell the joke or comment on it or both. It's been an ""in-thing"" among comedians for years, and now at last it's out there for all to see. If your tolerance for scatalogical, sick, perverted humor is not high, don't even try to see it. It takes a strong stomach to listen to the joke as it becomes ever more depraved, but if you can take it, your sides will ache from laughter before it's over.",1131667200,44,639,4.289256198347108
187774,3,1569388431,"The Aristocrats is THE comics' insider joke, not really meant for public consumption. It's been around for about 70 years, since the vaudeville and burlesque days.

The Aristocrats joke has a structure, just like knock-knock jokes have a structure. The joke begins with an elaborate description of a new showbiz act, and concludes, at the punchline, with the name of the act, ""The Aristocrats."" As in any good joke, the bigger the surprise at the punchline, the funnier it is. So the comics' challenge is to vividly describe a showbiz act outrageously at odds with the ""aristocratic"" name of the act.

Of course, half of the art of joke telling is in the telling itself. To achieve the desired effect, most comics rely on deviant scatological and sexual references. No doubt some viewers may feel offended by the hard-hitting humor of this film; it is not for the squeamish.

Though the Aristocrats is brutally entertaining, it could have been better. I would have loved to see how this joke has evolved over the past seven decades. Doing so would tell me something about the history of what we find offensive and repulsive. This film gives us only modern versions of the joke, and half of them are mediocre. Also, there is a notable lack of many top comic performers. Were top performers asked to participate in this film, and did they refuse, perhaps fearing negative repercussions to their careers? However, many of the lesser-known comics are very talented. And then, there were some comics who seemed not to add anything, such as Phyllis Diller and, oddly enough, Chris Rock. Anyway, for all its unevenness and bizarre subject matter, this film is a humorous glimpse at human depravity.",1128211200,,1691,4.885017421602788

187788,5,1569388431,"VERY FUNNY DOCUMENTARY

First off, if ANYTHING offends you, skip The Aristocrats. Just skip it. Save yourself, and the internet, your misery.

Basically this is a documentary about an inside joke among professional comedians. This group tends to be a dirty minded group to start with, and this joke is an inside thing among them to see who can make another comedian cringe. It's the professional comedians' version of ""Hey, smell how bad this rotten milk smells!"" where you see which of your friends can take the biggest whiff without cringing.

The joke is always formatted roughly the same way, but the details change to make it as gross/disgusting/offensive as is humanly possible. The punch line isn't funny. It's the journey of the joke itself that's funny. It's all about ""Oh man I can't believe he added THAT element to the set up! Not about grandma!""

I saw this in the theater (thank goodness for art house theaters that show indie documentaries like this) and about 10 people got up and walked out. That's how filthy this movie is. I mean FILTHY.

The movie really isn't about the joke itself. It's about the relationship professional comedians have with each other. They go on stage and try to walk the line between controversial and funny and push the limits of acceptable taste. That's their job. So when they are trying to make each other laugh/cringe they have to REALLY up the ante in order to have an affect on other comedians. That's what this movie is all about.

187808,3,1569388431,"I first heard the joke about ""the Aristocrats"" watching the DVD ""Gilbert Gottfried: Dirty Jokes"".  I had already heard of this movie, and decided to give it a try.  Can you make a good, full-length movie involving about 100 comedians, all discussing or performing the SAME (LONG) joke?  Well, almost.  FIrst: more than half the movie involves comedians reflecting, each in their own way, about the MEANING of the joke; WHY they think it's funny (or sometimes, not); how they APPROACH TELLING the joke, the HISTORY of the joke; the endless VARIATIONS the joke allows; what the variations say about THE PERSON telling the joke, and so on.  Sometimes, comedians discussing what makes something funny is futile or boring.  In this case, I had to say it was often illuminating.  Fortunately little time was spent on comedians ACTUALLY telling the joke (good thing too...a lot of the time they'd start to tell it, but never even finish for one reason or another).
Some of them mentioned the best telling of the joke they ever heard was Gilbert Gottfried at a roast for Hugh Hefner in NYC, not long after the twin trade tower attacks.  Shortly before the joke, he tried to tell a joke involving using the Empire State Building as a reference point for a flight.  The audience had a negative reaction: some groaned and somebody yelled, ""too soon!""  This was so recent, nobody had yet dared to incorporate it into a joke.  So Gottfried immediately dropped that, and launched into his version of ""The Aristocrats"".  His delivery was so funny that he literally had some of the audience fallilng off their chairs laughing, or unable to catch their breath with tears streaming down their cheeks.  Great recovery and a smash success.
It illustrates some things about this joke in particular and also jokes in general.  They tend to make fun of things that are inherently, at least to some degree, painful or uncomfortable.  Easier when the painful was experienced mainly by yourself; more dangerous when it relates to other people too.  The teller has to know how far he or she can push the limits of a comfort zone, without the audience turning from amused to disgusted or angered.
One reason I love Gottfried's style is that he's able to describe the most graphic, potentially disgusting things almost like an insurance agent trying to sell you a policy.  Both the incongruity of this, and the de-fanging of some of the offensiveness, (plus his expressions, the very sound of his voice, his gesturing, all of which make him funny for those who appreciate his style) are put to full use with the joke.
You want to hear the joke told well?  Watch Gilbert Gottfried: Dirty Jokes.  I don't think it's exactly the Hugh Hefner roast, but it's very funny.  You want to hear an intelligent discussion of jokes by comedians, then watch ""The Aristocrats"".",1395792000,2,2833,4.802061855670103

The funny part of a Shaggy Dog story is watching someone squirm who thinks it is a normal joke. The more you can make a (in this case) prude squirm the funnier the raunch is.

The funniest scene in the movie is Gilbert Gottfried's masterful and legendary telling of the joke at the Fryers Club soon after 9/11. What makes it funny is watching a surprising prudish and confused Hugh Hefner's reaction listening to the joke. (The exact performance would not be as funny if Larry Flynt for example was on the dais. And the filmed performance wouldn't work had not Hefner not been shown in frame.) The Gottfried performance comes late in the film and we are treated to dozens of top comedians wasted telling the same joke sans victim. Moreover, since the audience by this time is intimately familiar with the mechanics of the magic this is true tedium. In addition, most of the comedians telling the joke do so to the camera with no audience in sight. There is an actual reason that most comedy routines are in a concert film style performance before a live audience.

There is a lot of top-flight talent here. Drew Carey, Robin Williams, George Carlin among others yet it is a mime (Steven Banks) that tells the joke most creativity and Bob Saget who tells the most disgusting version. Honestly, the film shoots its um... Gun much too soon in the feature and nothing removes humor from something faster than explaining it.

I mean, some of the jokes are so horrific, I felt so utterly disgusting for even allowing myself to laugh. There just isn't enough forgiveness in heaven for what I've heard. Literally, people were squirming in their seats at the hundreds of awkward moments. If there's any topic or sexual act considered taboo, prepare to have it raunchily discussed in agonizing details because well, that's the objective of the joke. I've heard some pretty nasty things in my time, and don't get shocked too often, but this is comedic naughtiness taken to serious extremes. If you can find it in you to watch this, there are, believe it or not, really good reasons to watch this film.
  First, seeing movies nowadays, at least for me, is kind of a bore. The same ole' stock characters-love triangles-talking dogs-Jerry Bruckheimer go boom-saving the world-USA rules-type films are getting so hatefully boring. This movie is a welcome relief. After seeing it, I think you'll agree, it's exciting because it's premise is incredibly original.
  Secondly, there's over 100 of todays' BEST comedians participating in this dirty improv marathon. What's great is that you get to see each comic take a spin on this underground joke, but still keep their comedic essence. Some of the best to watch out for are Sarah Silverman, Bob Saget, Gilbert Gottfried, and one of my favorites, Kevin Pollak.
  Lastly, not only will certain visuals have you rolling, but it's very interesting to see comics use some of our most terrible recent tragedies and dare to include them in their jokes. I mean, have you ever thought 9/11 could be funny? Superficially, it's mostly for pure shock value, it's supposed to be, but there are certain points in the film where it's also therapeutic.
  This film is amazing to not only track down over 100 comics and expertly pick the choiciest parts of their rendition of this heinous joke, but just the editing alone must've been a monumental feat. It could've been a comic itself, it had impeccable timing.

187876,5,1569388431,"My husband and I watched ""The Aristocrats,"" he with a faint smile, me howling. That is, until ""Billy the Mime"" came on, when he began laughing uproariously, and I almost passed out from hysterics.

Up to that point, I was laughing away at pretty much everyone, while he shook his head and announced that this was ""white"" humor.

""It's not white humor,"" I replied. ""It's Jewish humor. Or even more precisely, Jewish show-biz humor."" Which means, once we return to basics, that ""The Aristocrats"" is the most American of American humor.

""The Aristocrats"" is not for everyone, but if it's right for you, it's a howler from beginning to end, as are the out-takes, and even the voice-over extras. Some have noted that ""The Aristocrats"" is not for those who dislike foul language. Let me be more precise.  I dislike foul language for its own sake, employed simply to be coarse and vulgar. I find foul language should be reserved for (a) when a hammer hits your finger (b) when comedians at the top of their game know EXACTLY when to use vulgarity, without a single wasted, gratuitous, Def Comedy Jam ""F bomb"" dropped.

What is amazing about ""The Aristocrats"" is how perfect the comedians' pitch is  in their retelling of the vulgar joke -- this is a lot of Miles Davis virtuosity and very little Kenny G.

In addition to ""Billy the Mime,"" my other favorites were Sarah Silverman and the guys who tell ""the Aristocrats!"" joke as Christopher Walken (Kevin Pollack) and Liza Minelli (Mario Cantone).

Taylor Negron was mesmerizing and daring.

Kudos to the ventriloquist, the fire jugglers, the card-trick guy, and Matt and Trey of South Park for finding non-linear new ways to present the joke.

God bless Tom and Dick Smothers, Carrie Fisher, and Drew Carey, for being quietly flawless with the joke and good sports about not taking their clean images too seriously.

That ""The Aristocrats"" is at times poorly shot only adds to its charm and authenticity. The editing is at times inspired in the interweaving of the performances, and at times less so.

One quibble -- the editors could have killed the interviews with Eddie Izzard, Bily Connolly and Eric Idle, maybe even Chris Rock, and taken Merrill Markoe's entire joke unedited off the DVD extras and into the main DVD -- that's if they DARED!",1170806400,8,2290,4.784263959390863
187877,4,1569388431,"The entire film deals with various comedians relating their own similar versions of a ribald joke involving scat, incest, urolagnia, bestiality, and sexual mutilation, obviously intended to be as shocking as can be, for entertainment purposes, and not necessarily advocating such activity; although it is questionable with a couple of these comedians, especially Bob Saget.

Anyhow, 'the joke' has been circling in the underground with comedians for years, seeing who can out-shock the other, in a ""gross-out contest""-type of dynamic, that is all. Although given the times, it could foressably be updated to include a more relevant punchline for maximum effect; however, the motion contributed by Drew Carey actually carries some weight, and without this crucial gesticulation, the other comedians' deliveries fall rather flat.

'The joke' depends upon a stark contrast of terminology and scenario between the story and punchline, whose roles can actually be reversed as well. It depends upon extreme bad taste, and is ultimately peurile in its purported 'sophomoric' comedy.

Interesting to note, is that the music industry has been doing this for years to gain notoriety, particularly in the 'Heavy & Death' Metal genre - that is, being as shocking as possible both to gain attention as well as perhaps shatter cherished taboos. Howard Stern has also been doing this type of schtick, to great results for him.

The herd love crass humor, considering the popularity of trashy icons pervasive nowadays, being that the majority of them remain in a high school mentality, largely conducting themselves with embarrassing immaturity, though justified with mutual acceptance; and thus, the success of ""hack"" comedy.

As to the title of the film, also noted is the herd's penchant to ridicule the wealthy, the intelligent, and the eccentric, which is obviously a reaction to their own feelings of inferiority, fear, and resentment since their peasant origins, which is altogether amusing to those who have these qualities, as well as lends a perspective of stratification. The very fact that this 'joke' exists is testament to that stratification.

The film can be amusing for its base descriptions, as in ""how low can you go..."", and largely depends upon the imagination of the individual comedian, as well as its delivery, most evident with Gilbert Gottfried's performance and Bob Saget's elaborations. It is asserted that much can be divulged about a person's character by the type of entertainment enjoyed, as well as the types of icons they are attracted towards.",1169942400,3,2562,5.31358024691358

187880,1,1569388431,"As someone who grew up in a house with a razor strap hung on the wall, it is quite possible that jokes about child abuse might resonate in another way. Take, for example, Gilbert Gottfried's casual reference to ""child fisting""...as someone who now works with children who have been sexually abused, I can assure you that this type of violation of infants and children by family members does indeed happen. And forcibly inserting an adult's clenched fist into either a child's rectum or vagina creates an amazing amount of trauma, both psychological and physical. For example - because the orifice of the child is too small to accommodate the object (in this case, a fist), the tissues usually tear, and there is often a tremendous amount of bruising and bleeding (yes indeed, Gottfried, as the movie said... ""there will be blood""). The victim is then violated in two senses - physically, and also psychologically, because this has happened by someone the child trusted. Children who have experienced this type of abuse have a much harder time making safe connections with adults later, and often become violent themselves. Feeling uncomfortable yet??

You can't just ""casually"" toss off these jokes and not consider the pain that they might cause to the unwitting. I can see the appeal of this type of humor to a very (VERY) select audience - but packaging the DVD in a lighthearted way with a cute dog and abstract references to ""dirty jokes"" is simply not fair. I suspect that most of the comedians featured in The Aristocrats have had very little exposure to the true outcomes, messiness, and extreme complications of sexual abuse - or they have been abused themselves and are working it out in a subversive way through their humor. This is an extremely blue movie, and a day later, I still have tears in my eyes thinking about photographs I have seen of the physically abused and the poignant stories they have told me...",1164412800,12,1925,4.833333333333333
187881,2,1569388431,"This movie is not offensive- at least not in the way the producers want it to be.  Most of us have an ""anything goes"" attitude towards entertainment these days, and accordingly, broadcasting something as ""OFFENSIVE!"" has just become a tired combination of marketing device and transparent attempt to appear a First Amendment champion.  Continued use of profanity and bathroom humor isn't all that funny if you're older than 13- it's initially kind of amusing, then puerile, then pathetic.  Comics tend to be attention-starved anyway, and therefore take any joke further and longer than you or I would care to see.  Case in point: The Aristocrats.

That aside, I wanted to like this movie.  I loved the premise, that telling a joke is like jazz, in that plenty of artists repeat the same material, but with their own interpretation.  It's the singer (comedian) that resonates, not the song (joke).  However, this film is a one trick pony that long outlives its clever foundation.  I also had a hard time believing that these guys found the joke all that funny themselves; most of the onscreen laughs were due to the chemistry between these old friends, and the audience isn't really a part of the joke a lot of the time.

The film's novelties provide the most entertaining moments: Kevin Pollack's Christopher Walken imitation, Billy the Mime, Taylor Negron's gay rendition, and a magician who tells the joke via a card trick.  George Carlin was really the only comic who made me laugh with his version of a strict telling of the joke.  On top of everything else, I found the jarring, MTV-style editing and quick camera switches made The Aristocrats even tougher to watch.

While we're on the subject, is there anyone worse than Bob Saget?  He can swear as much as he wants, and he's still every bit as annoying and unfunny as when he hosted America's Funniest Videos.  Impossibly, he's even less funny when profane.",1163548800,9,1915,4.849230769230769

Well, I'm not sure quite how they've accomplished it, but ""The Aristocrats,"" for all its high-priced comic talent, is one seriously unfunny movie.

The film is built around a supposedly classic joke involving an agent who walks into a producer`s office, declares ""Have I got an act for you!"" and then proceeds to describe that act in terms so lurid that even a convention of Satan-worshipping sailors might have trouble booking it for one of their programs.  When the agent finally finishes his description, the producer asks ""What's the act called?,"" a query which is always followed by the response, ""the aristocrats.""  The object of the joke is for the teller to be as offensive, disgusting and perverted as possible in the lead up to the punch line.  Routinely, the subject matter involves incest, bestiality, pedophilia, violence, urination, defecation and a whole host of other topics not normally broached in polite society.  In what amounts to a talking-heads documentary, ""The Aristocrats"" basically consists of all these great comics running their own variations on this one joke while discussing the iconoclastic function of humor and providing an occasional backstage glimpse into the art of joke telling (I guess that`s where the ""redeeming social value"" aspect comes in).

The main problem with the movie is not that it is crude, vulgar and disgusting per se, but that it is crude, vulgar and disgusting without being funny.  In fact, after the umpteenth take on the same routine, we sink into a kind of humor-deprived stupor that lasts for almost a full ninety minutes.

The comedians, however, are funny.

This might have worked better if it had been shorter.  There was a point when I just got too trashed out on the vulgarities by everyone to care what this movie was saying.  Kind of like the first episode of HBO's ""Deadwoood"" series: bad language eventually not only loses all effect, it also erodes any meaning.

It had its moments.  I laughed at the ventriliquist constantly abused by his foul-mouthed puppet.  The gay-looking dude doing his take on Liza Minelli was funny.  The Gilbert Gotfried segment actually made that joke funny...one out of a hundred...?

187894,5,1569388431,"The Aristocrats is a hilarious, wildly irreverent documentary centering on a host of mostly famous and infamous comedians telling their own versions of the oldest, most repugnant vaudeville joke in the world. This joke always has the same opening (a guy with a new act goes to a talent agent's office...) and the punchline is always ""the Aristocrats!"" - with that punchline being conveyed almost every time with a ""ta-daa!"" flair. The punchline itself isn't important - it's the journey leading up to it. Now, what happens in between the set-up and the punchline is entirely at the discretion of the  narrator. The middle portion is what makes the joke so mind-bogglingly risque, as the comics riff and vie to drop in the most outrageous of details, ranging from graphically sexual in nature, to scatological, to gruesomely (even disturbingly) violent, to adding elements of bestiality, to just plain outre. There's a free-wheeling, jazzy feel inherent in the film as the joke tellers seem to yank stuff from the stream of consciousness in their various impromptu depictions of the joke. So when is a film too offensive? I'm not sure sometimes. I'm not sure that the omnipresent bad taste in this film isn't actually superceded by a form of overriding artistry.

When I was in the movie theatre watching the Aristocrats, I noticed two things. One, there were people who gasped and then  stormed out in disgust. Two, there were people who gasped and then stayed, but not necessarily in their seats (some were standing or rolling around in laughter). I stayed. My outraged older co-worker stalked out (and probably took a cab home; I was his ride). I gotta admit I thought I knew what I was in for, but I was unprepared for the rancid verbal assault that spewed on me from the screen. To say this film is irreverent is to probably understate things. This has got to be, bar none, the filthiest film I have ever heard. I was in shock, yet I couldn't stop laughing.

Like someone already mentioned, as the film progresses, the constant onslaught and repetition of the joke begin to prey on one's mind, leaving one numb and inured. Fortunately, there are enough funnymen who ""cover"" the joke in hilarious and inimitably personal fashion to ease the sensory overload and to break the monotony threatening to wash over the audience.

The ones who made me laugh most were: Otto & George (the guy with the profane puppet); Wendy Liebman and her ""wholesome"" rendition; Martin Mull, with his non sequitur version; Kevin Pollak, telling it as Christopher Walken; Jon Ross, he of the flexed rubber grin; Eric Mead, the card-dealing comic; Billy the Mime; Bob Saget, with his gut-busting delivery just prior to going on stage (I knew Saget was depraved, but Holy Crap! And yes, HIS was my favorite); the animated kids from South Park; and the sexy and irreverent Sarah Silverman. Noteworthy is Gilbert Gottfried's version, which he busted out during the Friar's Roast of Hugh Hefner when his 9-11 joke tanked. Thus far, Gottfried's version is lauded as the best retelling of the Joke.

I'm giving the Aristocrats 4 and a half stars because of its daring, its unapologetic political incorrectness. and its vulgar but undeniably frequent laugh-out-loud hilarity. It's worth the price of admission just to witness old-school and currently ""it"" comics getting shockingly dirty and earthy. I can't give it five stars because not all the comics were amusing.  Some - like Stephen Wright, David Brenner, Hank Azaria, Howie Mandel and Carrie Fisher - even went as far as to leave me cold, blank-faced and even bored. Other plodding moments have to do with several talking heads waxing philosophical about the nature of - or being long-winded with their analysis of - the Joke.

But I heartily recommend the Aristocrats, which ultimately is about the pure catharsis and saving grace of humor. But buyer beware: only those with strong intestinal fortitude should take a peek at this documentary.",1154822400,5,3971,4.925261584454409
187895,5,1569388431,"Nothing is further from the truth than the subtitle ending the film: ""Keep the joke alive. All you have to remember is one word.""  I've never cared much for heavily front-loaded, epic-length jokes, both because I fear that I won't get the punchline when/if it comes and because I'm envious of talented tellers, aware that at best I'm good for no more than a one-liner.  At one point, the joke that's the object of the film is compared to a John Coltrane solo.  Right on!  Most of the performers in this film are Improvisers Supreme, playing on a riff, going where angels fear to tread.

The stand-outs are Carlin (he's always good, but I previously never realized how spontaneously good he can be), Saget (he shows his dedication to, and sheer love of, the art by going on in spite of himself), and the show-stopper, Gilbert Gottfried.  By all means, don't give up on the film until Gottfried's climactic performance.  Like the joke itself, the film justifies itself at that moment.  As told by Gottfried, the joke is every bit as filthy, perverse, and obscene--but it's no longer offensive!  At that moment we are not merely a peverse, dysfunctional family but a human community, united by the capacity for thinking the worst (otherwise the possibility of being offended by this movie wouldn't exist) but also for daring to make the best out of the worst.  We're God's fallen angels, still redeemable because we're not too proud to acknowledge the body fluids that make up at least part of the spirit incarnate.  Rising from the muck, we are true Aristrocrats in the Almighty's eyes.  And if there's a more powerful example of Grace, I can't imagine what it could be.

Credit must be given to Fred Willard for observing that words like ""The Sophisticates"" or ""The Royalty"" would ruin the joke.  The family act that calls themselves ""The Aristocrats"" does so in a spirit of unknowing humility and hope: they're not trying to be merely ""funny.""

Also, take note of the performer who near the end observes that the joke may soon be out of favor because all of these once unmentionable obscenities are now everyday stuff.  Forget the humor: ""real"" Aristocrat acts can be downloaded from all over the internet, which leaves ethnicity, race and gender--i.e. the politically incorrect--as the last off-limits frontier.

187901,4,1569388431,"Since the dawn of mankind, comedians both famous and obscure, have been telling the story of the ""Aristocrats""; a joke which generally begins with the phrase ""A guy walks into a talent agent's office"" and ends with the punchline 'THE ARISOCRATS'!

What is said between the opening phrase and the punchline is left up to the sensibility of the individual comic--in most cases, it is an amalgam of incest, sodomy, and bestiality mixed with the constant flowing of various bodily fluids.

For this documentary, stand up comic Paul Provenza and Penn Jilette of Penn and Teller have assembled 100 comics from different generations (Robin Williams, Whoopi Goldberg, Bob Saget, Drew Carey et al) while the old guard is represented by Phyllis Diller, Chuck Mc Cann and who can ever forget the great Professor Irwin Corey? (""....and Furthermore....!"") to have a go at it...

Some do it fairly straight, while others perform variations, yet others do it by NOT doing it (Jon Stewart).

Obviosuly the results are mixed, ranging from simply repulsive to laugh out loud, the centerpiece being Gilbert Gottfried's definitive reading during a roast for Hugh Hefner a few weeks after 9.11...

Among the standout moments: Hank Azaria with a pseudo Eastern European accent; Bob Saget, who is able to get more objectionable material into a sentence than anyone else; Kevin Pollack who does

an incredible turn as told through the voice of Christopher Walken (!) and Robin Williams and Drew Carey who tell the same joke about a cocktail bar piano player with a penchant for inventing obscene titles for his musical compositions.

The DVD includes many moments deleted from the theatrical release and a absolutely hilarious special feature in which some of the comics such as George Carlin and Paul Reiser tell their favorite jokes (Reiser's will have you in tears).

""The Atristocrats"" is an amazingly hip, original, entertaining piece of work, though not for kids or the easily offended.",1154217600,5,1968,5.071207430340557

A staple among comedians since the days of Vaudeville, the Aristocrats was assembled by comedy duo Penn and Teller, and features many stand up comedians and celebrities offering their insight into the legacy of the filthiest joke ever told, as well as giving their own versions.  In this documentary, you will see the likes of George Carlin, Robin Williams, Whoppi Goldberg, Jon Stewart, Sarah Silverman, Bob Saget (yes, Bob Saget), Phylis Diller, Jeffrey Ross, Richard Lewis, Lewis Black, Chris Rock, Judy Gold, Dana Gould, Mario Cantone, and many more giving their two cents and/or giving their own versions.  The kids from South Park (courtesy of Trey Parker and Matt Stone) even make an appearance, which will leave quite an impression on you as well, and Gilbert Gottfried is featured giving what is considered the definitive version of the joke at the Friar's Club Roast of Hugh Hefner; an event that took place after 9/11, and a joke that brings Rob Schneider to his knees in hysterics.  Hearing the same joke premise so often can grow tiresome for many, but for comedy enthusiasts looking for a little insight into the world and history of comedy, the Aristocrats is truly something to behold.",1154131200,5,1337,4.902654867256637

But this movie STINKS!!!  The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because of Larry Storch's brief interpretation of the joke using a British accent, which was the only truly funny part of the film and even that part was cut short.  The joke itself is not funny.  With very few exceptions, the comedians' interpretation of the joke is not funny.  It's 90 minutes of self indulgent comedians cracking themselves up over something that is really not all that amusing.",1153872000,4,639,4.610619469026549
187905,4,1569388431,I thought this was an extremly funny movie.  However the only downside is when they sometimes edited it in a way that made the joke lose momentum when it was being told.  The Gilbert Godfrey and Bob Saget versions especially.  Godfrey they hailed as the definitive version of the joke and the way they cut in and out of his rendition made it so it was hard to follow and you couldn't really enjoy it as much as if it was told straight through.,1153872000,2,443,4.25
187906,1,1569388431,"I usually find low-brow, potty humor pretty funny.  Where a lot of people would be offended, I usually laugh and feel entertained. For example, while some people may have been upset and disturbed by the violence in Kill Bill, Sin City, etc., I actually loved those films.  As far as comedy goes, I enjoy Dave Chappelle, Howard Stern, etc., even though my wife and others find them offensive.  With that all said, let me warn you that this film actually made me very uncomfortable and I couldn't even watch it anymore after about 30 minutes.  It starts off with the poop and pee jokes you might expect, and then moves on to vulgar sex acts, etc. (And at this point I was still okay with it, even laughing quite a bit).  But after about 20-30 minutes, it starts crossing way over the line and starts going into some very graphic depictions of incest, senseless murder/mutilation, and even a tad of necrophilia.  Okay, if that isn't enough to upset you, then maybe you'll be okay with this movie.  But I was really repulsed when they started carrying the joke too far.  And once you see that the whole point of the joke and the movie is simply that each comedian can improvise on the joke and make it his own, it is no longer entertaining or funny.  Alot of people may disagree with me, but I wouldn't watch this unless you're really immune to the most vulgar and uncomfortable things you can imagine.  Basically, if you can laugh about child molestation, then you're a sicko and this film is for you.  If you don't find that topic funny (like I imagine most people would not either), then do not even take a glimpse of this movie - You'll be sorry you did.",1153526400,6,1654,4.461794019933555

Whether it's Bill Maher's more pop culture take on the old Aristocrats joke, or Bob Saget's surprisingly vulgar interpretation, each comedian is revealed in its telling. There's one big problem however; the jokes aren't funny. I am sorry but there is a difference between telling a joke and going for shock value, something this movie doesn't appreciate.

From the opening montage this movies literally pummels you in such obscenity that the point of the film is too hard to get to. I really didn't care at the end of the day what each comics personal take was because all of them were caught in a who can top whom contest in terms of vulgarity.

This movie actually reveals why good comedy is hard to come by, because it's been replaced by shock value. It's a shame because there is a difference; go ask Bill Cosby and Jerry Seinfeld.",1153094400,4,992,4.6571428571428575

Jillette and Provenza have created a very funny documentary from a simple premise: the world's filthiest joke told and analysed by the Nation's top fun folk.

I liked the way they worked over the joke with no audience so you can see how they improvised on the filth theme.  Each comedian tells it in their own way, short or long (and very long in the case of Gilbert Gottfried and Bob Saget) and although the ninety minutes is basically about the same joke it is edited in such a way that I was not aware of the time.  It has to be said though that the filming is on the amateur level, by Jillette and Provenza and they admit as much on the optional commentary.  My favorites are the South Park crew and a very quick but brilliant sequence by Eric Mead who uses a pack of Bicycle playing cards to tell the joke.  Two comedians even manage to reverse the joke by having a very safe stage act performed by obscenely named artists.

But wait! There's more.  As well as the documentary you'll get to see another two hours of filth. Of the several extras these are the two I enjoyed most: 'More from the comedians' has twenty-one of them joking and revealing their thoughts on the Aristocrats; 'Behind the Green Door' lets them tell some of their other stuff.  All this on a wonderful DVD and no nudity!

* Oh yes, let me spell it out for the potential one star reviewers out there: if you don't like to hear certain words that end in s, t, k, t, m and others, repeated a zillion times, steer well clear of The Aristocrats.

This movie also exposes Jason Alexander for being a hypocrite. Alexander has become famous for writing children's books and for giving interviews in which he stresses how he makes sure to instill good moral values in his own children. However, in The Aristocrats, Alexander goes way out of his way to engage in the most vulgar and disgusting so-called comedy imaginable.

The basic thrust of The Aristocrats, at least to the extent that there is one, is that free speech is a good thing. Yes, we get it and did not need a trashy flick like The Aristocrats to figure it out either. Nor do we have to like trash like this either.

187916,1,1569388431,"The few minutes devoted to Gilbert Gottfried's telling of this dumb joke are perfectly hilarious, but not enough to redeem what is arguably the most vulgar and un-funny movie ever made.  The Aristocrats has so many faults one barely knows where to begin.  For starters, there are few things less amusing than having humor explained, it either works or it doesn't.  (Hearing musicians talk about music is also painful, and listening to actors talk about acting is torture.)  Next, as a class, comedians tend to be neurotic, juvenile, and self-indulgent, even the clever ones will go to any extreme to get the attention and approval they desperately crave.  The Aristocrats celebrates these inadequacies by encouraging them to top one another with increasingly grotesque tellings of one simple joke.  The result is a non-stop barrage of sludge that will make you feel like taking three showers afterwards.

The missing piece here is obvious, though not obvious enough to be seen by directors Provenza and Jillette.  It is simply this; comedy depends on surprise, an obscure perspective that resonates something inside the listener in a way that s/he did not expect.  The surprise of encountering filth comes only from it being out of context, there is nothing inherently funny about filth.  Jokes don't get funnier by getting dirtier; they become more offensive and revolting.  Toilet humor, and humor relying on sexual depravity, is not only the least funny type of humor there is, it is the last refuge of the comedian too lazy to actually create and hone real humor.

The premise of this film is that we are getting an insider's look at how comedians entertain each other.  As loathsome as this idea is, there may indeed be truth to it.  If true, it only reinforces our worst suspicions about comedians.  While truth must always be paramount, not everything true must be placed on a billboard.  Eating sausage is one thing, watching 90 minutes filmed in an abattoir is quite another.  Spare yourself.",1149379200,14,2001,4.978915662650603

Five minutes into it, I was ready to take it back to the video store, but then I just decided to fast-forward it and that's what made all the difference. It's quite quite raunchy, yet very side-splitting funny. I laughed hysterically through the film and even some of the extras. Unfortunately, the good stuff doesn't get going until about 30 minutes in.

Also, I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't much social diversion, just different shades of deeply established caucasian comedy...and Whoopi. There was even a shot of Chris Rock in the closing creds but....that was the only time I saw him. Perhaps, therein lied the rub.

Nonewithstanding, I believe this documentary is a should-see, but not a must-see.  The film itself, seems to be symbolic for not just the art of jokes, but for also the lives of those who tell them. It starts out slow and awkward to draw you in. Once it's got you, it goes for broke and in the end, it's almost always anti-climatic. And that's the Aristocrats.",1149292800,2,1044,4.693989071038251

This movie is  about one of the dirtiest jokes ever  told ... But it's not really about that at all.

It's about the craft of comedy; about how a two line joke that relies solely on the storytelling ability of the comedian can range from simplistic and gross to making a sweeping social commentary. It all depends on the mind, delivery and skill of the teller.

As a study of comedy and comedians, it's a brilliant film, clearly one of the most original films of the past several years.

The film quality is rough, the camera-work is amateurish, but that only enhances the primary objective of the film - to see past the crudness of the joke and peer into the world of comedy.",1142726400,5,620,4.477876106194691
187938,3,1569388431,"So, a man walks into a talent agency and pitches a documentary. The agent tells him he has two minutes to convince him, so the man tells him about all the comedians and their unique versions of the same dirty joke, adding vulgarities involving all kinds of sex acts (incest, bestiality, homosexuality, bisexuality, bondage, golden showers, s&m, you name it!) and other bodily functions. The more outlandish the description, the funnier it gets. On and on. We hear it from various comedians, the most shockingly funniest being Bob Saget, who played the squeeky clean dad on ""Full House"" and told the lamest jokes as host of ""America's Funniest Home Videos"" in the early 1990s. Finally, we get to see him at his most vulgar! Another unique scene is a mime who tells his version of the joke without a single word. He pantomimes the whole thing in the middle of the street with baffled onlookers adding much to the joke, and we get it, even the punchline. Brilliant! When all is said and done, the agent asks what the act is called.

Ta-da! ""The Aristocrats!"" Ha-ha. Or not.

Honestly, I never heard this joke before and read several articles that played up this documentary when it made its theatrical run. I wish I could have heard the joke without knowing the punchline beforehand. I don't know if I would've laughed or not. But watching this documentary, I did laugh at the outrageously dirty jokes and the different comedians telling it. Supposedly, it tells more about the person telling it than about the joke itself. The joke probably started as an excuse to break all kinds of taboos, building and building an audience's anticipation to the big climax of a laugh...and what we're left with is ""the aristocrats"" punchline. They explain why the joke works, how it works, why the punchline isn't meant to be all that funny.

So, I give it an okay three stars for its effort. It's not something I'd watch more than once, but I did appreciate the oodles of extra features, including uninterrupted sessions with comedians telling their version of the joke. During the documentary, it's edited in an interesting way, so it's nice to hear comedians tell the joke all the way through.

All in all...not bad. Can't figure out why the pug is on the DVD cover and DVD itself. Is he in on the joke? Or is it because he's so funny-looking cute that he just ""fits""? At any rate, if you want some naughty laughs, check out this documentary. In keeping with the advice at the end of the film to keep the joke alive, I told a co-worker my version of the joke and got a laugh out of it. Okay...now I understand the appeal!

187947,4,1569388431,"""This film has not been rated, but it is protected by the 1st Amendment.""  With that explanation for why this documentary is rated ""U"" (for being unrated), we launch ourselves into a the world of ""The Aristocrats.""  Now, this might not be the oldest joke in the history of the world, but it has to be in the running as the dirtiest joke of all-time, but what is made clear is that this joke is to comedians what ""Why did the chicken cross the road?"" is to kids in kindergarten.  Almost every comedian knows the joke (Dick Smothers might be a rare exception), and basically you have the premise (""A man walks into a talent agent's office...) and the punch-line (see above title), with as much obscenity and filth as you can put in the middle.  The telling of the joke can take up to 90 minutes (done once by Michael O'Donoghue) if done right (right being a relative term).

If you think that you are going to hear 100 comedians tell the same joke one after another, that is not what Penn Jillette and Paul Provenza have put together.  You will not hear the joke told from start to finish that many times (damn, I should have been counting), but there are thematic sections where the variations on a theme are explored by cutting from one comedian to the next.  There are also a couple of sections devoted to twists on the joke in the inevitable quest of comedians to one-up each other (e.g., takes by Wendy Liebman and Bill Maher).  Some of the moments that stand out are Eric Mead telling the story with visual aids provided by a deck of cards, Kevin Pollard telling the joke doing Christopher Walken's voice (guaranteed to make any stale joke hysterical), and family friendly Bob Saget becoming a real potty mouth.  But I also liked Rita Rudner being so delicately (but appropriately) appalled at the joke.

My favorite part was Cartman telling the joke to the ""South Park"" gang, although the legendary telling of the tale apparently belongs to Gilbert Gottfried, who unloaded ""The Aristocrats"" at a Friar's Roast of Hugh Heffner on Comedy Central, three weeks after September 11th.  Gottfried went too far (too soon) on a joke regarding a flight with a connection to the Empire State Building, and destroyed the room doing this joke, although what was really funny was daring to tell the joke more than the joke itself.  But, hey, you take immortality when and where you can.  Ironically, the most interesting part of the documentary is not the telling of the joke, but the analysis of the joke.  In this regard George Carlin is clearly the wise man atop the comedy pyramid, but others provide insights and the analysis provided by the Editorial Staff of the ""Onion"" stands out because they actually use a white board and colored pens to diagram how far you can go.

The number of comedians who appear in this documentary hits triple digits, arranged alphabetically from Chris Albrecht to Steven Wright.  There are big names like Robin Williams and Chris Rock involved in the proceedings, but have little to add to the fun.  But this is a gig where Taylor Negron will be funnier than John Stewart, and some of the best lines and insights come from talking heads where you have no idea who they are until the end credits assign names to faces.  The whole thing takes too long, but when you see the special features included on the DVD you realize that none of these funny people were going to shut up while the camera is rolling and they have funny stuff that has nothing to do with the topic.  Despite the warning at the start nobody should be offended by this film because unless they grabbed an animated Disney film by mistake, you have to know going in that this will be the filthiest DVD you have ever seen (and there is a SOUDNTRACK?  Wow).",1142035200,2,3747,4.5724962630792225

first of all, don't listen to the reviews that say ""if you didn't like it, you didn't get it.""  cutting down opinions that differ from yours is just plain unfair.

i realize that beyond being a supposedly hilarious movie, the premise is the art of the joke and, possibly, how it fits in with freedom of speech/political correctness in today's world.  i went in not expecting the joke to be funny, but the delivery to be, which wasn't the case at all.  it's an hour and a half of being on the outside of an in-joke.  and as for any intended higher meaning, it was completely lost on me.

i was so excited about seeing this movie that i convinced 6 other people (whom i laugh together with on a daily basis) to watch it with me when i received my DVD.  believe me, the humor my friends and i share is in no way prude, but when we watched this movie all you could hear were crickets.  to be fair, mario cantone's delivery was great, as was doug stanhope telling the joke to his unwitting toddler, but both of those combined made up, at best, 2 minutes of the entire movie.

i honestly wish i could see in this movie what all the people who rave about it do.  and how they get away with putting those 2 reviews on the DVD cover is beyond me.",1141776000,8,1384,4.173584905660378

The big laugh is the telling of the joke. ""The Aristocrats!"" is the punchline. To me not particularly funny. The dvd extras had some of the comdians favorite jokes & a tribute to Johnny Carson & his favorite joke are marginally better.

187953,1,1569388431,"I am staring this reviewing by saying I did not fast forward or stop this film at any time, since I rented it. If I went to see it in a movie theater, I would not have walked out at any time. I write this review having watched the entire film, though I can certainly understand why so many people actually did walk out of the theater when ""The Aristocrats"" premiered. And out of curiosity, I wanted to watch this film, and having watched it all the way through, I am sorry that I did.
If it were actually funny, I would be able to appreciate it, admire it, give it credit, and, most importantly, laugh at it. The problem, as all problems with jokes, is if it's not funny, it's just plain pathetic. Yet sometimes pathetic can even be funny, but not this time. It was way over the top, and I know, I know that's the whole point, that these comedians go so far over the top with this ""joke"". It is a game of who's sicker than who, but as the comedians would say it, who's more creative and outrageous than who? How about a game of who's funnier than who? And the winner is...... Nobody!
Dirty jokes can be extremely funny (Drew Carey's 101 Big [Richard] Jokes in the book ""Dirty Jokes And Beer""), but this goes beyond dirty and enters into too sick and overly disgusting territory (as, by the way, it promises to enter and does), and that just does not cut it for me in the humor department. It works in the sad and pathetic department though. I'll give you an example of what other gross-out humor I have found to be funny to an extent... ""Scary Movie"" and somewhat ""Scary Movie 2"", ""There's Something About Mary"", ""National Lampoon's Animal House"", ""Everything You've Always Wanted To Know About Sex But Were Afraid To Ask"", and my favorite stand-up concert is ""Eddie Murphy's Delirious"". So, I am not offended by sexual humor in general, it just all depends on what's funny and what's not funny. One of the most unfunny tellings would be from who most people viewed as the best.... Sarah Silverman. Funny? Hmm... Well, if I were hard of hearing and unable to read lips, maybe I could imagine her saying something that would make me laugh. But unfortunately, in this case, I do have my hearing, and I did not even chuckle or so much as smile.
The comedians I believe could have made this joke funny are Sam Kinison, Buddy Hackett, Rodney Dangerfield, and possibly, my all-time favorite comedian, Richard Pryor. And wouldn't you know it, all four are no longer alive. But then again, the almost always funny George Carlin is alive, was in this film, and was not funny at all with this material. So, go figure! Actually, George Carlin has said many times before that anything can be funny. It all depends on how you construct the joke.

As such, it is probably useful --a clean comedian is usually a dull one. Once someone is able to tell this ""joke,"" which is all about being as offensive as possible, it must be easy for them to tone it down a little and be merely vulgar to your average adult audience. It is stressed throughout this documentary that no one tells the Aristocrats to an audience; it is mainly told to other comedians. The stated reason is that it is too offensive, but I don't think this is exactly true. Many of the comedians featured in this film, such as George Carlin, are not exactly inhibited in their language and subject matter. The fact is, the joke is not really all that funny. Hearing it over and over, in countless versions, I chuckled once or twice at some especially bizarre scenarios, but there is no real punch line or twist that a real joke has. Of course, many of the comedians say this themselves, that it isn't really a joke. This, to me, makes the film a little hard to sit through for 90 minutes, and I have to confess I didn't watch the whole thing. I suppose it's interesting as a look at an aspect of the comic subculture, but for me it was simply too repetitive.

The special features (complete versions of the joke by various participants - who are shown to variable extents during the feature) are enjoyable too.

With The Aristocrats, you get to watch these comedians run wild and improvise, which is really the whole point of doing this particular joke.  It sets the comedian up to take the joke wherever he or she pleases.  The results are very interesting.

The documentary cuts from one talented comedian to the next, with each putting their own sick spin on things.  I must admit, it was pretty amusing to see Bob Sagat go off on an insanely filthy rant.  Even South Park's Cartman had a go at it - another highlight, in my opinion.  The collection of talent giving their insight into this insider joke is quite impressive.

There are bonus sketches included on the DVD.  In these sketches, you get to see the full rants of selected comedians.  The material can get a bit redundant after a while, but something will ultimately be said to snap things back to laughter.  Worth a watch.",1140739200,2,976,4.583815028901734

Oh yeah, lets get 100 of the funniest people in the world, but make sure they aren't funny...

I was laughing really hard about 10 minutes in, for about 3 minutes.  At 15 minutes I thought, how long are they going to keep doing this.  At 30: I can't believe how repetitive this is getting.  At 40:  I've wasted 40 minutes of my life on this, not ONE MINUTE MORE, and I turned it off.

187973,2,1569388431,"The Aristocrats is a failed documentary for many reasons, and I'll point out the most valid ones in a second. First, though, let me explain what the film is about. It's about a joke, a very old joke, that has mutated and grown as it's been passed down from its vaudevillian roots. And it started out going something like this: A man walks into a talent agent's office and says, ""I've got a great new act, let me show you."" So the guy brings in his wife and kids and they all poop on the floor, then fling themselves into the excrement, flying across the room, then pop up on the other side with their arms and heads held high and say ""Ta-Da!"" The talent agent then says, ""Gee, I don't know. What's your act called?"" And the guy says, ""The Aristocrats.""

So that's the initial framework for the joke. But as times changed and comedy grew, so did the joke. It was basically an inside joke that is just now being let out for some air by these insider comedians who've known about it for years, and now the joke has been taken to completely new levels of rude, crude, and socially unacceptable telling. Beastiality, incest, and pornographic tellings abound, but the punch line - ""The Aristocrats"" - remains unchanged.

The format of the documentary is a smattering and haphazard pasting together of comedians staring into the camera (not on-stage, mind you) and belting out various incarnations of the joke. Most go beyond crude which, so we're told, is supposed to make the punch-line more effective. But I found these long expletive passages boring and I yawned more than I laughed.

Another problem with the documentary was its target audience. It really isn't for the general population; it's more for comedians themselves. Historically, it's an interesting take on how comedy has altered over the years by focusing on this one joke, but doing a historical recounting of comedy by telling one joke multiple times is overkill and not going to engage many people (at least many people I know).

The final nail in the coffin was that The Aristocrats was trying to be both a serious documentary about comedic changes, while also attempting to be funny. I will say that, on some level, this works because it IS interesting to see the permutations the joke has gone through, but it's not funny. And that's what I was expecting when I sat down to watch this. My expectations were that I'd laugh my butt off with the line-up of comedic talent listed in the movie (George Carlin, Drew Carey, Stephen Wright, Lewis Black, Andy Dick, Gilbert Gottfried, Chris Rock, and the list goes on and on), but the laughs were short in coming.

187976,5,1569388431,"Clearly people either love or hate this movie. That's a good sign for people who are interested in movies and art that take a stand and have a point of view and are in some way authentic. That's The Aristocrats.

First of all, I laughed the whole way through.  When I wasn't laughing, which was rare and welcome, I was learning about comedy, and about taboos and what's offensive, and feeling like I was in a world I could never get into on my own.

Secondly, it's shot exactly the way it's supposed to be shot.  It's not slick - this is not a pretty hollywood story, it's not a movie for lovely images - it's got a ""punk"" sensibility - like the joke itslef. It's not mainstream, and it doesn't care whether you think it's attractive, good looking or has its hair in place. It's REAL.  And it sure feels right for the subject.  (When I go with my musician friends to hang out at their gigs, we're always in the dark dank hallways, and crappy green rooms with cigarette burned armchairs and it stinnks of stale beer, and the back doors are always right next to the garbage bins.  That's what being inside WORKING show businesss IS, despite the phony lies you see on Entertainment Tonight.)  It's a documentary that is proud of its flaws, and rightly so. The style fits the substance perfectly.

The sound is imperfect as well - people telling the joke in restaurants, on the street, backstage during shows - you hear it all and have what feels to me like a genuine experience.  If I were to be pretentious about it, I would say it's a perfect example of Dogma 95 filmmaking.  But it's not even concerned about that - it's just REAL.  That aspect informs every bit of this original and bold little film.

I have watched it on DVD three times now and get more from each viewing.  Believe it or not, this movie respects its audience more than any other I have seen in a loooong time.  If you take the time and effort to see what is going on, more and more interesting stuff unfolds.

It's hilariously funny.  Subjective as that is, it's incredible to me that some customer reviewa go on and on about how they 'get it, but it's not funny.' Well, guess what - I think they don't get it.  They just don't.  This movie is smarter than it looks, even though the joke may seem stupid.  There are subtleties in the humor in this movie that are not obvious amidst the context of this old gag.  It's not about poo and pis and incest.  Man, anyone who thinks that what they're watching needs to get away from the tv for a while.

The movie respects viewers enough to let them draw whatever conclusions they want, rather than trying to manipulate how we should feel or think. That's reason enough to champion it.

After all is said and done, I think the fact that this is polarizing is part of why it is a great movie.  I for one like movies that allow me to have my own experience, and that haven't test marketed me into some stunned numbness.

This movie rocks.

And the DVD bonuses take you further into the mindset and fun of it all. The music hall number by The Royal Debonaires (Are they a gag or really an act??); The mime track with a mime routine of an abortion (come on, these guys are fearless) is genius.  Sarah Silverman, Pat Cooper - I never though I'd ever have those two in the same sentence - are both welcome bonuses.  I could go on and on...

This movie will be taught in film schools in years to come, while at the same time being watched by frat boys just looking for a lot of big, in-your-face laughs.

And WHOA! Man, are some of these guys hilarious. And we take this footage and we edit it as horribly as possible. It might almost be unwatchable when my unpaid friends and I are done editing it.

Perhaps, through all the scattered clips you might get near a complete telling of the joke- but only with a handful of these guys. And remember, these are professional comedians- George Carlin, Jeffrey Ross, Chris Rock, Bob Saget, Phyllis Diller- so they know how to tell a joke. They know timing, they know how to build momentum, anticipation, I mean they are the masters of their craft. But forget that. We're just gonna show the jokes all jumbled up. Mix them in with this and that. After all, the only way viewers won't get bored is if we are constantly inserting blowhard commentary.

""I mean, we're even going to get Gilbert Godfried's legendary telling of the joke at Hugh Heffner's Friar's Club Roast, and we're not even going to let that material breathe. Don't get me wrong, we will get a bunch of comedians to discuss the ins and outs of Godfried's version. We're just not going to bother to really show what they are talking about.

""Then, since we're going to have all this space to fill, we'll get these comedians to all share the same meaningless observations. Eight or nine will compare the joke to jazz improv. No -better- they'll all liken it specifically to John Coltrane. Then, with all the second-rate comedians, we're going to give these guys the opportunity to speculate on the enduring charm of dirty humor. Really make them feel like viewers believe these guys have something worthy to say. Then, we're going to have everyone else just go on about how everyone else in the movie would tell the joke.

Many people talk about the funny tellings of the joke, bob saget's, gilbert godfried's, sarah silverman's, yet you never get to even hear them tell the joke straight through.

It doesnt make sense to me how a documentary could be made that neve fully shows us what the documentary is about.  The people who tell the joke are funny comedians, but for some reason the camera just doesnt trust these professional to know how to entertain.

It's about comics, so it's bound to make you laugh a couple of times, but that's not the goal of the film.  The film's purpose is to give the backstory on a joke that is almost like a secret handshake among stand up comedians, while at the same time allowing you to glimpse just how warped some of these people are.

There's no doubt that it takes a special type of person to become a comic.  Being funny isn't good enough.  Someone has to be driven and willing enough to go in front of a crowd and face humiliation night after night.  They probably spend half their lives on the road in tiny clubs.  It's no surprised that they're a little warped, and nothing illustrates this better than The Aristocrats joke.

The joke itself is just a comic talking about a family act where each person commits the most unspeakable acts.  The punch line is that the group is called the Aristocrats.  It's not a funny joke.  The humor comes from the way it's told.  How far will the comic go in setting up the punch line?  How can they get more disgusting and over-the-top than the previous comic?  How can they make it their own?

This film isn't for anyone who's easily offended since the humor often deals with sex, incest, and bodily functions that people don't normally talk about.

For those of you that like to think about what makes something funny, you will learn ever so much more.  Yes, this is just 90 minutes about comedians telling/discussing the dirtiest joke of all time (and they mean it.  I like to tell people the joke, but I do not unless I can completely trust them not be disgusted.  As a result, I do not get to tell this joke often.  When I do, however, it is savored.  Like an orange on a nice summer day.)

The joke involves graphic amounts of sex, feces and a few acts that you have never thought of before, but can immediately recognize as sins against both man and God.  People who can no longer appreciate lowbrow, ""blue"" humor should pass.

For those of us still left, this movie is pure genius.  Classic comedians such as Robin Williams, George Carlin, Bob Saget (who, by the way, has the best version of this joke,) and more all telling ang talking about the nature of the joke.  It becomes a discussion on humor and how to craft a joke.  Given the protean nature of The Aristocrats, you will begin to see both similarities and differences in each comedian's telling, things that hint at their viewpoints and personalities.

I managed to catch this movie at the theater, and three people walked out during its course.  I was kind of dissapointed by the small number.  This was galvanized by the number of people joining in and laughing so hard, a few fell into the aisle.

Basically, you start telling a seriously raunchy joke that includes elements of incest, blood, fecal matter, and anything else you can think of to gross out your most weak-stomached friend. Somehow, you convey that the whole situation is an act. When the person asks you what the act is called at the end of your joke, you simply reply ""The Aristocrats"", which ""is"" the punch line. And for some reason, that's supposed to be funny. It's supposed to be a joke that a comedian can improvise with, and show off their writing sills. It's supposed to convey the art of telling a joke. But I can't think of a more unfunny display of writing ""talent"" than telling this joke. It's simply a gross out joke. It's like laughing at fart jokes, only not as funny. It will have you scratching your head as to why they aren't just telling a regular joke that's actually original.

I do enjoy most of the comedians in the film. At one point or another, they have succeeded in their endeavors. Sadly, this film makes them all far from funny. Don't get me wrong, if you are between the ages of 9 and 13 and just love to hear swearing a explicitly vulgar dialogue, you may love this film. If the ""shock factor"" does a lot for you, you also may enjoy this film. I on the other hand was yawning most of the film. Juvenile humor can be insanely funny when cleverly delivered.

I thought I had heard some jokes that pushed buttons, but these comedians in private go REALLY far.  It's a joy to watch that freedom in the hands of creative people.

My wife hated it for the first 15 minutes - but she couldn't believe I was enjoying it so much, so stayed and watched it all.  Once she got over her disgust at some of the things these people say in the joke, she got hooked - now she keeps giving me different versions she keeps thinking of herself.

I thought most of the DVD extras were EXCELLENT (the mime piece in ""More from the Comedians"" is NOT to be believed). I LOVED ""Behind the Green Door"" - all those great comedians talking about jokes like literature and seeing how they tell jokes I may even have heard before - you reall see why pros are pros and your co workers aren't.  Lots more extra tracks I haven't even gottten to watch yet - there's over two hours of material.  The commentary track is really casual - I like it not being scripted or sounding like they are reading it like so many of those are on dvd's - this one is like you're just hanging out watching it with Penn Gillette and Paul Provenza, telling stories about their comedy friends (The Bob Saget story they tell is HILARIOUS) and things about comedy you never even think about.

It is best to watch ithe movie with some friends - but watching (for the third time) alone, I really appreciated that it is a documentary.  There is so much to learn about how to tell a joke, how specific comedians tell things their own way, what makes some of them different, how just talking about taboo things is not wrong in the least... I could go on and on about the things this movie makes me think about.

Some people complain in these pages about parts when the comedians aren't telling the joke - that's the best part IMHO.  The times we hear the joke told really just show the things they talk about. I wish they talked even more about what they do.. .but there's a lot of that in the DVD bonus material.  As much as I loved the movie, the extras made it even better - and create a whole package of this Aristocrats joke phenomenon.

Everytime a couple of friends come over who have not seen it, I have a great time showing it to them all over again.

This is definitely one of my favorite DVD purchases ever. I can whip this out for the right people and know we are going to have some serious laughs - everyone reacts different to it - which makes it even funnier.

It's definitely NOT for everyone, though.  (But I think  it should be. Like my wife, get past the language and the whole nastiness of the joke, and you find a whole world of laughs and very clever stuff.)",1139184000,2,3040,4.217616580310881
187994,2,1569388431,"THIS MOVIE NEEDS TO BE VIEWED IN A CROWDED MOVIE THEATER.  This movie does not translate well to the home video market.  You need to be in a dark theater, with strangers, all reacting to the sickness and grossness together.

If you do buy or rent this, you should invite a bunch of people over to watch it together.  It is just like watching Pink Flamingos.  It's just sick if you sit there and watch it by yourself.

Note that I believe that most people who give this movie 5 stars are the ones that watched it in the movie theaters and not at home by themselves, on DVD.  You can tell, because these people only talk about the movie and mention nothing about the DVD extras.

Watching this at home on DVD, I did not think it was very funny.  It just got tedious.  And I love gross humor.  I always laugh at the joke about why you put duct tape around your gerbil.

It is interesting to see all of the comedians featured in one movie.  And you do get some insight in the behind the scenes activities of a comedy act.

The movie was filmed in a standard 4:3 format.  The DVD has a few nice extras, that are in some ways better than the movie.  There is a section where all the comedian inputs are strung together for a complete joke.  There is a 15 minute section of comedians telling other gross jokes.  There are some pretty good ones in there.  And you can watch the movie with commentary from the producers (one of which is Penn from Penn and Teller).

187995,2,1569388431,"""The Aristocrats"" proves three things you already knew:

1. Whoopi Goldberg isn't funny

2. When comedians stop telling jokes, they immediately stop being entertaining.

3. Nothing is more annoying than someone telling you something is funny before you get a chance to judge for yourself.

You hear comedians wax poetic about ""The Aristocrats"" so often in Paul Provenza's documentary that it is shocking, and downright annoying, how few times you get to see someone in the film tell their version of the joke without interruption.  The few times you do - Sarah Silverman, a ventriloquist, a mime, and a card magician are all blissfully allowed to tell it from beginning to end - the movie screams with comic genius.  But this is almost never the case.

The problem with ""The Aristocrats"" is that it feels like a DVD documentary for the film it should have been.  It was clearly edited by two people (Provenza and someone with the hopefully false name Emory Emory) who had no confidence in the audience's attention span.  Case in point: the greatest telling of the joke, by consensus, is Gilbert Gottfried's Friar Club Roast version.  And when it's finally time to see that version of the joke, it's continually interrupted by a stream of talking heads (one of whom isn't even a comedian) telling you how funny and legendary the performance was.  Well, if it was so great, why won't you let me watch the stupid thing?  There are about 2,000 cutaways in the movie, 80% of which are completely unnecessary.  Some shots are just of comics laughing, with no context whatsoever.  This annoyed me to no end.  I've seen episodes of ""Best Week Ever"" that were less hyperactive.

Other potentially great versions also get ruined by the editor's scissorhands - Bob Saget's, Jason Alexander's, and a host of others.  The bottom line?  ""The Aristocrats"" is the first movie to heckle itself.",1139097600,6,1877,4.867507886435331

187997,5,1569388431,"I saw this expecting to be disappointed after all the hype and buzz.  The opposite happened.  I expected dopey raunchy comedy and some guilty laughs. What I got was a thoughtful, insightful look at comedy, comedians and the creative process, as well as real probing into cultural taboos and how boundaries shift and change over time and from person to person - all hidden amidst the funniest and most outrageous comedy I have ever seen in a movie theater.

Yes, my sides ached from laughing - but whenever I wasn't laughing, I was THINKING.  My respect for comedians and the art of stand up comedy has grown a million fold.  And I discovered people I had never heard of right on the same level as the many comedy superstars.

I am a fan of documentaries - and this one blew me away.  It's style and substance are completely origiinal, and it feels underground and voyeuristic as it takes us behind the scenes into the comedians' workout session. This movie is so funny it's easy to lose track of how smart it is.

Those who claim it is repetitious are missing the point - whenever something seems like we've heard it before, you can isolate some little nuance or effect that makes it unique, despite how it seems at first hearing it.

The DVD is also full of additional  examples of all that - and in some cases clarifies it to those who hadn't noticed. There is over 2 hours of bonus material - worth the price of the dvd alone - and most of it is as funny and thoughtful as the movie.

187998,4,1569388431,"Unrated and unrelenting, ""The Aristocrats"" is a simple joke that gets carried far, far beyond normal human comprehension.  It is funny, unique and nearly unbelievably disgusting.  It simply starts out with the comedian telling the `agent' that a family of four; Mom, Dad, son, daughter and the dog walk onto a stage.  It ends with the `agent' asking the name of the act.  ""The Aristocrats"" is the answer.  What comes between is the real meat of the package.  Dozens and dozens of comedians tell hilariously different parts of their versions of the joke throughout the film.  Be wary.  The subject matter includes feces, vomit, incest, bestiality, murder, group sex, urine, blood, pedophilia, violence, forced consumption of every bodily fluid available and more!  This is where you get to hear what comedians really like to joke about!  And if you ever wondered why Gilbert Gottfried is even mildly famous, his final version of the joke is so irreverently vile, you'll never wonder again.  Disgusting stuff.

Frankly, I reached my limit of the entire premise by that point. This would have been much better as a half-hour special on HBO because beyond that, it's too repetitive.

The highlight of ""The Aristocrats"" is Kevin Pollak's telling of the joke--as Christopher Walken. One thing the film will show you: there are a lot of professional comedians out there who are really not funny.",1138838400,6,506,4.685393258426966

Number 2, you can't be easily offended (and if you DO have a sense of humor, you're probably not easily offended).

Number 3, watch this film as it was intended - a documentary, not a live stand-up act.

Abide by those 3 rules and you will ENTIRELY enjoy this film. The Aristocrats is about an inside joke, a secret handshake among comedians. It's actually an excercise, something a comedian practices sharpen his or her chops, and often performed for other comedians, rarely in public.

As explained in the film, the joke is like a jazz piece, with a set beginning and ending punchline. The middle is all improvisation. And while the joke itself is fairly lame, the improv is where the artist gets to go off in any number of directions - all filthy, gross, pornographic, depraved, sick, disgusting and horrible. And it's the FUNNIEST S**T you will EVER hear!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Bob Saget, Gilbert Gottfried, George Carlin and Pat Cooper steal the show. Saget in particular so gleefully dives in that the laughter, including his own, is infectious and non-stop.  Most of the comics on the DVD do not tell the joke in its entirety, but rather put their own spin on the origins, execution, and purpose behind the joke. But the full effect of the joke is played out numerous times

Penn Jillette and Paul Provenza produced this film on a non-existant budget and the production quality shows it. But who cares!!! What's even funnier is listening to them on the commentary track admit how crappy they made the film! Bad camera setups, out of focus shots, microphones not plugged in...

This is a DVD to watch and laugh at over and over, pull out at parties, and even learn from. The language is as XXX-rated as it can possibly be - that's all you need to know.",1138665600,3,1848,4.612804878048781

188003,5,1569388431,"This is a documentary that HAPPENS to be funny.  This documentary is more about what makes something offensive and how to tell a joke than it is about just trying to make the audience laugh the whole time.

In fact, the whole point of the joke is to see how far you can push someone before they DON'T think it's funny.  The reason they all go so far is that the entire premise of the joke is to push that person over the edge and leave them standing there, mouth agape, that ANYONE would dare to say such things.

Along the way of course, many of these people manage to be quite funny, but that's not the point of the documentary.  It was clearly centered around Gilbert Goddfried's telling at Hugh Hefner's Roast, which immediately followed...  alright I won't spoil it.

Anyway, I found it more interesting at times to listen to the particular approach each person took to trying to push the limits.  These people are trying to push YOUR buttons, but as happens so often with storytelling, the story often ends up saying more about the person telling it than it does about the audience.

And, of course, I spent a good deal of time laughing about it as well.  The footage and explanation of Gilbert's exprience at the roast was my favorite, I must say.",1138665600,3,1254,4.4605263157894735

If you're reading a one-star review, and the person seemed unprepared for what the movie was about, feel free to skip it. It's true that this movie not for the faint of heart, but it's extremely funny. I don't go in for juvenile humor, toilet humor, etc, but this movie made me laugh harder than I've laughed at most comedies, precisely, I think, because it is so over the top. There's something engaging and infectious about the obvious glee with which a lot of the comedians tell their version of the joke; it's like they're jumping off a very high diving board, and you're going with them. Highlights for me included the mime, Sarah Silverman, and the comedians telling the joke to, or at least in the presence of, their (pre-language comprehension) children. My reason for not giving this movie five stars is its editing: several times a comedian's telling of the joke was interrupted by other talking heads, which put a big damper on the humor. The worst case of this was Gilbert Godfried's version, which I'd heard a lot about and was really looking forward to hearing all the way through. The folks at the Friar's Club seemed to enjoy it, but the movie audience got a truncated version.

188008,5,1569388431,"A lot has been said about this movie in these pages, and it's probably all true. If you're easily offended, or you're looking for a conventional comedy, you will probably dislike this movie. If, however, the power of words is limited to the power *you* give them, there is a lot to find in The Aristocrats.

Those who have written before me have said a lot about the humor in this movie. It, too, is probably true. As might be expected from any collection of so many comics, with so many different styles, from so many different backgrounds, some bits will have you gasping for air while others may fall flat. Like most entertainment, that's a matter of taste and it's hardly worth arguing.

But there's another aspect to his movie that really deserves attention. This movie swings. The joke around which this movie is centered is like a comedy version of a jazz standard. It has been interpreted by many talents, much like any standard, but the documentary itself is even more interesting than its subject.

Illustrating the art of interpretation (""the singer not the song,"" as Penn Jillette describes it in the film), the movie shows the impact of the joke in many forms. Like Monk working ""Epistrophy"" in so many ways, discovering something new in every playing, comedians retell a behind-the-scenes comedy staple until you think you've heard it all... until the next time it's told.

Director Paul Provenza destructs and reconstructs the joke until this documentary evolves into something akin to a body of work that is presented in a single sitting. This film is a comedy mash up. It's about creating something new that is bigger than the sum of its parts. It's about risk taking, and it's about the love of the subject. It's essential viewing for any student--casual or dedicated--of comedy, film, or storytelling.

And besides all that, it's funny. Very funny. Few movies better illustrate the important idea that entertainment is subjective. Reviews can help guide you part of the way toward deciding if something is a good match for your tastes but, at the end of the day, only by watching it can you know if this movie has something to say.

It is raw, primitve comedy deconstructed as it is performed.  Watching the various attempts at making the joke each comedian's own is fascinating.  Who cares about the joke - as the movie says, it's about the journey.  And the journey keeps taking twists and turns and never stops bringing surprises along the way. I found it hilarious, but I was shocked at how much I learned - watching the movie and watching those around me in the theater when I saw it the first time.  It's a serious documentary - the laughs are the byproduct of the subject, and they are plentiful and different for each viewer - but it never gets weighty or takes itself too seriously. (This is proved by the DVD commentary track - Paul Provenzo and Penn Gillette talk about the art and craft of comedy more than they talk about making the movie. It's like the Cliff's Notes to the movie, revealing a lot of the ideas that they didn't state outright in the movie.) We see the ideas the filmmakers want to show us as the performers engage in them.  It's so much fun, and so fascinating to get a sense of hanging out with  all these people.  The language is raw, the ideas are twisted, but it's just words being used as a creative exercise.  How do they make us laugh at such horrible stories?  Because they are artists.  Some people don't want to know how 'the sausage is made.'  But the result is creative people being free, fearless, and playing with no rules.  I wish mainstream movies would take more chances like this - I don't care about being offended if there's a point to it - and this movie has some really important points to make about artists and freedom.  And the whole way, everyone is just having a great time -it's infectious.  Way better than the predictable tripe Hollywood usually tries to pass off as comedy.  I'll take a disgusting joke over safe, manipulative stuff I've seen a million times before ANY day.

The DVD has loads of great extras - along with the movie, they explore in greater detail some major points inn the movie, and also some great comedy just for the hell of  it.

Falsely advertised as 100 comics delivering the same joke in individual ways, the film is actually a half-baked documentary consisting of an endless stream of talking heads endlessly and shallowly pontificating on the implicit philosophical and/or sociological underpinnings of an amusingly obvious dirty joke.  Some are sincere, others sarcastic, all (to various degrees) annoying.  Even the footage of those who make a genuine effort is so manically chopped up that their earnest delivery is irreparably compromised.
Fortunately (and probably for the sake of their own careers), some refuse to actually tell the joke (bless you Don Rickles, Jon Stewart and Phyllis Diller), while others spit it out so generically (Emo Philips, for one, who is normally ingeniously eccentric) that it is simply embarrassing.  Even Gilbert Gottfried's Hugh Hefner Roast footage (which, face it, is the sole reason this thing was even made) is truncated, for reasons unknown.  Rather than being allowed to judge it for ourselves, we instead get a half-dozen or so commentators telling us how earth-shattering it was (speaking of which, is Hugh Hefner the world's most humorless man, or what?).
The whole film is like when someone tells a long-winded joke with far too much exposition then either screws up or forgets the punch line.  A lot of empty, self-indulgent babble with no pay-off.

The joke itself takes a backseat to the concept of how the joke is told, why it is told, and by whom.  It is a fascinating probing of the mind of stand-up comedy, an insightful study just as important in the history of showbiz as Citizen Kane or O.K.Computer.

Yes, the bits are sidesplitting (Billy The Mime), yes, the comedians are brilliant (Sara Silverman), yes, the movie is crazy funny (Tim Conway).

To witness the fences of American censorship being trampled over with such exalted glee, while also observing the fourth wall of pompous documentary style being smacked around as well (an early scene of Richard Lewis talking to two cameras simultaneously is one such anarchy) makes this movie breathtakingly enjoyable, an icon and milestone of charming, maniacal cool.

It's really a film about tolerance, pushing the edges, adlibbing and trying to one-up your fellow comics by making them laugh at the most outrageous vile humor possible with a punchline that really isn't the joke.

Some of my favorite takes on the joke come from Sarah Silverman and Bob Saget.  But the crown jewel absolutely comes from the genius comic Gilbert Gottfried.  I've been a fan of Gilbert's for years now, but I had no idea he could be so dirty!  And thankfully, he has his own DVD out now of dirty jokes, and it's f***ing brilliant as well!

188043,5,1569388431,"""The Aristocrats,"" is not a funny movie.  Any laughter on my part was spurred by the laughter of the participants, like a cough prompted by someone else's cough, rather than by the content of the joke.  My reaction was more like awe.  I was absolutely astounded by the verbal riffs that were going down.

The premise of both movie and joke are simple.  The movie:  Tracks the on-going life of a particular and particularly dirty joke that is more often performed for other comedians than the public, and is an exercise in inventive one-upmanship.  The movie uses an A, B, and C list of comedians to tell the joke.  The joke:  A manager for a ""family act,"" meets with an agent to sell the act, explains what the act is, the agent asks the name of the act, and the name is the punch line.

What makes the joke is the explanation, which is open to the teller's stream-of-consciousness, and which includes any and every sexual taboo the teller can pull out of his or her personal universe.

The thrill of the movie is in watching the comedians create astounding, totally uncensored, somehow logical Rube Golberg constructs of verbal obscenity.  It's like watching a leap into the subconscious, or the dredging of a cesspool in which all the bodies have been dumped.

This is a movie for comedians, poets, Shakespeare scholars, and anyone interested in jokes, story-telling, or verbal play.  It is not for the feint, or easily offended.

My wife loved the idea, hated the movie.",1138233600,6,1473,4.6770428015564205
188044,1,1569388431,"I eagerly awaited this movie to be released on DVD. I appreciate crude humor in the right context, and this movie was going to present alot of it, as well as an insight into the origins of a notorious in-joke among comedians. Five minutes into this film, I knew I was in trouble...that I was caught up in the hype of The Aristocrats. I trust rottentomatoes as a good source for choosing movies, and the film had received very favorable reviews on that site. At six minutes  I decided to continue watching with the hope it would get better; it didn't. I don't care how much one may intellectualize about, and heap praise on, this film...it is just one long, boring, repetitive exercise about a subject that gets less funny the more you talk about it. Okay, am I the only one that has scratched his head saying, ""Who the heck is Sarah Silverman, and why do reviewers always lavish huge praise upon her and write as if she is a household name?"" I suppose that is a way to get us into a group mindset saying, ""Oh, yeah...Sarah Silverman...she's funny,"" while whispering to each other, ""Who is she?"" She is not very funny and anywhere near the talent level of another Jewish, female comic: Sandra Bernhard. Amusing parts of this film: Kevin Pollack doing a Christopher Walken impersonation and Wendy Liebman's alternative name of ""the act"". It's always nice to see Rip Taylor, Don Rickles, Pat Cooper and Phyllis Diller (all legends), but they do not come off very funny here. I appreciated Emo Phillips new look, for I had not seen him since his bobbed haircut days. Taylor Negron-always funny and Sandra Bernhard's male counterpart...but too many close-ups of him. The director did not compliment Mr. Negron by shooting the camera in his face for so long. I did like his take on the joke, though. So, this is my ""intellectualizing"" on this film. See it if you will, but no hip, young, upcoming, with-it, retro-cool comic will be able to make The Aristocrats funny or shocking. Oh, finally, the much praised Gilbert Gottfried bit at the Friar's Club- amusing, but much less funny than it is described even taking into account the context of that particular evening's events.",1138233600,6,2170,4.695538057742782

It's not that I'm easily disturbed or shocked by what I heard in the movie, and I realize there are horrible, inhumane things that occur in this world every day that we ignore in our self rightous concervatism; but I still I think it is utterly pointless and idiotic to celebrate the most disgusting, irreverent trash manifested from the minds of otherwise respectable comedians in the name of art, creative expression, and entertainment. Yes, they are brave for exploiting their sick thoughts and airing the most disturbed recesses of their minds, but it simply does not make for good entertainment! I don't know what the hell it is, but It's stupid! It's playground humor to the nth degree, told over, and over, and over, and over, and again; having been designed for a cheep laugh that was spent  the first fifteen minutes of the movie, if at all. I don't care if you're Paul Riser, or Whoopi Goldberg, or Bob fricking Saget for that matter, the joke was not smart,it was totaly stupid, and we all respect you a little less for having heard you stoop to that level.

If your brand of humor is condusive to an endless barage of bad words, pointlessly disgusting imagery, with countless references to incest and beastiality, this movie is for you. Come see the absolute worst of the best in the business.

Some other reviewers have complained that the Aristocrats is more like a movie about comedians just talking about the joke. If that viewer watched more than the first few mintues he/she would know that's not the case. Furthermore, the DVD provides 2 hours worth of bonus features that include the complete joke being told by several individual comedians, if the montage style doesn't tickle your fancy.

In reality you get the funniest comics talking about the dirtiest joke ever. Oh, sure, there are some tellings of it and they are pretty darn profane and hilarious. But there's not enough of the actual telling of the joke and the performances that are presented are so chopped up it's not quite the same thing. The best tellings (Gilbert Gottfried, George Carlin) are the ones that are allowed to go the longest without cutting away. It seems to me that quite a few comics got slighted (Robin Williams), but without knowing what, out of the 140 hours of footage, was not used, it's hard to say.

The DVD goes a long way to fixing this problem by giving several comics their own bit in the special features menu. Even these though are jump-cut together and it can be a little jarring at times.",1138147200,2,997,4.413043478260869

when you think all of the ideas of the movie have been explored another layer is revealed. concepts introduced early in the movie pay off towards the end.

in addition to being truly hilarious and a lovely record of some of the finest comic minds of our generation, the aristocrats is a deeply personal work coming from the mind of hollywood veteran, paul provenza.

Like a Freudian roller coaster ride through Evening at the Improv in Hell, this film pushes into disturbing and hilarious areas of the brain that most films would never dare.

The entire conceit of the film is that it's telling the same joke over and over.  But in truth, the joke is never really the same.  As each comedian takes their crack at it, the interpretations reveal the subtle styles that define each comic mind.

Penn Jillette and Paul Provenza do a spectacular job of keeping the pace whizzing by at breakneck speed and luring the subjects into wonderfully unguarded moments. What starts off as a simple private joke becomes a very keen dissection of the minds of comedians. Fans of Penn & Teller's groundbreaking Showtime series will be right at home in this unconventional and appealingly comic docuemntary. Even if you're offended by the jokes, or not a fan of raunchy humor, you'll still discover a very intelligent and dissecting documentary lurking beneath the surface of this shocking verbal assualt.

The film is both surprising and delightful as it describes the most depraved acts ever imagined by the human mind with a good-natured joy and cheer.

These reactions made this movie more enjoyable for me.  It was almost a social experiment.  While I'm sure the DVD will be great, especially with the extra material, it is my opinion that to get the most from it, you need to watch it in a group of dissimilar people.  The ""squirm factor"" of those that are shocked is important to feel the strength of this movie.

That said, I will own this DVD to have two things.  The ""South Park"" clip, which will never allow you to see those little scamps the same again, and the sublime performance of Sarah Silverman, who rather than simply telling the joke in the third person, became one of the Aristocrats relaying her past experience in the group and hitting on a realization about what she went through.

188063,5,1569388431,"I couldn't laugh for weeks after my friend died. I couldn't laugh for years after my mother died. But wow, I couldn't stop laughing when I saw the Aristocrats, and it felt like none of that other stuff ever happened. For once I laughed with every pore, cell, and microbe.

This movie is the only one that made me want to run back out to the ticket booth and buy seats for the rest of the day...to see all the parts I couldn't hear/see when I was teary-eyed and gasping at the greatest joke-tellers of the world.

I later took other friends.. from the age of 21 to 83, (yes, I love em all)..who all and I mean ALL had versions to tell me after the movie. We still do one-liners just in goofy moments. It's a classic. -- this is one of those movies that will stand the test of time.

I was lucky enough in my life time to see several renditions of the Aristocrats in the green room of comedy clubs and its like Jillette and Provenz acted as the history channel of what all of the comics have in common.

Yes, it is horribly disgusting, sickening, and grotesque.  Yes, it involves people talking about utterly disgusting & despicable acts.  Yet, it raises several intellectual points.

1.  The entire movie is people talking about taboo subjects in a humorous manner.  Are you offended?  Why?  Why not?  This is an excellent example of free speech!

2.  Why is it funny?  Why are you laughing so hard?  You analyze the nature of comedy.

3.  A hundred different people tell the same joke in different ways and they all generate laughs.  It is definitely the violinist and not the violin.

188071,5,1569388431,"""The Aristocrats"" is a rare film in that it is absolutely brilliant and  outrageously funny at the same time.  It's not about the joke, it's about the art of joke telling and improv. The editing is superb, so you never get tired of hearing the different variations. In fact,  just when  you catch your breath , wipe the tears from your eyes and settle back in your chair...you can't help but buckle over with belly laughs again. It's simply hilarious from beginning to end.

If you can only buy a few films a year..this should be one of them. I've seen it 5 times and each time I laugh harder and pick up on something new. I've never enjoyed a film more.

Hollywood should sit up and take notice. If more people put out movies like Paul Provenza and Penn Jillette.....Hollywood wouldn't be in the slump that it's in right now.",1137974400,15,826,4.437086092715232

188074,5,1569388431,"I believe it is misleading to label the content ""offensive"".  Every person who has seen or might see this movie has heard each of the off-color words before.  In today's day and age we should be somewhat numbed to them by now.  To paraphrase Lenny Bruce, a particular word only has the power to offend us if we allow it to do so.  A word is just a word.  It is a meaningless sound in itself.

But it is the spirit, attitude, and context in which it is used that suggests something more.  It isn't important that someone may find a few words or phrases in ""The Aristocrats"" to be offensive.  The point is that the joke-telling allows the teller to nurture an atmosphere of outrageousness and no-holds-barred freedom from perceived boundaries of good taste (which is a pliable and oft-shifting boundary anyway).

I am a huge fan of most of the comics in this film, and I was delighted that some of the lesser-known comics had the best bits in the film, Dana Gould in particular.

I hope that the large majority of the population is offended and turned off by this film.  Why?  Because it makes the ""enlightened"" rest of us feel superior to them because we aren't behaving like sticks-in-the-mud who simply don't get the joke and miss the whole freakin' point.

We laugh hard at this film because we aren't supposed to.  We aren't supposed to condone this kind of outrageous freedom of speech in this rather repressive culture we live in.  But the fact that we can and do laugh at it is reassurance that we still want to celebrate things that challenge us.

In my review of ""Waiting For Guffman"" several years ago I labeled that movie as ""the barometer of funny"" (or ""barometer of humor"", or whatever) --- you can gauge a person's sense of humor by how they respond to that kind of humor, sort of a litmus test.  ""The Aristocrats"" is the same thing -- I will use it as a litmus test to gauge other peoples' sense of humor.",1137715200,20,1919,4.45272206303725

7797134,5,1569388431,"Both gross and funny, this unconventional documentary looks at the sociology of the world of stand-up comics through the lens of a particular joke that for almost countless decades was known only to comics. (The filmmakers seem unable to identify the joke's precise origins, but it might go back at least to the nineteenth century.) Called ""The Aristocrats"" in America but known by other names in the United Kingdom (""The Debonaires"" or ""The Sophisticates""), the aim of the joke was to gross out other comics and to display story-telling skills, because the actual punchline of the joke  is not that funny. Almost anyone can get a laugh with a clever punchline, but the humor of the Aristocrats is entirely in the telling.

Throughout the film, famous and not so famous comics tell the story, each in his own way. For example, surreal humorist Steven Wright tells a surreal version. George Carlin of the ""seven dirty words"" fame arguably tells the most unforgettably gross version. Sarah Silverman dramatizes the story by making herself into the victim of the obscene action.

In one of the most powerful scenes, Gilbert Gottfried's performance of the Aristocrats at a gala that was held shortly after the 9/11 attack revealed this joke's sub-cultural significance to a wider audience for the first time, but more importantly reaffirmed that we could still laugh. Gottfried had started off with a joke about flying at which the audience indicated they regarded  jokes about airplane disasters as being in bad taste. ""It's too soon,"" someone called. ""You want to hear a joke that is in bad taste?"" asked Gottfriend. Whereupon he launched into an impromptu telling of the Aristocrats. About half of the audience were professional comics who recognized it, and they were rolling on the floor. The rest of the audience had never heard it before, and were both shocked and caught up in Gottfried's telling. (Could anything shock the late Hugh Hefner? Evidently, this joke did.)

If you are intrigued, now, and want to hear the joke, just watch this movie. It is the ultimate dirty joke, though, and you have been warned.",1475712000,2,2115,4.963276836158192
