7923843,5,B00004UD5S,"Great video, bring back many enjoyable memories and moments. Well worth the buy, would recommend to anyone who was living in that time period. ""Funny""",1388448000,,150,5.04
7923844,5,B00004UD5S,5 stars for the Flip. Today we have some great actors/actresses but Ole Flip was a funny guy with his style in the old days.,1360800000,,124,4.0

7923846,3,B00004UD5S,"Sorry, but Flip Wilson was funnier than this video. Somehow it is put together badly, or, the skits were chosen badly.  I wanted to see the show as it had appeared on TV all those years ago, lively and spirited; but this video just doesn't convey that feeling.",1167264000,,260,4.416666666666667
7923847,5,B00004UD5S,"Some say music is the universal language, and I love music!  However, I think laughter has to rank right up there in this regard also.  We all need lots of laughs each day to keep our spirits up.  If you are down, depressed, ill, discouraged, then I encourage you to pick up a copy of this videotape.  It just could be a lifesaver!",1126137600,2,331,4.2063492063492065
