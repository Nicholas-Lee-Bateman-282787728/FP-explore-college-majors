4337679,5,B004EI2NPO,"The acting was great for the tone of the movie, the special effects and makeup on the creatures was way better than I was expecting, the story was hilarious and all around I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I'd put it in the same category as Shaun of the Dead, the Evil Dead movies, Scott Pilgrim and those sorts. Very worthwhile buy.",1296518400,13,332,4.459016393442623
4337680,5,B004EI2NPO,"LAST LOVECRAFT: RELIC OF CTHULHU is a great, low-budget horror / comedy in the same vein as SHAUN OF THE DEAD. It's like CTHULHU meets OFFICE SPACE (sort of). If you are a Lovecraft fanatic, then you'll love the many references to his work (I especially enjoyed the animated, comic book telling of the history of CTHULHU, THE SHOGGOTHS, and THE ELDER BEINGS!). A man named Jeff Phillips (Kyle Davis) finds out that he's the last living relative in the Lovecraft line. He's given a relic that must not fall into the hideous, flippery claws of the deep ones! Adventure ensues when Jeff and his workmate / friend, Charlie (David McGinn) join forces and enlist the aid of CTHULHU expert, Paul. Together, the trio risk life and fish-rape in order to stop the coming apocalypse of ultimate, tentacular doom! Highly recommended...",1294617600,28,823,4.843971631205674

4337687,4,B004EI2NPO,"Great movie to watch when you can't find anything else.  The storyline was pretty good.  The costumes were ok.  The CG was a bit weak, but there wasn't much.  The acting was pretty phenomenal.  Entertaining, nerdy, and if you love Lovecraft lore, it's pretty accurate.  Don't watch it expecting it to be a serious horror movie, it's more of a comedy.  I loved it.  Only dropped by 1 star because the camera shooting is a bit amateur and CG is weak.",1510963200,,448,4.444444444444445

I was impressed with all the actors except one of the leads. All the supporting actors were excellent natural comic actors.

While not exactly a big-budget film from a major studio, it's entertaining, in the same way as street actors doing an ad-lib play.

4337697,4,B004EI2NPO,"Fun, light, quick horror/comedy. Okay, Comedy lightly disguised as 'horror'.

This movie looked like it was made on the money someone scrounged out of their sofa cushions. The acting was actually mostly tolerable. If you watch this, it's for the humor, which mostly worked for me. The movie is cheesy, but fun. Worth sitting through for fans of H.P. Lovecraft who can handle it not being taken too seriously. The animated exposition dump scene actually worked pretty well. The effects are...well, like I said, the movie was done on a budget.",1509321600,,541,4.945054945054945

4337700,5,B004EI2NPO,"Production is a sometimes confusing blend of obviously minimal budget combined with really professional creative quality across the entire credits scroll.
The writing is campy but in an authenticly Lovecraftian prose style.
The protagonists are ridiculous, nerdy, vulgar and precise... horror is easy, comedy is hard and horror comedy is amazing when it's this faithful to the Lovecraft genre.
The costuming and Deep Ones prosthetics would be at home in a real jump scare popcorn screamer and entirely faithful to the Cthulhu Mythos.

4337708,5,B004EI2NPO,This was a great B movie my son and I both liked it we laughed and it was worth watching. The special effects were surprisingly good for a movie of this budget I was not expecting this at all and the acting was also good believable.  This is a great movie for people that like funny B movies it fits both comedy horror and science fiction. It was fun to watch my son is in his teens this is not a movie for kids.,1507766400,,412,3.9047619047619047

4337718,5,B004EI2NPO,"I saw some of the reviews and was on the fence about watching this, but since it was free with Prime decided to give it 10 minutes to prove it wasn't a high school art project.

The first five minutes didn't convince me, but after that it steadily got better.

For those wondering, this isn't meant to be a horror movie (at all). It's a comedy movie that makes use of elements of horror.

The low-budget nature of the costumes and effects added to the humor. The acting was actually not bad.

As others have said, you must have the ability to appreciate nerd/gamer humor to appreciate this film. If you do, you won't be disappointed.",1506988800,,633,4.431034482758621

When a nerd gets told that he is the only one that can save the world you are going to get this movie.
He isn't a super athlete/martial art fighter he is a nerdish artist that gets told ""only you can save the world"" I expected it to be just as it was, it made me laugh at the antics of ""what do we do now"" and yet still had some horrorness to it, being chased by monsters.

The filmmakers obviously know how to make a movie. The frustrating thing is that they have utilized a few ideas from Lovecraft in a way which  makes a travesty of his mythos, and all in the name of a very fannish and unfunny comedy. The essence of Lovecraft is atmosphere and a sense of malign cosmicism which is entirely missing in this movie . This is not the only film in this category combining competent filmmaking with a trashy story line. Clearly this brand of filmmaker could do much better; they just don't. At a time that we desperately want filmmakers to make decent Lovecraftian horror, this kind of filmmaking could well turn off those viewers who might otherwise appreciate Lovecraftian horror, and lead them to think this is what Lovecraft was all about.

It seems the stars are right and Cthulhu is coming back.

They meet up with a friend from their schools days who they picked on a lot.  Okay, maybe not a friend.

I've also discovered an actor I intend to follow: Barak Hardley. He's funny and likable in a supporting role. I was thrilled when I found that Saine and Hardley have since worked together on another, even better film, ""Bounty Killer,"" released in 2013.

4337811,3,B004EI2NPO,"I'm really not one for prostituting a perverted version of Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos for so light a purpose as comedy, but there's no way I can pass up the chance to watch any movie referencing Lovecraft or the Mythos.  Of course, everything about this film screams comedy, so it's not like an HPL devotee could go into this expecting anything even remotely serious.  In the final analysis, The Last Lovecraft: Relic of Cthulhu is relatively funny and unconditionally stupid - it has its good parts, and it has its bad parts.  They mostly cancel each other out for yours truly, but I can see how some will find the movie a good deal funnier than I did.

As everyone knows, Cthulhu lies dreaming inside his house at Rl'yeh deep beneath the ocean, waiting for the day his cult followers will free him to wreak havoc upon the Earth once more.  In this inaccurate telling of the story, two ancient relics must be rejoined to fashion the key to Cthulhu's watery tomb.  The cult has finally managed to find the relic that had been lost for centuries, which means Starspawn, Cthulhu's general, will be coming for the second relic, currently being safeguarded by a council of Lovecraft scholars.  With one half of the ""key"" now in the hands of the cult, though, only a descendant of Lovecraft himself has any chance of keeping the other relic safe.  This ""last Lovecraft"" is James Phillips, a real loser who knows nothing of his heritage.  His best friend is a comic book junkie who at least knows the comic version of the Cthulhu Mythos story, but the two must seek out the aid of Cthulhu specialist in the form of an old high school classmate even nerdier than they are.  Together, these three set out to save the world from Cthulhu's agents' tentacled clutches.

Even though you're given a quick, comic book version of the Cthulhu story (inaccurate as it is), those actually familiar with Lovecraft's brilliant horror tales will be in the best position to try and enjoy this movie.  You'll at least understand all of the references.  Those unfamiliar with Lovecraft can enjoy the comedy, but the sad fact is that this movie makes the whole Mythos look pretty stupid, what with fish people and an octopus-man running around all over the place - when, in actuality, the Lovecraft canon actually represents the pinnacle of cosmic horror.  I would hate for anyone to view H.P. Lovecraft through the window of this outright comedy.",1348617600,,2422,4.72209026128266

Well I just gave it a shot on Netflix (which had similar glowing praise) and for a no budget movie it manages to rise ever so slightly above the muck. It's got a few funny bits so if you're a Lovecraft completist this movie won't be too painful. The director has no clue which can be a little jaring; for example,look at the box cover art. The star of the movie is the guy in the background on the left. All through the movie the star just kind of ambles along, overshadowed by the other two characters. It's never confusing who the star is, but what is confusing is why the other characters do all the heavy lifting. In other words the hero never really has his hero journey.
Not worth buying but get all your nerd buddies together and watch it on Netflix.",1343692800,,900,4.269005847953216
4337814,4,B004EI2NPO,"I have to start off by saying that I am not an H.P. Lovecraft fan.  I honestly don't think I have read any of his stories which supposedly form the basis for the mythos behind this film.  Certainly, I've seen several movies loosely based upon some of his work, such Re-Animator, Dagon, The Unnamable, and The Dunwich Horror.  I admit that I am much more of a movie buff than I am a voracious reader.  So I cannot say with any degree of accuracy, just how closely The Last Lovecraft adheres to the world created by the late author.  But I CAN tell you why I found it to be surprisingly enjoyable.

I suppose the first thing that struck me about this low-budget little film was the basic resemblance to another recent horror spoof, Stan Helsing.  Not so much in its execution, because Stan Helsing was very much a broad and off-color spoof of the horror/slasher genre.  But the overall premise of the two films bears a striking similarity.  Each of the main characters in both movies are the last in a line of those descended from the characters/persons referred to in the titles of the films.  They're both basically losers stuck in dead-end jobs, who have no initial interest whatsoever in taking over for their long-deceased predecessors.  But circumstances (plus the need to make an entertaining movie) soon force matters upon them, so that they grudgingly have no choice but to get caught up in their respective adventures.  From there, the two films veer off in completely different directions, but I felt the need to make a small comparison between them, as I've only recently seen both films.

The Last Lovecraft asks us to believe that when the fate of the world is on the line, the Geeks will somehow save the day.  Jeff and Charlie are co-workers as well as roommates, aimlessly going about their lives with little purpose other than trying (without much success) to get laid, and scoring sought-after comics and collectibles for their own amusement.  And, of course, dreaming of writing and publishing their own comic book.  Their lives take a sudden and unexpected turn when a stranger shows up at their apartment, bearing an ancient relic.  He informs Jeff that he is the last descendent of H.P. Lovecraft, and that he must somehow protect the relic from falling into the hands (or tentacles) of the beast-god, Cthulhu.  For the things and the worlds that Lovecraft wrote about are indeed real!  As if to drive that fact home, Cthulhu's slimy henchman, the Starspawn, shows up the apartment, and all hell proceeds to break loose!  The Starspawn's mission is to recover the relic, in order to use it to once again unleash Cthulhu upon an unsuspecting world.

Escaping with the relic and their lives, and left to their own devices, Jeff and Charlie decide to enlist the aid of an old high school acquaintance, Paul.  Paul lives in his grandmother's basement, and is a self-avowed geek authority where matters of Lovecraft and Cthulhu are concerned.  His extreme geekiness makes Jeff and Charlie seem normal by comparison.  The three embark upon a comedic road trip to find the legendary (according to Paul, anyway) Captain Olaf.  The boys hope to convince the Captain to help them, for during his years at sea, he is reputed to have had encounters with the minions of Cthulhu.  This must be true, for when the friends finally find Captain Olaf, he is living in a broken down RV in the middle of the desert - as far away from the ocean as he can possibly get.  Like some of the other characters, Captain Olaf is an inspired creation, and delivers some of the movie's best one-liners, all with a deadpan seriousness that's sure to make you chuckle.  I think he may have been my favorite character in the entire flick.  Personally, I would love to see or read a back story about the colorful Captain Olaf's adventures and exploits, though they could certainly leave out the slimy details of one of his encounters - you'll know what I mean once you've seen the movie.  Oh, and let's not forget Gary. who lives with the good Captain.  Talk about a fish out of water!

The final confrontation at the end is a bit weak, and could have been done better, but overall, this delightful movie does not disappoint.  The acting is pretty good for the most part, and the make-up and creature effects are serviceable if not outstanding.  The ending or epilogue following the big climax, neatly ties into references near the beginning, and leaves the door wide open for a sequel.  I certainly would not object to seeing a sequel to this entertaining little film, should they ever make one.  In any case, I found The Last Lovecraft to be well worth the small amount of time I invested in watching it.  Don't go into it expecting a work of art, and you too, may find something to enjoy.

Oh, and be sure to watch the end credits.  There's nothing additional following them, but as the credits roll across the screen, there's a catchy little sea shanty that plays.  I found myself humming the melody for days afterward.",1340150400,3,5009,4.67351598173516

4337817,3,B004EI2NPO,"It was only a matter of time before a fan film would use the same tropes common to many modern horror novels in the Lovecraftian vein -- that Howard Phillips (H.P.) Lovecraft's stories were actually thinly disguised reports of true events. What's surprising is how polished the final product is.

Directed by Henry Saine, The Last Lovecraft follows the travails of Jeff Philps (Kyle Davis) and his irascible roommate and coworker Charlie (Devin McGinn).  When Professor Lake (Edmund Lupinski) appears heralding Jeff as the last of the Lovecraft line responsible for keeping an artifact safe from Cthulhu's minions, the duo don't believe him at first.  It doesn't take long before the place is crawling with Deep Ones and Jeff and Charlie flee in a panic, leaving Lake to deal with General Starspawn (Ethan Wilde).  Pursued by Starspawn and his minions, the two buddies look up Sheldon (Edward Flores) a self-proclaimed Lovecraft expert holed up in his grandmother's basement.  Sheldon leads them to Innsmouth and Captain Olaf (Gregg Lawrence) thanks to a tourist map Sheldon acquired previously.

Throughout, clever comic book style flash animations, narrated by aspiring comic book artist Charlie, help explain the more esoteric aspects of Lovecraft's mythology, including Shoggoths, Deep Ones, and Elder Things (which, at one point, are mentioned as Old Ones, a bit of sloppy editing since Chaosium formalized their name as Elder Things but Lovecraft was by no means consistent).

It's pretty clear this film was made by Call of Cthulhu role-players.  Dynamite figures prominently and there are several shout-outs to Dungeons & Dragons players, none of them complimentary. It's puzzling that General Starspawn is a ""he"" rather than an ""it"" since Chaosium also generalized other creatures like Cthulhu as Star-Spawn.  But then The Last Lovecraft is at least partially blazing its own path.

The special effects are surprisingly good, with the exception of the Deep Ones, who look like guys in big rubber masks.  There are also some odd direction choices, like when General Starspawn's tentacles appear from behind his shoulders.  When tentacles sprout beneath a RV, Starspawn must be on his back...but he clearly isn't a minute later.

The Last Lovecraft isn't quite as clever as its cast may believe, but I can't be too hard on a 78-minute loving tribute to Call of Cthulhu gaming.",1333929600,4,2383,5.190600522193211

But the movie doesn't deliver on the promise of the premise.  Instead we get 5 minute dialogue scenes where nothing happens, including a ""Road Trip"" style series of sequences that have nothing to do with the Cthulhu mythos.

The Star-Spawn of Cthulhu is a weak villain who utters cliche lines like ""You FOOLS!"" and wears a silly graphic tee-shirt.

There's a lame attempt at a Cthulhu version of Robert Shaw's Quint character, who had a run in with the Old Ones at sea.

Again, the ideas here are great.  It sounds like it will be entertaining, but the execution is BORING and UNINSPIRED.

It feels more like a spoof of Cthulhu rather than a loving homage.

This could've been awesome.  Instead, it's just a missed opportunity.",1326758400,5,1012,4.758620689655173
4337822,2,B004EI2NPO,"Written on the heels of horror-parodies, like Shaun of the Dead, The Last Lovecraft has the potential of being a really fun, humorous homage to the Cthulhu mythos stories. The humor, while not up to Shaun, Zombieland, and other films, is ok. The characters aren't very likable, but well-written humor occasionally makes up for that. The place where it really stumbles is in the setting. The main plot concerns a powerful leader of Deep Ones, the half-man/half-fish servants of evil, but the story mainly takes place in the desert, and even within that setting, usually in one spot. I don't know if the film-makers couldn't get permits or other permissions to film in town or other populated areas, but this is what kills the movie. Any Lovecraft-based film, especially one with Deep Ones, needs to be set in a dark, dreary setting, even if its a comedy. This isn't The Hills have Eyes. This is a story about fish-men. You can't base it in the desert. If Last Lovecraft had been filmed in a run-down part of some fishing town or even the poorly-lit factory that the villain's intro was filmed in, it would have been far better, but, as it is, setting is key to Lovecraft, parody or not.

I won't give the movie a total fail, as it does have some decent effects and humor. I felt that the filmmakers wanted to homage Lovecraft and not just make fun of the genre, so I can respect their effort on that level. Unfortunately, that's all the film has going for it.",1324857600,,1458,4.564885496183206

I'll just say that I was pleasantly surprised, that it was better than the hype allowed.  (I hate it when movies are compared to other movies, as though some loose association will make them better, or worse.)  I loved this movie purely on its own merits.
I have to also add that I am a fan of Lovecraft, have been for many decades, and find no offense in this movie taking ""inspiration"" from the writer's work.
It's a daffy premise, trying to merge humor with horror.  For me it totally worked.  My first thought when it was over: I hope there's a sequel.
In short: I loved all the characters. I loved that they managed to do so much with so little.  I really didn't notice anything lacking; you don't need a big budget to do something grand.  The story fairly zips along.  I thought the opening credit sequence was very classy.  I also loved the animated history/explanation.  This is ingenuity at its best.

The creature effects were fairly good for such a low budget offering.  The characters embrace the nerd stereotype and the result is some great dialog and memorable scenes.

It is nice to see this type of work, that takes a good-natured poke at the normally weighty Lovecraft Mythos.  The movie ends with sequel potential and I'd certainly be up for another funny tale of dark cults and tentacles.",1309564800,2,746,4.78125

His job is to protect it and keep some fairly cheesy looking cult members from getting it, otherwise, Cthulhu sets up shop again and the world is doomed.

That's what happens in The Last Lovecraft: Relic of Cthulhu. Comic artist Jeff (Kyle Davis - Friday the 13th) is the last descendant of H. P. Lovecraft, and a Lovecraftian cult has found a relic and charged Jeff with the safekeeping of the object. While Jeff wants no part of this, bored buddy, and comic book aficionado Charlie (Devin McGinn - Universal Remote) embraces the task, and after recruiting high school geek Paul (Barak Hardley - Falling Overnight), our trio heads out to protect the relic. But not before the legend of the Cult of Cthulhu, is told in comic book form. It appears that the army of good guys, unable to slay Cthulhu, locked him away in a prison at the bottom of the ocean. The key was broken in two and the pieces hidden, and now Cthulhu's general, Starspawn (Ethan Wilde - Frankenstein & the Werewolf Reborn!), has one of the pieces, and is on the trail of the other. Now Jeff & Co. are headed to the desert to find the secret RV of the legendary sea hero, Captain Olaf (Gregg Lawrence - Troublemaker). Their voyage is dogged with kidnappings, and attacks by Starspawn and the aquatic demon army.

The Last Lovecraft: Relic of Cthulhu is a horror, comedy in the vein of Army of Darkness. And like AoD, there is a story among the slapstick and humor. The only drawback is that there isn't a series of movies to base the characters on, but this could be jumping off point for both the actors and the franchise.

Karl's Grade:
Acting - B (Campy)
Setting - B
Script - A
Jumps - none
Effects - C (Cheesy)
Overall - A-

The Last Lovecraft: Relic of Cthulhu is a low budget, `B' movie. Not that that's a bad thing. The acting is good, if a bit campy, and the effects are adequate, if a bit cheesy. But the characters, coupled with the plot and the effects make this an enjoyable, fun romp to save civilization as we know it. The humor is more geek, gaming, and comic book related, so it feels like a private joke, that we all get. Just like when a Comic Con joke is made in a movie or a sitcom. I liked this movie, even with its lack of big name draw and polish. This movie appealed to what each character represents; the reluctant, fearful hero; the adventurer; and the nave nerd, who save the world in spite of their faults.

4337836,5,B004EI2NPO,"Having recently started reading Lovecraft, I've been laying hands on as much Lovecraftian material as possible. So, when I heard by accident that thsi DVD was coming out, well, I had to see what the hubbub was all about. The YouTube trailer looked pretty great and the DVD, well, it was a longer version of the YouTube trailer. So, yeah, it was pretty great.

Though, I thought the main antagonist was a little too SyFy Channel monster-of-the-week. But, I think that was part of the intentional charm of this flick... It was reasonably low-budget. But it also had reasonably good special effects. Sure, the CGI tentacles look a bit like CGI tentacles, but with this movie, maybe that was intentional too? And of course, the entire plot/scenario is presented so preposterously as to be laughable (literally! it was pretty darned funny!)... Again, I consider it all part of the charm of the thing.

The basic story is that Lovecraft was privvy to real history of Cthulhu, et al. He merely disguised that history as fiction. Well, R'lyeh is rising, Cthulhu's cult is trying to find the parts of the idol-like key or key-like idol that will unlock Cthulhu and unleash his tentacly glory on an unsuspecting world. Would we really miss the mini malls and reality TV if Cthulhu got loose, though?

Anyway, the movie's a pretty good, funny B movie romp. I certainly laughed. It's probably better if you know the Mythos before watching...",1298592000,2,1429,4.8244897959183675
4337837,3,B004EI2NPO,"Reviews Of Unusual Size!

Re: Jeff is an average guy that just happens to be the last descendant of HP Lovecraft. So naturally, it falls to him when Cthulhu starts to rise, sending his slimy minions to seal the deal and steal a relic from Jeff and his misanthrope friends.

Outstanding: This movie has a great sense of humor about itself, and though many fall flat it stays pretty amusing throughout. The traditional special effects, especially the monster suits are well done.

Unacceptable: The same can't be said about the CG, unfortunately, which is very cartoony and jarring. The humor is a little broad sometimes, and I thought the grandma was a poor addition. I didn't like the makeup for Starspawn at all, his tentacles were too small and random, and he was too red.

Summary: Worth watching, but not a classic. Certainly the best HP Lovecraft comedy action horror movie out there!

4337838,5,B004EI2NPO,"Henry Saine is a gifted young director with a generous, self-deprecating - and riotous - sense of humor entertwined with comic-book horror, meaning you never actually have to look away. This movie nods to Lovecraft first, then to Spielberg, Disney and to Saine's own sense of reality - his delightful animations and illustrations steal the show. Saine borrows technique from the masters as the highest form of flattery, with great results - tongue planted stubbornly in cheek.

By the way, it's pronounced K-thu-lu.

Writer/producer/actor/jack-of-all Devin McGinn (Charlie) both writes and chews scenery effectively, and Kyle Davis (Jeff) is a sweet lead. Editing for comic moments by McGinn and Saine is spot on. Best parts are the encounter with Olaf the sea captain, accompanied by the pirate song sea shanty - performed by cast and crew - and the scene when Jeff and Charlie first encounter the sea monsters in their Mini Cooper.
