2658864,5,B000ILYYD0,"Let me be the first to say, ""I needed that!""  This is a show that I and probably every other Goolie fan doubted would EVER be released on DVD.  For those who are unfamiliar with the show, it is a horrific spoof on classic Universal Monsters combined with the TV show Laugh In.  It has extraordinary characterizations of Frankie, Wolfie, Drac and an assorted bunch of offbeat characters with comedic voice-overs by Larry Storch, Howard Morris and many other notables.  I mean who can forget Ratso and Batso and the ever annoying Hauntleroy?  Some of my most cherished childhood memories of Saturday morning television are due to this show, I never missed an episode.  They may not hold up well over time but true afficionados of 70's pop culture will surely have a monsterous flashback of better days.  And now it's Weird Window Time...",1158451200,28,835,4.756944444444445
2658865,5,B000ILYYD0,"My dad bought this for me on the Betamax (man I'm old) when I was a toddler. I loved it and played it constantly. It was passed down to my cousins when I was a teenager and it got lost. I searched for this for years, so glad I'm now able to show my family and we can all 'join the goolies' again!",1312934400,,296,3.7142857142857144
2658866,5,B000ILYYD0,"I'm a little young to have seen these episodes when they were actually on TV. However, when they were relesed on VHS in the 90s, my Grandmother bought them. I remember watching these cartoons with all the other grand kids, & we all loved them! I was so excited when I found them on DVD; I just had to have them. Brings back great memories. The picture & sound qualities on these DVDs are great. I would definately recommend this collection for kids & parents alike!",1291420800,,465,4.4186046511627906
2658867,5,B000ILYYD0,"I loved the show!  Some might think it's stupid.  But not me.  There are lots of pretty good corny jokes,
but that's what makes it so fun.  I think it is a very enjoyable series.  And let us not forget songs.
Very cute.",1289433600,,219,4.0
2658868,5,B000ILYYD0,"I used to get up literally at dawn and watch this on a 13"" black and white set when I was a little kid in the really early 80's, I loved it that much. I don't think I've gotten up at dawn again since. When I ordered this, I wasn't expecting to get the full series (it was right around when this came out) but I received this version in the mail and was delighted. If you are in your 30's, as I am, a tiny bit of this show goes a long way now. It's just great to have it around now and know I can see it whenever. I still occasionally throw it on and watch half an episode. I look forward to having some kids and playing it though, now that they don't make cartoons for normal well-adjusted children anymore.",1281398400,,707,3.9510489510489513

2658870,5,B000ILYYD0,"Back in the 70s this was one of my favorite Saturday morning cartoon shows. I realize a lot of the jokes are corny, but they go by very quickly, and they also have a lot of ghoulish puns throughout. Sabrina also turns up here, as she started on the Archie's show.",1268611200,,263,4.176470588235294
2658871,4,B000ILYYD0,"i was very young when i watched groovie goolies in the early seventies. i was 5 maybe 6 and i still remember the episodes even though i am 44 years old now. it brings back memories when i was a kid when saturday morning was an event. kids now treat such things as trivial now. unfortunately now kids can't be kids. the art, the stories, the music, and the jokes still work after 39 years. i recommend anyone who wants good clean entertainment  to watch with the kids or their own enjoyment buy groovie goolies. there is bonus footage that is good also but the cartoons are better.",1262995200,2,580,4.37037037037037

2658873,5,B000ILYYD0,"I remember watching this series as a little kid, and it held up surprisingly well.  A great, harmless introduction to youngsters to classic cartoons and monsters.  Monsters are fun!  And they rock!",1257984000,,197,5.09375
2658874,5,B000ILYYD0,this is back when cartoons were fun true its jokes are cheesie and they repeat alote of gags on all the shows but thats ok it grows on you fast .did a good job on restoreing the toons sound is good . i do see some flicks on top left of picture sometime right that due to age of  film but does not take away from the show it self  . you can see alote of work went in to restoreing this show . its worth checking out,1246838400,,414,3.6931818181818183
2658885,5,B000ILYYD0,"Remember these guys? I know I sure do. Groovie Goulies is a great way to releave stress with it's Laughin styled script. Each disk is a wonderful barage of brght psychedelic colors, cool music, and bad jokes that only a vampire clould love. Speaking of vampires, Our star Drak or Daddio as he sometimes called seems a bit of a square against the rest of the carachtures such as Frankie who aloways seems to be very child-like and somwhat dopy, and Wolfy who just happens to be the resident hippy at Horrible Hall. Generaly speaking, The Groovy Goulies are perfect
for those times when one feels lonely and very much out of place.
It's a great reminder that even monsters have their place in the world and that no matter how strange you think you are you still belong even if you don't believe it.",1218067200,4,796,4.496551724137931
2658886,5,B000ILYYD0,"The Groovie Goolies never crossed over generations like Scooby Doo, but it's a much better cartoon if you ask me.  Being a huge fan of the Universal monsters and spoofs like The Munsters, a cartoon like this is right up my alley(and maybe yours).  There's really no plot to this show.  It's a bunch of assorted monsters hanging out at a mansion called Horrible Hall and engaging in all kinds of nonsense.  There are two musical numbers per show, usually in the form of 60s bubble gum rock with a horror twist on the lyrics.  Actually, some of these songs are pretty good.  The rest of the show is dedicated to endless bad jokes and puns, along with mini scenarios that are as close to any kind of plot you're likely to see.  Being a fan of really stupid puns and jokes, this kind of humor really does it for me.  I mean these puns are bad, so bad that they'll have the Crypt Keeper groaning.  I'm not fortunate enough to have been alive when these cartoons were shown on Saturday mornings, so this review is coming from a guy who doesn't have the childhood memories and nostalgia thing factored in.  That being said, this must actually be a funny cartoon coz usually tv shows don't seem as cool as an adult than they did when you were a child.  This holds up very, very well.  I'd highly recommend it to folks who like the classic monster movies and bad, corny jokes.  Lets face it, outside of Scooby Doo, the whole horror/humor cartoon thing was never done much.  Unfortunately the show only ran 16 episodes, but they're all here, even a few with commentaries.  There's a bonus documentary that's kinda silly.  It's done in a very sitcom scenario type of way that's a bit annoying, but it does feature interviews with some of the folks behind the show, as well as Forrest Ackerman and Alice Cooper.  Well worth a look and a reminder of how cool Saturday morning cartoons once were.",1202342400,5,1882,4.472140762463343
2658887,5,B000ILYYD0,"This show was a must for our house. My sisters and I argued on what to watch on Saturday mornings so mom made us rotate each hour. I always got the Groovie Goolies during my hour. The dvd is fantastic with great color (without having to stand up and adjust the dial or the rabbit ears!) They should have included the live action color footage from the Saturday Superstar Movie called Daffy Duck and Porky Pig meet the Groovie Goolies that was relased later. I'd much rather have that in this dvd rather than the stupid 90's rock group with the plageurized name that had absolutely no part in my childhood. Again, they should have included the live action Goolies and left out the stupid 90's band.",1201910400,2,697,4.496062992125984
2658888,5,B000ILYYD0,"It was GREAT to watch these episodes again.  Ok, the jokes were sometimes excruciating in their cheesiness but the nostalgic trip was worth it.  And it was great introducing my kids to other spooky cartoons beyond scooby doo.  Two phrases brought it back to life for my older siblings, ""This place is driving me batty."" and Frankie's post-injurious, ""I needed that.""  Dark Shadows is next on my list!",1194480000,,400,4.838235294117647
2658889,4,B000ILYYD0,"Whatever your feelings about the Goolies, they have been lovingly restored.  The colors are brighter than bright, and the images are crystal clear in this set.  The musical tracks have been re-""vamped"" and pumped up, but for some reason, they couldn't do this with some of the novelty voices in the songs, which sound a bit tinny in comparison.  The vocal tracks of the cartoons themselves though, are clean and clear.  Overall, I think they look and sound better than they did when I saw them as a kid. We didn't have cable, so I can see and hear them better than I did when they were broadcast.  The one notable missing thing, as one of the other reviewers stated, is the laugh track.  I don't know why it was taken out, but the programs suffer notably by the lack.  A lot of the jokes were always corny, but somehow it seemed more fun with the show laughing at itself.  Without that, many of the gags seem to fall flat.

Overall though, it is a well-done treatment.",1193270400,3,968,4.423728813559322
2658890,5,B000ILYYD0,"been a long time so this was a buzz to show my kids,,,great cartoon ,,
corney gags and jokes but i was 10 when i first saw this so i was very pleased",1189900800,2,149,3.5454545454545454

2658893,4,B000ILYYD0,"I recall this series from my childhood as being much better (of course), but it holds new and unexpected entertainment value as an adult. The animation is horribly limited, obviously executed on a stingy corporate budget, but the animated personalities are very expansive. One of the best aspects about this series as an adult is not the painful puns slung end over end Laugh In style, but the voice characterizations. Where the animation leaves me vastly disappointed now, the voice acting is really a howl (sorry). I'm also not too proud to mention that I love the musical numbers found in each show; they're fun and catchy, albeit a little corny.

All in all, terrific as both a nostalgic purchase, and one in which to find some new inspiration.",1188259200,5,748,4.7984496124031
2658894,4,B000ILYYD0,There is no laugh track which is disappointing because I remember that being one of the funniest parts of the show.,1182211200,3,115,4.523809523809524
2658901,5,B000ILYYD0,"I watched this as a kid and I couldn't get enough of it.  It's not great animation, nor is it great television, but it had all of those movie monsters that I loved.  Dracula, Wolfman, Frankenstein, Mummy; what more could a monster lover want in a cartoon?  My daughters love it as well, though they don't love movie monsters like I did back when I was their age. (Jeepers Creepers gives them the creeps!)",1175817600,3,404,4.4324324324324325
2658902,5,B000ILYYD0,"If you can't be 8 years old anymore(and I don't think I would want to be), then this set along with others out there can let you be for a little while. I grew up watching these whacked out monsters play their music and tell corny jokes . This set of the series was great fun to watch again, and the side benefit is my young boys have fallen in love with the gang of ghouls from ""Horrible Hall"" just like I did all those years ago.

  One extra for you older fans is that the humor does have an adult edge that is lost on children and makes it fun for us.",1175385600,5,554,3.8849557522123894
2658903,5,B000ILYYD0,"funny, laugh-in style jokes with really catchy songs( 2 per episode).

2658904,5,B000ILYYD0,"This is a great collection.  I can remember every Saturday morning glued in front of the tv waiting for this show to come on.  It's truly a great dvd that not only I can enjoy, but my son is hooked on it now too.",1168387200,4,212,3.7954545454545454
2658905,5,B000ILYYD0,"Yes!...a complete set that has been a long wait over due. I myself, was not only shocked, but, very happy to see the return of Groovie Goolies on a full complete collection...I would thought i'd never see these cartoons again and all was lost to the great memories of time only to see dust, however, the value of great demand from customers sure can bring it back. These cartoons sure brought back a lot of great and wonderful memories of my childhood and i love every minute of it. If your a kid of the 70s and 80s (early that is) you'll truly enjoy the Groovie Goolies again and will truly bring those wonderful memories back in a huge way...Highly Recommended!!!",1162684800,10,665,4.5041322314049586
2658906,5,B000ILYYD0,"Ah, the good old days when things were alot less hectic & stressful & so much easier to live.  For awhile I'd felt as if noone remembered that this fantastic cartoon had even existed.  People said I was losing it! Well my hat's off to the great folks at Amazon.com for even having this in stock.  I feel as if I'm (type youthful age here lol) again & more alive than ever! This is a ""must buy"" for any collector, child, or older person ;0) who has lived in a time when life was much simpler.  Why not buy this for your kids or grandkids if you have any, & allow them to step back to our time so that they won't miss out on the adventures that we once had when we watched Sabrina & The Groovie Goolies.  This is extremely well made, with art also added in, it was a reminder of many things for me.  Thank You Amazon!",1162425600,11,815,4.031055900621118
2658907,5,B000ILYYD0,"The episodes always began in the same fashion: On a stormy night, a disembodied voice welcomes us to an obviously haunted yet strangely colorful castle called Horrible Hall.  A vampire bat flies across a full moon and attempts to enter a window, which inexplicably moves, causing the bat to crash into the stone wall, revert to vampire form, and fall to the ground.  The vampire looks at the viewer and gripes, ""This place is driving me BATTY!""

The vampire, of course, was Count Drac, one of the hosts of Filmation's GROOVIE GOOLIES, a 1970's favorite which is the latest new release under BCI's Ink & Paint brand.  This cartoon, a spin-off of the then-popular THE ARCHIE SHOW and originally paired with the adventures of SABRINA THE TEENAGE WITCH, is a long-awaited release that has finally come to DVD in a package featuring the complete series on 3 discs.

An exponent of the classic Universal Monsters craze that began in the 1960's (and was still going strong in the '70's), GROOVIE GOOLIES was a gang of friendly, rock-and-roll-playing monsters whose adventures acted as a sort of monsterized kids' version of ROWAN AND MARTIN'S LAUGH-IN, following almost the same format right down to the wall of windows (here christened ""Weird Window Time"") where the characters told jokes and one-liners.  In addition to Drac, the other Goolies were Frankie (the friendly, sweetly goofy Frankenstein's Monster), Wolfie (a hip, surfing, hot-rod-driving, practical-joking Werewolf), Mummy, Boneapart (a skeleton who fell apart as often as not), the sexy Vampira-inspired Bella LaGhostley, wacky witch-cook Hagatha, and a host of others.  Sabrina makes appearances as well, along with some of the other characters from her show (which deserves its own release as a companion to this set, as the Goolies originated on SABRINA).  The pacing of each episode is frenetic, which helps with some of the humor; many of the jokes are enormously corny, but the delivery and speed with which they are told makes them funny, and the character voices are top-notch talent, featuring Howard Morris and Larry Storch doing most of the characters.

Each episode also featured fun, cute and funky soft-rock songs that were usually somehow related to the show (two per episode), and the Goolies actually scored a Top Ten hit during the '70's with ""Chick-A-Boom,"" which is also here.  The episodes have been well restored, with vibrant color, and the artwork, which Filmation has usually excelled at, really stands out.

Extras include commentary for two episodes, featuring Lou Schemier (head of Filmation during its run),historian Darrel McNeil, monster expert Bob Burns and GOOLIES head writer Jack Mendelsohn, hosted by voice-over artist Wally Wingert.  Wingert also appears as one of the stars of a ""docu-comedy"" called GOOLIANS, which combines documentary material with a sitcom format.  In this feature (which runs almost like a GOOLIES episode) Wingert and fellow Goolian Daniel Roebuck (of LOST), both self-confessed monster freaks, are sent on a mission to gather information about the Groovie Goolies to cure their classic monster fixation.  From my point of view, there isn't anything wrong with a classic monster fixation, but along the way we hear from Mendelsohn, Schemier, Alice Cooper (who originated the monsters/rock music connection), Ron Chaney (grandson of Lon Jr.), Forrest J. Ackerman (ex-FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND publisher) and more, so maybe it's a good thing.

If you're looking for a way to introduce your kids to the idea that sometimes scary can be fun, grab this set; it's a great Halloween treat and a wonderful return visit from some old fiends.  To quote Frankie, ""We NEEDED that!""",1162080000,35,3690,5.166107382550336
