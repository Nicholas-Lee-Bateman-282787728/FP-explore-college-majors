Andrews DVD Review: This wacky tribute film THE BEATLES AND WORLD WAR II [aka ALL THIS AND WORLD WAR II] features all of The Beatles songs, but features The Beatles songs sung instead by a diverse group of artists against a background of World War II images, and has been revamped and re-edited into this new 1976 film.

The film, directed by Tony Palmer, features many of the most famous groups and artists of the 1970s, including the Bee Gees, the Four Seasons, Elton John, Keith Moon, Tina Turner, Peter Gabriel, Helen Reddy, Frankie Valli and Jeff Lynne to name but a few singing their versions of The Beatles songs against a documentary and newsreel footage of the Second World War.

The 1976 film THE BEATLES AND WORLD WAR II was the strangest mix of cinema and combining World War II images, via newsreels as well as Hollywood films made at that time, which featured the music of The Beatles, but not The Beatles original recordings, but cover versions that is featured by various artists, but critics declared the end result as disastrous. The original distributor junked the film so completely that no copies survived, and the film took on its iconic status and one I really loved when I viewed it in the cinema.

Although the original 1976 film had disappeared, thanks to the indifference and stupidity of the original distributor, said director Tony Palmer, instinctively I felt the central idea, and the material, and of course the music, was just too good to be lost forever. So for those fans that have had to rely on a few very poor quality extracts on YouTube, the 2016 film is a completely new experience, much of it in HD and they have used some of the original tracks, but added a lot of new archive footage, some of them never seen before.

In addition, they have used totally different music and the film starts with Vaughan Williams, and ends with Shostakovich, taking in Sergei Rachmaninoff and including many famous people that were prominent around the period of the Second World War which includes Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, Bernard Montgomery [Viscount Montgomery of Alamein], Bob Hope, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Joseph P. Kennedy, Joseph Stalin, Humphrey Bogart, Milton Berle, Neville Chamberlain, Richard Burton, Winston Churchill and many others.

The film makes reference to war-torn Syria, but before that be prepared to see some really unsettling and shocking images at the end of World War Two, where we witness the news footage of all the starving and emancipated people in the concentration camps and all the emancipated dead people who were put in the mass graves. But equally shocking is all the shocking images of the conflict in Syria and the thoroughly shameful and belligerent attitude from the monstrous Syrian regime towards his own civilised people of Syria, especially with the consequences relating to all the death and destruction we get to view, which is so upsetting and heart breaking, especially the heart and soul of Syria and will make you extremely angry what you view of what horrible monsters can do to the casualties in any wars throughout civilizations past and present.

This film itself is a far more complex than the original aka All This And World War II film, and I hope it will give everyone pause for thought about our troubled world in which we live. So sit back and enjoy a totally new experience of matching most of The Beatles brilliant music and songs, with the combination of equally brilliant film clips old and new to match The Beatles music and songs throughout this brilliant DVD video extravaganza. One thing I can assure you that when you view this unique musical film documentary, is that you will experience massive amounts of rollercoaster emotions, like joy and happiness, but equally lots of sadness, and especially you will view some horrendous newsreel film clips, that I know you will shed a great many tears and and outrage anger in what you view. But despite this, it is a totally brilliant concept of especially featuring The Beatles songs combined with the newsreel film clips, that fits so perfectly and a great job all round.

DVD Image Quality  Gonzo Multimedia presents us with image quality that varies a great deal, from very grainy to good quality, but of course I suspect they were only able to source what was available at the time. What you view in mostly in black-and-white images, but now again you get some colour images that again vary in quality, but when you get the more modern colour images near the end of the film, they improve a great deal. So for a DVD it is the best you will ever experience and of course to have been able to upgrade all of the images to 1080i at least, they probably would have had to spend a lot more on the budget. While checking out information on this DVD, I read that you would experience HD quality image, well this not true, as with a DVD you do not get a high definition quality image, but because it was only released on the DVD format, you will of course only get the standard 480i image quality.

DVD Audio Quality  Gonzo Multimedia presents us with just one 2.0 Dolby Digital Stereo Audio track. The audio quality of the newsreel inserts are very clear and precise, especially with the sound recordings feature in the Second World War scenes were not so advanced as to what you expect with modern day recordings, but when you hear The Beatles songs sung by the different Artists, the sound quality is really excellent and on par with a compact disc audio quality, that of course compensates for the 480i image quality you view.

Compact Disc Audio Quality  Gonzo Multimedia has given us two prestigious and stunning audio compact discs with presentations of The Beatles songs sung by different Artists. The quality is absolutely outstanding and you get to hear all the songs in the full, compared to how they break up the songs in the film. The orchestration by The London Symphony Orchestra and The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra with the singing Artists are totally awesome and you get a real clarity, warmth and rich sounds that really show off the professional and beautiful production values of the whole package and the Artists really pay homage to The Beatles in their interpretations of their songs in a unique and special way. The only thing is that people have complained about the intrusion of the audio extracts at the start of some of the songs from the politicians, comedians and the Germans, but they only last for about 30 seconds to just over a minute, but of course the best aspect of these compact discs is the very professional song presentations that are so utterly brilliant, and of course they compensate for the audio intrusion in the film documentary. But one wonderful rare bonus is revealed on the second compact disc with track number eleven, where we get an audio recording of John Lennon talking about world peace and it was so great to hear his words of wisdom from one of main contributor to The Beatles, who is now sadly missed.

BONUS: Includes a wonderful colourful 12 page booklet that goes into great detail about the reboot of the original film ALL THIS AND WORLD WAR II that is very informative and has wonderful images of the artists that sings The Beatles songs and has an in-depth interview with Tony Palmer which adds a great deal to this wonderful DVD release.

Finally, THE BEATLES AND WORLD WAR II is a weird and quirky film, where the 1976 musical documentary juxtaposes The Beatles songs, performed by a number of artists and musicians, with World War II newsreel footage and 20th Century Fox films from the 1940s onwards. Sadly this musical documentary only lasted two weeks in cinemas, because people took the film too serious and didn't get its hard hitting message. The original intention of the filmmakers was to use The Beatles actual music in the film, but instead the decision was to use  other artists covering The Beatles music was made by the film's producers after they realised additional money could be made through a soundtrack album. The decision was a sound one, as the soundtrack Compact Disc actually generated more revenue than the film. The original film has sadly never been officially released on any home video format, but bootleg copies of the film were available at the time via several dedicated collector-to-collector resources. But now for the first time a high quality transfer is now available with this unofficial DVD release and is well worth the purchase and it brought back so many fond memories when I first viewed the music film documentary at the cinema, so well done Gonzo Multimedia in making someone very happy. Highly Recommended!

8756421,2,B01DM592T4,"I was very excited to see this release become available...though I was a bit skeptical, with the title being ""The Beatles and World War II"" as opposed to the original release title of ""All This and World War II"". Most of us have been familiar with the soundtrack but had never actually SEEN the movie.
Well, we STILL haven't, as proven by the below interview excerpt from the included package booklet (EC stands for Ear Candy magazine)

EC: After all these years, what inspired you to revisit this project?
Tony Palmer: Instinctively I felt the central idea, and the material, and of course the music, were just too good to be lost forever.
EC: Were there any legal hurdles to ""re-booting"" the film?
Tony Palmer: The film is completely new, although using some of the original tracks, which we licensed from the MCPS, and a lot of new library footage.
EC: I mean, even to use the name ""Beatles"" in a film don't you have to get permission from Apple?
Tony Palmer: Well, it is The Beatles music, although not performed by them which is where the 'permission' would be required. Should I say that the music is by Freddie & The Dreamers?
EC: Who owns the original, ""All This and World War II""?
Tony Palmer: As it is a new film, we needed to have it copyrighted, which we have done.
EC: Again, were there any obstacles to using some of the same footage?
Tony Palmer: Much of the footage we have used is public domain, or from the Imperial War Museum.
EC: One thing I really liked about the original film was the order of the storyline (I'm a big history buff) and the clever way lyrics were placed with the images (Like showing Chamblerlain with ""Living is easy with Eyes Closed"" from ""Strawberry Fields"".) Watching it again last time I also noticed that the ship cannons in ""Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds""match the drums in one part. Will the new film follow that same formula?
Tony Palmer: Sometimes, but I had a lot of new ideas.
EC: Seeing the list of songs used in the new film, I noticed that several from the 1976 version were now gone: ""Magical Mystery Tour"", ""We Can Work It Out"", ""Lovely Rita"", ""Because"", ""She Came In Through The Bathroom Window"", ""Polythene Pam"", ""Sun King"", ""You Never Give Me Your Money"", ""The End"". Did you feel these were no longer relevant to the re-edit?
Tony Palmer: Correct.
EC: And what inspired you to bring in the music of Shostakovich?
Tony Palmer: It was, and is, relevant to the new edit. For instance, the new closing sequence is all about Hiroshima, and much though I love the Beatles' music, I didn't think their music was up to it, emotionally,or intellectually.

So, interesting to see, but NOT historically accurate. Also, the film maker has added politically-charged current-events footage from Syria...trying to make a point/connection, but ruining the experience of the original film.

Nice to watch once; won't watch again.",1479427200,10,2871,4.669960474308301
8756422,5,B01DM592T4,"I've been waiting for both the CDs and the DVD for what feels like forever - forty years! I saw this several times when it came out, and drove up to the Cineramadome Hollywood to do it! Plus, this collection even includes the added bonus of famous movie and historical sound bites from clips in the movie. BONUS! The only thing that has changed is the title. THANK YOU!",1477440000,,369,4.36231884057971
