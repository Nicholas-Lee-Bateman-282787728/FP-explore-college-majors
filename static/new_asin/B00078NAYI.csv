8045867,4,B00078NAYI,"Defunct distributor Catcom Home Entertainment has been one of the better purveyors of public-domain titles in terms of quality-for-price, and this double dose of 1940s Hollywood drama is no exception.  Michael Curtiz's 'Life with Father' (Warner Bros., 1947) is something of a classic, based on the writings of Clarence Day and starring screen icons William Powell and Irene Dunne, with a nice supporting cast including a young Elizabeth Taylor.  It's prim and touching-- as one would expect from a movie of its pedigree-- and tempered with humor that succeeds thanks a little more to its talented players than to its quaint situations.  4-minus stars.  The print here appears to be not much different than most other unrestored versions I've seen, that is, offering a somewhat fuzzy early Technicolor-process image with minimal age-related wear.  Audio clarity, however, is superior.  Stuart Heisler's 'Smash-Up: The Story of a Woman' (Universal, 1947) is straight social melodrama featuring Susan Hayward, Eddie Albert and some lesser-known but reliable character actors from the period.  Solid stuff, if a bit maudlin at times.  3-plus stars.  Source print is decent, though Catcom's transfer isn't the sharpest I've encountered (I would recommend VCI's as the best).  Content and presentation combined rate about 3 1/2 stars.",1384214400,3,1329,5.439024390243903
