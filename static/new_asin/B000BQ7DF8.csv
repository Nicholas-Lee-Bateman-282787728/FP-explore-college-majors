Note to all discerning caregivers of fancy toddlers:
If you are expecting Baby Einstein, go BUY Baby Einstein. It'll save you the hassle of coming back to complain that this clearly inferior, much lower-priced Baby Tutor DVD is not a glossy, higher-end Baby Einstein DVD in disguise. The cheesy graphics shown in the pic are what you will see on your TV! Your kid might still love it!",1393632000,,636,4.389830508474576
8090934,1,B000BQ7DF8,this is trash don't waste money or time on this or any of the other videos by this company. poor quality and sound. teaches nothing no actual words to teach kids just poor sound affects and picture.,1358208000,,198,4.378378378378378
8090935,5,B000BQ7DF8,"My nephew is 2.5 years old and he loves to watch this video over and over.  He does love all trains, but also enjoys the other things that go.  He has tons of Thomas the train videos but they just don't hold his attention the same way because he can't quite understand the story yet.  So if you want something simple for a young child who loves trains, trucks, planes or cars - this might be the video for your family.  His 6 month old brother will watch too because of the soft, classical music they play in the background.  I would also recommend the alphabet and counting videos by the same company.",1261008000,,602,4.292035398230088
8090936,2,B000BQ7DF8,"my son is 2 years-old and loves cars and trucks and i had hoped that this video would suit. he has already watched the baby einstein ""things that go"" to death. however, i was very disappointed when i got this video; it doesn't even come close to baby einstein. the supposed 3-D animation is pathetic and the video as a whole is very slow moving. my son watched it because he loves cars but he was straining to be engaged. it has two levels for younger children and older but the video is really for young infants to stare at objects on the screen that just sit there. waste of money!!!!!!!",1137542400,4,589,4.315315315315315
