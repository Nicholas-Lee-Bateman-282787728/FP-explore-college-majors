4263656,4,B0045UBFOQ,"I think I should have looked in to this DVD more. It is a show and tell the commentary by Wallace and Gromit. While others do the Show.  Very disappointed, I had expected Wallace and Gromit to to all. I am a fan!",1333843200,13,212,3.9302325581395348
4263657,3,B0045UBFOQ,"This is a series of young adult shows on different human inventions, not Wallace & Grommit's.  Kind of disappointed in that but Wallace still plut Grommit in dangerous situations on every show.  For those that are huge W&G fans...do add this to your collection.",1333584000,,261,4.909090909090909
4263658,1,B0045UBFOQ,Not the same as other Wallace and Gromit's.  My kids love all those and Shawn the Sheep.  They say this is just talking with little action or good story.,1333152000,7,153,4.241379310344827
4263659,3,B0045UBFOQ,"I anticipated that this release would be just what it is:  a variety type show with wrap-arounds starring W&G.  Fun stuff to be sure, but make no mistake:  this is NOT a new set of adventures with our pals.

While it's great to have them back, it is a far cry from previous releases.

By all means; if you are a huge fan (as we are) pick this up and enjoy - and maybe even learn something.  Just don't bring any expectations from previous adventures.",1332028800,76,450,4.235294117647059
4263660,1,B0045UBFOQ,"I have two Sony Blu Ray players purchased less than one year apart in 2011.  This dvd does not play on either machine.  The disc starts and will not continue past the first 23 seconds.  I purchased the second dvd to test my players, but the second dvd did not play through either.  I plan on returning both dvds.",1328572800,,312,4.237288135593221
4263661,3,B0045UBFOQ,"First, it would not play in our PS3 or another blu-ray player. We bought a third player and it worked. The show is good but has less W & G than I expected. I thought I would see W & G doing experiments but no. They just introduce stories told by real people on video, not animated. That was disappointing. Now, I like shows that explain stuff and talk about science, so I enjoy the show enough. And I think my son will eventually (he's only 20 months now but we're collecting TV for him for later). It is fairly interesting and informative.",1302393600,7,540,4.252427184466019

4263669,4,B0045UBFOQ,"Great for younger kids to watch and learn. Not so much a cartoon with Wallace and Gromit, rather them narrating us through some real life educational inventors.",1464393600,,160,4.962962962962963

4263674,2,B0045UBFOQ,"This movie wasn't what I expected. My expectations were that it was like the previous Wallace & Gromit movies....all animated! Although this movie had interesting footage and facts, real life stuff, I wasn't very pleased. If I had wanted a documentary  I would have bought a documentary like programs you see on the discovery channel. I would not buy this again and really don't want it in my collection.",1449705600,3,404,4.855072463768116

4263682,5,B0045UBFOQ,The favorite characters narrate a neat walk through history's inventions.  It entertained those up to age 65.,1437177600,,109,5.411764705882353
4263683,3,B0045UBFOQ,"I expected a DVD of Wallace & Gromit's inventions. Instead, I got programs which are introduced by Wallace & Gromit but the actual 'inventions' are live-action footage of people talking about fascinating things in nature. It's not totally uninteresting, but it's mostly NOT Wallace & Gromit. Kind of like the PBS show 'Nature' with small animated bits here and there.",1435536000,7,367,5.133333333333334
4263684,4,B0045UBFOQ,"This disc is basically Wallace & Gromit introducing various science vignettes.  If you're a big Wallace & Gromit fan you will not find this particularly inspired or creative.  Its aimed at youngsters.  I've only watched the first couple of episodes, but found the science bits interesting, fairly well produced and good looking.  Package arrived on-time and undamaged.",1434931200,3,368,5.4035087719298245

4263694,5,B0045UBFOQ,"Wallace & Gromit are always fun.  This combines real people and the stories of their inventions - Wallace & Gromit only introduce and sum-up on these DVDs, but very interesting.",1421798400,,177,4.9
4263695,3,B0045UBFOQ,"It was not clear at the time of purchase, that this was NOT a clay-mation movie. Interesting factoids tho",1421452800,,105,4.578947368421052

4263703,4,B0045UBFOQ,Wasn't quite what I had in mind. But the plus side is it is educational & fun for children.,1414368000,,91,3.8421052631578947
4263704,5,B0045UBFOQ,"Great movie, my son loves it",1414281600,,28,3.8333333333333335
4263705,2,B0045UBFOQ,"What a disappointment.  There is very little Wallace & Gromit here.  The very little is a 'hosting' of sorts of interesting technological developments.  I never would have bought this if I'd had any idea.  And, because I own many W&G videos and love them, it never occurred to me to read reviews, or I would have known.  I'll be reading reviews carefully in the future.  I love the antics of these two in the story-type videos.  There's none of that here, so nothing to love.",1412121600,2,475,4.517647058823529
4263706,1,B0045UBFOQ,"This movie is not a full cartoon of Wallace and Gromit.  Instead, it is 6 episodes of real life invention videos with Wallace and Gromit introductions.  My children were very disappointed.",1409184000,5,188,5.032258064516129
4263707,5,B0045UBFOQ,It's Wallace & Gromit! What else can I say?,1407888000,,43,3.888888888888889
4263708,2,B0045UBFOQ,"I was expecting more Wallace and Grommet, instead I got too much real world footage of inventions. I was not expecting this. My 3 year old doesn't like it either.

I have seen other Wallace and Grommet videos and they are great. This one is just in a different category.",1407369600,,270,4.4
4263709,5,B0045UBFOQ,"Great price, unique items, perfect condition and fast ship!",1405987200,,59,5.666666666666667
4263710,2,B0045UBFOQ,"Not what I wanted at all. I was a bit hasty in ordering this DVD, saw Wallace and Gromit and just went for it. I guess if you have kids its a good option, but im 20, and just wanted some nostalgia with my favorite characters, very disappointing",1404691200,,244,4.104166666666667
4263711,5,B0045UBFOQ,"Not what I expected, kind of like Bill Nye the Science Guy, but very interesting and informative with Wallace and Gromit humor.
But I did enjoy it very much.",1404259200,,157,4.448275862068965
4263712,3,B0045UBFOQ,This is great for kids. Very informative. Wallace and Gromit do the intros and little appearances but vidio is mostly documentaries on scientific inventions and principles.,1399852800,,172,5.653846153846154
4263713,5,B0045UBFOQ,"Bought this video for my grandson, he loves Wallace an grommet  so was very happy to find this one.  He has most of the series so am always glad to find one he is missing",1398643200,,170,3.8285714285714287
4263714,5,B0045UBFOQ,"Wallace and Gromit aren't easy to find, (off internet).  I bought 3 W&G and 2 Shaun the Sheep, all arrived in ELECELNCE CONDITION and arrived in several days, FREE SHIPPING.  This DVD, was well over a hour long.  It was part cartoon part real time.  The Grandsons loved it.  Will again be using this method of purchasing..",1398297600,,322,4.578947368421052
4263715,5,B0045UBFOQ,"Wallace and Gromit are terrific characters. The DVDs are wonderfully made, they create fun, interesting, and intriguing stories that you can watch over and over, you never tire of watching them. They are so fun, fun, fun.",1397606400,,221,5.0
4263716,4,B0045UBFOQ,Great story and my kid loves wallace and gromit anyway. like it very much. willing to buy more some day.,1397001600,,104,4.25
4263717,4,B0045UBFOQ,"This was a birthday gift for my son! I thought that we were in the stadium when he opened it!!
Came faster than expected and protected very well in shipping!!",1396483200,,158,4.3
4263718,5,B0045UBFOQ,This live action show is great. You get to see real inventors in action and still get splices of Wallace and Gromit. I just love them,1394668800,,133,4.153846153846154
4263719,3,B0045UBFOQ,"It is interesting to watch how things are invented, but for my 5 year old grandson - he prefers to watch Wallace and Gromit themselves.  He is not as interested in the functionality.",1394064000,,182,4.515151515151516
4263720,1,B0045UBFOQ,I ordered this thinking it was a new episode of the adventures of Wallace & Gromit.  It isn't!  It's a collection of film clips about new inventions.  The only role W&G play is as host emcee.  If you're a W&G fan this will be a huge disappointment!  Save your money...this is a bust.  If I could return the product for refund I would!!,1390608000,4,335,4.238095238095238
4263721,5,B0045UBFOQ,"Video of interesting inventions, not all successful or promising.  Presented by Wallace and Gromit, so there is some of their commentary/background ""antics"".  Enjoyed by adults as well as older kids.",1389830400,,199,5.6
4263722,2,B0045UBFOQ,"This isn't a true Wallace and Gromit show, only a little bit of Wallace and Gromit to accompany other pieces of live action, very disappointed.",1388793600,,143,4.76
4263723,5,B0045UBFOQ,Adult fun and entertaining. I've been watching these two characters for years. The British accents also make it funnier. Wish I had a dog like Gromit.,1386633600,,150,4.8076923076923075
4263724,5,B0045UBFOQ,"Great fun!  Inventive thinking with a whimsical animated flair.  If you've enjoyed Wallace and Gromit's wild inventions, you will really treasure these real world innovators.",1383955200,,174,5.92
4263725,4,B0045UBFOQ,This was a bit different than the usual whacky W & G fare; I didn't realize that it was 6 episodes from a BBC series about inventions.  Nonetheless it was interesting and fun.  Hope to get more episodes,1375488000,,202,4.2894736842105265
4263726,4,B0045UBFOQ,"Expected something like ""How Its Made"" but didn't deliver that quality.  Interesting enough to watch a few times over. Sitting on the shelf now...",1374451200,,146,5.083333333333333
4263727,2,B0045UBFOQ,"This was not at all what I expected.  Based on their past shows, I was disappointed because I wanted to showcase how good the characters & animation were in other movies an short episodes.  Since I was trying to impress a friend with how great those creators are, I felt your recommending it was only to make a sale, not to provide me with a quality product.",1368662400,,358,4.3283582089552235
4263728,4,B0045UBFOQ,Good fun as only Wallace and Grommit can dish it out.  Fascinating inventions for all ages.  Learn and laugh at the same time.,1365638400,,126,4.434782608695652
4263729,3,B0045UBFOQ,"Apparently I did not read the description at all. This is not a movie of my little goof-balls, but rather a collection of perhaps TV series. I am not sure. Inventive as always, but I should have read more before purchasing the product. Hope the grandkids will like it anyway.",1364774400,,275,4.52
4263730,3,B0045UBFOQ,"My kids love Wallace & Gromit, and I thought I was buying them a DVD of some of their episodes we had somehow missed. No.. this is the duo narrating 6 episodes about bizzare inventions, not the humorous claymation I thought I was getting for my children. I am sure it will be interesting to watch once, but not something my kids will watch over and over and make worthy of purchasing it. I should have paid more attention to what I was buying I guess!",1363392000,,451,4.255813953488372
4263731,3,B0045UBFOQ,"I enjoy Wallace & Gromit, but this DVD is so little about Wallace & Gromit, that to be called theirs, its almost misleading. Not worth the money, find it to rent somewhere.",1362096000,4,172,4.40625
4263732,5,B0045UBFOQ,"Gromit is our favorite dog (OK together with Shaun the Sheep and that dog)  I originally ordered all these
movies for my grand daughter but the audience is always the three of us we love it!",1359676800,,190,4.277777777777778
4263733,5,B0045UBFOQ,Entertaining and educational.  My son really enjoyed it and I wish there were more available.  Entertaining for adults as well.,1359417600,,127,5.3

4263735,2,B0045UBFOQ,This is a DVD all about the inventions of Wallace and Gromit. Not a video for kids as we had hoped.,1359072000,,99,3.761904761904762
4263736,3,B0045UBFOQ,"I should have read the fine print.  I thought this was a new wallace and gromit claymation comedy.  It's actually information videos.  Very interesting for adults or older kids.  My husband enjoyed it, but it didn't hold the attention of my kids aged 2-9.",1358985600,,255,4.7272727272727275
4263737,5,B0045UBFOQ,This is like watching NOVA hosted by Wallace and Gromit.  Very intersting and informative even for adults.  This is great for all ages.,1357948800,,135,4.826086956521739
4263738,2,B0045UBFOQ,"We looked at it and really didn't enjoy it.  It might be great for someone, but the audience we had were younger children between 7 and 10.",1357084800,,139,4.148148148148148
4263739,5,B0045UBFOQ,"This is an incredible collection of videos about big and small, successful and failed, famous and obscure inventors and their creations. It is excellent for the whole family. We have all been inspired by these videos to come up with new ideas and try things we wouldn't have tried otherwise. The W & G segments are hilarious, but even the inventor documentary sections are funny and uplifting. This collection of videos really makes you appreciate human ingenuity, and quite honestly, I think this video makes the world a better place!",1356912000,2,535,4.955555555555556
4263740,4,B0045UBFOQ,"When I ordered it, I thought it was the latest in the series of excellent Wallace & Gromit adventures, but they are ""hosting"" a TV show, similar to a PBS science special, and the grand kids and I ended up liking it a lot.",1353974400,,221,4.045454545454546
4263741,5,B0045UBFOQ,Here I am at 44 years old and my 3 and 6 year old got this video.  I am hooked on Wallace and Gromit.  What a great couple guys doing some funny stuff.  Good movie and hope they come out with more.  Great buy for the money.,1353715200,,223,3.6808510638297873
4263742,1,B0045UBFOQ,"We have enjoyed all of the Wallace & Gromit DVDs to date, with that said we did not hesitate to order ""A world of Adventure"". We were disappointed to learn that Wallace and Gromit only conduct introductions and comment on various politically correct story lines dealing with history, science etc. Regardless of ones political views, it would be nice to be entertained and not spoon fed someone else's propaganda. Seriously, the creators of W & G should stick to that which made them wildly successful and forget the PC.",1352073600,7,519,4.842696629213483
4263743,5,B0045UBFOQ,"My 7 year old son was mesmerized by this DVD.  He couldn't wait to show me the walking creatures made out of PVC piping.  It was amazing.  I love that it's showing homegrown inventors from around the world.  It's so great for the kids to have exposure to lives and inspiring ideas put into action from beyond our borders.  In fact my son just said, ""Watching this makes me want to go into the garage and invent something"".  Also, needless to say, the various W&G vignettes, including the elephant-gas-run contraption, kept him chuckling.",1346198400,8,537,4.720430107526882
4263744,5,B0045UBFOQ,"OK, OK, we too were surprised when we got it out of the library that it was Wallace and Gromit hosting a show about inventors and their inventions, and not a series of Wallace and Gromit shorts with all their crazy inventions.

Well the fact is it is so amazing, we are buying it for gifts for young and old alike.  You will be stunned by the REAL inventions out there, and the stories behind them.  If you have a curious mind, or you want to inspire curiosity in a young one, then this is a movie for you.

And as a reminder it just has short cute vignettes of Wallace and Gromit, but the real stars are the REAL inventions.",1344384000,62,625,4.140495867768595

4263747,2,B0045UBFOQ,"I wish that I would have researched this product before pre-ordering but the Wallace and Gromit name made me think that I was getting that!  It's not that they aren't in the video but this is really a kids educational series with some W&G interstitials.  Very disappointing to me and I would imagine that the replay value wouldn't even be that great for almost any kid!

There was little here for me and nothing for my 16 year old son.",1335398400,23,435,4.4125
4263748,5,B0045UBFOQ,This is a great tool for older children to get them thinking.  The possibilities of putting thought into action.  Pretty cool inventions are shown.  If you thought it was an animated show you will be in for a let down.  There are between inventions small bits of Wallace and Gromit.,1335398400,5,282,4.58
4263749,1,B0045UBFOQ,"Delivery was great from Amazon, disappointed in DVD. Was expecting more Wallace and Gromit, not just them announcing each invention. Was not what I expected.",1334620800,8,157,5.32
4263750,4,B0045UBFOQ,"I recently received this and watched it with my 7 & 10 year old sons.  This is a series of National-Geographic-flavored-but-cool-enough-to-compete-on-Saturday-morning shows (Children of the 70s, think Big Blue Marble).  Segments are introduced by our friends from Wallaby Way, but the core of the show is real-life footage of inventors, hobbyists, and tinkerers showing off their cool gadgets.  They have a segment on Theo Jansen, the guy who makes those amazing wind-driven walking 'animals' that stalk beaches.  Cool stuff.  The level of the engineering is ~2-3rd grade.  My 10 year old thought the inventions were cool, but he definitely could have handled more detail.  The 7 year old liked it after his initial disappointment that it wasn't a 'real' Wallace and Grommet show.  Overall, absolutely worth a look, but make sure you're aware what you're buying!",1334188800,29,862,5.286764705882353

8416853,4,B0045UBFOQ,A good mix of a documentary about some wonderful inventions and classic Wallace and Gromit silliness. I think this would be better if you're a fan of the series like me.,1510012800,,169,4.483870967741935
8416854,1,B0045UBFOQ,"This DVD is not really about Wallace and Gromit. They just introduce news clips about regular (human) inventors. If you love Wallace and Gromit, watch The Curse of the Were-Rabbit again. That's really them.",1509235200,,206,5.088235294117647
