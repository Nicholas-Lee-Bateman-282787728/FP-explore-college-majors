8014164,5,B0001LOT6O,"First of all, I love Disciple.  Their music is phenomenal stuff.  But, I not only love their music, but I especially love how God is front and center in their music.  He's definitely front and center at their concerts, as well.

With that said, this is one of the best band DVDs I have seen.  The concert of Disciple at Cornerstone is really a great performance to own on DVD.  This performance was right around the time the band released ""Back Again,"" so most of the songs are from that fantastic album.  There are also a good number of songs from ""This Might Sting a Little"" and ""By God"" (the two great Disciple albums before ""Back Again"").  So, if you're a fan of those three albums, you're sure to love this live performance.

The music videos of the songs ""Back Again"" and the rough cut of ""One More Time"" are pretty good, too.  The producer goes through and shows us how they made the ""Back Again"" video and it was really pretty interesting to see that process.

However, I would say where this DVD really shines is the behind the scenes time with Disciple.  It is great to get a look into the lives of Brad, Kevin, and Tim (Joey hadn't joined the band yet) as they show us their homes and we get to meet their families.  It's interesting and often quite hilarious to see what the guys like to do in their spare time and what they like to collect.  Most of the time is spent showing us what they do when they're not performing while they're on the road.  Seeing Disciple go golfing and seeing Kevin ""battle"" some kids in one of those blow-up fighting ring games at a church festival are just two of the great highlights.  There's a lot of great stuff in this section.  It really shows what down-to-earth guys that the guys of Disciple really are.

All in all, it's just a great DVD... especially if you're a fan of Disciple or Christian hard rock music.  I'd highly recommend checking it out!  Disciple rocks!",1176163200,5,1915,4.401709401709402
