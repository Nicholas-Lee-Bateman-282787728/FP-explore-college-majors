1421509,5,B00005BCK2,"The pictures were beautiful, the music inspiring, but just one technical nit-pick:  The DVD was presented in LETTERBOX, with permanent black bars at the top and bottom as part of the image.  Haven't the folks in educational TV yet heard of ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN?  An anamorphic presentation would fill a widescreen TV properly.  Granted, my widescreen TV can expand the image to fill the screen and look approximately like it should, but I lose some resolution when I do that.  Hurry up, intelligentsia, and catch up with Hollywood!",1087516800,3,532,5.068965517241379
1421510,5,B00005BCK2,"From the earliest images of Jesus to modern time, this documentary covers an enormous variety of styles, from many countries. One glaring omission, is that it does not include any Russian icons, but that aside, this is worthwhile viewing for anyone interested in the history of Christian art. Many of the world's masterpieces have Jesus as the central image, and this film starts with some of the best, by Giotto, and his fabulous frescoes in a 14th century chapel in Padua.
Among the myriad of images, some of my favorites are an exquisite statue, probably the earliest known (about the year 290) of a young Jesus as ""The Good Shepherd"" from the Vatican, the work in the St. Catherine Monastery at Sinai, many replicas of The Mandillion, the original which is said to have been lost in a fire, and ""The Light of the World"" by William Holman Hunt, a 19th century English artist.
There are the great masters like Michelangelo, Leonardo, Rembrandt, and Grunewald, as well as 14th century Ethiopian images, Latin American art, some from Asia, and one from India in the Islamic tradition that is a curiosity piece.
It also examines illustration in the most widely distributed image of Jesus, Werner Sallman's ""Head of Christ"", as well as more contemporary examples by African American folk artist William H. Johnson, Marc Chagall, and Andy Warhol.
It ends with the extraordinary stained glass windows at the Notre Dame Cathedral.
Written by Dr. James Clifton and directed by Craig MacGowan, one of the visual techniques this film uses to great effect is the morphing of many images. It has several narrators, among them Mel Gibson, Edward Herrmann, Ricardo Montalban and Patricia Neal, and has a wide array of musical selections as a soundtrack. Filmed in widescreen, the color reproduction is excellent, and total running time approximately two hours.
As many call Jesus ""the image of the invisible God"", and man has been made in God's image, this documentary states, ""is it any wonder that the faces given to Christ are as numerous as the peoples of the earth"".",1080950400,12,2059,4.919540229885057
1421511,4,B00005BCK2,"this is a clever work which looks at the evolution (and not much at the history!) of the representation of jesus's face, over a period of time overlapping christendom. not sure how comprehensive it is but it seems so. at the limit, it could be viewed as a good timeline of (christian) iconography.
full rich with spectacular visuals brought about by the use of morphic transformations. when the show is over, the viewer is left definitely thinking.
it appeals well to those interested in the history of religions (especially christian), art historians, and everybody in between.",1051056000,7,578,5.03125
1421512,5,B00005BCK2,"This is a fabulously beautiful documentary of iconography of Christ through the centuries, and the narration and background music are overall (i.e., in spite of occasional oddities) perfect complements.  I sort of wonder why Mel Gibson and Ricardo Montalban were asked to serve as narrators here, but Gibson gets extra points for pronouncing Hagia Sophia so creditably :-) The bit where the computer graphics move from face to face is marvelous.  The music for the interior of the cathedral at Chartres is, surprisingly, rather brutal;  and (I think I remember this running during a shot of San Giovanni in Laterano) the synthesized ""How Lovely Is Thy Dwelling Place"" from the Brahms German Requiem is an odd choice, though it doesn't sound godawful.  For me, a composer with an artist wife, the low point was some of the (by turns) hideous and sickly-sweet modern stuff, because it is certainly possible to do new work which is beautiful, and to do beautiful work which is not saccharine - and iconography of Christ ought to be beautiful, and ought not to be sugary.  But these moments occupy relatively little space.  Occasional weird things in the narration - how, exactly, are Christ's features in Michelangelo's ""Final Judgement"" in the Sistine Chapel those ""of Apollo""? - there is glancing reference to the Sistine Chapel being the ""most private chapel in the world,"" yet considering the flood of tourists which passes through it every day, it is actually, more likely, the most PUBLIC chapel in the world.  For the most part, though, the narration is simply informative, and balanced.  Our century, with its own morbid preoccupations, holds the grotesque work of Hieronymous Bosch in high regard;  and the narration rightly says that it inspires horror;  we then move to the Chartres cathedral, and quotations from the age to the effect of the beauty of the architecture and art raising our earthly souls to an awareness of heaven - and here, in this seeming aside, we have the heart of iconography.  The depiction of Christ serves a spiritual purpose, it is not a mere exercise for a modern artist to express his personal dissatisfaction with the world around him (like the Belgian artist who self-servingly ""equates"" public dislike for his ""art"" with the sufferings of Christ ... puh-leeze ... his beef is with an allegedly ""cynical and stupid"" public, but perhaps he should have taken a good look in the mirror).
But these (for me) flaws are abundantly compensated for, there are wonders which space does not allow for much more than listing ... the ancient Ethiopian icons, with the peculiarly primitive heads, no less devotional;  a peek at Raphael's ""Triumph"" in the Stanza della Segnatura in the Vatican (in the same room facing the School of Athens, though generally less famous except to artists and theologians);  the incomplete sculpture Michelangelo had intended for his tombstone;  Rembrandt's self-portraiture in the Crucifixion (i.e., one of those raising the cross ... nothing like the self-proclaimed martyrdom of the Belgian, above) and the Descent from the Cross;  the Veronica icon, and the Pantocrator from the monastery at Mt Sinai.
Some wonderful surprises, too, such as the ""three-headed"" Latin American depictions of the Trinity which, while they are dubious as iconography, are fascinating cultural and artistic documents;  and a Latin American Last Supper, featuring a roast pig at the Passover which must be a visual malopropism for the ages ....
Beautiful, stunning and informative.",1040860800,32,3518,5.113438045375218
1421513,5,B00005BCK2,"This is simply one of the best documentaries I have ever seen.  It is visually stunning, and well-researched.  This should be required viewing for any introductory art history class, as well as for any person who intends to travel and wants to understand some of the art they will be seeing.",995328000,7,291,4.686274509803922
1421514,4,B00005BCK2,This is an interesting look at Jesus through the eyes of many cultures and religions.  It is informative and enlightning.  Anyone who believes in Jesus should own this film. Like Jesus this film will stand the test of time.,992995200,3,223,4.6923076923076925
1421515,5,B00005BCK2,"This video has been a blessing-- I orginally viewed it during the Easter Season.  It is a beautifully written, filmed and narrated work of art in it's own right. A reverend but wholly joyful testamant to the love and awe that man has tried to offer back to God in his desire to portray Jesus, the Christ in each of their own times.  It was compelling to see how artists at each moment in time sought to picture the Christ for their audiences-and more --how they speak to us even now. It was fascinating to see how each time frame sought to answer Jesus' question to us --""Who do you say I am?""",991612800,3,593,4.238938053097345
1421524,1,B00005BCK2,"I can't believe I watched the same program that others have said they used for classroom teaching.  It was an extremely facile and unanalytical treatment of the subject.

I would recommend that any showing of this film in a classroom be accompanied by a critique of the contextual assumptions implicit in this production.

I am very glad that I previewed this before not buying it for my library.",1231286400,4,396,4.794117647058823
1421525,5,B00005BCK2,"Very informative and incredibly well done. A thorough history of how the face of Jesus has been depicted throughout the ages. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone with an interest in Art History or Christianity.

1421526,5,B00005BCK2,The morphing from one picture of Jesus to another is moving. The documentary is respectful and not at all like some Jesus documentaries that belittle one's faith.,1199145600,,162,5.037037037037037
1421527,4,B00005BCK2,"If you have to teach 30,000 years of Art History in a semester, this is a great tool.  I use the first chapter (""In the Beginning) to illustrate the origins of Christian art.  There is very little ""faith based"" information, just a lot of facts.  Most of the art is viewed in context rather than in museums with cultural explanations.",1175731200,,333,4.516666666666667
1421528,5,B00005BCK2,"The works selected are often some of the most significant and well-regarded images of Jesus.  Clearly, a great deal of thought and scholarship went into selecting the works and the way they are put together.  The music enhances the visual a great deal.  Unfortunately, the music for the most part is a ""stylized"" sampling of something else, and not either an original soundtrack, nor a complete performance that is used.  There is a composer given music credit for the show, but the score is a lot of ""samples"" from other literature including Godspell and other Jesus related works, that are ""homogenized"" to create a ""new"" work.  As careful as the producers are in production, their lack of citations of original art works and locations, and original music and composers, is disappointing and not of the level of the production.  A little more detail to the citations would have made the work even more special.",1167523200,3,912,4.8896103896103895

1421531,5,B00005BCK2,"Estamos sin lugar a dudas frente a un documental excepcional. Pocas veces y de manera tan exquisita y erudita, se ha podido presentar una produccin acerca del rostro de Cristo en el arte universal con una calidad tan singular. No creo que haga falta agregar nada ms a lo dicho, sino solamente recomendarlo. Sin embargo, quisiera comentar, que en lo concerniente al barroco peruano, se presenta una ltima Cena en la que Cristo, rodeado de sus discpulos, tiene como centro de la mesa, una bandeja con un conejillo de indias o cuy, como le llamamos en el Per, hecho que obviamente captur el inters de los realizadores. Se trata de una expresin ms del color local que ti al barroco, durante los siglos XVII y XVIII, principalmente, en los pases iberoamericanos como el Per, y que es parte de lo que algunos sealan como sincretismo y otros prefieren llamar sntesis. En el documental se asevera que dicho cuadro est en el Convento de San Francisco de la ciudad del Cusco. Recuerdo haber recorrido dicho convento (solo una vez en el ao 2001), pero no recuerdo haber visto ese cuadro. Recuerdo, mas bien, otros de maestros tan importantes como Quispe Tito. A riesgo de equivocarme, podra decir que tal vez se trate del lienzo de Marcos Zapata, notabilsimo maestro indgena del siglo XVIII y que est colgado en la Catedral del Cusco. Si observan bien, aparte del conejillo de indias, como plato principal, observarn sobre la mesa dos fuentes complementarias. Una con mazorcas de choclo (o maz) del Valle Sagrado de los Incas. Otra en la que destacan ajes o pimientos picantes tpicos del Per, as como botellicas de aguardiente, interesante reminiscencia del autntico pisco del Per, y frutos dulces sobre la mesa, como la granadilla y, tambin, las chutas o panes redondos elaborados en la villa de Oropesa, asiento del marquesado que se halla al sur del Cusco y cuyo titular detentara el derecho a la sucesin del trono de los Incas en una hipottica restauracin monrquica. Otro de estos cuadros, se puede admirar en el Convento de San Francisco el Grande de Lima, con muy parecidos motivos y con el famoso conejillo de indias como plato principal sobre la mesa. El autor, si la memoria no me traiciona, fue el hermano De la Puente de orgen flamenco.",1120435200,6,2236,4.765463917525773

7937170,4,B00005BCK2,"Excellent narrators and a visually stunning images make this documentary about how artists have depicted Jesus over the centuries a keeper. Stacy Keach, Patricia Neal, Mel Gibson, Edward Herrman and Ricardo Montalban lend their expressive voices. The montage with images of Jesus morphed into the last few seconds of the work is incredible. If I had to quibble about this, I'd say that it glosses over the 20th century and spends a little too much time on the iconoclasts. How many images of white paint splashing and brushes covering art do we really need to make the point? We use this documentary at home as a prayer focus to let the images wash over us as we meditate.",1237507200,,672,4.703389830508475
