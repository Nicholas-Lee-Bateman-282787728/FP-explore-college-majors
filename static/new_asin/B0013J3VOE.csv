What she doesn't know is her family and his family have a history which complicates things even more.  This is a feel good movie, bring it back to USA format.",1256342400,,252,4.229166666666667
8251146,5,B0013J3VOE,"This is a lighthearted movie with great characters and scenes that make you laugh out loud!  Very clean, family friendly, and sweet...originally aired on TV so you can probably catch it around Valentine's Day or Christmas.

Its basically a Romeo/Juliet story with a modern-day comical twist.  Two families that own neighboring vineyards have been at war for several decades, but when the children become adults, they scheme together for the sake of making a prudent business deal.  They fall in love as they are trying to get their families to agree to the deal, but they don't realize it until the story reaches a hilarious climax.",1204761600,,632,4.933962264150943
8251147,5,B0013J3VOE,"A MUST SEE if you're an Italian Mother or Daughter(and even if you're not). Lighthearted, funny and romantic. Have been trying to get it FOREVER! Wish it was available in the correct format for US distribution.",1203465600,,210,4.861111111111111
