7688673,5,B01CQOVHPO,I really like the concept of two movies on each disc,1473120000,,52,3.8181818181818183
7688674,5,B01CQOVHPO,"My whole family enjoyed these films and ""You Gotta Stay Happy,"" which is arguably the least known of the four was by far the biggest hit with the kids.  That B/W screwball comedy still has the power to bring out lots of laughs and Stewart and Joan Fontaine performed well together.  Harvey is Harvey, and probably is better as a play than as a movie (which Stewart himself claimed), but suffers a bit from being dated.  Winchester '73 is a great Western and the real star of the series.  The Glenn Miller Story was slow, but interesting, nonetheless as a historical tale, though it seemed like it would be forever before Miller's classical swing music would dominate the soundtrack.

The packaging and quality of the discs seem fine. Only the Glen Miller Story is in color.",1469491200,6,773,4.654411764705882

7688699,4,B01CQOVHPO,"""Harvey"" is a classic, and Josephine Hull richly deserved her Best Supporting Actress Oscar, though if it were re-made today it would likely be attacked for taking alcoholism too lightly. ""Winchester '73"" is also a classic as the prized stolen rifle goes through many hands before Stewart gets it back. (In this era of many, many sequels, I used to wonder what would have happened if I went into a Blockbuster and asked one of their know-nothing clerks, ""You have 'Winchester '73' on the shelf, but what about the first seventy-two?"") ""The Glenn Miller Story"" benefits from lots of terrific Big Band music, sometimes with the original performers such as Louis Armstrong and Gene Krupa, but the bio part is largely Hollywoodized. ""You Gotta Stay Happy"" is little known but cute, the way TV sitcoms would become.",1503360000,,810,4.91970802919708

7688709,5,B01CQOVHPO,"I bought this as an economical way to get a DVD copy of The Glenn Miller Story, which I've seen many times, but not lately. Watching it, for me, is akin to eating a favorite meal: You know what to expect, and you're happy when it meets your expectations. Also, I'm a musician, and seeing so many actual musicians of the day in the film -- Louis Armstrong, Gene Krupa, Ben Pollack -- is an added bonus. I will add that upon viewing it again, I had forgotten the extent of its quaintness and innocent charm. The movie was released in 1954, but the tone harkens to a time when movies were more likely to trade realism for sentimentality, and given that Miller was a enormous star and a fallen hero, the tone is no surprise. Already owned Winchester 73 (a superb Stewart western), and I'm looking forward to seeing Harvey - a classic that somehow I've never watched -- and I'll also watch You Gotta Stay Happy, although I'm no fan of screwball romantic comedy, even those including Mr. Stewart. Overall, a great deal, particularly if you enjoy more than one of the included films.",1492128000,2,1076,4.494897959183674

It was indicated that there is a lot of grain on the darker scenes.  Perhaps a bit.
