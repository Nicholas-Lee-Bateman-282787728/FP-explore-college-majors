7071452,5,B00UUOVQ5Y,"In 1959, as a young 1st Class Boy Scout, at an Air Base I met a Boy Scout from West Germany who told me about the Jugend in WW II.  Then on WSYR-TV in Syracuse, New York, I watched an English version of this movie, Die Brucke (German: The Bridge).  Now, as a former USAF Officer, I was pleased to acquire this original for my DVD collection.  Today, many are under the misguided notion the Nazi Jugend (Youth) of Germany died in a state of unquestioning obedience to the Fuhrer.  That is a myth.  Bernhard Wicki's production revealed the antiwar sentiment of Germans after the War.  The film portrayed the true life circumstances of teenage boys and girls in a small town.  Then they were forced to defend their homes and town in a confused battle of injury and death.  Young German Soldiers were expressing humanized emotions at an actual historical moment in a battle that should never have happened.  American Soldiers pleaded with the teenagers in German uniform to just go home; the war was lost.  The real value of this movie is the contents are presented from a German point of view.  It was nominated for an Oscar.  The teenage actors were superb to present what the real tragedies were at the closing days of WW II and the rise of a new mentality in Germany as it returned to the culture of the West again.",1445299200,15,1315,4.4789915966386555
7071453,5,B00UUOVQ5Y,"great movie I saw when it was first released in the 1950s not long after war was over.  First time I had seen WWII thru enemy eyes, well done, the tanks look a bit fake and the US soldiers wearing only helmet liners not steel pots, other minor technical details incorrect but great movie for the reason it was based on experiences of a real Hitler Youth survivor whose group defended a bridge.  Be sure and watch the interview with the author of the book the film is based on that makes the entire video worth the money and something you can't see on youtube, plus seeing this on a large TV screen is great, quality is wonderful.  recommend",1442534400,2,640,4.361344537815126
7071454,5,B00UUOVQ5Y,"Superb. Maybe one of the best war films I have seen. The acting throughout is stunning. Many memorable scenes with noir-like lighting, angles, and perspectives. Surprisingly realistic and gritty battle scenes. I liked that there was not a stitch of sentimentality or a snippet of music in the film. Just a cold and fast-paced treatment of an awesome story. Quite heavy in some places. I was moved. Another stellar Criterion Collection release with a wealth of extras. Highly recommended.",1442016000,,487,5.177215189873418

7071467,5,B00UUOVQ5Y,"This simple, relentless, starkly told tale should be watched and discussed by every high school student.  Technical limitations aside, the film is a powerful statement rich with themes of loyalty, obedience, abuse of power, and love - love of friends for friends, motherly love for son, teacher for his doomed students.  Who does not weep when the mother begs the policeman to jail her son rather than see him sent to the army - both she and the policeman knowing that these promising kids would be nothing more than cannon fodder at the end of the war.

This was a powerful anti-war message in Germany fifty years ago.  This movie needs to be viewed and contemplated in today's world, not to pick apart its technical imperfections, but to think - long and hard - about our own times.  There is a lot to learn by this deceptively simple, black-and-white film.",1476403200,,859,4.7

7071472,5,B00UUOVQ5Y,Great movie.  Story evolves from youthful naive teenage boys in a German village to their futile efforts to stop advancing US Army troops.  Interesting depiction of Germans and Germany at this stage of the war.  Picture quality was excellent for a 57 year old movie.

7071473,2,B00UUOVQ5Y,"This is a poorly done movie in many ways. The acting is stiff and choppy. The plot-is quite weak.  It is an anti-war movie that exploits the ugly side of war by focusing on  patriotic-idealistic young men who  discover for themselves the deadly consequences of being poorly trained, and poorly led immature boy soldiers who were left to fend for themselves in a no win situation.",1465689600,,379,4.712121212121212

7071478,5,B00UUOVQ5Y,"I first saw this film in 1961, when I was in the army and WWII was recent history. It's an anti-war film in some ways similar to 'All Quiet On The Western Front' that portrays the youthful enthusiasm of becoming men. I was in the 101st Airborne Division when fully half of the soldiers joined at 17. I knew many who joined at 16, others at 15 and I knew 4 who managed to join at 14 during WWII. So, it wasn't just a German phenomenon. The tragedy of this story was how a classroom of boys put on uniforms and without training found themselves in combat. This was true for Germany during the last days of the war when Hitler, seeing all was lost, sought to plunge the entire nation into suicide along with himself. Now look at how many child soldiers around the world have emerged since then. And they are lead by radical, ruthless, savage men who seem to lust for evil.",1462492800,4,869,4.2727272727272725

7071493,5,B00UUOVQ5Y,"It is April 1945, the final weeks of the Third Reich, and the small town of Bad Tlz in southern Germany, midway between Munich and Innsbruck, is bracing for an attack by the American army.  Bad Tlz is divided into western and eastern sections by the River Isar, which is spanned by a narrow bridge.  Although German army officers plan to demolish the bridge soon to impede the American advance, seven 16-year-old German boys are sent to defend itat first, their commanders expect that the boys will go home before the fighting starts; later, the officers intend that the boys will offer token resistance (forcing the Americans to bring up reinforcements), and then retire so a German demolition team can blow up the bridge before the American reinforcements arrive.  Most of the adultswhether parents, teachers, or army officersare surprised when the 16 year olds are drafted, and are convinced that these youths are putting their lives at risk for no purpose.  But the boys themselves have grown up under the Nazi regime and absorbed its values.  To them, military duties offer a chance to show their courage and to follow orders.  At first, it is still like a gameone boy suggests using as an observation post a fort they had used when playing cowboys and Indians.  But, when the firing starts, they discover that it is not a game.

This film is based on a novel of the same name (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bridge/dp/B000UFJN6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bridge</a>), which was derived from author Gregor Dorfmeister's (penname Manfred Gregor) actual experiences during the war.  Dorfmeister begins the story when the boys are already in the army, and employs a dozen flashbacks to provide personal information about each of the boys and some of the army officers.  Wrestling with this unwieldy framework, Dorfmeister wrote and re-wrote the novel seven times before submitting it to the publisher.  Understandably, director Bernhard Wicki considered this format inappropriate for the movie, and chose instead to tell the story more or less chronologically.  This required him to omit many details, and to foreshorten time, placing in several days events that actually took place over several years.  For example, in the film, the boys were in the army for only a single day; in the novel, they had 14 days military training.

Each of the seven boys has a distinctive personalitysome are more mature than others.  The movie gives us a good understanding of some of the boysJrgens desire to be an army officer, Walters resentment of his Nazi fatherbut it fails to capture the character of Hans Scholten (who is Ernst Scholten in the novel).  This is unfortunate, because Scholten, as the most mature, the most outspoken, and perhaps the most sensitive of the group, may be the most important character in the story.  In the book, Scholten is an outsider.  He loves music, plays the flute, consistently avoids Hitler Youth meetings, and has once been arrested for vandalism.  More than the other boys he resents military regimentation; and he is the only one who dares to talk back to army officers.  His only motive for fighting the Americans is avenging the death of one of the other boys.  Even so, he does not hate all Americans; and when one GI pleads with the boys to go home, Scholten feels a grudging admiration for him, and avoids shooting him.  But Karl, one of the other boys, shoots the American, and Scholten is furious that the stupid ass had shot him.  When Lieutenant Hampel, who has come to demolish the bridge, tells Scholten to convey the Generals compliments to the other boys, Scholten, his eyes burning with hatred, waves his arm at the battle scene, where five of his friends lie dead, and tells Hampel, There they are, Herr Leutnant, waitingfor the Generals compliments!  If you get a chance, read the bookDorfmeister has packed a great deal of emotion into its 140 pages.

The Bridge was shot with black and white film.  This gives it the appearance of a World War II era newsreel.  The dialogue is in German, with English subtitles.  In some respects, The Bridge is not very realistic.  It is highly improbable that a small squad of seven teenagers would be equipped with two machine guns, multiple panzerfaust anti-tank weapons and liberal amounts of ammunitionespecially if they were not originally expected to do any serious fighting.  When The Bridge was filmed, the German army did not have large battle tanks.  And U.S. Army officers, reading in the script how American tanks were to be shot up by German teenagers, declined to provide American tanks for the movie.  So Wicki had to employ dummy tanks.  But these technical discrepancies do not reduce the dramatic impact of the story.

This DVD includes some informative extras.  (1) Author Gregor Dorfmeister (22 minutes, in German with English subtitles) describing the real life events on which this film was based.  (2) Excerpts from a 1989 television interview (15 minutes, in German with English subtitles) with director Bernhard Wicki.  (3) A 2015 interview of director Volker Schlondorff (9 minutes, in English), in which he discusses The Bridge, its place among German war films, and its impact on viewers.  (4) Excerpts from a 2007 documentary about Wicki (9 minutes, in German, with English subtitles), produced by his widow, which give viewers an idea of how The Bridge was filmed.",1449619200,6,5427,5.029082774049217

7071496,4,B00UUOVQ5Y,"Great to see a war movie from a non-American perspective.  A group of 14-16 year old German youths are drafted into the Army at the end of WW2.  Their youthful exuberance gradually fades in the course of just one night given the task of guarding the bridge into their  town.  As night fades into morning, the American soldiers arrive and are dumbfounded on why a group of kids are fighting so fiercely for a lost cause.  The youths are able to stop several tanks and the GI's just go away figuring why bother for such a non-strategic town.  The ending is tragic.  This movie was made in 1959 and said to be the first German anti-war movie, but its message is also more than that.",1447286400,3,679,4.384

Loved the American's telling the 'Kindergarteners' to go home. the boy fought and killed. they were killed and went under. Thinking they killed their friends-thinking their killing helped on one. very completes ideas and feelings set to life for a brief moment in this little German town near the end of he war.

8708448,5,B00UUOVQ5Y,"This is one of the finest ""waste of war"" movies ever made. Directing, acting and script are superb. Most of the movie is the lead up to the final clash. We see the boys in school and acting like teenagers. They deal with love, family problems, food shortages, boyish quarrels and school. They are nave and have delusions of grandeur that have been beaten into them as they grew up during the war. There school teacher is cynical but has to walk the party line with his lectures. During one moment in class, a boy who likes trains is talking about becoming a hero. His teachers comments that the war is coming to an end and Germany will need train engineers more than they need heroes. The little village is tired. The boys are surrounded by adults who are worn down by the war, loss and shortages of everything. When they receive their draft notices, they are elated. They are going to defend their homeland. One mother tries to have her son arrested for stealing in hopes that he will survive the war, but the police won't do it. The school teacher pleads with their company commander to leave them out of the fighting but is rebuked. The boys go to war. They have one day of training when their company is ordered to the front. Their company commander has second thoughts and gets permission to assign the boys to guard their village bridge. It is not an important bridge and is due for demolition anyway. He thinks he has spared them. First night, their NCO goes into the village to confer with the engineers who are assigned with blowing up the bridge. He runs afoul of military police. He has no written orders. He is gunned down while trying to avoid arrest for desertion. Now, we have untrained, teen aged boys armed with machine guns and panzerfausts thinking they are the holding the most important bridge in Germany--with no adult supervision. The night is filled with badly mauled German troops retreating across their bridge. They don't understand what is happening. They think the soldiers are cowards. They become more determined to hold their insignificant bridge. The next day, when American patrols arrive the boys open fire. In a the day's skirmishes, young are lives thrown away for no purpose.",1518998400,,2213,4.676923076923077
