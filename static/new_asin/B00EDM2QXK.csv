5904572,5,B00EDM2QXK,"These DVD's are broken down into 15 minute workouts for every body part (core, cardio, legs and arms). It's a great workout to do when you're short on time. Short and effective. I also like Jennifer's voice, very pleasant to work out to, unlike many other instructors out there.",1388275200,11,278,4.6938775510204085
5904573,5,B00EDM2QXK,"After weeks of holiday eating, my wife and I were ready to get back onto track.  We have always liked Jennifer Cohen approach and voice since her days on Shedding for the Wedding.  My wife picked up this DVD and the Belly series - I am at the intermediate level and I like the modifications for some of the workouts are easier than others for me.  It makes it easy to adjust my workouts to help make me stronger!",1388275200,9,412,4.189873417721519
5904574,3,B00EDM2QXK,"NOTE:  I received a free copy of this DVD to review for the web site Metapsychology Online Reviews; you can read a more complete version of my review on that site.

This is one of two new releases by Weight Watchers featuring self-proclaimed ""expert"" fitness instructor Jennifer Cohen (the other is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Weight-Watchers-Ultimate-Belly-Series/dp/B00ELKDCV4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Weight Watchers: Ultimate Belly Series</a>).  As Cohen explains in her introduction, the 15 Minute Boot Camp Series DVD offers short routines performed at three different levels, beginner, intermediate, and advanced.  Cohen herself displays the intermediate version of the moves, while her two background exercisers model the beginner and advanced.

Cohen teaches live in a large, bright studio.  Light and weights are optional for those following the intermediate or advanced options, and a mat is helpful for the floor moves.  This DVD offers a total of four approximately 15-minute workouts.  Here is how they are listed on the Main Menu:  Core - Cardio - Upper Body - Lower Body - Play All.  I have provided more detailed information on each routine below (times in parenthesis are the actual times).

CORE (15:27 mins.)
This section focuses on standing core moves and uses weights for the intermediate/advanced.  For the short (<2 mins.) warm-up, Cohen does side stretches and back flexion.  Each exercise is performed for about one minute (I've listed the intermediate version which Cohen demonstrates):  1) rotation to one side holding weight (both sides), 2) lunge forward and wood chop weight from shoulder (both sides), 3) squat with rotation, 4) side lunge moving one arm in and out (both sides), and 5) side lunge reaching weight out to one side and then overhead to opposite side.  Cohen concludes with brief upper body stretches for the chest and shoulders.

CARDIO (16:33 mins.)
Weights are optional for this workout as well.  Cohen again starts with a quick warm-up, this time doing a few squats and shoulder rolls.  The specific moves are as follows;  1)  skaters, 2) mini squat with jump, 3) rotating dumbbell reaches to floor, 4) forward/reverse lunge and side jacks, 5) overhead reach and pull-down into side lunge, 6) knee up/tap back (""rocking horse""), and 7) pli&eacute; squat.  To cool down, Cohen moves through 1.5 minutes of stretches, including bent over cat/cow, half forward bend, and a standing hip flexor stretch.

UPPER BODY (16:11 mins.)
This segment could have been titled ""Upper Body/Core,"" as about half the routine consists of planks.  For the 1.5-minute warm-up, Cohen moves through deep breaths, slow squats, and chest stretches.  The exercises tend to alternate between floor and standing movements, and they appear in the following order:  1) standing walkout to plank hold, 2) modified side plank with dumbbell reach, 3) standing bent over row with dumbbells, 4) plank with alternating knees in, 5) biceps curl with toe tap back, 6) overhead triceps press with pli&eacute;, 7) modified forearm plank to plank (a.k.a. spider push-up), 8) overhead press with squat, 9) standing L-rotation for arms to deadlift, 10) modified plank with row, and 11) arm lowers from overhead with half pli&eacute;.  Cohen ends the workout by stretching only the triceps, just a few second per side.

LOWER BODY (15:34 mins.)
The short (1.5 mins.) warm-up for this routine consists of squats and pli&eacute; squats.  The following exercises are included in this segment:  1) curtsy lunge, 2) lateral lunge with knee lift, 3) basic squat, 4) cross country shuffle, 5) bent over squat with leg press (1st side), 6) step side with pli&eacute; squat, 7) bent over squat with leg press (2nd side), and 8) reverse lunge.  Cohen concludes with a short standing stretch (1 mins.) targeting the hamstrings and hip flexors.

There were several things that I found disappointing about this DVD.  First, I'm not sure that the video is appropriate for ""all fitness levels"" as marketed, particularly for beginners.  The abundance of plank work in the Upper Body routine was quite strenuous, and the beginner modification was often to hold the plank--this static move would likely be even MORE challenging for most beginners!  Furthermore, many of the exercises included throughout all four workouts required pre-existing flexibility and core strength, which is probably not typical of the average Weight Watchers consumer who is just starting out with a fitness program.

In addition to the issues with the difficulty level, I thought that the routines themselves were too diffuse, as they did not seem to adequately target the intended body area.  The Core segment was my favorite given that I enjoy standing core work, but the intensity of the Cardio felt very uneven, and finally, both the Upper Body and the Lower Body segments seemed like more indistinct total body workouts.

More experienced exercisers who enjoy short segments but who are not necessarily looking for well-defined body part routines may find something to like about this DVD.  Personally, however, this video would not be something I would recommend.",1387670400,36,5183,5.329643296432964
5904575,5,B00EDM2QXK,"This one is for me!  I am getting back into my exercise routine after knee problems, this DVD is going to work for me.  I have only done one 15 min session and it was great, the three levels let you work where you feel best.  So happy to get started again",1387497600,4,255,3.8653846153846154
5904576,3,B00EDM2QXK,"I really wanted to like this one.  I do like that it is only 15 minutes, which is great for a busy day.  I like Jennifer Cohen's clear instructions.  They are easy to follow.  And I like that there are 3 levels, which gives lots of room for advancement.  But I only gave it 4 stars because of 2 things.  One is the music.  There is no sync between the exercises and the timing of the music, which really frustrates me and makes it much harder for me to complete the exercises.  I have done 2 of the workouts, the core workout & the lower body, and both are like this.  My other objection is that the reps are not always uniform on both sides.  So that is what lowered my rating.  Otherwise, I like the workouts.  I just wish it  had been put together a little bit better.",1387152000,58,771,4.093959731543624
5904577,5,B00EDM2QXK,"I really enjoyed the Weight Watchers 15 Minute Boot Camp Series, in fact it has become my new favorite workout DVD.
What I really like about it is, you can work at your own pace.  You can do the Beginner, Intermediate or the advanced exercise.
They also break it down into 4 workouts
15 minute upper body
15 minute lower body
15 minute core
15 minute cardio
I would do the intermediate sometimes and then switch to the advanced if I felt comfortable.  I can switch it up any way I like.  When I am finished, I am really sweating and even breathing heavy.  I LOVED GETTING EVERY DROP OF SWEAT OUT THAT I COULD.  Did you know that sweating helps to cleanse toxins from your body?",1385942400,5,677,4.299212598425197

5904609,5,B00EDM2QXK,I like this work out.  It does not seem like it will produce much intensity and in the end it does.

Otherwise she is very pleasant and encouraging.,1477440000,,270,4.254901960784314

5904617,4,B00EDM2QXK,"This DVD works well for those busy days. 15 minutes and you're done!  There are 2 women in addition to Jennifer doing three different levels of each exercise, so it's easy to switch levels. Some of the exercises do seem a bit repetitive, which can make the 15 minutes drag at times. WARNING: Every segment but the cardio segment requires you to quickly get on the floor and up again several times, but if you're fine with that it's a good workout.",1446768000,2,447,4.451219512195122

5904650,3,B00EDM2QXK,"Read Dr. Beth's 3-star review of this product, it is spot on (on this page). I was doing the Weight Watchers 4-Week Targeted Workout Plan which I LOVE, but I was looking to add some variety and maybe some intensity/challenge. These workouts don't really concentrate on the sections they say they do. I had done the 4-Week Targeted lower body sculpting routine plus lower body circuit one day, and thought I would do the 15 Minute Boot Camp Upper Body the next day, since my lower body was sore. But the upper body workout incorporated a ton of squats, lunges and plis. The Cardio workout in particular was a bit repetitive at times. You seem to stay on one move for a really long time before moving on. I was especially disappointed in the Core segment, I did not feel like I worked my core very much at all. You should consider these workouts as 15 minute total body segments, rather than concentrated workouts. For that I would recommend the 4-Week Targeted Plan. I will be keeping the cardio and lower body segments in my rotation, because they are a nice level of challenge for me and do provide a good workout, although a bit tedious.",1443571200,,1139,4.533980582524272

5904652,5,B00EDM2QXK,This is a fabulous DVD. 15 min workouts that depending on what level you pick can give you a great workout. I am so busy and I know I can fit 15 min in my schedule. Great for all levels.,1439942400,,186,3.675

5904654,2,B00EDM2QXK,"I've been working out for years and I'm in pretty decent shape. I bought this DVD as a ""lazy day workout"" , but found it surprisingly challenging. The one thing I didn't like and the reason why I'm giving it such a low score, is because I you don't know what segment you're doing! I didn't read the order of workouts when I played it. I simply pressed, ""play all"". The first 15 minutes was standing abs, but I wasn't sure if we were doing abs, upper body or lower body until it was almost over. Over all, not my favorite workout by any means.",1434153600,,542,4.171428571428572

5904677,2,B00EDM2QXK,"It's ok. The cardio moves as slow as a snail, boot camp cardio should make you sweat even at the beginner level. The moves are kind of boring and repetitious. The instructor needs to talk a lot less, it's very distracting. But I spent money in it so I will use it. You get a better work-out from the WW time crunch 10 minute video. Better instructor, music, moves and workout.",1422748800,3,376,4.309859154929577

She explains at the beginning that there are three levels and how that works. Then during the exercises,  she explains it at least 30 more times. We got it the first time!  The second thing I didn't like was the music. It must have been added afterward because she was never with the music. Drove me crazy. The last thing I didn't like was the upper body section. She did one exercise standing,  then one one the floor,  standing,  floor. .....I'm 57 years old. Getting up off the floor every other exercise was a bit much.

I found this one was actually easy to follow unlike so many others that just go from one thing to another and you get completely lost. I have knee issues so I take it easier doing the lunges but I love that there are four different 15 minute work outs. I do the cardio first and then alternate the core, upper body and lower body on different days. I am just getting started again with exercising and I am 65 and in good health but I don't want to overdo it and get tired of it quickly. The directions are easy to understand. My only complaint is the fact that they don't do the counting with the reps. I like the three different levels and find that I can do the level 3 for several reps and then go back to the 2nd or even 1st level.  I have recommended this to my daughter who is trying to lose weight on WW.

The instructor has two people with her who demonstrate the beginning and advanced levels while she demonstrates the intermediate level.

Although each segment targets one specific area, they all include movements that tone the whole body.
