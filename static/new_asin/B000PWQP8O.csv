2828586,4,B000PWQP8O,But I enjoyed it. Better than most in the genre. The writing is strong and it's always nice to see Adrienne Barbeau on screen. I recommend it.,1185926400,5,142,4.296296296296297
2828587,4,B000PWQP8O,"This brilliantly complex thriller, starring Adrienne Barbeau and Nick Brendon, is a refreshingly smart and taut horror film, providing chills and surprises but never compromising the film's intelligence. Given the chance, I would love to see what the makers of this film could do in the future.",1184976000,8,294,5.276595744680851

I wish there was more gore though.  It's an eerie and complex mystery, and has the right blend of suspense and fun.  Cult Classic?  Only time till tell...",1184544000,9,318,4.589285714285714
2828589,3,B000PWQP8O,"Unholy is not an easy movie to classify...part horror, part sci-fi, part psychological thriller, it isn't great in any one area but it is an interesting `small' movie. I use the word small because the two stars, Barbeau and Brendon, ad onscreen throughout almost the entire film. This isn't a scary movie, per se, but it is creepy. It's one of those films that makes you wonder just what the heck is going on throughout most of the movie but a twist at the end brings everything home.

Barbeau is Martha who returns home with flowers for her teenage daughter, Hope. But Hope has locked herself in the outdoor storm cellar with a gun to her head, babbling incoherently about some experiment...just before she pulls the trigger. Brendon plays older brother Lucas in a role not unlike `Xander in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. He's slightly timid and tries to make up for it with humor. Martha wants to know why her daughter would take her own life and what this experiment is that she referred to before she took her own life. They find a hidden room in the basement with a painting of a crazed looking man wearing Nazi symbols. Martha falls asleep several times only to find herself in this room, strapped into a chair, and listening to an old record phonograph playing some crazed, cult-like chanting.

This is a film where virtually every character they encounter is some kind of nut or seems to know something about what's going on...from the guy who runs the flower shop to Martha's old next door neighbor, Charlie. Martha and Nicholas discover that the man in the painting was a Nazi scientist working on an experiment with the U.s. Government on what they called the Unholy Trinity: Time Travel, Mind Control, and invisibility. The more they discover, the more strange things become...there's encounters with strange kids in cemeteries, Nazi soldiers, and something morphing out of Martha's own living room floor and grabbing her ankle. You really do wonder where all this is going as it's just so over-the-top bizarre.

REVIEWED BY TIM JANSON",1194566400,4,2043,4.798295454545454
2828590,1,B000PWQP8O,"When I first read about this film in FANGORIA magazine months ago, I was excited........ The government continuing the occult experiments the Nazi Germans were dabbling with during the 1930-1940s.
Sounded like an excellent premise.

Now let me say right now, I don't like to criticize creative work unless it REALLY deserves it.
I know how hard it is to create movies and music.
So I only write reviews on Amazon for 2 reasons...

1) Something is VERY VERY good and I want to tell people they should see it.
2) Something is SO BAD, I feel obligated to warn others not to waste their time.

UNHOLY is beyond bad.
I dont' know if they were trying to be silly with this film, or experiment with music video ideas... or actually what they were trying to do.

This film suffers from the ....... ""since we are blending together government conspiracy, Nazis, the occult, time travel, invisibility and mind control all into a single plot line, we don't have to worry about consistency. NOTHING needs to connect together or make sense.""

So for 117 minutes this film jumps back and forth with images of people effected by the events of the Necromancer and the continuation of these radical new blendings of the occult and science.....but do we really care  ?

NO

There is never any feeling of tension or suspense.
Never any care for any of the characters. Let them all die, good riddance.
Never a real feeling that this ""threat"" will affect the outside world.

It is rare this happens with a movie, but you almost find yourself angry at the end that you spent 2 hours of your life actually paying for and watching this.

We had a ""movie night"" with 5 people at the house (all aged 43-50) who have probably seen every horror and sci-fi film in history.

At the end the group honestly looked at each other and said out loud........ ""Do we all agree that was probably the worst piece of crap you have ever seen?""

The only worst film we could recall was ""Blair Witch Project"".",1194134400,,1965,4.551136363636363
2828591,1,B000PWQP8O,"I can't believe the ""good reviews"".  The acting was bad. I'm normally a fan of Adrienne Barbeau.

But I wasn't impressed with it. IT BORED ME SILLY and I had to really fight to stay awake.",1193097600,2,188,4.194444444444445
2828592,1,B000PWQP8O,"This movie has very little plot or coherence. It's a stew containing uncooked lumps of time-traveling entities, apparitions in basements, and figments inducing people to commit suicide.

Actually, the director's commentary on this DVD is better than the movie itself. In addition to providing some behind-the-scenes insights into how a bunch of buddies get together to make an Indie film like this, he talks about how he went about casting ""Unholy."" He says he was sure from the start that he wanted Adrienne Barbeau in the film because he'd remembered her as the all-night DJ in ""The Fog,"" where she'd won him over with her ""sexiest voice ever.""

Barbeau's presence in ""Unholy"" is in fact the film's only redeeming virtue. It's good to see her on screen again, but it's unfortunate it had to be in a mishmash like this. So whether you are looking for sex appeal, or for a movie with at least some suspense and semblance of plot - it would in fact be better to go back to the source and check out ""The Fog."" Watching this movie will just leave you in one.",1192233600,6,1055,4.6063829787234045
2828593,5,B000PWQP8O,This film is full of twists and turns with original writing that present a brilliant story.  I don't think you can find another movie out there like this given its low budget that can turn your head inside out and make you want to watch it a second and third time to figure out the mystery behind it.  Definitely a film to pay attention to along with its creators for future projects.,1189900800,4,384,4.319444444444445
2828594,1,B000PWQP8O,"I read the reviews posted about this movie the other day. I thought to myself, ""Odd... Adrienne Barbeau in a current movie that isn't awful."" Tonight, when scanning the local RedBox, I saw this movie and rented it. I even told my girlfriend that I had read nothing but good reviews about it. Oh, the horror that ensued. I would appreciate it if everyone that wrote a good review about this movie pitched in to refund me the $1 rental cost for this piece of excrement. It hurt my brain to sit through this. It was not complex. It was not well directed. It was most certainly not well written. In all honesty, it was possibly one of the worst movies I have burned into my retinas since Cobra Vs. Python on the Sci-Fi Channel. It makes Troll 2 seem like Taxi Driver; Flesh Gordon like The Deer Hunter. As if it were the video in The Ring, its sole purpose is to destroy. In this case, it destroys one's mind, as opposed to their physical existence. It is a spiteful movie and I would recommend it to no one. I gave it one star only because that is the lowest rating possible on Amazon. It deserves negative stars... If only that were an option.",1189814400,2,1141,4.311627906976744
2828595,5,B000PWQP8O,"I've seen some reviews calling this movie genius, and some calling it a mess...I definitely agree with the first.  This movie is brilliant.  Especially for direct to video standards.  That being said, it is NOT for everyone.  It is not a slasher.  It is not a straightforward horror.  It's DRAMA/THRILLER.  If you want a straight forward horror movie, go see any of the countless DTV options.  If you want a movie that makes you think, and one of the few movies I've seen where you can watch the entire thing TWICE and it be like seeing two different movies...watch UNHOLY.  It's quickly becoming of of my faves...",1189382400,5,614,4.663551401869159
2828596,3,B000PWQP8O,"""Unholy"" is a low budget horror/mystery movie, and as such, it's not really any better or worse than most of its type. Its biggest asset is Adrienne Barbeau in the lead part, who again proves that she's a good (Tony Award and Golden Globe nominated) actress and not just a faded sex symbol. The rest of the cast is a mixed bunch and the script rather uneven. It felt like it was trying too hard to be clever with a twist in the end, and failed to really grab your interest on its way there.

""Unholy"" is worth renting for fans of low budget horror movies and may be worth buying for Adrienne Barbeau fans. She deserves to be in better movies than this.",1189209600,3,652,4.258064516129032

2828598,5,B000PWQP8O,"Unholy is a savvy, heady flick that will too easily be categorized as a horror movie. Or, psychological-horror-thriller flick, if you're into sub-categories. In truth, it's much more than that. It brings new fear to old scares, while preying on two of the more frightening elements of the 20th century: Naziism and New Jersey. Now, combine the two.

8193646,2,B000PWQP8O,"<strong>Unholy</strong> (Daryl Goldberg, 2007)

I wanted to like this movie a great deal more than I did; the concept is amazing, and the acting is, in general, up to that standard. Unfortunately, it takes a few wrong turns in the script, and the farther on we go, the more lost we become, until there is a point towards the end of the movie where you know you're never going to find your way back to that luminous path of potential on which you started out.

Plot: Martha (Adrienne Barbeau) is a distraught mother. She has just (in the movie's opening sequence) unsuccessfully attempted to talk her daughter, Hope (<em>Thralls</em>' Siri Baruc), out of suicide. Her other child, Lucas (<em>Pinata: Survival Island</em>'s Nicholas Brendon), comes home to help her cope, and the two of them start looking for answers. The more they dig, the weirder things get.

Saying <em>what</em> they start finding, even close to the beginning, would be plunging deep into spoiler territory, so I'll just say that while it's nothing you haven't seen before, scriptwriter Sam Freeman takes a number of disparate things you've seen and attempts to put them together in such a way as to be, if not wholly original, at least well on the way. And from what we can see of the big picture by the time we get to the end, he was really on to something. Too bad he doesn't seem to have spent a great deal of time thinking about internal consistency in his conceit, which leads to some moments where the viewer is shaking his head and wondering why no one thought to question this or that angle. Unfortunately, if you're working in this sort of speculative vein, the sort of internal consistency we don't get is exactly what the script needs to carry everything off. Which turns this from a movie advertising endless possibilities into something of a slog.

Worth checking out for the concept, but don't expect to enjoy it much. **",1335484800,,1906,4.714714714714715
8193647,2,B000PWQP8O,"If only the movie itself were half as good as the marketing campaign created for it, Unholy could have been a pretty good film.  It certainly sounded promising, with its talk of a conspiratorial government project experimenting with the ""unholy alliance"" of time travel, invisibility, and mind control - not to mention the return of Adrienne Barbeau to the horror genre.  Adrienne has long been one of my favorite horror starlets, so - despite the fact that she's no longer the beautiful young woman she used to be - I expected big things from this movie.  The end result was quite a disappointment.

Adrienne Barbeau plays Martha, a Pennsylvania widow who helplessly watches her daughter kill herself in the cellar of their home.  Hope's final words to her mother are ""Beware of the experiment.""  She has no idea what the ""experiment"" could be, but she certainly knows something incredibly strange is going on.  Earlier that day, she had an unsettling encounter with the world's creepiest fruit stand vendor, a man who told her that ""they are playing with your future.""  With the help of her son Lucas (Nicholas Brendon of Buffy fame), she begins searching for a reason why Hope would have killed herself.  This somehow leads her to a secret government conspiracy to continue the unethical experiments of a certain Nazi ""necromancer.""  While this might sound interesting, it really isn't because we never learn any real details about any of it.  We mainly just watch Martha and her son go out demanding answers during the day and then come home again, as if their lives aren't in any danger whatsoever, to the one place where bad things continue to happen to them.  Suspense and paranoia increase (among the characters - not the audience) until the truth is finally revealed.  There are a few surprises along the way, but there's never anything to get excited about.

The filmmakers claimed that the story is based on a real military document that referred to a secret occult project with Nazi origins taking place in a rural Pennsylvania community.  They went so far as to take their web site down at one point, claiming it had been shut down by the American government because it revealed some dangerous information the public was not supposed to know.  On top of that, some visitors to the site were reportedly sent messages warning them to be careful because they now knew too much.  Sadly, this marketing campaign exhibits much more careful thought and creativity than the actual script of the movie.  A sparse look and feel also does the movie no favors.  The sets are minimalist at best and few in number, probably due to a low budget, and the cinematography has a serious case of the blahs.  I didn't feel like beating my head against the wall after watching Unholy - but I can't say I really enjoyed watching it, either.",1326672000,,2830,4.783950617283951
8193648,2,B000PWQP8O,"This movie had a lot of great things going for it considering the obvious size of the project. Good use made with effects, some good scares and very tense scenes. And the caliber of the acting for a low-budget horror should give the cast and director something to be proud of (no Academy Awards, but you know...)

The serious flaw that made it often unbearable is the plot. Take Nazis, occult, time travel, mind control... then put a plot twist in just about every scene in the film and place every single person under suspicion and you just get a tangled mess. Plot devices in horror films, awesome. But if your movie's flow chart looks a Pollock painting then time to scale back.",1300060800,,681,4.536585365853658
8193649,4,B000PWQP8O,"...except that THIS movie ultimately made sense.

This movie does start off as very disjointed and bizarre, and it seems like most of the reviewers here never got past that.  Once the investigation starts, though, the pieces begin to come together and make sense, in exactly the way that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Donnie-Darko-The-Director-s-Cut-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B0006GAOBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Donnie Darko - The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;should have and never really did.  The key difference is that Unholy is completely unconcerned with explaining how the weird stuff works (it's Nazi magic; deal with it and move on), while Darko falls apart unless you can somehow magically understand all of the weird rules that govern its peculiar version of time travel and alternate reality...and even then, you might want to hit Wikipedia and see if you got it right.  Darko hangs a semblance of a plot on a poorly-explained idea; Unholy is a well-crafted mystery that doesn't fully make sense until you put the final pieces into place.  (In other words, it's a well-crafted mystery.)

Unholy gives you all the clues you need to understand it, but unless you were watching closely or jump right back in for a rewatch, you'll miss some.  Yes, there are still a couple of holes that could have been (more explicitly) filled in, but they're side issues and you should be able to figure them out with a little thought.  Just about every Weird Random Thing gets explained, either explicitly or by implication.

It also helps tremendously if you listen to the three ""radio broadcasts"" that are played over the end credits; those are the final pieces of the puzzle, and playing them with the credits may have been a miscalculation, as many people will miss them.  (Subtitles would have been VERY useful for this movie, for those and for Hope's taped journal.  Both are sources of critical information, but they can be hard to hear clearly.  If this gets a Blu-ray release, I hope subtitles will be part of the upgrade.)  It also helps if you know enough history to understand the significance of the first two broadcasts, but if not, the last one (and the credit cookie at the very end) makes it Really Obvious what has happened.

This is not a movie to turn on as background noise while you're doing something else and turn off when the first credits show up.  If you do that, it'll make no sense and you'll think it's crap.  This is a movie to focus on for an hour and a half, from the moment you hit ""play"" until the DVD comes back to the menu after the credits.  All of the answers are in there, and everything really does come together in a coherent fashion.  If you're confused after the first viewing, a second time should clear everything up nicely.

Conclusion: If you're looking for mindless blood-and-guts horror, stay away from this one; you won't like it.  If you like puzzle box plots (in the way that the best time travel stories are), pick it up, watch closely, and maybe watch it again.",1287964800,,3080,4.990215264187867
8193650,1,B000PWQP8O,All I can manage to say about this movie is that I had a ridiculously painful headache after watching it and my mother (who purchased it) made the store take it back even though they didn't refund her money.  It is THAT bad.  What the hell is going on in this movie?  Can somebody tell me and not fall over foaming at the mouth because their brain imploded on itself trying to comprehend it?  The only reason it gets one star is because there is no zero or negative star rating.  Without a doubt the WORST movie I've ever seen.,1267488000,2,527,4.23
8193651,2,B000PWQP8O,"I mainly picked this up because I'm a Buffy fan and wanted to see Nicholas Brendon do something besides Xander Harris.  Well, you could still see Xander in his character...

Anyway, the movie over all wasn't so great.  Over all, it was pretty boring.",1221868800,,250,4.636363636363637
8193652,4,B000PWQP8O,"This one will get reviews all over the place because it doesn't fit any mold. It's not the regular glossy splatter horror we're used to. It has no over the top, technological edge special effects. And the production values seem. . .spare-- purposefully barebone.
  Yet, it's Different. Think of it not as a Horror ""movie""-- but like a Horror ""Play"". Yes, the bodies start piling up in a mondo-funny way, but the actors are not playing this as 'Camp'. It's contained, inward-spiralling madness.
  Best watched Late Night-- after Midnight.
  Time Travel, Torture, Mind Control, cold blooded murder and Nazis who may or may NOT be dead.
  This one has the feel of a new cult classic to me.",1208044800,,686,4.754237288135593
