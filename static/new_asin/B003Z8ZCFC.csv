8410038,2,B003Z8ZCFC,"As noted in other reviews, this is a poor quality VHS transfer, I've seen better bootlegs. Picture and sound are bad on this. The thing that mostly sucks is it's not even a good Motorhead show. The band are not at the top of thier game on this night, obviously not in sync on half the songs. On the plus side, hardcore Motorhead fans will appreciate getting to see the band in the early 80's.",1442016000,,392,4.24

8410041,4,B003Z8ZCFC,"There is not that many Motorhead real live video with Fast Eddie Clarke, where most is lipsynched.

Most non-lipsynched is VHS bootlegged and bad bootleged with inaudible sound and bad pictures that looks like it was taken from the back row of an arena.

I was pleasantly surprised with the picture quality and sound and the fact they played material from Iron First which Fast Eddie left in mid tour.

I even accepted a couple of glitches that probably occured when transferring from tape to disc that do not affect the performance.

Best if you view it from a perspective of buying a live concert from the 1970s and early 1980's - not up to modern standard, but better than many of the aforementioned concerts of that period.

That said, no excuse for XXL Media to mislead the buying public with the wrong date and modern shots of the band, and having their logo at the right hand corner all the time.

P.S. There is no booklet/insert",1302480000,2,936,4.574850299401198
8410042,5,B003Z8ZCFC,"I have had this on vhs for years and it's awesome.
Maybe the transfer is bad for the two negative
reviews but the show itself is killer! It was
Motorhead in the prime! It's available on dvd
in the vhs format which of course is not as
good as most expect these days but i don't
mind full screen and vhs quality. So I give
the show 5 stars not this dvd. later mates.",1294617600,3,364,3.9324324324324325
8410043,1,B003Z8ZCFC,"Motorhead collectors should steer clear of this one. It is the 1982 Toronto Maple Leaf Gardens concert, I believe, purposefully mislabled as being a Canadian concert from 1988.

Any idiot would know that Fast Eddie was long gone from the band by 1988. Yet, there he is playing guitar for them, but the year is 1982.

This was a disappointment. The packaging is an outright lie.",1293667200,6,377,4.696969696969697
8410044,2,B003Z8ZCFC,"Just received this DVD and gave it a spin. What a disapointment. I gave it two stars because I enjoy the band and have seen them live. The DVD itself probably deserves less than I gave it. There is a lot wrong with this DVD. I bought it because of the great tracks listed. However here's my gripes:

1. If you have a widescreen TV, this is a full screen video so enjoy the black bars on each side.
2. The quality of the video itself is soft and grainy and very much looks like a 2nd generation VHS tape. The only thing that is very clear & clean is the large XXL Media Logo plastered to the top right of the screen throughout the whole thing.
3. The box says the sound is 5.1 Dolby Digital but the diagram below it shows only 3 speakers. I can verify you only get sound from the center channel speaker and left & right fronts. No sub and no surrounds. The CD's sound better than this DVD.
4. No extras of any kind.
5. Only 50 minutes long.
6. Guess the best thing about it is you can play it anywhere since it's a region 0 disc, at least according to the box.

I can only recommend this DVD to die hard fans who want everything by the band.",1291420800,10,1140,4.0176211453744495
