8611139,3,B00F0N6A5G,my grandson loves all of these Home Alone movies.  I like the original one and the rest are just OK.,1464998400,,100,4.0
8611140,5,B00F0N6A5G,I had seen this before and wanted to finish out my Home Alone set it met my expictations I enjoyed it a  lot,1453420800,,108,3.6956521739130435
8611141,4,B00F0N6A5G,this is a good movie. better and I mean way better than 4. I think because that they did not try to bring back the mccallisters. I thought that the kid did a good job a little bit annoying with him being scared all the time. the mom was the funniest character in the whole movie. I got some good laughs from the robbers. the traps were better in this one than 4 and the story was better than 4 as well. I will put it this way everything was better than 4. but nothing and I mean nothing will out beat 1 and 2. all in all it was a good and entertaining movie. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do,1451433600,,614,3.84251968503937
