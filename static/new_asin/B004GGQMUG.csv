4372884,5,B004GGQMUG,"My 2-year-old is in love with Pingu and has started interacting with the characters more and more.  I think it's accessible because they don't speak a particular language, but the emotions are visible and easy to connect to.  Also, this is a fabulous deal to get all four for so little.  We've already bought copies for my nephews too.",1321315200,,335,4.6440677966101696
4372885,5,B004GGQMUG,"I ordered this set for my two year old who loves Pingu, and has one older (region2) DVD set. He loves it! On the DVD box and the internet there was no stories list so I'm giving it here:
First and oldest MEET PINGU dvd hasn't got menu or scene selection, but all the other ones do. It has 6 movies: Pingu goes fishing, Pingu helps deliver mail, Pingu plays fish tennis, Pingu gets a bike, Pingu at the nursery, Pingu and the organ grinder.
The second dvd CHILLIN' WITH PINGU has 8 movies: Pingu helps with incubating, Pinga is born, Pingu is jealous, Pingu is left out, Pingu & Pinga don't want to go to bed, Grandpa is sick, Pingu & Pinga play circus, Pingu's parents go to a concert.
ON THIN ICE dvd has 8 movies: Pingu and the snowball, Pingu & Pinga go camping, Stinky Pingu, Pingu's ice sculpture, Pingu's balancing act, Pingu has hiccups, Pingu gets lost, Robby the snowboarder.
SOUTH POLE dvd has 8 movies also: Pingu and the abominable snowman, Pingu and the daily igloo, Pingu boogaloo, Pinga sleepwalks, Pingu wants to fly, Pingu plays tag, Pingu gets carried away, Pingu's big catch.
First two DVD's are older and have that magical ""Pingu"" feel to it, but the two newer movies are sped up and that charm is somewhat lost. This is DVD playable in USA format. The price is excellent for the volume (30 stories). They all speak penguins' language with very rare recognizable words like Happy Birthday to you. And the stories are very educative (except children will not learn any language from it); storytelling about family, friends... I would definitely recommend this product.",1317513600,15,1587,4.631205673758865
4372886,5,B004GGQMUG,Bought this movie for my niece and she loves it. Great movie would recommend it highly. Picture quality is really good.,1313884800,,119,4.714285714285714
4372887,5,B004GGQMUG,My grandchildren (age 2 & 4) learned about PIngu while viewing trailers from another DVD.  They enjoyed it so much that we purchased this set.  They find it enjoyable and dance along and mimic the characters.  Sometimes it is annoying for adults but then the children think it's hilarious and I think it allows for creativity and imagination.  All in all a wonderful children's DVD Set.,1311379200,,386,4.803030303030303

4372889,5,B004GGQMUG,"My toddler has been watching Pingu on Netflix, and he absolutely adores it! We were very excited to find this great collection of Pingu that we could own on DVD (region 1), and for such an excellent price. This collection includes about two dozen episodes, which are approximately 5 mins each, on two 2-sided discs. Pingu was created by a Swiss group for BBC children's television and I think it's brilliant. It's very well suited to young children by including short, simple, yet interesting little stories. The scenes, actions, music and dialogue (""penguin"" language) is slower-paced and continuous, which I think is much more well suited to young children than flashy, loud, and fast-paced cartoons. The characters speak nonsense ""penguinese"" but the stories are very easy to follow. We were initially concerned that the fake language would hold back my sons language skill development, but we watch it with him and constantly point things out and explain them in words. I'm amazed at out how well he follows it. The characters are appealing and depict typical family and friend relationships. The main character Pingu is charming and sometimes mischievous, relates well to little boys, and makes my son laugh all the time. The claymation is very well done and visually appealing (especially the newer episodes). There are a few scenes that some kids may find a little frightening (Pingu/Pinga gets lost; Pingu and Pinga go camping, and they get scared of the shadow of friend Robby outside the tent).

I really can't recommend this enough!",1300147200,22,1543,5.050980392156863
4372890,5,B004GGQMUG,"I teach kindergarten and on Fridays we eat in our classrooms and watch a special video. Over the past few years my kids have fallen in love with Pingu, to the point where the Pingu VHS tape we have is on its last hours! I was so excited to find this DVD with even more Pingu to replace our beloved VHS edition. Now my class wants to eat lunch inside everyday and doesn't want to watch anything other than Pingu! It is a silly claymation series, but my students are now fluent in ""penguinese""!!! I highly recommend.",1299801600,8,514,4.309278350515464

4372895,3,B004GGQMUG,The DVD set consists of 2 double sided DVDs that are poorly recorded as far as the sound goes. It was impossible for me to determine which side had which season on it. Also the sound quality was terrible. One episode will be significantly louder than the other. The advertising at the beginning of Pingu on thin Ice is so loud it made my 2 year old and 8 month very upset.,1406851200,,372,4.180555555555555

4372898,5,B004GGQMUG,"Checked out the ""Pingu"" movie at my local library, unsure what it was, but thinking my oldest daughter would enjoy it since she likes penguins.  Turns out, ALL of my kids adored it, and roared with a laughter harder than any I've heard yet.  So I bought this, to learn more about this guy.  It is a Swedish movie, I think, no spoken words, just entertaining ""penguin sounds"" and an unintelligible but very bouncy theme song strung throughout these shorts.  RUN to buy this for your kids--it is a long time since I have seen anything so cute, so original, so thoroughly entertaining for kids.  It is the same sort of animation as the old Rudolph series, not cartoon, kinda claymation figures that move around--very well done!  This stuff is proof that shows don't have to be obscene or rude in any way to grab your attention--my kids were enthralled from beginning to end!",1398470400,,871,4.623376623376624
4372899,5,B004GGQMUG,"This ""film"" is unique because it depends more on visual images than on auditory input. Pingu is entertaining to both children and adults!",1397001600,,137,5.0
4372900,5,B004GGQMUG,My daughter really likes these cartoons. No real languages are used but you can get an idea what the characters are saying based on manerisms and non-verbal cues.,1396915200,,162,4.821428571428571

4372914,4,B004GGQMUG,"I got this DVD so I could play it for my penguin preschool class. We didn't watch all the episodes together, but they were really interested and focused on what we did watch. I also thought it was cute. It was something different that none of them had seen before. The characters speak in an unknown language, but that doesn't hinder you from knowing what's happening. I think it adds to adds to the level of interest. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a cute penguin video for kids.",1370304000,,488,4.433333333333334

4372920,4,B004GGQMUG,"Having first seen these wonderful shows in Europe, I was pleased to find them available on DVD for an incredible price. While the quality of the episodes was fine, the packaging left much to be desired. The four features are burned on to two discs, without labels or any insert.

I love Pingu for everything it isn't. It's not showy and in your face, there are no annoying songs, it doesn't try too hard. The dialogue is suggested and left to the imagination, the lessons are subtle. Claymation is always awesome.

And my toddler is completely enthralled.",1361577600,4,446,4.36144578313253

On family request I began to seek Pingu materials for Christmas presents only to learn that these are rather obscure and hard to locate.  Multiple searches located few sources, many of which are overseas in Europe or Japan.  I searched many sites and went with this very nice DVD collection of four different groups of Pingu stories, each of which contains several episodes of the foreign-based penquin series.  They appear to be early ones and are of good sound and great clarity.  My family is very pleased with this set and I am a hero.",1356912000,,602,4.862745098039215

My 2 year old son has been watching Pingu for the past year or so, and each time he sees an episode he laughs and laughs, like it was the first time. We have quite a few DVDs but Pingu is a standard go-to.
We just purchased this to give as gift - we want to share the joy!",1334620800,,370,3.8815789473684212
4372932,5,B004GGQMUG,"I love this character and claymation/cartoon.  I came across it for the very first time through netflix.  My daughter who is only allowed to watch TV 2 to 3 times a week and only for a 1/2 hour each time is in love with Pingu!  I like that the episodes are short so if you want to stop the showing after an episode you can.  We just tell our daughter ""that's it all done"" and she just assumes that is the end of the DVD.  She actually will sit through these episodes and it is great to watch her face as she smiles or laughs at certain parts.  There are no actual words spoken which I love,  let your childs imagination go wild as to what Pingu and his family are trying to say and do.  Kind of takes me back to the old cartoon days of Tom and Jerry where you watched the funny actions and yet the beauty of Pingu is that it is not violent.  You don't ever see a cat chasing or beating on a mouse or vise versa!  I really hope you get this DVD and watch it with your kids you will love it!!!",1334102400,,991,3.91

4372935,5,B004GGQMUG,"How I wish I could write a positive review for Pingu, but unfortunately that is impossible now. Pingu has ruined our lives.

The first time my son watched Pingu was on a flight, he was 2 years old, and there has been no way back. He watched it non-stop during the 10-hour flight, laughing and kicking every minute, eventually being sick all over the seat and all over me.

He begged me to get ""birdy"" for him when we got home, so I did. The real name is ""Pingu"" not ""birdy"" as I found out. I was silly enough to get a whole pack with dozens and dozens of episodes.

My wife left me.

I'm joking, but she did threaten more than once if I didn't get rid of the DVDs.

I didn't destroy the DVDs and my son and I kept watching the Pingu.

The problem was I was addicted too. So my silly son and his useless dad would spend entire afternoons watching Pingu, kicking, throwing objects, custard pie, anything, laughing very loudly.

Eventually my son's table manners deteriorated so badly that we had to introduce rules: Pingu only at certain times, etc..

And then Pingu tried to fly, a bird pricked the balloons, Pingu fell from the sky and my son was so scared that he threw his train up in the air and bye bye 46 inch TV hello 13 inch screen.

Pingu ruined our lives.",1329350400,11,1264,4.233333333333333

Very low on stress, no loud noises, high shreeks or anything like that.  The soounds they make are low in key, so they don't grate on your nerves like other cartoons do.  Love it!!  Very cute!
