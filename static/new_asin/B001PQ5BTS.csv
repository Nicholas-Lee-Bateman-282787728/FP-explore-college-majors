8334266,4,B001PQ5BTS,"Bill Moyers did an amazing review of mind/body healing in this acclaimed series.  I still use it in teaching some of my university classes.  I particularly like the the program on ""Qi"" and Chinese mind/body healing and the review of Jon Kabat-Zinn's MBSR program at UMASS.  Some of the information is now a bit dated, as much new research had expanded our understanding of mind/body functioning.  For example,the Breast Cancer group study presented in the series that showed increased longevity of group participants has been followed up by a newer study that did not show increased longevity.  So with the exception of the outdated nature of some of the material, this beautifully produced series still provides a wonderful introduction to mind/body healing for general audiences.",1292371200,32,781,5.216
