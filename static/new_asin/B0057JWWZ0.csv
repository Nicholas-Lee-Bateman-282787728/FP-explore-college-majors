8460836,4,B0057JWWZ0,"Middle Eastern is a bit broad to describe this disc as it is essentially music from the greater Iranian world in the region of the Caspian Sea and Central Asia. Although there is some instrumental support, the music, as the name suggests, is all singing and singing of a rare traditional style. The main film of some 48 minutes is a somewhat disjointed series of interviews with some intriguing clips that unfortunately do not make it to the 106 minute concert that is described as a bonus on the menu. This will not suit everyone, and those looking for Arab or modern Lebanese fare should probably pass. Fairuz or Um Khalthoum this is not! Nevertheless it is fascinating stuff. The Azerbaijanis still show their Soviet connections by speaking in Russian and the Kurdish and Armenian music is actually from Northern Syria or perhaps South Eastern Turkey and is not at all Arabian in tone. My regret was that the concert did not include a number of other performances that were heard at the Festival as this would have greatly broadened the appeal. The technical quality of the disc is excellent. Not for everyone but a great disc for those interested in this limited field.",1315526400,,1173,4.754901960784314
