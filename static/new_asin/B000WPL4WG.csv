8225068,5,B000WPL4WG,"I remember watching this series growing up.  I stumbled across it on hulu.com only for hulu to remove it from its repretoire, inexplicably.  So I hunted the Internet for it and it here!  Great anime for the time it was made.  Decent storyline too.  As an adult rewatching the series, I still enjoy it.  Though, I can see where it was clearly written for children.  Far better than the American version in Robotech.",1444348800,,414,4.589041095890411

8225071,5,B000WPL4WG,"Product was as described by vendor. Product did ship late, but they threw in a bonus dvd movie. Can't say I am fond of the movie they gave me, but they made an attempt to please the customer so I can't totally knock them for that. Would buy from this vendor again.",1316304000,,264,4.096153846153846
8225072,5,B000WPL4WG,"This is the most perfect Macross box set. It was really hard for me to find this box set and it cost me around $200 includes shipping cost through ebay. Pretty expensive to me but feels worth it. This black box set was originally released by Animeigo but has been reverted to Harmony Gold. The new box set with different cover can be easily found in [...] and the price much cheaper but that one does not interest me to buy. Harmony Gold have changed the cover with the image of Ichijo Hikaru/Rick Hunter and Hayase Misa/Lisa Hayes hugging each other at the front. I prefer this black box set with the Macross logo at the front and a few image of main characters at the back. This box set holds nine disc in every single plastic case. There were linear notes as well decribing  characters, song, mecha and etc. Plus a hologramme plate. The subtitle is perfect. The picture looks much better than the ADV release. The poor thing is audio. Only in Mono. Maybe this is an old anime so it's hard for Animeigo to enhance the sound. No extra feature also, only a candid interview with Macross Director, Noburo Ishiguro on alternate audio track on disc 9 but I am still giving this anime 5 star because this is really a masterpiece. It feels great because I can see this beautiful anime and one of my favourite since I am a child, got a proper released. Watching this one brings back the nostalgic moments and gaves me a new prespective to the character of Lynn Minmay. Minmay was not a little brat and annoying girl. Harmony Gold has defamed her in Robotech. Most of the dialoques for her character has been changed and a few scene also has been taken out. The favour has been given to Hayase Misa(Lisa Hayes)which make most of American viewers hates Minmay. But watching this in the original language have changed me a lot and now I realize that Minmay was very soft, innocent and generous. She's even look lovely in here. I felt sorry for her and really touched at the end of the series when she let go Hikaru to Misa after trying so hard to be together with him. There were few scene becomes my favourite and I watch it again and again such in Romanesque, where Minmay and Hikaru kissed each other in front of Xmas cake in Christmas eve. It looks so romantic and touching. The other scene where Minmay went back to her home town, sit in her room and all the memories when Hikaru and her had together comes back to her. Not to mention also the scene Minmay returns Hikaru feelings by hugging him after Hikaru saved Kaifun and her from Kamjin. I just feel really touched because after so hard trying to be together, they finally reunited. There is no scene could touched me when Hikaru and Misa had.  My feelings also the same when I watched Macross Do you Remember love! Minmay only had her songs to make her strong to survive after she lost Hikaru. So sad! This one can be found on Macross Flash Back 2012 where Minmay has become a superstar and loved by her fans but her heart still broke. Loves this anime very much. None of today's anime can match this one!",1199750400,13,3057,4.408849557522124
