4706537,3,B005HVWWDK,"Let me start by saying I love the series. I was so excited to find this series at such a budget price. It started off amazing; I bought the first season and fell in love so I bought the 2nd and 3rd set of the S.A.V.E. series and was sorely disappointed. The box is a bit misleading by stating the 3rd and 4th seasons would be 16:9. Yes they are in widescreen but there were not enhanced for widescreen tvs. So what I got was this tiny little widescreen show in the middle of my widesreen TV!!! I am pissed! Such a shoddy presentation from funimation!

If you are willing to overlook the deception buy the set...if not...look somewhere else.",1341619200,3,640,4.333333333333333

DVD case is nice and feels heavy, all 4 cds are tightly placed, Good presentation! Third stage movie is great, continues right off Second Stage so its a smooth transition from where the story left off, some nice improvements on the cg racing scenes too, and SOUND if you've got the bass to back up those exhaust revs, wooo Satisfied!",1340582400,,471,4.303370786516854

4706604,5,B005HVWWDK,Great anime about street racing in the mountain passes of Japan. Funimation English dub is much better than original English dub.

B... are used so it may not be appropriate for some viewing audiences. one other thing different from the tokyo pop version is the use of nick names for some characters like iggi, natalie, cole, tak etc. this is not used in this S.A.V.E version.  but i totally love this film. i am a fan and can't wait to get my hands on stage 5 english-dubbed.",1372723200,,712,4.353383458646617

Back in the mid-2000s, Initial D was already an established property that many anime fans and car enthusiasts loved (including myself). With that much popularity circulating, it was only a matter of time before the US localized it and presented it to America.

So... US anime/manga distributor Tokyopop licensed the distribution rights to the Initial D anime as well as the manga it was based on.

In their attempt at creating an experience that could appeal to a wider audience, Toykopop did things that are totally unacceptable in today's US anime market.

* Names were changed/altered
* The original true-to-life car sounds were replaced with generic sound effects
* The Super Eurobeat soundtrack (a trait the series had become known for) was removed in favor of generic rap/rock music
* The computer-generated race sequences were given added ""special effects"" (this was the most questionable edit they made and still baffles me)
* A simplified translation that lost almost ALL the racing technicality in the process

Tokyopop tried to justify these edits by including the original Japanese versions of the episodes in the discs they had. But... the fans had spoken. The localization treatment Tokyopop gave to Initial D was horrible.

As time passed... it seemed like the US would never see Initial D in proper English. That is until Tokyopop lost the rights in 2008 and Funimation picked it up.

Now that the history lesson is over, it's onto the actual review :)

---

The first thing you'll notice about the Funimation version is that the original audio and soundtrack of the show has been kept in tact. They did what was originally expected the FIRST time it was being brought to America: ACCURATELY translate Initial D into English.

Initial D's dialog is one of those animes that uses a relaxed, everyday way of speaking. Tokyopop's did their best to honor this by forcefully adding in slang phrases like ""DUDE!! TAK'S EIGHT-SIX IS GETTING PUNKED!!""

Funimation also recognized the ""relaxed"" speak in their translation. But, they have scripted it in such a way that it doesn't feel forced at all. While they do use words like 'frikkin' and 'dude', the Funimation voice cast does its best to make it sound like talking and not script reading.

Also... props to the head of voice casting for finding suitable voice actors for each character (something the Tokyopop version missed by a LONGshot). Takumi, for one, sounds his age for once! But the real shining factor of the Funimation dub is that almost every character has an american voice that is pretty much an English version of their Japanese counterpart. Ryosuke Takahashi sounds pretty spot on :P

It's unfortunate that it's taken THIS long for America to get Initial D in an acceptable form. But, in the end, it was definitely worth the wait! The only thing I'm asking for now... is for a blu-ray release of this material.

And... I cannot wait until Initial D Fifth Stage is brought to US shores. Keep up the good work, Funimation :)",1366502400,,3242,4.879781420765028
4706674,5,B005HVWWDK,"Arrived earlier than promised, didn't dissappoint. Its a great product, good quality for an old cartoon. Highly recommended if you like cars in general.",1364947200,,152,5.375
4706675,5,B005HVWWDK,Very interesting anime with enough details to satisfy gear heads and in nice CGI graphics (i believe it was) for the time. Awesome story as well I'd say if they don't have all the season (1-4 currently) on Blu-ray which is what i  was looking for pick up one through four on DVD.,1364601600,,279,4.264150943396227
4706676,5,B005HVWWDK,"Like I said with the first season, the graphics and story line are simple but its still awesome. Has the english and japanese languages and english subtitles.",1363305600,,158,4.888888888888889
4706677,5,B005HVWWDK,"Been waiting for a while to get the series since my buddies have the japanese versions and the english subtitles just doesn't make sense at times. The rough translation sucks. Saw the S.A.V.E. editon on netflix and the voice over and subtitles makes sense and now it is better watching it and understanding what is going on. Searched for it on amazon and Bam! found it.
If you like anime or this title, get it in the S.A.V.E. version. You won't be disappointed. 13 episodes, includes extra stage 1 & 2.
3rd stage is full length feature film.",1359763200,2,541,4.530612244897959
4706678,5,B005HVWWDK,"The second stage is just as good as the first, only it is half the length. They also include the Extra Stage movie Battle 14 which is about the Sil-Eighty and its two drivers which is about the length of two episodes. In the extras on the Battle 14 disc they include the uncut movie. The Third stage is a full length movie and does seem to com to somewhat of a stopping place for the series, but don't worry! They made a stage four and it doesn't feel like they just tacked it on.",1357862400,4,480,4.063157894736842
4706679,5,B005HVWWDK,Way better than the Tokyopop version. This is uncut and very well redone by Funimation. You can understand to story line and not feel like something is missing.,1351123200,2,160,4.75
8473814,5,B005HVWWDK,"The graphics are a step up from stage 1. It's very nice! I bought this to replace my old subtitled Japanese DVD set. I like the Title Screen music as well. The previews make me want to watch Dragonball Z again lol. Soon I'll finish stage 2&3 and move on to stage 4 and review that.
