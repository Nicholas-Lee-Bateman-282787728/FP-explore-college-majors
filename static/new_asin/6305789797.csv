1069898,5,6305789797,"Undisputable one of the best movies to come out of Jamaica. This classic, entertaining, hilarious comedy offers non stop laughs. Aligned with an all star cast of not only good actor, but entertainers, as well, this Jamaican comedy crosses all lines of color, creed and social class. It not only offers a well writen, well directed movie, but also a strong ambience of Jamaican culture. Armed with true Jamaican patios and subtitle, for those that might have problem with the dialogue. I see no reason why this treasure should only be for Jamaicans, but should be shared with America and the rest of the free world too. I think that everyone should pick up this movie so the whole family can enjoy it. We can only hope that Jamaica has more movies like this one to offer in the future.",992390400,,784,4.607142857142857
1069899,5,6305789797,"See the real hardcore life in Jamaica. Backyard dubparty's, smoking the green herbs. Great soundtrack! A collector's item for reggae lovers. Turn up the volume and let the bass kick in... Jah love spread the word.",984960000,,213,4.944444444444445
1069900,5,6305789797,"WORDS CAAN DESCRIBE this masterpiece of Jamaican culture, seen! Shot during the ""Golden Age"" of Reggae music. See your favorite artists like Jacob ""KILLER"" Miller, Robbie Shakespear of ""Sly & Robbie,"" Gregory Issacs, Burning Spear (Winston Rodney), Big Youth, Kiddus I, Horsemouth, Tommy Mc Cook & the all-stars (crucial horn section). Some of the finest footage of Jamaican country and the very best musicians of the era can be seen on this film. A MUST HAVE for any serious Reggae enthusiast. You'll love the live 70's Stage Show ""dance hall fashion"" w/ Gregory Issacs crooning and Jack Ruby as da selecta'
Political violence rocked the country at this time in the 70's and one of the by-products of this was an energy...sort of a creation of vibes & the movement towards mass consciouness that can be seen, felt & certainly heard in this film, awul. The BONUS AUDIO tracks contain some NEVER RELEASED MATERIAL that are incredible...featuring some tracks from the score that you have never heard before. Also the SLIDESHOW contains a wonderful array of still-shots taken during the filming of ROCKERS.....excellent for backround A/V during entertaining. Some crucial shots of Peter Tosh too. Also, the PATOIS DICTIONARY is another must have for anybody who was not raised by Jamaicans, and trying to understand the dialect. Only Jah Know~",984528000,22,1340,5.095454545454546
1069901,5,6305789797,"This film is more than cookie cutter come-uppance. It is a spiritual journey, one that takes the viewer through a day in the life of a down-to-earth third world international superstar, who brushes shoulders with Police, Theives, Herbsmen, Artists, and everyday people. Rockers is a glimpse of Jamaican Culture, Music, Vibe, and Hard Roots Reggae.  I'd give it more stars, but it got 5 from everyone here already. I bought this DVD twice, one for me & one for my bud. The 7 bonus tracks are outstanding. The Soundtrack is only half the picture. There are many many more great songs in this film you could only get here. This is a no-brainer.",982022400,8,641,4.672566371681416
1069902,5,6305789797,"Part of what I like to call the ""Holy Trinity"" of reggae-flavored films--the other two being ""Harder They Come"" and ""Countryman"", ""Rockers"" is one of those rare movies  where style over substance is a moot point--it's still a classic! The  storyline is almost mythic in its simplicity and universal themes; but you  ultimately don't care because your senses are too busy soaking in the  infectious energy of the performers, the sumptuous tropical colors, and a  perfect marriage of visual movement and insistent reggae beats. The  subtitles are helpful but not really required in order to enjoy the  experience. The only other film I can think of to compare this to is 1959's  ""Black Orpheus"", which had a similar power to immerse you in  another culture with its heady combination of music, color and movement.  Warning-I guarantee you'll break traffic laws to rush right out and  immeadiately purchase the incredible soundtrack album (which thankfully is  in print and fairly easy to track down)!",963360000,10,998,5.092592592592593

1070130,5,6305789797,"Very well crafted film with many historic bonus cameos of reggae singers & musicians, some of whom are not with us anymore. The story is finely woven and politically on target. I've watched it many times over the years. Fantastic soundtrack & very powerful use of certain songs to enhance the scenes. The most memorable is all the friends of the hero assembling to venture out on a mission of liberation. They one by one strut through the yards & ghetto areas of Kingston to get to the meeting spot, with Peter Tosh's Steppin' Razor loudly playing, a perfect choice. The result will cause goose pimples! Not to be missed!",1311206400,,621,4.654545454545454
1070131,5,6305789797,"I first saw the film in 1983 ,when a friend showed it to me on VHS. I was instantly hooked ,and blown away at the amazing music and culture of Trenchtown. I also understand why Bob Marley was not featured in the film ,as he was way over exposed at that time .I have owned the first DVD version ,and the 25th annv. edition ,which I gave to a friend ,as a gift. I have dreamed of a Blu-ray transfer ,and am not that concerned that all the extras from the re-released DVD are not there ,but it is puzzling. I have not yet seen this ,and will possibly ammend this review ,but I am hoping for a straight film to Blu ray transfer. I hope to god this is not some Hack DVD clone job ,as I would be devastated. I intend to enjoy this film in it's pure aspect ratio and Hi-Res glory. DVD is ancient and I am done with it. Please let it be a ""tru Blu"" Film Transfer.",1285372800,,855,3.947976878612717

The plot is simple yet effective and the characters believable and real but the music just tops it all off. Good clean transfer onto blu-ray format with nice audio. I buy disks purely for the movie so i have no comments on the extras but you will not be disappointed with the quality of this movie finally on blu-ray. Good value and a must for collectors and reggae music lovers.",1261180800,,481,4.415730337078652
1070233,5,6305789797,"Poor people get ripped off every day, and nothing is ever done about it.  This low-budget film from the early eighties portrays a handful of Reggae studio musicians who take on the local Kingston version of organized crime who supplement their ill-gotten gains by stealing what little belongings the local poor folks have.  The musicians decide they too can play that game, emptying the bad guy's warehouses full of stolen property and re-distributing it all by leaving refrigerators, microwaves, stereo systems, bikes, motorbikes, lazy-boy recliners, and what have you, along the streets of Trenchtown and Shantytown in sort of a ""Christmas Morning"" give away.  After having seen the movie several times in theaters in the eighties, I jumped at the chance to own it when it was remastered for Blu-ray.  The sound track alone makes this flick well worth owning.  A fun movie that didn't cost a lot to make--don't expect any mind-blowing special effects, though--there aren't any.",1252713600,,979,5.170886075949367
1070234,4,6305789797,"First of all I have to say I love this movie for many reasons.  One of which is for the fact that Horsemouth is an awesome drummer and he had an aspiration to make a movie in his lifetime and made it happen.  AWESOME!  A low budget film, but it makes it so perfect!  The music selections make this flick totally worth buying!

So my discrepancy, unlike the DVD version of ""Rockers,"" the blu-ray version only has the film, chapter selections, and audio selections.  The DVD has a menu on terms used by Rastafarians and a menu where you can listen to most of the tracks on the movie.  Granted the menu on Rastafarian terms is kind of lame, it at least has more on it than the blu-ray version.  Why did Blu-ray come out if they aren't going to use everything it is capable of?  It can hold more information and at higher resolution.  So why aren't these menus and MORE on this DVD?  Well, I have no clue.  But I would suggest you buy the DVD version cause you'll get more out of your dollar.  This blu-ray version really disappointed me!  Not worth the price!",1246406400,10,1056,4.2944162436548226

It captures the vibe of reggae in the late '70s perfectly and includes performances by some of the greatest performers of the time.

I only wish more of the reggae musicians kept this same type of closely knit fraternity!  A lot of those same musicians have been recently featured on the Black Seed (2001) album.  Check both of them out!!!",1009497600,5,380,4.626865671641791
1070241,4,6305789797,"Okay, this is my absoulte favorite movie of all time, one that I base my own artistic philosophy on.  That being said, there are things about the DVD version I love and one major thing that bugs me.
The difference in picture quality versus the VHS version is AMAZING!  I've seen ""Rockers"" on video a hundred times but when I saw it on DVD for the first time I was shocked at the amount of detail I'd been missing. Colors, background business, scenery that I'd never noticed before jumped right out at me.
The bonus features also make this DVD worth the price.  The audio-only feature is great.  You get to hear all the songs in full and they're accompanied by excellent production stills from the movie itself and candid photos of the cast and crew taken on location.  The cast biographies are a nice addition, too.
My big complaint about the DVD version is the inclusion of additional music that was not included in either the theatrical or VHS release.  Several songs were seemingly randomly inserted and they changed the disco song playing at the Uptown club (I guess they couldn't re-secure the rights to ""Turn the Beat Around"").  The newly added songs haven't been properly mixed in at some points and are so loud they drown out the dialogue, which makes the subtitles feature absolutely necessary.
But this is such an incredible movie that it's still a worthwhile addition to your collection, regardless.  Maybe the solution is to own both the VHS and DVD versions.",995068800,22,1471,4.696498054474708
