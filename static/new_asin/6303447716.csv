8324594,2,6303447716,"OK - this vid delivers on its title - there is big air action for sure.  Unfortunately the whole thing is pretty low budget - if you're used to high budget, great music, beautifully shot snowboarding videos, then Big Fat Air will probably be pretty dissappointing.  Most of the snowboarding vids I own leave me with  that ""man I wish I was there"" feeling.  Big Fat Air doesn't even come close.",989971200,,393,4.492957746478873
8324595,1,6303447716,"One of the worst snowboarding videos I have ever seen.  The camera shots are all over the place and it doesn't flow nicely.  Instead you get dizzy while watching this video.  The video is very out dated and not at all fun to watch.  I did not understand what the host were doing and the music was just awful.  Most of the jumps were old and not ""big fat air"", it was just lame.  I do not recommend people to buy this video it was a total waste of money.",978480000,6,453,3.977777777777778
