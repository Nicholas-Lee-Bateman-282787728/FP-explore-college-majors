8012342,2,B0001GH7FY,"The version streaming on Amazon currently is only 69 minutes long (as of today, 12/05/2017). The original film is 84 minutes. About 15 minutes are missing. I have no idea what those minutes are. Based on the length cut, I'm assuming it's one or two skits that have been cut out. The film ends with ""Dark Town After Dark."" After some research, it looks like they fully cut out 2 sections and maybe shortened others.

""Star (of David) Wars"" seems to be missing
and
""The Bad News Bears in 'Getting Laid'"" seems to be missing

This film, LOOSE SHOES, is also known as COMING ATTRACTIONS and QUACKERS. The last part is the source of the title (based on Earl Butz infamous remark).

It is very silly and uses many overly-used gags. I'm",1512432000,2,729,4.507575757575758

8012344,2,B0001GH7FY,"For people much younger than myself, there are some topical allusions here that may be too dated to catch.  In 1976, two years before this film came out, agriculture secretary Earl Butz had to resign, when a joke he told privately at the expense of black people was reported in the press.  That joke is ironically quoted for the ""Loose Shoes"" song in the ""Darktown After Dark"" segment here.  Even if you were around in the 1970s, though, and caught that, there's not much else to laugh at; the ""Darktown"" sketch is probably the best of a rather poor selection.  The Woody Allen parody has a few moments, and there are a few other smiles here and there, but most of this film is desperately lame, with the Buddy Hackett skit about a treatment program for chronic bedwetters possibly the worst.  And then there's the video quality, very poor, and formatted for a 4x3 screen.  I think that, as another reviewer pointed out, it may just have been a sloppy copy of a VHS version.  This sloppiness shows on the DVD main menu, where the title is shown as ""Loose Shose"" (it's correct in the movie itself, of course).",1443744000,2,1108,4.5376884422110555
8012345,2,B0001GH7FY,"My memory of how funny the films was way off.  I found myself rather bored with the compilation.  That said, it has it's funny moments, notably the dark town after dark sequence - a la Cab Calloway.  But much of the rest was banal.",1434326400,2,231,4.204545454545454
8012346,5,B0001GH7FY,"...and there are some pretty slow bits but the finale ""Loose Shoes"" is video magic! Cab needed this material.  Always a late night pleaser when introduced to friends.",1391904000,2,166,4.928571428571429
8012347,5,B0001GH7FY,A really neat movie to see on occasion. Lots of cameos and off the wall skits. The Loose Shoes band number is the best ever.,1374710400,,124,4.0
8012348,3,B0001GH7FY,"I enjoyed the movie itself, I'd say it's a 3 star movie nothing great, but not bad. The dvd I received was from Miracle Pictures. It looks like it was recorded from an old vhs tape, and the sound quality is crap! It's sounds like the volume was all the way up or something, so that kind of took away from my enjoyment of the film. I would not recommend this dvd, version I would go buy a used vhs tape instead or what for a better dvd release.",1224806400,2,443,3.9887640449438204
8012349,3,B0001GH7FY,"I love those silly & stupid off beat movies, parodies ect... and when I heard this movie was along the lines of Kentucky Fried Movie, I was put off seeing it by how low it got a review on so many sites.

I have been really disappointed in the past with Tunnelvision and Amazon Woman On The Moon, and I had read up that this was another one where they put a well known star that was in it on the front cover who only has a short appearance in the movie... ya know like how they slapped Jack Nicolson on the cover of ""Little Shop Of Horrors""

Well, I figured for 89 cents, I'm sure I wouldn't be to disappointed as it was cheap for a coffee coaster if it bombed.

However, now that I have finally seen it, it will never be a coffee coaster.

Sure enough, as suspected, Bill Murray is only in it for the blink of an eye, and his scene is not really that funny. But it does have some good jokes in it.

Not everything is on mark, and some of it really stinks, but it has it's moments.

I enjoyed the opening Huge scene. Particularly a line about how far he can p%$#. And other little things like that throughout the film like ""these guys know how to use there pom poms, but can they f%$#""?

My favorite was one of the closing acts, a guy wakes up and cant get any from his wife, his shoes won't fit, and his bathrooms iced over, so that night he sings a great song about.

Well, thats the review of the movie, 3 stars for the film. It's not Kentucky Fried Movie, but it's far better then Tunnelvision & Amazon Woman On The Moon.

The quality of the film seems to be taken right off of a VHS or Beta tape. You can see the static lines now and then and even distorts for a second before it comes back. But, I can not see anyone demanding that this thing be restored to theater quality or remastered in 5.1, so it is what it is and it's better thing nothing. And I paid under a dollar for it, so how can you really complain about that.

The DVD I got came as a flip side with Bye Bye Baby on the other side of it. The Menu features the usual play all or chapter selection and also includes a small biography of 3 actors and the director, and also has a cheap little quiz game to play! Ten question about the movie, to see if you can get 100%... nothing special about it, but it's ok.

No subtitles, the sound can be pretty bad in some areas, the quality of the film is not the best, but the thing is watchable, turn the volume up and have a laugh, it gives you more then 89 cents worth of laughs, guaranteed!",1199577600,2,2501,4.022177419354839
8012350,3,B0001GH7FY,"In the vein of skit based comedic features such as Kentucky Fried Movie (1977), The Groove Tube (1974), Mr. Mike's Mondo Video (1979), Amazon Women on the Moon (1987), Tunnel Vision (1976), American Raspberry (1977), and That's Adequate (1989), comes Loose Shoes (1980), co-written and directed by Ira Miller, whose main claim to fame appears to be having had bits parts in a number of Mel Brooks features including High Anxiety (1977), History of the World: Part I (1981), and Spaceballs (1987), to name a few.  Some of the notable performers appearing are Bill Murray (Meatballs, Caddyshack), Buddy Hackett (It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World), Howard Hesseman (This Is Spinal Tap), Ed Lauter (Magic), actress turn director Betty Thomas (Private Parts), in a fairly revealing role, Jaye P. Morgan (""The Gong Show""), Sid Haig (Coffy), Avery Schreiber (Galaxina), Ysabel MacCloskey (""Bewitched""), and Walker Edmiston (""Barnaby Jones""), who provided the voice of the creepy Zuni doll featured in the memorable made for TV film Trilogy of Terror (1975).

The film is comprised of skits, some spoofs of popular films, with the writers trying to drawn upon the comedic value of combining two popular films into one.  An example would be Billy Jerk Goes to Oz...it's mildly amusing, but know a lot of the references are extremely dated and haven't held up very well (I wonder how many people born after the 1970s will recognize the Billy Jack reference).  While this is true of most of the films I mentioned at the beginning, Loose Shoes seems to suffer more than some the others given most of the material referenced is quite old or just somewhat obscure to begin with...some other skits involve spoofs on science fictions films, exploitation features, biographies, musicals, travelogues, public service announcements, and so on.  There is a somewhat humorous intermission bit, the kind of thing shown more often in the past, that touts the concession stand as a great place to alleviate that case of the munchies you may have developed from, well, you know...and if you ever wanted to see Avery Schreiber, who resembles a heavyset Gene Shalit, in a red sequined tutu, here's your chance (it's not as erotic as it sounds).  There were some references I didn't get at all including the bit with Howard Hesseman as a wartime correspondent in a spoof entitled `Just A Run in the Sun', which I think may have been tied to the film A Walk in the Sun (1945), but I'm not sure given I've never seen the latter.  Some of the bits had potential, but would often fizzle out, or just run longer than necessary (the take off of the biker flicks featuring skateboarders was one example of this).  There are two worthwhile sequences, the first one entitled `Ma and Pa Take Francis to New York'.  The filmmakers took the Ma and Pa characters popular way back in the 1950s with those Ma and Pa Kettle films (Ma and Pa Kettle Back on the Farm, Ma and Pa Kettle on Vacation, Ma and Pa Kettle at Home, etc.), and threw in an obscenity spewing talking pig named Francis (based partly on the Francis the talking mule, who never used such language).  Another great bit was the old time musical near the end, which includes a hilariously nasty song.  What about Bill Murray, you ask?  Well, he appears as a death row prisoner, wearing way too much make-up, in a jail house spoof, one that's not very good considering the lame gags present are as old as the hills.  All in all I'd say this might be worth getting if only for the Ma and Pa and the musical spoof segments, as the rest are relatively forgettable.  At the very least Loose Shoes doesn't run overly long, all of about 84 minutes, it's inexpensive, and was a heck of a lot funnier than Tunnel Vision (1976), which I just recently saw (and wished I hadn't).

The fullscreen (1.33:1) picture presented on this St. Clair Vision DVD release looks pretty decent, much like that of a slightly worn VHS tape, and the audio comes through well enough.  There aren't any extras included, but the skits are broken down into chapters stops so at least you can skip to the funniest bits, if you're so inclined.

By the way, John Candy's name is prominently displayed on the front of the DVD case, but if he was in this film, it must have been the smallest of parts as I missed him (he's not even listed in the credits, as far as I can tell).",1169424000,3,4369,4.681462140992167
