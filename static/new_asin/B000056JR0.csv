While she has been in some major motion pictures her roles often seemed small.  In this movie she has a starring role and you can really see a great performance.  Don't expect to see the same Loreli Gilmore.  Her character in this is very different!

  The story line is a cute little romantic comedy.  While it's not some great 5 star movie it is very watchable and something I would share with family and friends.

  The story is about Jessy (Lauren Graham) who comes home to see her father Jet James (Christopher Lloyd) who is in the hospital dying.  His best friend and fellow musician Nehemiah Peoples (Roger Daltrey) is staying at his home (somewhat of an uncle for Jessy.)  Jet a stereotypical rock star who has spent all his money.  While trying to hide her fathers car from the repo man Jessy ends up meeting Bobby Moritz (Casper VanDien).  They begin a relationship and Jessy believes that Bobby is a strugling poet.  She becomes upset when she learns that Bobby is really the nasty collection agent that has been hounding her father.

  I could not find this movie at my local video stores.  For this price it was a bargain.",1102118400,11,1257,4.4734513274336285

7932118,3,B000056JR0,"not an award winner but a sweet story .  Lauren Graham(GILMORE GIRLS) is the reason I bought this and she is always a delight to watch. A great actor and very good role model for teens. (except in Bad Santa..that is just not the type roll she needs to play) , and today we need role models who will not sell out to Hollywood.",1460419200,,325,4.078125

7932122,4,B000056JR0,"I really enjoyed this movie, probably because I like Lauren Graham and Christopher Lloyd. It isn't an earthshaking drama, but very believable story about real life. Not what you would expect but a nice little film. Kept my interest and will watch it again and again.",1361059200,,266,4.804347826086956
7932123,5,B000056JR0,"Wonderful cast and great story.  Features original music performed by members of the Who, Wings, Vanilla Fudge.  Not to be missed by fans of heart-felt contemporary love stories.  Lauren Graham dazzling in her first feature film leading lady role as the feisty Jesse James.  Casper Van Dien sets aside his action hero personna for a romantic role as a man in love who has a big problem.  One of Roger Daltrey's finest on camera performances as a broken down bass player and buddy of Christopher Lloyd's Woodstock-era rock star.
Check it out.",1243900800,,541,4.836956521739131
