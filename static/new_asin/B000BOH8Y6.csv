2433024,5,B000BOH8Y6,"I feel that this was another great foul-up on 20th Fox' part, right up on the level of the demise of Joss Whedon's ""Firefly"", especially Fox leaving A N fans hanging for five years for the resolution of the end-of season cliff-hanger. As ""Firefly"" has justified its' popularity with the release and massive success of ""Serenity"" (over a month in the Top Ten), Alien Nation proved itself through the production of FIVE (count 'em, 5) made-for-TV movies that followed.

1. ""Dark Horizon""- 1994

2. ""Body and Soul""-1995

3. ""The Enemy Within""- 1996

4. ""Millennium""-1996

5. ""The Udara Legacy""-1997

With the industry wasting production resources on so much other second rate crapola as fills the store shelves these days, I hope SOMEONE in the front office at FOX will take notice and put forth a little effort so all the ""Alien Nation"" fans won't have to wait as long for the TV movies as we have for the series.

As with ""Firefly"", FOX is missing out on a sure thing by not putting both these great programs back into production, instead of wasting resources on so much of the second rate drivel they are so famous for!",1136592000,157,1119,4.678571428571429
2433025,1,B000BOH8Y6,"I just read the review about this DVD set being 6 double sided disc with 2 episodes per side, volume problems, etc.  Being a big fan of this show when it aired, I was really looking forward to buying this until I read the review.  Why double sided discs? It is not necessary at all.  Double sided discs have been proven over and over to be a problem and do not last as long as a one sided DVD(according to many DVD websites, I'm not just saying this!), especially Universal (more info at video business dot com) who have done a horrendous job and have had major issues with the 'flipper' discs with 'Casino' & 'American Gothic' among man others.  Don't believe  me? Go to the reviews of those movies and check out 'Cinderella Man', 'Columbo', 'Quantum Leap', 'Blues Brothers', etc. This is just plain lazy and CHEAP.  Another great show BOTCHED by poor manufacturing and production.  Good riddance, they won't be getting one single solitary penny from me.  If you work for one of these companies and are reading this, do somethinng!! Us consumers are wising up and are tired of it.  %$#$%@#!  If ANYONE agrees with me, be sure and click the appropriate icon.",1135900800,134,1158,4.577669902912621
2433026,4,B000BOH8Y6,"It may be the ""Complete Series"" but does not include the four TV Movies made in later years.

Picture quality is okay but seems too colorful and a bit fuzzy.

Audio level also changes greatly from episode to episode so be very careful with your volume control.

Six double sided DVD box set with two episodes per side with no indication on packaging that DVD's are flippers.

Last DVD does feature a special on the making of Alien Nation.

This in places has a better picure quality than the episodes!

Please note however this special is five minutes in length - WOW!

So yes another great series let down by poor transfer to DVD with little or no quality control.",1135814400,72,665,4.491666666666666
2433027,5,B000BOH8Y6,"This series aired during the 1990-91 season on Fox. The network was trying to find more footing to accompany hits like ""The Simpsons"",""21 Jumpstreet"" and ""Married with Children"" so it decided to experiment with SciFi. This series blended the buddy cop formula with something akin to ""My Favorite Martian"". It looked through an alien prism at heavy duty issues like sexual harassment, predjudice, poverty, gangs, personal responsibilty, racism, gender roles and even school yard bullying. Viewers came to care about the characters in the show allowing it to soon build a base and sending it well onto it's way of being that rarity- a successful scifi show. Unfortunately, many factors aligned against this show: a major writer's strike, budget cuts, and a network jittery about the genre (face it, Fox has never been patient with scifi- look at ""Space: Above and Beyond"" and ""Firefly"". The only show it has ever stuck with for long was ""X-Files"".) The 1st season (and eventually the series)ended on a very tight cliff hanger. A series of 5 movies over the next ten years continued the story and provided closure for loyal fans. Hopefully Fox will see fit to release these movies as well. If you are looking for something quirky, thoughtful, action packed and a bit ""out there"", this is the show for you.",1135468800,21,1302,4.922727272727273
2433028,5,B000BOH8Y6,"I had avoided this show when it premiered, thinking it was another overhyped ""cops n' robbers in space"" show. I was wrong by a million miles. This series could stand in as the ultimate testing ground for true multiculturalism - a word that wasn't even in vogue at that the time (and the concept still isn't.) This series is one of those rare cases where television improves an on existing movie. The actors are likeable, the plots are intriguing, the dialog is coherent, the premise is thoughtful, and the action is packed. Alien Nation, like the original Star Trek series, was a ground-breaker in presenting thoughtful ideas and philosophic challenges in a non-threatening way with the assistance of ""fantasy"" as a back-drop. This series can really make a person think without having to be hit over the head. Fans of this show have speculated why this show died after the first season. Budgeting may have been a factor, but my personal belief was that it was the Hollywood Writers' Strike (of nine months) that killed this show, along with some other really good programs. Because of the Strike, a lot of really good, strong television simply couldn't sustain the momentum to develop a solid fan-base, and hence, advertisers to support the programming. Television networks became (more) afraid of challenging viewers and - once burned twice shy - seemed reluctant to give writers room for creativity lest they become too dependent. Alien Nation (opposite of alienation?) is a terrific television show whose time has come and should be revisited by viewers who prefer above-average dialog, moral and ethical stimulation, and sheer wit and whimsy just for fun.",1132617600,29,1659,5.0144927536231885

2433030,5,B000BOH8Y6,"Kenneth Johnson attempted to do with Alien Nation what Joss Whedon did with Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Take a mediocre movie and create a series that had heart, soul, and a mythology all it's own. If Alien Nation: The Series had been allowed to continue for a few more seasons, I have no doubt that it would have become one of those epic series that are now part of the American psyche. Unfortunately, the series was cancelled after just one season, but what a season it was! I am so glad that it is finally coming out on DVD! I just hope that the movies will eventually be released as well!",1130371200,128,590,4.324324324324325
2433031,5,B000BOH8Y6,"I really enjoyed this show. I liked the premise and the mythos; it was funny and interesting but wasn't exactly a mega hit. I'd buy it on DVD, though. It might not look the greatest, considering the time it was made, but overall I think it should hold up story wise.

I'm glad that it wasn't forgotten because it was a good show and glad it's getting praise on DVD. As always, when in doubt, Netflix it!",1130371200,6,403,4.233766233766234

As for the television series, it is basically Lethal Weapon meets Science Fiction. The leading stars for this series are Mathew Sykes, a human cop who is a bit mouthy. His partner is newcomer cop George Washington, not joking here. You will find yourself immersed with everything, from the birth of the Washington's new baby to Mathew and George recovering a newcomer artifact. To warn you, the series does stop at a cliffhanger.

We've just finished watching all the episodes and I was blown away by their quality. I really shouldn't be surprised by this it was developed by Kenneth Johnson; the same Kenneth Johnson who gave us the Incredible Hulk TV show with Bill Bixby. After the cliffhanger ending of the last episode, we immediately looked on youtube to see if we could see Alien Nation: Dark Horizon, the follow-up that was eventually made four years later. We were impressed by it as well.

2433131,5,B000BOH8Y6,"7/30/2104

I purchased this series back in the 1990's when it first became available. I was a loyal fan of the series when it was first aired. The writing and acting were top notch. The series addressed the issue of prejudice in a way that echoed my own feeling of being alien myself when I was growing up. It wasn't fashionable to be a science nerd with a slide rule and brief case in the 1950's. I consoled myself that many of the people that put me down were so stupid as to be beneath contempt.

I'm just finishing up watching the entire series which I haven't viewed for 12 years or so. It is an excellent series and as a Sci -Fi fan I highly recommend it as a must have addition for serious collectors. I also recommend the complete Alien Nation Movie collection, which I also plan on watching. The First movie ""Dark Horizon""  finishes up the final episode of the series which was left hanging after the series was cancelled and the other movies will also please fans of the series. Although I noted a review that had problems with playback of their disks I guess I'm fortunate because mine all work perfectly fine but as I said earlier I bought them back in the 1990's so who knows what the source is for the disks today with outsourcing so prevalent, they could be originating anywhere.

I noticed Gary Graham played the Vulcan Ambassador in the ""Star Trek Enterprise"" series. Another series that could have gone on for another season or two if I had my way. I guess it's like the song at the start of ""New Jack City"" ""Money , Money , Money"" is all the programming Exec's care about.

It's definitely a 5-star show, but I gave the set only four stars as the discs are double-sided.  However, they did play without problems.

2433163,4,B000BOH8Y6,"In the history of cinema, there are probably fewer than a dozen examples of television series that actually surpass the motion picture source material on which they are based.  Alien Nation is precisely such an achievement.

Originally a modest 1988 science fiction/ cop drama film starring James Cann and Mandy Patinkin, the series mirrored the usual prime time cop show format of the 1980s in terms of its general dynamic and pacing.  Of course the caveat here is that the show was set in slightly futuristic Los Angeles; where the human population is divided when a large spacecraft crash-lands and hence deposits a populace of genetically developed Tenctonese slaves from another galaxy.

Biped humanoids, these aliens are stronger, intelligent, and could be immediately identified by an apparent lack of hair and unique complexions/ skin markings.

The focal point of the show worked off the partnership between two LA police detectives, human Matthew Sikes (Gary Graham), and Tenctonese George Francisco (Eric Pierpoint) as they patrol an area known as ""Slagtown,"" the Tenctonese slums.  The show is comedic, action laden and chock full of pertinent social commentary that still holds up in society today.

Sikes, an admitted bigot, is initially offended that George was given an equal position as part of the department's diversity program rather than earning it over time.  One of countless humans with a prejudiced view toward the newcomers, much of the show's charm stems from the gradual broadening of Sikes' limited view of the whole race as a result of being partnered with George.

Where the film failed (it never really got into who the Tenctonese were as a people), the series absolutely dazzled.  Episodes typically divide time equally between the police precinct, Sikes' bachelor-style home life and George's very-humanlike family (which includes a wife and two kids).

The technical limitations of the era are completely nullified by solid writing and a very believable (yet fascinating) character dynamic.  Truly if modern filmmaking's notoriety is visual effects overshadowing storytelling then Alien Nation is proof positive of the inherent opposite.

As it had been many years since I encountered the show, I admittedly had it mentally intermingled with similarly themed shows V and Earth: Final Conflict.  Having revisited all of the franchises in question, I can assert that Alien Nation was by far the strongest of the lot despite perhaps being the least ""scientific"" and the most socially aware.

The lion's share of the credit for this program's achievement can be attributed directly to veteran television producer Kenneth Johnson, creator of such science fiction pieces as The Six-Million Dollar Man, The Incredible Hulk, and aforementioned V.  Should there arise any doubt to the man's uncanny television production sensibilities and/or approachable nature to what is considered my many to be a snobbish and oft unapproachable industry, a single listen to the included audio commentary will set the record straight!

It's nothing shy of tragic that Alien Nation only lasted a single season (22-episodes contained in this collection which aired between 1989 & 1990) on the Fox Network, who at the time reportedly couldn't financially continue production even though the ratings were strong enough to warrant renewal. The series' cliff-hanger ending was never resolved for the television audience, but Fox wisely decided to resurrect (and complete) the Alien Nation saga in the form of five made-for-television movies beginning in 1994.  While it would have been just amazing to have had said films included in this collection, they have, to Fox's credit, been released to DVD.

This is highly recommended science fiction drama that will, so long as there exists society, resonate with authority.",1304812800,3,3825,5.334442595673877

2433165,5,B000BOH8Y6,"This is hardly the complete series. The movies that followed the show's cancellation continue the story of Alien Nation and bring back all the show's main characters.
Taken in itself, the cliffhanger is the only drawback to this set. But, knowing that the movies were also available gave me something else to look forward to.
Gary Graham and Eric Pierpoint may as well be in buddy cop movies forever since they do it so well.
This is no cheap production and watching it again after all these years, you have to wonder why it was canceled. TV shows are best watched without commercials and this show is the perfect example of why. The stories are interesting and the characters (Humans AND aliens) are believable.
Graham is perfectly cast as opinionated, borderline racist Sikes and the change in him as his character grows as the series progresses is directly attributable to Pierpoint's performance as George. What a great big slice of SF fun and drama.",1302998400,3,954,4.823170731707317

2433170,2,B000BOH8Y6,"for those of you whom are disappointed by this series being randomly troublesome
due to the dvds being double-sided!? get yourselves an all region dvd player.

i have other dvds which are doubled-sided and won't play (properly) in my ntsc region 1 (ocassional load problems,freeze-ups,skips, sound quality fickleness,etc)
this is why a few months ago i got fed-up and bought a all region dvd player
right here at amazon (toshiba sd-705) for a very nice price.

i have found ntsc single dvd players and dual(vhs/dvd) units tend to be high maintenance(need to be cleaned after two or three discs or won't play scratched
discs very well.and the vhs side will only play a/o record with top brand vhs tapes
and the video heads need to be cleaned every two weeks and tend to break down after
only 2 and1/2 to 3 1/4 yrs).

all region players and psp 2 machines have a very good reputation for lasting many years (just never put a smudged,dusty,dirty or heavily scratched dvd into them
and we're better off buying single vhs video machines made by toshiba sharp and other high grade brands, with video dubbing hook-ups in the back)

the reason why i tell you this is a friend of mine in la,cali i've known for seven
yrs. proved to me doubled-sided discs are more tempermental in quality of duplication and playback then single-sided,dual-layered dvds and need to be treated

2433171,5,B000BOH8Y6,Another fine Televsion Series by V creator Kenneth Johnson he did a excellent job in developing Alien Nation into a tv series that has his vision and subjects just as his V saga. I highly recommend Alien Nation:The Series it even has stars and crew from his V saga. I also highly recommend getting the made-for-tv movie series too.,1272844800,,331,4.627118644067797
2433172,5,B000BOH8Y6,"This show, like all Kenny Johnson-produced TV series, is culturally relevent and fascinating, has great characters that develop steadily before your eyes, and you always feel you got something out of watching it.  Add to that action, wonderful humor, and a personal touch, and you can't resist watching it.

This series came out when I was a freshman. I never missed an episode. It was on the fledgling new Fox network.  Fox was so great back in those days:  Married with Children, Alien Nation, In Living Color, Tracy Ullman, the X-Files, you name it.

Alien Nation is about a ship that crashes in California's Mojave Desert.  The ship is not a vessel full of hostile, evil aliens bent on conquest but rather a ship of SLAVES.  They are taken into quarantine but unfortunately so are the Kleesanctsung (sp?), the slave master overseers (who usually provide the bad guy role in most epieosdes, look for the tattoo).  The show is a parallel between America's immigrant history, slavery, the struggle to fit in, there are Brown v. Board of Education allusions, interracial relationships (in this case, inter-species!), and all sorts of moral quandries and struggles.

We see and learn more and more about the culture of the Tanctonese (the alien slaves) and come to see how much they have in common with humans and how much we can learn from them.

The show is loaded with great plots, strong characters, and just plain fun.

It's more of a morally-based, didactic, cultural study show than was the feature film of the same name.  Alien Nation the movie, which I also like, is darker, more of a film noir type of thing.  Both are fun but have little in common.

I hope you buy this series and the awesome mini series specials of it that followed.  You won't regret it!",1272067200,,1766,4.7254901960784315

Yes, they do try to add some humor in with some slapstick (at Newcomer expense), but the fact that no one stops to see if Albert is all right shows the amount of racism that is alive and well in the series.  It is a pretty well written series, exploring not only the work lives of two cops, but their personal lives as well; what they feel, what they have to deal with as respective ""people"" and how they react to what they are put through.

2433182,5,B000BOH8Y6,"This excellent collection covers the TV series quite well. The pilot is a remake of the theatrical movie; the reshoot resulted in a recast, and that lead to a whole new take on the main characters.

Fundamentally, Alien Nation is a two-themed work: (1) Police Drama (2) Social Commentary about racism in the modern world. Both themes are very evident, and in one's face, and both drive the series in interesting directions.

Gary Graham, playing Matthew Sykes, brings to life a character who doesn't realize how bigoted he really is, and over the course of the season, begins to realize just what a jerk he really is, and to overcome his own prejudices.

Eric Pierpont, playing George Sam Francisco, is the alien beat cop skipped over the humans by affirmative action protocols. Eric's take on George is very different in manerisms than Mandy Patinkin (who played George in the Theatrical movie), and is a strong, self-confident character.

The conversion to DVD is excellent, and the series was top-notch. (Yet another case of finding the audience only after being canceled!)

The story does not end with the series, however... it concludes with a series of Made-for-TV-Movies, which are not in this collection. Familiarity with the original theatrical release is neither essential nor harmful.",1235001600,2,1295,5.089622641509434

2433187,1,B000BOH8Y6,"I saw the original ALIEN NATION movie, starring James Caan. It had weaknesses, perhaps mainly because it was an old movie. But it had strong points. As a discerning science-fiction fan, I found it tolerable. When ALIEN NATION - ULTIMATE MOVIE COLLECTION was released, I thought to read reviews for the TV series and the TV movies. Amazon bundled the series and the movie collection together; so I bought them all. That was a mistake. Amazon's high rating for the TV series betrayed me.

I watched about half of the series' pilot episode before giving up on it. I just could not stomach its lack of respect for a serious subject matter. Instead of feeling like a dedicated science fiction production, it felt like a blend of science fiction and sit-com.

Some screenwriters cannot resist the opportunity to display wit. For comedy, that's okay. If you insist that comedy is worth your while. For serious science fiction, or for ANY serious drama, gratuitous insertions of comedy are wrong. Behind all life, there exists a foundation of gravity. If for the moment that does not seem to be true, have patience. Eventually you will be reminded. So if your art emulates life, it must be serious.

But that does not mean a cinematic sequence should be excluded because it is humorous. If the story requires it, include it. On the other hand, do not deliberately insert humor just for the sake of humor. The engine that drives cinema is story. If you have a good story, devote yourself to it. That is all you need. Forget about trying to be funny.",1212105600,7,1540,4.696296296296296

2433192,5,B000BOH8Y6,"This DVD set contains the complete only season of the TV series, Alien Nation.  The video and audio quality is good - certainly equal to watching the series on TV.  The ""extras"" are quite brief - nothing to rave about - but were OK.

The plot is that five years before the time during which the episodes are set - the late 90's - an alien slave ship had a forced landing near Los Angeles.  The ship contained around 250,000 aliens - slaves who were bred to be very adaptable.  They look very much human with the exception of all being bald with patterns of large spots on their head where hair would be on a human as well as patterns of spots down their center back to the small of the back.  They are about 30% stronger than normal humans and more intelligent.  They learn very quickly.  Humans and aliens are sexually compatible recreationally, but it is unclear if a human and alien could produce a viable offspring.  After a period of quarantine, the aliens were assimilated into the culture of Los Angles.  The series starts after the 5-year assimilation period and the plot primarily follows the life of one of the aliens who became a LA detective and his human partner, as well as the family of the alien detective.  There are, however, other sub-main-character aliens, most of whom have regular interaction with the two detectives, including a female alien for whom the human detective starts to have romantic feelings.  The aliens seem to be in approximately the same cultural situation as African Americans in the late 50's and early 60's - fighting prejudice and discrimination.

I found the series to be fun.  It is well acted and the situations are quite believable for the most part.  It moves right along and doesn't get bogged down with philosophizing but there is plenty of character development.  Most of the aliens are quite likeable and I was empathetic to them and their situation.  The interaction between the alien and human detective is fun.  The growing romantic feelings between the human detective and the alien woman are well done.  The series ended with a bit of a cliffhanger and I, for one, wish there were more than just that first season.

I do recommend the series.",1209168000,3,2199,4.662337662337662

As I feel so strongly about how good this series is/was, I hesitated to write this review before -- I have SO much to say about it, it seemed hard to condense all that I felt in the length of a typical Amazon review.  However, I have just had a ""y/zilas/Cha"" (the Tenctonese word for ""epiphany"")....so I think I can condense my ideas enough here for a standard-size reviw....and include my not-so-standard-size admiration for this wonderful TV series.  (Or is it not-so-standard-size?  Everyone else who has had the privilege of seeing it during it's all-too-short (first?) season, must feel the same enormous admiration for the series as I have.....)

Why was/it it so good?  The premise is incrediblly personal to just about anyone on this planet!  I mean -- were you ever put down by anyone as a child -- or an adult?  Did you ever find the childhood ""duty"" of living with demanding parents, and/or visiting relatives, (and being nice to them!), somewhat more of a chore than should have been expected?  Did you ever meet with a class bully?  A dictatorial teacher....or doctor?  Or maybe just loving parents who never took you seriously as a kid?  Later on, did you ever meet with ""the boss from hell"", and or co-workers that you hated?  Do you have immigrants who tried to make it in a new country, somewhere in your ancestry?  Well, if you've ever had any of these experiences...or others, more horrendous than my sometimes too- vivid imagination can state here....you will be more than entranced and feel a kinship with, the Tenctonese ex-slaves who are 1/2 of the protaganist characters of this series.  As the story goes, their slave-ship, (including Overseers), crash-landed in the Mojave Desert in California, in 1988.  As th4e story opens it is 1989 -- and all the aliens, (whether former slave or former Overseer), must now find ways to live and survive in modern-day LA.

George Francisco, (ERIC PIERPOINT), has risen in the police ranks to become the first Tenctonese police detective.  He is a proud man, but gives due, (and sometimes -- especially at the series' beginning --undue) deference to his Human partner, Matt Sikes, (GARY GRAHAM), who obviously has been on Earth, and on the police force longer than he, George, has been on it. Howevever, even undue deference has its limits....and as the series progresses, Matt is sometimes proved wrong, where George's instincts are proved right, and Matt, sometimes grudgingly, does acknowledge this.  However, though Matt & George sometimes look at a crime from different angles -- they are both on the side of justice and equality....even though it sometimes SEEMS they are 180 degrees apart.....

  It would be easy to go into a long character description of all the wonderful characters on this program....but suffice it to say that each part is written, acted, and directed in a three-dimensional fashion.  One BELIEVES the reality of the fictionalized situation as it happens -- the stories are exciting, fast-moving, poignant, hilarious, touching.....and always, (after much realistic danger), have happy endings!

  The aim of the series is/was, obviously, understanding between fictionalized Humans and Tenctonese -- and, in the real world, to get us to try to be more understanding of our fellow ""different"" Human Beings -- of whatever race, creed, or color.  No -- this series did NOT want us all to start eating the strange alien foods...such as grasshopper mole, sour milk, newspaper, and pigs knuckles.  But it wanted us to RESPECT the customs of others -- just as we would hope they would respect ours.
I have known ""evangelical"" vegetarians, people who would not drink, (even coffee), for religious reasons, those who disapprove of inter-racial or inter-religious dating, some who think driving in any car is a sign of laziness, people who's favourite TV is WorldWide Wrestling, some who like opera, some who think that a 975 square-foot apartment is too big for two people.  Etc.  A.N.'s premise, however, is that, though everyone is enttitled to her/his opinion, they should allow others to live their own lives as THEY see fit, and not criticize.  What is most important in life is to RESPECT other's ways of living, even if you wouldn't ever do those things yourself.  Or -- as was said years ago on Professor JAMES SHENTON's TV series on American history: ""My right to swing my arm ends where your nose begins.""  Live and let live.  Respect others ways.  Give everyone a chance to make it!  I mean -- isn't that what the American Dream is supposed to be all about?

  The music on this show is excellent.  The sets are just right.  The pace of the series, the writing and the actors' delivery of it, perfect.  The stories are memorable.....and in many cases, unforgettable.
EVERYTHING was right with this series.  (If you're still not sure, get it from the library first....THEN buy it on Amazon!)

  Why did the show that reflected everyone's problems, and strove so mightily to solve them, end?  Your guess is as good as mine....but I really do think the powers that be should give this show another chance.  The world has changed a great deal since 1989.  But we still need ALIEN NATION....maybe now more than ever.  Bringing it back would make so many people happy....and, perhaps, help to make people understand each other, more, as well.

  I know I'm not the only one waiting for this wonderful show's return!  Buy a set of this series -- and see why!",1192752000,,5506,4.856068743286788

Fox could have done a much better job on the DVDs themselves, especially for a series that has such a strong following.

This show deserves so much better, but then again, it got cancelled when it was one of the best shows on the 89-90 schedule.

Here's to hoping the movies make it out one of these days.",1181692800,2,864,4.45859872611465
2433209,4,B000BOH8Y6,"Alien Nation was originally a movie released in 1988 starring James Caan and Mandy Patinkin. It followed the adventures of a human police detective (Caan) investigating the murder of his partner by Newcomers - members of an alien race that crash-landed on Earth years earlier and are now citizens of Los Angeles/USA. In order to catch the killers, the human detective partnered up with L.A.'s first Newcomer police detective (Mandy Patinkin).

The television series, released in 1989, recast the various roles (Gary Graham took over as the human detective with Eric Pierpoint as his Newcomer partner), but kept the movie plotlines intact - even including scenes from the movie in the pilot episode. The result was 22 episodes of interesting (and, at the time,) near-future science fiction that dealt with the pertinent social issues and cultural changes of the time.

Years later, the episodes and the issues that they dealt with are still relevant and interesting to watch. Immigration, relationships, cultural identity - the world is still trying to figure out how to handle these facets of itself. Alien Nation tries to put them into perspective, and allows viewers to experience them at a safe distance - while making sure there is plenty of humor and action to keep everyone in the audience entertained. The episodes have aged very well, though some of the technology that the detectives use (especially their computers) will seem extremely dated and slightly off.

There are two big disappointments in this set: The first is that there are very few extras beyond the series itself, so don't expect episode commentaries, etc..(though there is a single commentary track for the pilot episode). The second is that the last episode (and, thus, the series) ends on a cliffhanger! What will happen to our favorite detective oddcouple? The answer can be found in the made-for-TV movie _Dark Horizon_ - but that's not included in this boxed set.

Physical and technical aspects of the DVDs: This set contains six double-sided DVDs stored in three slim DVD cases (two DVDs per case). The total space is about the same as one-and-one-half normal DVD cases. I am very happy with this setup, as the slim cases seem to make it harder for the DVDs to slip during shipping; the set also takes up much less shelf space. I experienced minor technical glitches during one of the episodes on the fourth DVD when I attempted to play it on my old DVD player, but using a newer system (a slightly dated Playstation 2) allowed the episode to play completely.

Note about the made-for-TV movies: there has been some concern from fans that not all of the TV episodes are in this set. While all of the TV episodes ARE INCLUDED, the five made-for-TV movies are not. The movies, _Dark Horizon_, _Body and Soul_, _Millenium_, _The Enemy Within_, and _The Udara Legacy_, contain all of the main actors from the series, and shared a similar look and feel. At the time of this writing, these movies were not available on DVD.

May 2008 Edit: The made-for-TV movies were recently released as a set called _Alien Nation: The Ultimate Movie Collection_. That set picks up right where the series ends, and is definitely an excellent purchase for fans of the show.",1178928000,8,3233,4.90127970749543

2433216,3,B000BOH8Y6,"Alien Nation isn't just a sci-fi show masquerading as a cop show.  It's equal & intelligent measures of both and reminds the viewer what can be accomplished when serious treatment of science fiction is presented to a mainstream audience.

Too often Sci-Fi gets a ""cult"" label - something only Star Trek or Star Wars people should watch or love.  However, when you look at the lists of the most profitable movies of all time, you find many science fiction titles - E.T. The Extraterrestrial, Terminator 2: Judgement Day and of course the Star Wars films.  If so many people are going to see these movies, then how can one justify the ""cult"" label?  To be fair, there is much sci-fi that isn't done well, however when it's a focused production like Alien Nation, audiences are treated to quality, intelligent entertainment with more than just car chases and gun fights.

Unfortunately FOX didn't include any extras on this release, but at least we have these great episodes.  Treat yourself to great, memorable stories and characters and pick up this DVD set.",1156204800,7,1057,4.838888888888889

It would be great to have the option to see interviews from the actors, many of whom seem to have reached a deadend in their careers after the series and the movies that followed.  It would be great to have a guide to the series or a dictionary of terms that are used.  Anything.  But there is next to nothing.

Starring Gary Graham as Matt Sikes and Eric Pierpoint as George Francisco, this series is much more than a sci-fi cops and robbers story -- it is the story of the Tenctonese as they attempt to integrate themselves into human society.  Series creator Kenneth Johnson has done a masterful job of weaving subtle social commentary into each episode, adding enough humor into the mix to keep the series from taking itself too seriously.

My only disappointment with this DVD set is the fact that, apart from commentary from Kenneth Johnson in the pilot and a making-of featurette, there are no extras.  One would think that the suits at Fox would have thought about having extras on the DVD, but they didn't.

All in all, an excellent set to take home.",1152316800,5,861,4.564935064935065

This has always been one of my all time favorite series, but after watching the pilot with Johnson's voice-over and the actors's voices muted, I gained a new appreciation for the acting of all the characters just in terms of body language and facial expressions.  If you missed this on Fox and saw it chopped up on Sci Fi, you need this set!

I thought I might have grown up too much. What I discovered was that this show was better written and performed than I remembered.

You know the story. Alien slaves land on Earth and must assimilate into human society. It was a very thinly veiled take on racism, among other things. It was a clever attempt at trying to get people to think about their attitudes.

Okay, some might think some of the acting was a bit over done. Maybe they're right but I think it was effective. They never got close enough to home with their issues-based scripts to get uncomfortable.

I am enjoying my DVDs, and that's all you can ask for. My children, who weren't even born when the show was in production, are really loving it. My wife actually likes the show.

2433227,5,B000BOH8Y6,"Kenneth Johnson,the creator of TV Hulk and V, bring his moral ideals to the Alien Nation. Johnson's TV work has always showed us the human condition..preaching a message without hitting us over the head with it

you must remember in his mini series and short lived tv series V, the nasty aliens who are so nice and helpful. In  this series of the flip side. The aliens in Nation are  distrusted and hated... as in V, they were thought as  friends.

This complete series was more than a cop show, more than Science Fiction show...It blending of social culture and worked on many different levels. It isn't the alien bad guy which it could have been play it.  It is like black/white, jew/christian, etc..Star Trek did it in the 60's with their Battlefield episode. This show is pointing out the difference and well as our similar ideals.

The audio commentary on the series pilot from Kenneth Johnson is an amazing piece of insight into the creation of Nation to TV and the process of filmmaking.

The story lines are still freah 15 years after they were made. Everything from drugs to inter-racial couples are covered. This cult classic is for those who want Science Fiction witha brain, and not shoot the aliens.

The only problem i see is the missed movies which were made after the series waS OVER. At least they should have put the film which finished the series cliffhanger. Well we can hope for the Alien Nation Movies soon, I hope

I have a question though. Does anyone else think that there is at least 3 missing episodes?

By this I mean, there was one episode I'd seen (When FOX actually had enough brains to air this series.) that had Sikes and Fansisco investigating deceased persons that had been hit in their armpit. - It was supposed to be a method that killed Tenktonese instantly.

Alien Nation takes us to post 2000 L.A. where we get to follow around human Detective Matthew Sikes and Newcommer Detective George Francisco.  The Newcommers have landed and infiltrated society.  They get wasted on sour milk and love to eat raw dead things like beavers and ocelots.  They're stonger, smarter and sport bald, speckled heads.  How's that for racial tension.  Bring it on.  Me and my wife used to tune in every week to watch this Fox show and every week we were never disappointed, until they canceled it like a bunch of fools.
