4397470,4,B004KO94K4,"Vincente Minnelli's ""Two Weeks in Another Town"" is pure cinematic cheese, but cheese of an exalted kind--sort of a cinematic double-cream Brie. Minnelli, screenwriter Charles Schnee and producer John Houseman (yes, THAT John Houseman) frame ""Two Weeks in Another Town"" as a followup, though not a sequel, to their previous Hollywood soap opera, ""The Bad and the Beautiful,"" which also starred Kirk Douglas. Here, Douglas plays a washed-up alcoholic actor who flies to Rome on the promise of two weeks of work from an old director frenemy (Edward G. Robinson). From there, Douglas is forced to deal with his much-hated, much-lusted-after ex-wife (Cyd Charisse), Robinson's drunken harpy wife (Claire Trevor), a self-pitying baby of a young leading man (George Hamilton), and many other viperish types. But there is still time for Douglas and Robinson to screen their previous big hit (""The Bad and the Beautiful,"" of course).

""Two Weeks in Another Town"" is garish even by early-Sixties soap-opera standards, and wildly overacted in the bargain (especially by Trevor, Charisse and Hamilton). But Minnelli's direction is expert, and Schnee's runaway-freight-train style of storytelling keeps you watching, no matter how much you hate yourself for it. The film probably deserves a rating of between three-and-a-half and three-and-three-quarters stars out of five, and I don't mind bumping it up to four.",1398816000,2,1400,5.422018348623853
4397471,3,B004KO94K4,I thought I get a better movie than this one from Kirk Douglas and Edward G. Robinson plus love interests in the movie were flat out boring. The movie from what I seen of it was a take off of the other one that Kirk Douglas did with Lana Turner  the same plots & same format. Edward  G. as also done better. The ending had me a total lost driving a sport car under a water fall OK  ???  If a person has time give it a view otherwise  Douglas and Robinson have done better with there talents as well as the rest of the cast.  2 stars is all I can give it,1378512000,,553,3.807017543859649
4397472,2,B004KO94K4,"Aspiring to be an updating of ""The Bad and the Beautiful,"" this film is deeply disappointing and nearly impossible to get through. Kirk Douglas does a good reincarnation of his role in the earlier film (though as an actor, not a director), but Edward G. Robinson is painfully bad, and the others' acting can kindly be called dreadful. Perhaps the worst is George Hamilton, playing a pouting and prancing movie idol (I think) whose petulence is so over the top to suggest he was in another, camp version of the film. Vincente Minnelli is the director, and his work here is even worse than his ""The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse,"" made a year earlier, with Glenn Ford (playing an Argentine playboy) and Ingrid Thulin (playing his lover). That film also has actors competiting for most dreadful performance, but the award must go to Lee J. Cobb, who portrays an Argentine landowner with the inability to stop dancing and prancing. ""Two Weeks,"" then, is a curiosity, certainly, but one is curious only to be aghast at how a really poor film can descend to such levels of awfulness while not providing a reasonable amount of camp. If you want to see Kirk, watch ""The B and the B"" again. If you want to see decadent Rome, go for ""La Dolce Vita,"" (the phony Via Veneto in both films was shot in Cinecitta) and if you want to suffer through the existential travails of a celebrated director, there is ""8-1/2,"" which would be a useful antidote to ""Two Weeks""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Two-Weeks-In-Another-Town-Remaster/dp/B004KO94K4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Two Weeks In Another Town [Remaster</a>].

4397474,4,B004KO94K4,"Che bella citta Roma!  Vincent Minnelli's ""Two Weeks In Another Town"" is pure glamour, trash, camp and Hollywood glitz. In other words it is great fun. Don't go into it expecting anything more than over the top soap opera with the suds on overflow and you won't be disappointed.
  Rome takes center stage in the film and is shown in all its ""La Dolce Vita"" glory of 1962. So much was happening there at this time. The birth of the paparazzi, the filming of ""Cleopatra"" and the international ""Jet Set"" had just landed in Rome to make it the fun capital of the world. The film captures all of this with high gloss and a tip of the fedora to Fellini who had first shown a light on the goings on along the Via Veneto a few years earlier.
  Kirk Douglas plays a down and out movie star just released from a mental institution / rehab center when he is invited to fly to Rome by his old director and ex friend Edward G. Robinson to take a small comeback part in his epic being filmed at the famed Cinecitta Studios. Well I don't want to spoil the fun so all I will say is that there are plenty of gorgeous Italians running amok and lots of fabulous jewels bedecking Cyd Charisse. Tons of locations throughout the Eternal City and even an orgy!  But the highlight of the film is the climactic scenic drive through the streets of Rome that Douglas takes Miss Charisse on after the orgy. That drive has to be seen to be believed! Words fail me at the sheer joy of this over wrought fun fest.
  Trust me, it isn't anywhere near the brilliance of ""The Bad and The Beautiful"" of which it is a kind of follow up on, But it is beautifully bad in the very best way.
  The DVD says remastered. But don't expect Blu-ray quality, it is fine nothing spectacular in it's re-mastering. But the color is good and the picture is clear.
  I say, go ahead and take the plunge in this Fontana di Trevi of a movie.",1303344000,16,1887,4.254901960784314
4397475,2,B004KO94K4,"""Two Weeks in Another Town"" is a 1962 drama from Vincent Minnelli, starring Kirk Douglas, Edward G Robinson, Claire Trevor, and Cyd Charisse with George Hamilton, James Gregory, and George Macready. It was based on the Irwin Shaw novel of the same name.

Kirk Douglas (1916 - ) was a big star at the time. He had been Oscar nominated 3 times (""Champion"" in 1949, ""The Bad and the Beautiful"" in 1952, and ""Lust for Life"" in 1957) and had won the Golden Glove for ""Lust for Life"". His memorable roles include ""Young Man with a Horn"" (1950), ""Paths of Glory"" (1957),  ""The Vikings"" (1958), ""Spartacus"" (1960) and ""Seven Days in May"" (1964) He appears as #17 on the AFI list of Top 50 Screen Legends. Douglas plays an actor who gets released from a mental hospital to make a film with his former mentor, played by Robinson.

Edward G Robinson (1893-1973) was one of Warners biggest stars of the 1930s, usually playing a gangster. The 1940s would see him expand with films like ""The Sea Wolf"" (1941), ""Double Indemnity"" (1944), ""The Woman in the Window"" (1945), ""Scarlet Street"" (1946) and ""House of Strangers"" (1949) and later he would do such notable films as ""The Ten Commandments"" (1956), ""Hole in the Head"" (1959), ""The Cincinnati Kid"" (1965), and ""Soylent Green"" (1973). Robinson plays a film director under pressure to finish his film on time.

Claire Trevor (1910-2000) was dubbed the ""Queen of film noir"" because of her roles in films like ""Street of Chance"" (1942), ""Murder My Sweet"" (1944), and ""Born to Kill"" (1947), but in fact she had quite a varied career in multiple genres and was nominated for an Oscar 3 times (""Dead End"", ""Key Largo"", ""The High and the Mighty"") and an Emmy 2 times (1950, 1954). She made more than 50 films before transitioning to TV in the 50s. I liked her best in ""The High and the Mighty"", one of 4 films she did with John Wayne.  Trevor plays Robinson's long suffering wife.

BTW - Robinson and Trevor played a memorable couple in ""Key Largo"" (1948), a role for which Trevor won the Oscar.

Cyd Charisse (1922-2008) is best known for her dancing roles in films like ""Singing in the Rain"" (1952), ""Brigadoon"" (1954), and ""Silk Stockings"" (1957) - she was one of the few actresses/dancers who worked with both Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly, both of whom she characterized as ""delicious"". Charisse plays the femme fatale.

James Gregory (1911-2002) specialized in playing brash characters in more than 50 films. He's probably best known as Inspector Frank Luger from the TV series ""Barney Miller"" (1975-82) or as Dean Martin's boss in the Matt Helm films. I liked him best as the Senator in ""Manchurian Candidate"" (1962). Gregory plays an abrasive lawyer, but he is on screen so rarely it's a shame.

Sleazy George Macready (1899-1973) spiced up more than 100 films, often as a villain in films like ""The Seventh Cross"" (1944), ""Counter Attack"" (1945), and my personal favorite performance in  ""Paths of Glory"" (1957) that starred Douglas. When asked about always playing the villain, Macready claimed ""At heart, I am a kind man."" Unfortunately if you sneeze you'll miss Macready, which is a waste of talent.

Leslie Uggams (1943 - ) made her film debut as a singer, the first of a dozen films she made between 1962 and 2009. Uggams is probably best known as a singer, or as Kizzy from ""Roots"" (1977) for which she received an Emmy nomination, 1 of 3 she earned, including a win for ""Fantasy"" (1982). In 1968 she won a Tony for ""Hallulejah Baby"".

It's often said that ""Two weeks"" is a companion or sequel to ""The Bad and the Beautiful"" (1952). The film that Robinson and Douglas watch in ""Two Weeks"" is  indeed ""The Bad and the Beautiful"". It was concerned with movie making and had the same producer (Houseman), the same director (Minnelli), the same composer (David Raskin), same screenwriter (Charles Schnee) and the same star (Douglas) as this film. That film holds the record for the most Oscar wins (5 - Actress, Screenplay, Art Direction, Black and White Cinematography, and Costume Design) without winning Best Picture. In addition to 5 wins, Douglas was nominated for Best Actor (but lost to Gary Cooper for ""High Noon"").

Vincente Minnelli (1903-1986) directed nearly 40 films between 1942 and 1976. Perhaps he's best known for his marriage to Judy Garland (1945-51) and their child, Liza. Minnelli won an Oscar for ""Gigi"" (1958) and was nominated for ""An American in Paris"" (1951). In addition, he earned 5 DGA nominations, for those two and ""Bells are Ringing"" (1960), ""Home from the Hill"" (1960) and ""The Bad and the Beautiful"" (1952), which also starred Kirk Douglas.

Director/actor/producer John Houseman (1902-88) produced this film, one of two he did that year. Houseman is best known for his collaborations with Orson Welles in the 30s and 40s. Houseman produced nearly 30 films and appeared as an actor in as many (e.g., ""Seven Days in May"", ""Rollerball"", ""Three Days of the Condor"", ""The Naked Gun""). His films rarely received awards but were popular - ""The Blue Dahlia"" (1946), ""Julius Caesar"" (1953), ""Executive Suite"" (1954), and ""Lust for Life"". He often worked with Douglas.

NY Times critic Bosley Crowther said ""The whole thing is a lot of glib trade patter, ridiculous and unconvincing snarls and a weird professional clash between the actor and director that is like something out of a Hollywood cartoon."" I have to agree with Crowther. Many of the performances (Robinson and Trevor) are so over the top it borders on comical. And Douglas' idea of portraying mental illness is to shake his hands and grab his head.

In addition, the musical score is so intrusive it is almost a companion film. David Raskin (1912-2004) gets the blame here. Raskin worked on more than 100 films and was twice nominated for an Oscar (""Forever Amber"" and ""Separate Tables"") but his work here is more comical.

Finally, the production values were poor, especially the scenes in a car that are so obviously using a backdrop that you have to wonder if it's 1930 instead of 1962.

1962 was a good year for films. The top grossing films were ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""The Longest Day"", ""In Search of the Castaways"", ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane"", and ""The Music Man"".  Oscars went to ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (Picture, Director), ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" (Actor), ""The Miracle Worker"" (Actress, Supporting Actress), and ""Sweet Bird of Youth"" (Supporting Actor). Other notable films released that year include ""Advise and Consent"", ""Dr. No"", ""Jules and Jim"", ""Lolita"", ""The Manchurian Candidate"", and ""Mondo Cane"". Hope and Crosby released their final ""Road"" film.

Films about film making are all too common. Some of the best include ""Bombshell"" (1933), ""Sunset Boulevard"" (1950), ""The Stuntman"" (1980), ""A Star is Born"" (1937, 1954), and ""Swimming with Sharks"" (1994). A bit off beat, one should also see ""Ed Wood"" (1994), ""Get Shorty"" (1995), or ""Shadow of the Vampire"" (2000). Watch any of these instead of this one.",1299888000,8,6951,4.868755292125318
4397476,5,B004KO94K4,"Just get this. Vincent Minnelli directed this handsome production that seems to be completely shot in Rome, and also Cinecitta studios, (one of the settings). Kirk Douglas and Ed G. Robinson are the big stars in this. Both Hollywood people, one a director, and the other an oscar winning actor both on the verge of their own personal demises. A chance comes for both of them that brings them together, while you get to hang with them on and off sets with George Hamilton and various stunning Italian beauties. Once this movie gets it's motor going, it's going to knock you over. I don't want to reveal the end, or really, the big scenes near the end, but I will say that now I see where Oliver Stone got his ideas for the fantasy sequences in Natural Born Killers and Rodriquez got his visual style for the car sequences in Sin City. Cyd Charisse plays a real succubus, (if I've spelled that right)...with more danger than Lena Horne in her hottest scenes...and that's saying something. Both gals seem to be equal in their abilities in flashing dazzling, dangerous teeth. Technicolor looks extravagant in this film, and so does Rome at night. You care for the lead, Kirk, and don't want some downtempo melodrama to eat him alive, which seems to be always lurking around the corner..but that's the great trick of this film...it puts you on edge and then delivers goods you never expected. When it's over, you've been on a wild ride. You might also dig Kirk's Maserati convertible too...or Clare Trevor, who gets to have lots of fun tearing up the scenery. And while you're at it, get a front projector so you can watch these astonishing films from this period on a 72 inch screen.  You'lll never look back.

8433241,5,B004KO94K4,"This is an early gem of Kirk Douglas's work. It is such a benchmark  of the 1960's and contains a variety of great performances, including George Hamilton before he became a self parody of himself.  This is a lesser work of the Bad and Beautiful genre. In his early performances, Kirk played flawed characters, who betrayed a weakness. Only later did he become, Kirk Douglas with a capital K, the teeth barring, dimpled chin full of aggression.
In this he is a damaged director, just out of the asylum, trying to make a comeback on a picture in Rome. Hired by his old nemesis, Edward G. Robinson, he is walking a tight rope of frailty.

8433245,3,B004KO94K4,"Maybe they should have stayed at home.  TWO WEEKS IN ANOTHER TOWN (1962) has the technical advantages of color and widescreen, but otherwise it drags uncomfortable amounts of deja vu in from THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL (1952), with which it shares the same star (Kirk Douglas), director (Vincente Minnelli) and composer (David Raskin, whose music verges on self-plagiarism) -- in fact, the film that Douglas' character is helping to doctor consists of outtakes from that earlier movie.  This film is set in Rome, but despite a multinational cast and Cinecitta sequences that include the Via Veneto set from Fellini's 1960 LA DOLCE VITA, has little real Italian feel.  Perhaps the problem is that BAD AND BEAUTIFUL was a full-out melodrama, while this one wavers into psychodrama with too much violence on the part of Douglas' character battling substance abuse and a romantic addiction in the form of an obscure object of desire played a little too over-the-top by Cyd Charisse.  Her performance is uncomfortably strong, but the real razzie for overacting should go to Claire Trevor as the nagging wife of an American director (Edward G. Robinson).  With Daliah Lavi, George Macready, Vito Scotti, and George Hamilton as the obligatory Brandoesque punk.  Leslie Uggams' first movie appearance.

The Beautiful. Here, people are bad and beautiful enough, but the writing is
clumsy and the directing pretty close to awful. The overacting borders on
inane, most notably Claire Trevor, in an admittedly thankless role. Even the
always brilliant Kirk Douglas can't emerge unscathed. And yet, the great Italy
locations and backstabbing nonsense manage to entertain despite the excesses.
