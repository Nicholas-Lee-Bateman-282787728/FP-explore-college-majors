8382936,3,B002WAVS9S,"This DVD may have been published in 2009, but the content is at least half a century old. It's not like the history of the 1880s has changed much since whenever this was made, but the documentary style certainly has.
Style-wise, I enjoyed the documentary, but content-wise it was lacking. The subjects listed in the description (Brooklyn Bridge, O.K. Corrall, Buffalo Bill, etc.) are touched upon, but there is very little depth. Maybe one or two fun facts per topic. I think the documentary covered about thirty topics in about as many minutes. Maybe it was 40 minutes.
Anyway, if you like old-style newsreels and that sort of thing, you will probably enjoy this. If not, you probably won't. If you are looking for in-depth historical research for a history-related project as I am, however, this will only serve as a starting point for subjects to research on your own time. For instance, you can learn way more about 1880s baseball from the Bay Area Vintage Baseball group than you do on any subject covered in the DVD... except maybe Alexander Graham Bell.
In addition to the documentary, the DVD also includes a lengthy dramatized biopic of Alexander Graham Bell that was actually kind of interesting and entertaining. I think it was about 20-30 minutes of the total 60. Again, if you don't like old movies, you probably won't enjoy this.",1491436800,,1343,4.818181818181818
