8681065,1,B001EVWAIY,"The comments in this product review are completely uni-lateral and subjective in the extreme. While racism of any stripe can never to be condoned, it is a fact of life that the ""dehumanization"" and ""demonization"" of the ""enemy"" -- (i.e., Taliban, Mujahadeen, Iraqi Army, Iranian Regime, Viet Cong, Nazis, etc.) is part of all warfare waged by the U.S. and their allies. You should first consider the source and use your own historical perspective. Save the ""sermonizing"" and ""politically correct"" speechifying for those people who really are so weak-willed or numb-skulled to buy this DVD for purposes of reification and reiteration. In deference to those who suffered mightily at the hands of the less than compassionate Imperial Military Forces of Japan, give me a break! Save the ""marking"" and ""tagging"" for ""Birth of a Nation"", ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"", or ""Gone with the Wind"".",1266019200,5,877,5.13986013986014
