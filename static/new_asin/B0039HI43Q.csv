If you can't stand wasting your time learning absolutely nothing, especially how to edit the photos you've taken like a professional, then do NOT purchase this!  I edit photos with many types of software, but recently was interested in Elements and wanted to start learning on an old version I already owned.  The teach has the most boring voice, swallows loudly, talks slowly, and doesn't show you what you REALLY want to learn.  Yes we know Photoshop allows layers, not lets use them in editing all parts of a photo.  Lets remove a small shadow off one side of someone's face.  Let's brighten their eyes, remove something from the background sky . . . . NONE of these things will be found in watching the video.  Ugh - waste of money.",1377820800,,904,4.5030674846625764
8392064,5,B0039HI43Q,"I loved this tutorial! I never have enough time to really sit down and learn something, plus I am a visual person and this was exactly what I needed! You got me up to speed in virtually no time at all! Thank you so much! I would definitely advise someone to use this if they are new to PhotoShop Elements!",1299283200,,305,4.1
8392065,2,B0039HI43Q,"I am learning Digital Photography and chose Photoshop Elements 8 as my starting point to learn about digital dark room techniques. I had read a couple of good books by Scott Kelby and Matt. However, I am a kind of a visual person and would prefer learning difficult concepts like layers and filters by watching instructional videos. I purchased this DVD with the hope of doing this. However, I succeeded in < 10% of my aspiration to this end! The DVD is very very basic and barely scratches the surface of Photo shop elements 8. Also the techniques used are quite elementary. The selections made during the teaching are gross and lack finesse and I was looking towards some work which would make me say WOW and follow the authors' techniques. However, I find that the techniques displayed are very childish. Retouching and restoring is the worst chapter and has absolutely no technical details of different techniques available in Elements for restoring old photos. Scott Kelby's books are wonderful as they detail the techniques and especially point out what the PROS use. However, for people who prefer visual instructions instead of printed books, this DVD was one where I had placed high hopes...but I am utterly disappointed. I would not recommend this to anyone who is serious of learning Elements 8...please look for a good book by Scott Kelby and you will find yourself learning much more. This DVD is waste of time and money.",1287878400,2,1434,4.857142857142857
8392066,4,B0039HI43Q,It is worth your money to purchase this video.  It help you understand the basic of this software.,1283126400,2,98,4.444444444444445
8392067,5,B0039HI43Q,"Photoshop Elements 8 is the top program of its kind.
Now there is a dvd with instruction on actually getting the most out
of this great program. Books are fine for learning if that is all you have, but
having a really good dvd like this one makes a huge difference to me. It is so
great to watch this on my computer and work at doing the things I am witnessing.
I'm right there in class looking over the shoulder at my instructor's screen. Wow,
it couldn't be clearer. I watch and learn step by step.  Learn Photoshop Elements 8 covers many more topics than I need, but even those I'm not using are interesting, and who knows, maybe someday... Being a photographer, I use to be into films, all kinds. Now with those older prints and slides transferred to computer, it is amazing what can be done. Use to buy infrared film for special effects. Now any picture in my collection can be duplicated as infrared with touch of button. Really glad to learn about that and so many other techniques that bring old faded colors and memories back to life. I recommend this learning dvd. Love it.",1269129600,,1083,4.415
