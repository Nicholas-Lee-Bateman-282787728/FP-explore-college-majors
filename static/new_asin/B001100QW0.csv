8239685,5,B001100QW0,Very interesting body work for those who want to invest in their physical training. Even what seems easy implies important muscle coordination with repercussions on the quality of body movement. All very clear and well explained.,1510617600,3,229,5.388888888888889
8239686,4,B001100QW0,"I have initially thought I would likely not use this video as I am not not a dancer or have to prepare to dance.  I had ordered before receiving the feedback from the seller that perhaps I should go with the video for everyone including seniors!  I guess if you go by age then I am in the senior range but probably never would have ordered that one because that description sounds like it is for one who is barely able?  I love Pilates and barre workouts so I was intrigued with the idea of a good stretching routine.  This workout is interesting because I think I get it!  You do have to prepare well In order to follow but I have rigged my workout space so that the workout is easier to follow.  I actually have a cheap door mirror, set up along side me on the floor that reflects the TV so that when I have to work the side that is turned away from the TV , I can follow more easily.  I feel as if I am laying right along side the subject in the video.  I know nothing of the ballet terms but I just mimic the subject and it has worked out just fine!  I have gnd that I do like it and try and make time for it at least once a week.  You do get the feeling you are correcting your body alignment for even everyday life, not just dance.  I do wish there was a workout for everyday people that is short, like 10/15 minutes that might help you go on then to do yoga or pilates?  I am still not even sure how long this video is, I think I have looked a few times at the cover and not come up with the answer but I know it does seem quite lengthy.  I don't find fault with it's rawness because there is a certain charm to that.  You do feel as if you are getting a personal lesson from the Master herself!  So all in all I am happy to have it!  I am sure it is not for everyone.",1420588800,10,1775,3.8753462603878117
