7979587,5,B000087EYP,I love this series and it took me forever just to find the DVDs. I'm glad I have them now. The anime really caught my attention the first time I watched it. I can't think of anything bad to say about it except that they need more episodes.,1232841600,,239,4.0
7979588,5,B000087EYP,"Hidden away in the Ministry of Hades are the Guardians of Death.  Their task is to protect spirits on their way to the afterworld and to do in a few demons along the way. Tsuzuki is the star agent although his demeanor is a bit offhand for the seriousness of his task.  This bothers his new partner Hisoka more than anyone else, and the intent of this set of episodes is to dispel some of Tzuzuki's apparent self-centeredness.

A violinist's deal with a demon results in his death and the looming death of his daughter, but an unexpected cornea transplant shifts the contract to Hijiri, a young violin student who was facing blindness.  Tsuzuki and Hisoka come to the rescue, but Sagatanas is no ordinary demon, and Tzuzuki nearly becomes a victim instead of a hero.

The action is pretty furious, and there's some slick magic to add to the fun.  In addition to the story's action, the relationships of the characters are well developed and provide a strong secondary theme.  This is a complex story, one that takes all three episodes to develop.

As I mentioned in my review of the first DVD, this is an unabashedly bishonen series.  I'm assuming that, if you are reading this review you have already seen the first volume and are past any initial reaction, but the intensity level is higher is this story arc than before.  Which means that this series may hit your discomfort zone if you are a high testosterone viewer.  But it is a superb example of the genre, well drawn and choreographed and, for all their effeminate veneer, the characters are genuinely interesting, as well as attractive.  If you are looking for a bishonen series to start with this is a good beginning.",1139184000,2,1677,4.647457627118644
7979589,5,B000087EYP,"This is my absolute favorite DVD of what I've seen of the series so far (which is up to DVD 3). I love the song ""Devil's Trill"" and coming from a musical family have heard the ledgends surrounding it. I was quite pleased to find my favorite series adapted it to fit it into the story line. ^^
Descendant of Darkness (Yami no Matsuei) is an amazing series and I commend the vocal director of the English version for selecting such a talented cast. ^^ However- If you're a die hard fan, I suggest watching the subbed version, as the Japanese vocal work is considerably more enjoyable than that of the English version. This is just my humble opinion, but it seems to be shared by many fans I've talked to.
As mentioned in the editorial review, homosexuality is implied. Whether it is limited to the twisted 40 year old rapist/murderer Muraki, depends on the viewer's interpretation. To shounen-ai fans, it seems quite obvious there is an underlying ""something"" between Hisoka and Tsuzuki. But this could be just as readily taken as a strong, platonic partnership between the two. So if you're looking for frequent make-out scenes between two guys, might I suggest a little series called ""Gravitation?"" ^^ But if you're just uncomfortable with homosexuality and worried it might ruin the show for you, it won't. There are so many layers to the series, the few bouts of defined homosexuality can be overlooked. The complexity of this amazing series should not go unnoticed because of an occasional flashback of the Muraki-rape scene (which when shown, isn't graphic at all, just silhouettes of a larger figure pinning the smaller one to the ground).

7979590,4,B000087EYP,"Formerly known as 'Yami No Matsui', 'Descendants of Darkness' has been translated, much to the joy of American viewers - like me.  :)  This particular story deals with a violinist who involuntarily finds himself in a pact with the devil, and the hot dead guys (known as guardians of death) who are out to fix the situation.  This arc is especially coherent, which is a plus.  *Lots* of drama.  Plenty of blood.  Dan Green does a particularly good job as the voice actor for Tsusuke, our violet-eyed protagonist.",1065052800,,511,4.75
