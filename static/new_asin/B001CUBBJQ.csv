8290066,5,B001CUBBJQ,"Ancient Discoveries: Mega Machines is an excellent documentary which deals with antiquity's supermachines. The amount of effort and research put into this project is evident and as a result the documentary helps transport the viewer to another time allowing one to lay eyes on such structures as Athens' Parthenon and the Ptolemaic Pharos (Lighthouse) of Alexandria, as well as contraptions such as Archimedes' Claw and the medieval Trebuchet, among several others to mention a few. Very well written and very well presented, this documentary is guaranteed to provide the viewer with significant knowledge regarding the mysteries of building and construction in antiquity.
Ancient Discoveries: Mega Machines is strongly recommended to all those with a soft spot for Ancient Egypt, Ancient Greece, and Ancient Rome.",1248998400,,814,5.57258064516129
