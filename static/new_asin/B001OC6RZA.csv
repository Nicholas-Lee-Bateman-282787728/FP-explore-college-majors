I'm okay with the producers trying out a heavier subject matter such as murder, but the story is really not that good. Unlike other Wallace and Gromit stories which contain much more humor, I barely got any laughs out of this one.  Story's too short, not funny enough, and predictable. A total rip-off at $24.99 for a 30 minute DVD.",1434844800,,498,4.584269662921348

3729643,5,B001OC6RZA,"Nick Park and gang do it again.  I love Wallace and Grommet.  The subtle British humor married to clay-mation in the hands of expert animators cannot be beat.  Here we have another marvelous mix of crime drama, comedy and action-adventure as Wallace finds himself smitten with a pinup has-been who is out for more than just a good time with a beau.

As usual, it is up to Grommet to show his human better half that not all is tea, cheese, cakes and crumpets, and that malefactors are at work to satiate hostile desires.

Truly another fantastic whimsical romp of two beloved character out to face another challenge as they take on the baking trade to open new frontiers to make their fortune.  No cyber dogs here, and Wallace's luck with women remains constant as he strikes out yet again, but for his own good this time, or so it seems.

See this really great piece of animation with friends and family, or just enjoy it yourself.

3729647,3,B001OC6RZA,"Don't get me wrong, the movie itself is worth four stars easily, five if you are old enough and British enough to get the in-jokes in this story of Wallace and Grommit turned bakers (which I am).

But I'm knocking off two stars because of the brainless packaging which forces you to sit through a seemingly endless progression of adverts for other shows offered by the same DVD foundry. All you can do is fast forward, and not every segment lets you do *that*. See how you feel after five minutes of fighting the sodding DVD just to get to see what you actually paid for.

And if I never see that ""Mad Cow"" claymation thing again it will be several billion years too soon. They stick it on every bloody ""Britcom"" DVD these days.",1409702400,4,728,4.385185185185185

3729658,1,B001OC6RZA,"An attempt to make a more ""grown up"" Wallace & Gromit comes off like ""Bevis and Butthead do Hitchcock"".

The gags seem like what might come out of a junior high lunch table discussion.  ""It's a house, and it has a windmill.  and there's a bomb.  it gets stuck in his pants.  and you can see his butt!""  Maybe funny stuff if you were there in the moment, but it is lacking all the grace and subtlety of earlier epics.  Wallace's inventions are absent - there's some big machines in the bakery, but they are just big whirly things built of bits we've seen before.  The plotline of Gromit's love interest seems thoroughly confused - enough so that I wonder if the wrong things ended up on the cutting room floor.

Normally when I tire of a DVD I give it to a local charity to resell.  This one's going into the recycling bin.",1384992000,3,822,4.279220779220779
3729659,5,B001OC6RZA,I have to admit to being a huge Wallace and Grommit fan. The sense of integrity and attention to detail make their films a step above the usual digital animation format most other pics of this nature are done in. This is done through stop motion and its just a lot of fun. The characters are so endearing. I would highly recommend this for Any Wallace and Grommit fan and if you've never seen this comedy team buy this film. It'll leave you wanting more.,1384646400,,454,4.352941176470588
3729660,5,B001OC6RZA,"Wallace and Gromit are one of my FAVORITE.  Wallace falls in Love and so does Gromit and they call it puppy love.

I have watched it over 50 times and I may watch it again tonight.  I quiet evening at home a nice dinner and Wallace and Gromit.

3729664,5,B001OC6RZA,"I don't understand the reviews that say ""A Matter of Loaf or Death"" lacks the creativity, ingenuity and fun of previous Wallace & Gromit animations. Personally, I was dazzled from beginning to end by this 30-minute film, in which Gromit must save Wallace from the sinister intentions of the murderous Piella Bakewell. The film's visual inventiveness had me chuckling throughout and belly-laughing much of the time.

I have to admit that, even more than usual, I wanted to brain Wallace for being so blind to the intelligence and loyalty of Gromit, who is smarter than Wallace by at least a multiple of ten. And I also must concede that the plot developments in ""A Matter or Loaf or Death"" are considerably more dire than in any previous W&G outing, so that it can't be recommended for children under the age of seven or eight. But there's no real gore in the film, and I think families with older children will be enthralled by it.

Among the extras on this disc is a cartoon featuring Shaun the Sheep, an Aardman character with which I was previously unfamiliar. The short--which features Shaun and the rest of the flock playing soccer with a stray head of cabbage--is utterly wonderful, and utterly appropriate for children of all ages. I definitely plan to check out more Shaun the Sheep animations!",1379635200,,1302,4.782222222222222

3729671,5,B001OC6RZA,"I have been a Wallace and Gromit fan since the 90's with a ""Grand Day Out"", ""The Wrong Trousers"" and ""A Close Shave"".  Not only is the animation visually remarkable, but the story lines are clever and hilarious.  ""A Matter of Loaf and Death"" follows in the same tradition.  Although not a winner, this too was an Oscar nominee in 2009.  You can watch these many times and pick up something new each time.  Not only pay attention to the dialog, but you also fine many interesting things visually in the b ackground, that may reference past Wallace and Gromits.

3729673,5,B001OC6RZA,"This is just a short film, not feature length.

If you like Wallace and Gromit, you're always frustrated that there's so little of them.  It takes a lot of effort to do this type of clay stop-motion animation, especially with the huge amount of loving detail the creators put into each scene.  That means that the output is limited and a fan is always left wanting more.

This is the latest W&G short film, and worth owning.  It has the same basic themes as other W&G films:  Wallace is foolish; underappreciated Gromit must defeat the villain and save the day;  there are lots of ingenious mechanical devices.

If you've seen any of the other W&G films:  The Wrong Trousers, The Curse of the Wererabbit, etc., and were left wanting more, this will live up to your expectations.  If you haven't, this is as good a choice as any to get to know them.",1358985600,,848,4.483660130718954

I didn't check the rating before I purchased, nor did I really look closely at the story line. Obviously not suitable for 3-yr olds! But we still love all the puns, as we loved previous W&G films. Three stars only to reflect the fact that this is the first time I've seen W&G deviate from being super-children-friendly stories. I would probably rate it a 4-and-a-half otherwise, only because I thought the story was too short!",1356566400,,555,4.673469387755102

3729677,2,B001OC6RZA,"I've seen and enjoyed all the Wallace & Gromit films UNTIL NOW.

""Loaf or Death"" was a severe departure from the charm of this series. Other than the fun gadgetry that is part of every story, there is nothing to save this film from the gratuitously dark, unfunny, and frankly terrible story. With all the work that goes into this art form, it's a wonder that they wasted their time on such awful writing.

refreshing to see something funny with just a look or eye roll. I enjoyed watching the earlier W&G back in the 90s when my son was 4.

3729692,5,B001OC6RZA,"I fell in love with Wallace and Gromit after watching an in-flight movie of them.  I have all of the Wallace and Gromit dvd's.  Just a delightful, entertaining movie.  My only complaint is that ""A Matter of Loaf or Death""  is too short.",1288656000,,236,4.4186046511627906
3729693,5,B001OC6RZA,"I think what impressed me most about A Matter of Loaf and Death was the simple fact that it came out a mere three years after the largely successful Where-Rabbit film (which itself came out a full decade after the prior W&G film, A Close Shave).  I'm not sure if this has to do with the animation process being perfected or the infusion of Ardman resources from three successful DreamWorks collaborations, but it's great that gang has been able to follow up a solid effort with another solid effort so quickly.

Returning to its typical 30-minute runtime, A Matter of Loaf and Death places Wallace and Gromit into but another new business venture.

From window washers, to rabbit control, this time 62 West Wallaby Street converted into bakery-mode complete with ovens, robotic kneading arms, and contraptions that can only be described as ""Wallace-esque"".  Calling their new venture ""Top Bun,"" profits are raising right along with the bread dough up until the moment Wallace falls head over buns in love with a seductive bread-industry icon, Piella Bakewell.

Oblivious-er than usual, Wallace is high on life with the course of events but Gromit finds himself concerned by the news that 12 local bakers disappeared mysteriously and all of them seemed to have had connections with one miss Piella Bakewell.

The humor, once more, is spectacular.  If the low key comedic bits don't capture your attention the first time through, the scene that spoofs the famous pottery wheel/ Righteous Brothers bit from the movie Ghost certainly will!  I was also quite enamored with the segment that spoofs the pay-loader suit made famous in James Cameron's ALIENS.

I'm surprised to observe around the web the general consensus that this one happens far too quickly (or is too short as the complaints seem to balk).  Interestingly, save for the Where-Rabbit, all of Wallace and Gromit's films have been 30-minutes or under.  How quickly we get spoiled!

To counter such complaints, truly this team does their absolute best work when the proverbial clock is ticking.  The pacing here and the near-frantic exposition harkens back to the early-shorts, particularly reminiscent of the structure of A Close Shave.

I must confess to having inadvertently viewing this one out of order but as a result of the error, can state with absolute certainty that despite the general consensus, this one looks and feels a lot more like the original W&G shorts than it does the slightly out of place Where-Rabbit full length feature.

In all, some argue that A Matter of Loaf and Death is too short in runtime or not as clever as the earlier entries of the franchise but I completely disagree with these sentiments.  Having been afforded the luxury of viewing the entire Wallace and Gromit collection within the course of a week, I can state with absolute conviction that this one more closely resembles the original features than it does the more Hollywood-finessed Where-Rabbit that preceded it.  Highly recommended entertainment!",1287878400,,3001,5.03030303030303
3729694,3,B001OC6RZA,"The kids liked it well enough, but the adults were very disappointed in the lack of creativity and cleverness we've grown to expect. This had none of the visual puns or sneaky cultural references of Were Rabbit. Gromit saves the day, as usual, but not in any particularly clever way. **Spoiler alert*** the big finale is basically a fart joke. Really? From Wallace and Gromit? Nick Park, we expected so much more...

As other reviewers mentioned, it's also fairy short. Longer than the ""features"" (The Wrong Trousers, etc.) but not nearly as long as Were Rabbit.

Bottom line: a must if you're a fan, but it will probably collect some dust after the first viewing.",1282089600,3,664,4.765217391304348

While you are listed as the writer and director of ""Loaf and Death"", I seriously doubt that you had anything to do with it. In fact, I hope you had nothing to do with it. It would be a shame, if someone as talented as you are, were responsible for this abomination.

It was violent, Wallace and Gromit had both lost their personalities and lacked any of the traditional W & G charm that we all love. Both W & G were actually minor characters and that big, fat annoying woman was the main focus of the whole show. What on earth was this director thinking?

Please get control of your characters back from whichever talentless morons you sold them to and make us some more wonderful W & G adventures.

3729710,1,B001OC6RZA,"Wallace and Gromit: A Matter of Loaf and Death / B001OC6RZA

My family and I are long-time lovers of ""Wallace and Gromit"", but we just hated ""Loaf and Death"". Someone on the production team apparently felt that W&G needed a 'dark and edgy' upgrade to appeal to a wider demographic, so ""Loaf and Death"" was created with all the basic plot points of ""Close Shave"", but with the violence and insanity ramped up to 11, and with all the charm sucked out with nary a backward glance.

""Close Shave"" was fun and amusing because, despite the potentially dark subject matter of sheep being stolen in a nefarious plot to grind them into dog meat, (a) nobody ever got seriously hurt (including the villain, due to a timely Made of Steel revelation), and (b) the plot was so over-the-top amusing, with hilarious moments that burned indelibly into the memory: most memorably the ""organized"" motorcycle riding sheep.

""Loaf or Death"" has none of those amusing moments, despite a few throw-away jokes. The story is immediately darker than ""Close Shave"", as human bakers in the area have been murdered in a recent crime spree. The lady of the hour, Wallace's new love, is of course the culprit - and the movie makes no bones about the fact that she is incredibly insane (filling her bedroom with wooden clothes models, wearing the baker hats of her dead lovers) and that she is abusing her French poodle. Yes, you read that right - the ""Shaun the Sheep"" of this movie is a pretty girl poodle who is openly abused by her mistress - even being hit so hard with a shovel that she leaves a cartoon 'outline' in the shovel. Ha, ha, ha, I'm not laughing. In yet another ""funny"" moment, Wallace's insane fiance bites her own arm in order to incriminate Gromit - the scene is way more disturbing than it sounds.

Although ""Loaf and Death"" retains the iconic W&G look, the feel is that of a series that has been handed over to a brand new team of writers and developers. Even W&G have been flanderized - Wallace's signature neglect and misunderstanding of Gromit has blossomed into outright abuse of his position as 'master', such as when Wallace decides not to go out in the rain on an errand and 'cunningly' sends Gromit instead. This sort of character change really undermines the entire relationship between the two main characters - as Wallace becomes less of an innocent dupe in need of defending and just another human-who-won't-see-Gromit-as-an-equal, and therefore deserving of their fate.

I would not recommend this new featurette. I wish for myself that I had not seen it at all.

First of all, understand that me and my whole family (consisting of my husband and two preschool girls, aged 3 and 4) are HUGE fans of W & G--we have all the other shorts and the wonderful Were-Rabbit on DVD. However, after reading the other reviews, I was worried about the violence, lack of plot, etc. in this short film. It's really not so bad. The plot does seem a bit rushed, the characters not quite as fully developed as those in previous offerings and there's not quite as much wacky inventiveness in this one. However, the 'violence' complained about by other reviewers didn't bother my two girls at all (we agreed that the villainess shouldn't treat her dog that way, however). The animation as always is top-notch, and I did like the interplay between the villainess, Wallace and Gromit. I always love the way the Aardman guys throw in campy horror devices (like when lightning crashes the night Gromit discovers the lady's bedroom full of numbered dressforms) and there are other visual and verbal gags tossed in for fun too.

While not quite up to par (I'd rate all the other W & G films at least 6 stars here on Amazon) this little film is still fun, entertaining and a welcome return of our favorite residents of West Wallaby Street.",1263945600,2,1359,4.634854771784233

Fans will recognize the familiar Wallace & Gromit style in the main feature, which opens with the bludgeoning death of a baker in his own kitchen by an unknown assailant armed with a rolling pin. We next see our heroes in their latest business venture, a whacky-tech bakery on wheels.  While out on a delivery run, the two rescue a Miss Piella Bakewill and her pet poodle, who are trapped on a runaway bike.  The very agreeable Miss Bakewell moves in rapidly on the love-struck Wallace, while Gromit begins to smell a trap.  The plot manages to work in elements from half a dozen recent popular movies in filling out a funny story line.

While this new short film doesn't quite live up to the cozy, quirky atmosphere established by the previous three 30-minute outings, my main criticism with this release lies with the DVD presentation.

Despite being a widescreen movie, ""A Matter of Loaf and Death"" is cropped into full frame, meaning that a good chunk of the wonderful imagery on either side of the screen is cut off; in some instances, this process even obscures visual gags. While the framing issue may not be a great concern to casual viewers or young children, film and animation fans probably won't like missing the months of work that went into creating each shot.

The DVD comes with a welcome audio commentary track by director Nick Park and editor David McCormick as well as a fun episode of the ""Wallace & Gromit"" spin-off series ""Shaun the Sheep"".

And like anything, e.g., a music group, there are great albums and there are good albums (and there are bad ones, too).  ""A Matter of Loaf and Death"" is a good show...not a great show, not a bad show, but a good show.

Regardless of where you are coming from you have got to love all of Wallace's unecessary gadgetry and Gromit's eye rolling patience with his dim master, er, pet, er, who own's whom here anyway!?

I have to admit that the set-up for the story line starts with a jolt rather than a bang.  Wallace and Gromit are bakers!?  Where did that come from?  Of course Wallace and Gromit pull the bakery business off all right, but did I miss something or did Wallace's fascination with the TV ad bread girl appear from nowhere?

That aside, I really liked the former bread model and her particular motivation for action.  You really fear for Wallace as you would an old friend.  In fact I liked nearly everything about the show, though I thought that the poodle was designed with much less class as she deserved (and that Gromit deserved too :-D).

All in all this is a 4-star offering for me and other seasoned Wallace and Gromit fans, but my guess is that if this show were a person's first experience with this duo that they'd have a tougher time ""getting it"" and would tend toward a 3 star experience.  But if you already know Wallace and Gromit you will enjoy the show quite a bit.

This installment was conceived, planned, blocked and filmed for the widescreen 1.78:1 (16:9) format and it has been butchered into a 4:3 presentation by its cheap American distributor (Lionsgate), making this the official ""Dumb American"" version. The action and the characters are incomprehensible in this format. Too many things go on at once in too many complicated set pieces for the viewer to follow or even have a dim understanding of what he is supposed to be watching. The viewer is essentially missing half the action and a 100 % of the artistic intent. Worst of all, the crucial painstakingly-rendered facial interactions of the main characters with each other are simply missing, destroyed or nullified from not being shown in the same frame. The same massacre was perpetrated on every installment of ""Shaun the Sheep"" available on DVD for its weight in gold, on this side of the Atlantic, from the same unscrupulous distributor (complete with PAL-to-NTSC ghosting). The only way you can see the complete episode in North America, as well as ""The Wrong Trousers"" in its original 1.66:1 ratio and ""A Close Shave"" in its original 1.77:1 ratio - is to buy the whole collection on Blu-Ray. I don't own a Blu-Ray player but this may be the deciding factor for me to acquire one. This DVD also only comes in 2.0 Dolby whereas the film was intended for 5.1 Dolby. Need I say more?

To add insult to injury, the 20-min enhanced-for-widescreen ""Making Of"" documentary shows extended scenes of the wonderful 16:9 presentation of what the buyer has been missing.

For the wholesale and pointless desacration of several British animation masterpieces, heartless money-grubbing corporation Lionsgate should be prosecuted for crimes against humanity and our planet's artistic heritage.

UPDATE Oct. 8, 2009: This product is still being sold by Amazon.com after going out of stock, probably because of huge demand. There is no hope yet of it ever being replaced by a widescreen version or a version giving the viewer a choice between fullscreen and widescreen.

As for the commentators who find the subject too violent and are offended by an obese person lashing out at having lost her girlish figure: (1) grow up! and (2) why am I not surprised that Americans - of all people! -  would be offended by a children's story making fun of overweight people not being able to reconcile their unhealthy eating habits with their obsession with body image?",1254355200,16,2567,4.988317757009346
3729738,4,B001OC6RZA,"OK.  First to the people who complain about the full-frame aspect ratio:  Yes is it full frame (filmed in 16:9), but you know that by reading the packaging before you buy.  And the run time of 87 minutes on the package is misleading.  But these are not problems with the film.  Which, while seeming a bit more violent that previous W&G, more than holds its own against A Grand Day Out,  A Close Shave, and Curse of the Were-Rabbit, and only trails the masterpiece, The Wrong Trousers.  Everything you have come to love in a W&G is there:  Rube Goldberg machinery galore.  Witty word play for the grown-ups, pop culture references, and a dark side.  This time the boys nemesis is a serial killer instead of a sheepnapper (and would be murderer), hair triggered diamond thief, or demented hunter, so we are headed to a slightly darker place. For adults that is, but not for the little ones.  The darker aspects are implied, with the exception of an owner striking her dog, and my son found the blow less troubling than Gromit being kicked out of his room and abandoned in The Wrong Trousers.  There are some great gags, like Wallace using stale muffins as brake pads,  Gromit making an airport-ready metal detector, and Ghost and Aliens references, to name a few.  It just feels more like a W&G film that Were-Rabbit does to me:  No down time in the story, only two speaking parts, no cgi (at least not obvious to me),  and more Gromit!",1254268800,,1434,4.54296875
3729739,5,B001OC6RZA,"I can't believe all of the haters on this site.  This has the fastest action and slapstick comedy of any of the previous W&G features, including the movie.  I can't imagine anyone not liking this phenomenal show!",1254096000,2,212,4.702702702702703
3729740,4,B001OC6RZA,"I have to say I am shocked by the bad reviews on this Wallace & Gromit short. The only thing I would criticize is that they altered it to fit to a standard screen instead of the wide screen. But I knew going into it that it was another 30 minute short like Wrong Trousers or Close Shave.

As an adult who loves stop-motion animation and Wallace & Gromit, I was not let down. I enjoyed the story. The animation was fantastic. And it was full of the usual style of W&G gags (wonderful contraptions, something highly amusing that Gromit is reading, silly puns/double-entendres). I enjoyed the dark storyline. Sure, it may be a bit much for small children... but who says all animation is intended for small children?

By the way, the reviews on the UK Amazon website for this DVD are excellent.",1254009600,2,791,4.486111111111111
3729741,2,B001OC6RZA,"I am soo disappointed right now. I waited so long for this video to be released here in the US. I am a big W&G fan. But feel duped. The package says running time 87 minutes. But it is only 30!! The 30 minute video itself is funny but not nearly as good as Were Rabbit or any of the previous episodes. Plus, it is a bit more scary for kids! Ugh...hopefully after we wait another 3 years it will not be as disappointing.",1254009600,10,418,3.988095238095238
3729742,4,B001OC6RZA,"I never thought I'd say this about a Wallace & Gromit feature as I am a big fan, but overall I would have to give this DVD a thumbs down.  Where to begin?  First, the film comes across as very crammed & rushed in terms of it's overall pace to painfully squeeze into it's 30 minute running time and it really shows.  Second, there is a scene of animal cruelty where the villian hits her little dog and you hear a very cringingly real yelp of pain that I felt to be very innappropriate for a film that's supposed to be open for children to watch.  Third, it's just lacking in the subtle english humor of the previous films which made me love the W&G movies in the first place.

Lastly the movie was made to be seen in anamorphic widescreen, but Lion's Gate has decided to deny American audiences of over 33% of the full picture and are only releasing the film in ""pan-&-scan"" full-screen, which is a real shame as the makers of W&G have made the best film yet in terms of technical expertise of their work with plasticine.

Good things about the film are two-fold, one is that physical motion and facial expressions of all characters have hit a new high by Aardman, and the other is of course simply to see Wallace & Gromit interacting together as they always do.  But overall for the aforementioned reasons and in comparison to the previous films, I can't in good conscience give this film an overall good review (and want the film as it was intended to be seen, in WIDESCREEN).",1254009600,10,1477,4.388278388278389
3729743,1,B001OC6RZA,I was expecting the feature-length film and got 30 minutes. What a huge disappointment. Amazon should refund our money or send us the real version. Shame on Amazon! I hope I can get a copy of the 4-disc FEATURE-LENGTH film someday.,1253923200,,231,4.658536585365853

It was awful.  It was too rushed, there was none of that subtle British humor and it was very dark in its storyline.  If you love Wallace & Grommit I do NOT recommend you purchase this movie.  If I could return it, I would.",1253923200,6,392,4.301369863013699
3729745,1,B001OC6RZA,"My kids love the Wallace & Gromit movies, all of them. So naturally, we bought this one based solely on the trailers. The movie is short but the animation is excellent like other W&G movies.

The problem is that this is a very dark, violent film when compared to other Aardman/Nick Park movies. Although no graphic scenes are shown obviously, the story indicates that actual murders happen, dogs are hit, and a person is eaten by a crocodile. Yes, of course it's not a horror movie, but those expecting a typical child-friendly movie should reconsider.

Why did the producers go so dark with this one? My 5 year-old kept saying, ""That was the meanest film I've seen!"" A letdown. Hopefully future W&G movies will not go this route.",1253750400,20,730,4.6953125
3729746,4,B001OC6RZA,"I have all of the Wallace and Grommit shorts, crackling contraptions, and movie, so I can say from experience that there is no such thing as a bad Wallace and Gromit feature.  A Matter of Loaf or Death keeps the good streak intact, and is fine entertainment, albeit perhaps not as quite as good as A Close Shave or The Curse of the Wererabbit, in my opinion.  But I've been anxiously awaiting release of A Matter of Loaf or Death here in the States, and it finally arrived today.

Although the package states that the running time is 87 minutes, the actual feature is only about 30 minutes.  Also included is a ""making of"" segment, and a ""Shaun the Sheep"" episode, so counting all three of these probably is how the 87 minutes were derived.

So, I popped the DVD into the player, gathered the wife and kiddies around (the kids are only two and four years old, but they love Wallace and Gromit), and we watched the feature.  It was funny, and the animation was great, as usual.  However, it was more violent than previous entries, and I felt a bit uncomfortable at some of the scenes as my two and four year old watched them, particularly with regards to how Gromit and another dog are mistreated.  The kids didn't have any problems or get scared, but you may want to watch the feature first before showing it to your young children.  Its mostly cartoonish violence, but the other dog's owner, Miss Piella Bakewell, is a bit mean.

But I'm pleased with my purchase, and strongly recommend A Matter of Loaf and Death.  This is probably not the best DVD to get if you've never seen Wallace and Gromit before ... you should start with the original 3 shorts ... but its a ""must have"" if you're a Wallace and Gromit afficionado like myself.",1253664000,53,1734,4.473015873015873

3729748,1,B001OC6RZA,"I admit to not having done my homework on this, but still...  You have to be able to make an impulse purchase every once in a while without getting ripped off.

I was out shopping for a pack of batteries when I saw a new Wallace and Gromit DVD on the shelf.  Didn't know Nick Park had done anything since The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, so I quickly investigated.  The front of the package said ""All New Animated Feature"" and the running time said 87 minutes.  Now ""feature"" to me means a full-length presentation (as in ""our feature presentation"")...  a short might be called a featurette.  So I assumed this was more than just a 30-minute short (which is what it actually is).  They must have totalled all of the supplemental clips on the disc to get that ""87 minute"" total time.  Nice.

Also, since I couldn't find a widescreen copy anywhere in the stacks, I guessed that this had been animated full screen.  Wrong.  Lion's Gate apparently decided to release only a butchered pan-and-scan version of the short.  I didn't know anyone still did that these days.  How ignorant.

While I'm sure this short is fun, it went back to the store unopened.  I'll wait for a better version to show up someday.",1253577600,125,1198,4.52803738317757
3729749,2,B001OC6RZA,"Just getting a new Wallace & Gromit short is good news, but ""A Matter of Loaf and Death"" feels a whole lot like a remake of ""A Close Shave."" It's still rather entertaining, but it feels rather derivative. It also seems to use a lot more pop-culture gags than the older films did, though admittedly they're old enough that they have become permanent fixtures on the pop-culture landscape and only one isn't funny if you don't know the reference.

I would NOT get this single-disc release, though, because it is a cropped full-frame (1.33:1) when the movie itself was animated in widescreen. The documentary on the making of the movie is in anamorphic widescreen, and often reveals how cramped some of the cropped shots are. It seems that the 4-disc DVD complete collection is in full-frame as well.

The Blu-ray remasters the original shorts as well, and they look spectacular.",1253577600,117,1208,5.601092896174864
3729750,3,B001OC6RZA,"Unlike some of the other reviewers, I've actually seen this. It was broadcast in the UK many months ago.

While the animation is brilliant as always, the script is not quite as stellar as The Wrong Trousers (it's similar to A Close Shave in terms of the characters and plot), and overall it seems much more scary and violent than Nick Park's previous offerings, including the feature-length Curse of the Were-Rabbit.

I know these are generally released as UNRATED here in the USA but my suggestion to parents would be to give it a go yourself before getting the family in front of the screen. It's especially harsh with regard to treatment of pets.

Having said that, it has some funny moments; I particularly enjoyed the Ghost homage.",1253404800,7,736,4.734375

I have all their films on dvd and vhs, plus creature comforts, plus the chicken run/flushed away/curse of the were rabbit dvd set, the world of invention dvd, plus pirates, band of misfits. I love aardman animation films and I love Wallace and Gromit.  I was very excited to see this movie since it was the only short I hadn't seen and was a bit nervous because I had read some bad reviews on here, about Peter Sallis's squawking screams, about it being too violent. Here's what I think and I may be a bit biased because I love Wallace and Gromit so much: I really enjoyed Loaf and Death. Loaf and Death is about Wallace falling in love. Again. Oh, Wallace, have you learned nothing from a close shave and were-rabbit? This time, he falls in love with a woman who used to be the bake-o-lite girl, who had now gained a ton of weight from eating baked goods and is furious with bakers (similar to people who get angry with McDonald's because their food made them fat) and the bad news? Wallace and Gromit are not running a bakery delivery service. I think the film stirs (no pun intended) up lots of fun, humor, and suspense. Gromit, as always, sees the bad in this whole thing, but will he be able to save his friend? Yes, it is a bit violent, but I think people seem to forget Feathers pulled a gun on Wallace in the wrong trousers. I don't think the violence is that bad, and I think this is like watching an old movie. Wallace and Gromit still shine in this and I prefer this to world of invention. Too much live action and not enough Wallace and Gromit. I guess I thought they would be going around, interviewing inventors and it would be all Claymation. Spoiler: it wasn't. I think Loaf and Death is a great addition to the series and while a little violent, the message that good triumphs over evil (even if it takes 30 minutes to get there) is very clear",1478044800,,1927,4.337950138504155
