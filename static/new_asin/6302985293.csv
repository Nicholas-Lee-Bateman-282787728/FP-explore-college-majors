530795,5,6302985293,"BOYS NIGHT OUT is now available on DVD.  The film Pillow Talk has had more said about it and its social reflection of the 1960s then this gem from the same director.  However, next to Pillow Talk, I personally feel Boys Night Out is the better movie.  With Boys Night Out, we just have more fun.  This film is from the era when Playboy magazine and ""The Pill"" were becoming major influences on the so-called Sex Revolution in the US.  Boys Night Out is a sex comedy tied to this time and that quickly dates it but this is true of most comedy.  Boys Night Out's script writing sparkles with wit, the directing/editing is tight and the cast is superb.  The title song has lyrics written by the renowned Sammy Cahn and sung by cast member/pop singer Patti Page.  You can't go wrong with Kim Novak and James Garner plus the film's wonderful supporting cast that is made up from some of era's best actors and comedians.  So set your sexual mores back to 1962 and enjoy this light romp of lust and love.  Recommended!",1297296000,36,1011,4.416216216216216
530796,5,6302985293,"There were a lot of humorous surprises in this movie.  For starters, James Garner lives with his mother and is a nerdy weather buff!  Then there's Kim Novak, who takes to the role of a seductress with aplomb, only a minute after she arrives for what she thought was an apartment inspection.  The 1950s-style paternalism all the men dish out to Novak in spite of their lurid extramarital fantasies is downright charming.  I give this movie two thumbs up, and am sure you will too.",1163289600,16,479,4.6
530797,3,6302985293,"""Boys' Night Out"" is a good but not great comedy starring James Garner & Kim Novak (along with a strong supporting cast). The premise of the movie is a bit disturbing (if you don't find adultery funny, anyway), but the plot plays out like an episode of ""Three's Company"" with things not being as they seem.",1127692800,4,306,4.482142857142857

530923,5,6302985293,"Most reviews tag this film as a sex comedy when in reality it is more of a comic observation about the sexes.  The film debunks the wide held belief that men have a one track mind and want one thing from women.  Pause for a moment and think about the relationships between men and their mothers and you get the picture.  Sure men think they yearn to be like Hugh Hefner yet truth be told they desire nothing more than a home cooked meal or a listening partner than a roll in the hay. On the reverse coin women think they can view male-female relationships with cool detachment as represented by Kim Novak's post-grad sociology student.  That is, of course, if the male isn't represented by cool hunky nice guy James Garner.  The film has a funny astute script that makes cogent observations and the cast is uniformly excellent.  Ultimately the film comes down as a celebration of marriage and fidelity.  A great snapshot of male-female relationships circa 1962 that hold true to this day.",1435881600,6,988,4.611428571428571
530924,4,6302985293,I am a child of the 50s and 60s and this movie reminds me of that different time. This is a good comedy with a great cast. I think many will identify with one of them. I love Howard Morris. He is under appreciated. A great break from special effects and constant action.,1435276800,,270,4.113207547169812
530925,5,6302985293,I managed to catch this on TCM while surfing.  It's funny and fast paced.  Someone commented on IMDB that Pillow Talk received more attention in this time period but it was the lesser movie. I couldn't agree more.

531038,5,6302985293,"This film is a delightful look at the stereotypical married male who isn't satisfied with what he has at home and yearns to be a ""player.""  Of course, it is a period piece now and, even though by today's standards, quite tame considering the subject matter, it is still worth watching more than once.  I added it to my library because James Garner was an actor I always admired and from my home state of Oklahoma.  I also remember my mother owning a copy of a manual that was an eye-opener for a small girl.  It had something to do with the Kinsey Report.  Hollywood does make light of illicit behavior in this film but it was definitely worth a ""G"" rating.  Truly a great film!",1410220800,,678,4.341269841269841
531039,5,6302985293,"This is just a fun movie.  Sit back, relax, and don't worry about the language.  These were such good actors and could make you laugh without filthy language, but then that is what good acting is.",1409875200,,196,4.416666666666667
531040,5,6302985293,"I've loved this 'adult' comedy since I was a kid and am still a big fan of 60s comedies.  Back then you could watch movies only when they chose to air them, no VHS or DVD at that time.  I would look for it year after year on TCM afterward.  As soon as the DVD came out, I bought it immediately.  Fairly typical sex comedy starring Kim Novak and James Garner.  If you don't love them: you're crazy!  Yes, it's dated, but it's still good.  Add Tony Randall to the mix and you're off.  I really recommend this for nostalgic reasons, humor and silliness.",1409788800,,550,4.221153846153846

531042,3,6302985293,Cute little comedy filled with good cast.  Worth watching with fun situations as a divorced bachelor and his three bored married friends find that they can't make up their minds of what to do on their one Boy's Night Out night a week.  After checking out an adult magazine (one father found in his son's lunchbox) on the train to work one morning they come up with the crazy idea of getting a bachelor pad to share and a beautiful blond to put in it.  They decide to have fun with James Garner (the bachelor) by turning over the project to him.  Then the fun starts as he accidentally finds a beautiful modern upscale apartment for only $200 a month in New York.  (A brutal murder had recently been  done in it and they couldn't get anyone to rent it.)  Now you add the sexy Kim Novak as a post grad working on her dissertation on the Modern Married Man and his Adolescent Sexual Fantasies seeing her change to cash in on this and there you go - disaster on the hoof.,1408320000,,967,4.28021978021978

531045,4,6302985293,"While  ""Boys' Night Out"" is, in many ways,  standard romantic comedy fare from the late 50s to mid-60s,  a stellar cast and a script with some unexpected twists make it much better. In a strange way, it is almost as relevant today as it was when released.",1407715200,,255,4.382978723404255

It was a silly piece of fluff, all Kim Novak did was an impression of virgin Doris Day, just a kissing scene with Garner. No revolution of any kind in this movie. I love to watch old movies for the decor, cars, clothes even the snappy back and forth dialogue of characters. This had plenty of dcor and clothes but no snappy dialogue. Just a silly little movie to pass the time with.",1406160000,,512,4.34375

I read somewhere she either designed or put some of these outfits together--I have no documentation to this fact but I like to believe it--It's got everything you. well I, could want in a movie--great sets, great clothes, cute story and total 60's vibe--what's not to love?!

This early sixties film has all the qualities of that genre and its moral bearing. The story set in New York City and the bedroom community of Connecticut starts off slow but gains speed to a finale that brings all the cast to a focal point where a happy resolution takes place with many laughs.

So, if you want this DVD right now, Amazon's poor quality transfer DVD is the only game in town. If you don't mind waiting, you might want to write the studio (Warner) and have them release an official, truly digitally remastered DVD.

You can imagine the hilarity that ensues when the wives find out about the apartment and the blond! and Garner begins to hate his friends as they spend time with Novak, whom he's beginnig to fall for.

531158,4,6302985293,"This is a lesser known sex comedy from the 60's with Kim Novak and James Garner,  in good comic form,  ably supported by fine character actors in both major and minor roles; the script is pretty much from the same design mold of the Rock Hudson/Doris Day comedies. This is especially apparent with Tony Randall on hand playing an almost identical role to the ones he played in those comedies.  Lots of ""will they tumble into bed when they shouldn't?"" and ""how will the hero actually get the girl?""  questions are  posed, and settled without too much concern for realistic logic by the fadeout.  Sets and colors used are rich and very 60's in design,  and Novak's graduate  school character sports a wardrobe, even Novak might have had trouble affording,  but that is also typical of these films. Even today I would like to have an apartment that nice!  Park your critical thinking at the door and settle back for a fun ride though; it's a good cast and they deliver the laughs.",1303084800,9,977,4.595375722543353

7833537,2,6302985293,"Terrible aspect ratio! It's full-screen with all of the humans stretched into taller, thinner versions of themselves while the left and right of the screen are cut off entirely.

Other than that, it's the dated battle of the sexes film I expected and enjoyed. The cast was great, including the cameos like Bendix.",1504483200,,313,4.90566037735849
7833538,5,6302985293,"Fred, Doug, George, and Howie (James Garner, Howard Duff, Tony Randall, and Howard Morris) Share the commuter train daily to and from work. On Wednesdays they spend the night at Slattery's bar, away from home and family, until the 11:35 commuter train. Fred's boss spends Wednesday nights out in his ""home away from home.""

One day Howie confiscates a copy of Playmate magazine from his son's lunch box. This gives the commuters an idea.

Kim Novak (Cathy) is a sociologist who finds a perfect setup for applied research. Now before you cover your kid's eyes, it is not that type of movie. In fact, every time a juicy story starts, some train comes by and all we get is the punch line. It must be an educational movie as the husbands tell their wives that they signed up for classes at ""The new School for Social Research."" I looked it up and the school is real. One class is ""creative accounting""

Be sure to look at the cast list. It is fun to try to remember other movies that they were in.",1500940800,,993,4.445054945054945
