1445270,5,B00005JLH0,We have loved this movie since its release.  We watch every time it's on tv.  I bought the DVD for my daughter to take with her to college.  We love Michelle Rodriguez.,1503360000,,168,4.1875

1445272,5,B00005JLH0,"North Shore is the most classic surf movie ever.  I grew up watching this film and get a good laugh every time I watch it.  Probably some of the best cheese ball lines that every surfer uses when joking around with their buddies.

""That was a hot wave.  That wasn't a wave but a ripple.""
""If the wave breaks here, don't be here, or you will get drilled""",1501718400,,353,4.147058823529412

1445274,4,B00005JLH0,"I can't help it, I like this movie. Normally I review horror films, but that's not all I watch. This one is just good fun, and a look into the surfing world, that many of us, like myself have never been around. It's your typical young 20's ""making it through tough times"" kind of movie, but it is very well done. Rating wise, there is some strong language, partying, a sex scene(no nudity), and some suggestive adult language/behaviour. The acting in this is great by all actors, and lots of beautiful young women and men to see. The soundtrack to this fits the movie perfectly with some pretty cool covers of songs most of us know. All in all, a fun movie that might make you shed a tear, but will certainly make you smile.",1500854400,,724,4.37037037037037
1445275,5,B00005JLH0,"North Shore is an authentic and well made movie. I'm on the North Shore and this movie is just like this area. Great video and story line. No crap in it so most everyone can enjoy it. ""Noone listens to Turtle"".",1500595200,,210,4.146341463414634

1445277,5,B00005JLH0,"Good movie without a serious plot, but Bosworth does a bang up job. How they showed her doing the surf scenes when it wasn't really her is amazing. Good movie you don't have to think about too much.",1489795200,,198,4.2368421052631575

1445515,5,B00005JLH0,It's a Hollywood film that actually gives a pretty real inside look at the surf scene in Hawaii. Gorgeous aerial and underwater cinematography.,1436227200,,143,5.260869565217392
1445516,2,B00005JLH0,"I think this movie has a very predictable story line, like a lot of other surfing movies, a Caucasian surfer person, who is considered a local in Hawaii, and never misses a beat and every thing usually works out perfect for them, of course, not to forget that they can out surf everyone and never ever loses a wave or fall off their boards . . . ah, such a typical story line.  First of, just because you live in Hawaii, that does not make you a Hawaiian, so don't describe an obviously Caucasian Actress as the ""Hawaiian Anne Marie"", and she don't even look like she can really surf, they must have used doubles for her, perhaps that is why at the ""Big Pipe"" contest, she gets trapped under water when her leash gets caught on some rocks. You see her undo the velcro on her ankle and then abandon the board ( with the leash attached ). About 20 seconds later when she is diving below the oncoming waves you can clearly see the leash re-attached to her ankle, but what I find really amazing is I didn't know they had a Bonzai Pipeline Surf Competition for Girls, not back then, and although the directors tried to make her look good, she's not that good, there were other better female surfers out there.  This movie is not very credible at all.",1435708800,,1245,4.339055793991417
1445517,5,B00005JLH0,"I've always loved this movie but had it on VHS. The shipping was fast and the packaging was great (the box was a little too big, but no big deal).",1435363200,,146,3.9

1445570,5,B00005JLH0,"Both movies are great.  I am particularly biased towards North Shore because one of my life-long aspirations is to live in Hawaii for a few months.  The scenes are nicely done even though they did not have as many special effects as we do now.  Perhaps that is another thing that got my eye about these two movies.  If you love the sea, these two are good to spend a Sunday afternoon and plan your next vacation.",1425254400,,412,4.311688311688312

Although the plot is a bit cheesy (it is aimed at a younger audience), We find ourselves loving to watch it for its light heartedness and the sheer beauty of the ocean. No oscars here, just pure entertainment. If you want grittier fare starring Kate Bosworth, try The Warriors Way.",1424908800,,348,4.816666666666666

If you like surfing and/or movies about surfing, you'll probably like this one.
The acting is decent enough, although some times the subject matter can get gross (toilets, vomit and worse!).
But overall excellent for action and scenery (and a lot of bikini clad girls), with an all-right story line.

It's the ultimate empowered-chick flick with loads of fun surfing footage and good moral lessons about not being a wuss or giving up your dreams for some dumb guy (at least not if you want him to respect you in the morning). Hot bodies, great surf footage, great plot. Win-win-win all around.",1386028800,,413,4.376623376623376

and NORTH SHORE is a mellow mid-later 1980's flick for
 everybody. BOTH MOVIES ARE TIMELESS and if you love Hawaii
like I do you will love this 2 pack - and what a great price.
I bought 2  2 packs and leave one unopened just to have it
as backup for the other set in case I lose it.....
Keep an eye on Kala Alexander in the movie BLUE CRUSH, he brings
local flavor to the movie and is a legend on the North Shore.
In NORTH SHORE the legendary Gerry Lopez as Vince Mualoka is
priceless as is the rest of the cast including Nia Peebles,
the dude from Trapper John, M.D. and TURTLE........ BLUE CRUSH
has a great cast and dudes will love it too if they love chicks
and Hawaii and it shows Michelle Rodriguez in one of her earlier
roles and all the other girls are great too !!!.
YOU GOTTA OWN THESE and if you watch NORTH SHORE first then
BLUE CRUSH you will see how the 2 movies are a little bit alike
in their plot line towards the end.  YOU GOTTA HAVE THIS 2 PACK !",1377388800,6,1017,4.0

Quite a surprise was Michelle Rodriguez. This young lady is one of the most versatile actresses I have ever seen. She plays a good warrior, (I've yet to see her in a part as a young ingnue), and she certainly shows skill in driving and also with the jet ski. I'm convinced she did some of the surfing shown in the film herself, though Hollywood has its ways. I gave this film 5 stars and as a Blu-Ray it is quite breathtaking to see the North Shore surf. Its in good company with BC2 and the other good surfing films beginning with John Millius's (an accomplished surfer himself) ""Big Wednesday.""",1373414400,,758,4.421428571428572

1445862,3,B00005JLH0,"I bought this movie as a teenager.  Which explains everything.  Inexplicably it's remained in my movie collection until today, when I decided to watch it again.  I'm puzzled by myself as a teen, but can only guess I was drawn in by the ""strong girl story"", waves, and cute guys.  Of which this movie serves up quite a bit.

Anne Marie was a competitive surfer until an accident where she almost drowned.  Now, somewhat back on her feet, she wants to surf the Pipe Masters.  This could mean good things for Anne Marie, because a deal with a sponsor at these events could raise her standard of living.  She's been living with two friends and her younger sister, who she takes care of since her mom left.  But with the tournament coming up she gets fired from her job because of a partying football team.  But that same team may offer her some opportunities as well.

Characters:
Kate Bosworth: Anne Marie Chadwick
Matthew Davis: Matt Tollman
Michelle Rodriguez: Eden
Sanoe Lake: Lena
Mika Boorem: Penny Chadwick
Faizon Love: Leslie

None of the acting is incredible in this movie.  Even Rodriguez, who I normally like, lacks her normal shine.  She still plays a tough girl, and is very supportive to Anne Marie.  But she can do so much better, and has.  Bosworth as Anne Marie was a bit flighty.  I know her character is supposed to be flip flopping with emotion, but some of those flip flops just didn't make sense to me.  And the quickie romance with Davis' character, comes off as more of a fling than anything serious.  I also wasn't that impressed with the performances by Lake and Boorem either.  They seemed to be filler for the story.

The plot has a good idea.  Having a girl come back from an accident to try surfing with the pros again.  But then they have that romance thrown in and it kind of ruins it.  As much as I liked looking at Anne Marie's beau, the whole romance part could have been left out and it would have been a much better movie.  And considering I watched this as a teen, I'm surprised my mom let me since it shows an immediate sexual relationship.  I'm ok with that, people are going to do what they're going to do, but I know so many people who would be absolutely horrified their children were watching such a thing.  But anyways...

The filming is what makes this movie ok.  The waves are beautiful, the action shots stupendous, and while you can't say you feel like you're riding a wave, it's probably the next best thing.  They got some great film in this movie.  I never really thought of surfing as a spectator sport, especially with all the wipeouts, but watching this movie, I learned to appreciate a surfer that actually stayed on their board and the skill it took to do that.  The accompanying music was just the icing on the cake for it too.  Nice and upbeat and fun, it further kept this a teen movie.

As an adult I don't think I'm as enthralled with this movie as I once was.  But it did make me want to pick up a surfboard (ignoring the fact I've never done it before and live in Ohio).  I know that teens will probably love this movie at any time, and the rest of us can appreciate the tropical scenes and skilled athletic moves in the movie.

1445863,3,B00005JLH0,"I don't like this movie. I bought it for someone. I don't know why I bought it for someone. This is not a movie I'd normally watch. I don't know anything about surfing. The three girls on the box are kind of strange looking. Why is the girl on the right laughing? I don't find surfing funny.

As for the movie itself, this is the ultimate ""this is our third date and I agreed to watch this at your house, will you at least let me touch your bare stomach or back if we aren't going to make out"" movie. You pretend to watch this movie while your date is genuinely interested in its plot. I also refer to this movie as the ""I tried looking for a copy of Blue Velvet at Suncoast and found 30 used copies of this instead"" film. If you like water and smiling, you'll probably like this film. I really hope my fiance, an avid surfer, is not reading this right now. Oh crap she's leaving me",1362355200,,882,4.098265895953757

1445927,3,B00005JLH0,"I owned the DVD when it was released. And then traded it off when the Blu Ray came available. But the Blu Ray does not have the extras on the DVD. How many of us like the extras in movies? Raise your hands. So I ordered a new DVD just for the extras. This is a pretty good movie. It would have been better I think, without the obligatory bedroom scenes with Matt. And the Luau was a bit silly also. Unless you enjoy watching 400 pound nearly naked men shaking their booty. I don't. The search for oneself is the theme in this as Anna Marie tries to be Mother to Penny, and find her own dream of surf competition. It looks as if she did a lot of her own tricks in this. But I am probably just blind. What production company would endanger their star? The waves were HUGE. But I was raised on the Midaltlantic coast, so anything over three or four feet would look huge to me. In spite of the drawbacks I still like this movie a lot.

1445989,3,B00005JLH0,"The summer movie of the year arrives a few months late.  Blue Crush epitomized the very spirit of summer, with its surfer mentality and hanging out at the beach.  Blue Crush, however, goes against the grain of most surfer movies.  It tells the truth about surfing and that most surfers have to work hard to pursue their dreams.

The best part of Blue Crush, while giving an interesting view into the surfer culture, is the surfing scenes.  Much like Top Gun with its jet scenes, the actual surfing overwhelms anything the story has to offer.  They're wonderful and exhilating, and as you watch you suddenly realise why, as dangerous as surfing is, why people fall in love with it. The surfing shots at the film's climax are absolutely stunning, and you suddenly realise how much force the ocean has to offer.

The story of Blue Crush is Ann Maria is preparing for the Pipe Competition, which is the one competition that if you do well you can pretty much surf for a living.  Her two friends, Eden and Lena (a real surfer), support her and makes sure she stays focused on the competition.  The one struggle Ann Marie must overcome is she nearly drowned threes years before the movie starts out.  Her mother, who we never see, has left her to raise her sister because life got to intense, and Ann Maria struggles with this same flaw.  The Pipe Competition features some of the most intense waves surfers can tackle, and people die out there.  The three girls work in a hotel to make ends meet and struggle with getting Ann Maria's sister to school..

That is the movie in a nutshell.  Blue Crush's driving force is whether or not Ann Maria will give up her dreams.  The biggest stumbling block in the way is an NFL football quarterback who, with some of his buddies, are vacationing.  They begin a romance which makes Ann Marie lose focus on the competition.  It turns out the quarterback a player and has done this before on several vacations.  He then has a change of heart and supports her in the competition.  This is the weakest part of the movie.

Why he has a change of heart is never really explained and to this viewer the romance seemed little more than a tool instead of an actual love story between the two characters.  You never really connect with him as a person.  Instead, he feels like just the mandatory love interest instead of an actual character.

However, give credit where credit is do.  Blue Crush gets kudos for actually showing the surfing culture as having to struggle to continue surfing instead of the beach movies of the 1960s where no one knew what work was.

And the surfing shots.  Don't forget those.

I also like the fact that the girls don't live a life of glamor but instead are living a life of poverty; they live in a shack and must work as maids at a hotel to make ends meet while eating some of the leftovers. With dismal living conditions they don't complain much and remain upbeat as much as they can while pursuing their passion. Very entertaining!",1318032000,,536,4.316831683168317
1445991,3,B00005JLH0,"While my wife was at work, I came over to my parents house to go shopping with my mom cuz my dad was out golfing. After we came home and I made my turkey w/ wasabi sauce pita bread (Pita comes from the middle east, did you know that? Moracco has real good pita at Fcot Center, BTW), I flipped through my parents DirecTV package. My parents have all the mooovie channel and so I came across Win a Date With the Hunky Tad Hamilton on Showtime.
I started watching this movie in hopes of some T&A, but sadly you won't find much other than a slightly hot Kate Bosworth in a tank top. The premis of this movie is that Kate is the charming girl who works at a supermarket with the guy was in SpiderMan. No, not the guy that plays cards with A-Rod and rides Seabiscuit, but the guy who was black Spidie in one of the less entertaining sequals. I think his name is Tofu Grace, but I don't know.
So Kate who looks OK in this film, wins a date with Tad Hamilton. Tad is a moovie star with good looks (think Ben Affleck only not as attractive). Kate goes on this date with the guy that is not as hunky as Ben and real likes him. The wannabe Ben is a womanizer, (womanizer, boy you know are, womanizer womanizer, see we both in a different way -- ah I love Brit) at least i think he is a womanizer. I didn't watch this from the start becuase I was watching this special on Hitler on the Military Channel (I told you my parents have a lot of DTV channels!) Off topic but did you know that Hitler tested posision on his dog before he used it on himself and his wife Eva (Peron) Braun!
Tad prmosises to change in ways in hopes of smashing out the quasi-hot Kate. Tad does change his ways for the most part but fails to smash Kate though he comes close but his agent and so other dork thats in his entourage inturupt him at this run down motel which has a clerk that looks like the guy who played Bud Bundy on Married with Children.
Tad gets this part to play the star in some movie and wants Kate to go with him to LA or wherever they are filming this movie. Tofu Grace finally has the balls to tell Kate that he loves her and wouldn't mind smashing her but then Kate has already decided she'll go to LA with the Ben wannabe. Kate and da Ben guy fly to LA in his private jet. Kate starts PMSin' and realizes that she is stupid and loves Tofu Grace. This would never happen in real life becuase Ben is attractive and wealthier as F and Tofu is kina a prick and works as the owner of supermarket.",1312588800,,2478,4.069529652351738

1446057,4,B00005JLH0,"Released in 2002, ""Blue Crush"" tells the story of three young female surfers in Hawaii who support their lifestyle as maids at a high-class hotel. Anne Marie (Kate Bosworth) has dreams of going professional, but she has to get over her past failures and her family's breakup to succeed. In the meantime a vacationing NFL quarterback (Matthew Davis) romances her and she has to determine if their relationship is real or just a fling (for him, that is). Michelle Rodriguez and Sanoe Lake co-star as Anne Marie's surfing friends.

As you can see, ""Blue Crush"" is a 'sports film' in the manner of ""Karate Kid"" and a host of others. Although some of these movies go the comedy route -- e.g. ""Cloud 9"" and ""Bad News Bears"" -- ""Crush"" is a serious drama with fun flashes.

Filmed on the beaches/resorts of O`ahu, Hawaii, this is a beautiful and exhilarating film to watch, the perfect remedy if the weather in your area has been dreary.

There's no profanity, raunch or t&a exploitation but, to be expected, the film features some good-looking women in swimwear throughout its 104-minute runtime (dudes too, if you're a woman). By ""good-looking"" I mean realistically so, not like ""Baywatch"" which normally featured masses of ultra-hot babes swarming the beaches.

For the first hour the film was pretty much what I expected it to be, nothing great but moderately entertaining for this type of flick, and then something happened at the the 58-minute mark that struck a chord with me. Anne Marie hits the waves with her friend (Rodriquez) to prepare for the Pipeline Masters as we hear the song ""Youth of the Nation"" by P.O.D. This sequence touched me for some reason. The music & lyrics are emotionally potent and effectively set the tone for the remainder of the film.

""Youth of the Nation"" exemplifies the zeitgeist of the new millennium just as ""My Generation"" perfectly represents the mid-60s and ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" typifies the 90s (I was gonna say ""and just as 'Muskrat Love' typifies the 70s"" as a joke but decided not to, lol). Anyway, everyone's heard the song by now but if you're not sure go to youtube and listen to it with lyrics; it's an incredible piece, to say the least, and dig those heartrending lyrics! It's reality, my friend.

For me, the film's just compelling enough to give a marginal thumbs up. Fans of surfing and Bosworth (or any of the other actors) will appreciate ""Blue Crush"" more than me. But I was moved by the above musical interlude and one other thing...

What affected me most with the story is the picture of the three maids, impoverished and disdained by the snobs but full of youthful zeal and hope. It strangely reminded me of something I experienced on my last trip to Southern California. I was leaving the last showing of a theater late at night and spied the janitorial crew coming in to clean with their mops & buckets. They were Mexicans, mostly young, and possibly illegal aliens. Everyone walked by them as if they were invisible, like they were the scum of society or something. But I made a point to acknowledge them and smile. I don't feel I deserve a medal for this or anything; it's just that I made a decision long ago that, no matter how far I go in life, I'm not going to look down on or ignore those in a more modest position. Why? I don't know, maybe because I'M scum.

The film runs 104 minutes.

1446063,3,B00005JLH0,"2002's BLUE CRUSH stars the adorable Kate Bosworth as the young female pipe-charger Anne Marie Chadwick who is overcoming a past surf injury.

With the help of her two best friends Eden(Michelle Rodriquez) and Lena(Sanoe Lake) Anne Marie begins a training regime in-between watching over her younger sister Penny(Mika Boorem) and working as a hotel maid.

Of course all of these girls have attitude and a fiery spirit which leads them down an exciting path, which includes Matt Tollman(Matthew Davis) a professional football player vacationing in Hawaii with his team.

What happens when Anne Marie starts falling for Matt, will he get in the way of her goal to win Pipemaster?

Not to mention the soundtrack is fantastic,two of my favorite tracks being 'Destiny' by Zero 7, and 'If I Could Fall In Love' by Lenny Kravitz, they all convery the 'perfect summer in Hawaii' mood!

This film is better then expected and it's nice to see a movie with some girl power!",1220486400,,962,4.877300613496932
1446064,4,B00005JLH0,"The premise of the movie is simple enough: overcoming one's past difficulties and exorcising personal demons.  The method of empowerment is surfing.

To be quite honest, when I hear the name Kate Bosworth and the words ""riding pipe"" in the same sentence, I figure that the movie is a winner.

Anne Marie (Kate Bosworth), Eden (Michelle Rodriguez), and Leena (SOMEONE), are three roommates who love to surf.  They pay their way to live by working as housekeepers at a fancy resort hotel.  I've stayed at hotels all over the country, even Hawaii, and I've never seen a housekeeper that looks like Kate Bosworth, let alone three attractive twenty-somethings together.

Aside from that obvious ridiculousness, Anne Marie is a surfing prodigy who has lost her way.  A few years ago she had a bad wipeout, and she hasn't recovered psychologically.  She has to enter a big tournament where the waves are so strong they kill people, where she has to overcome fears to get her big break.  Along the way she finds a fling with an NFL QB in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl, and he gives the typical metaphorical speech that relates to surfing victory, and helps her overachieve.

For what is essentially a chick-flick, this movie is actually pretty good.  It doesn't hurt that there are a ton of bikini shots and great surfing action.  The drama, humor, and believability make it quite enjoyable, with something for everyone.",1203292800,,1406,4.836820083682008
1446065,5,B00005JLH0,"`Blue Crush' is a lot more than just a chick flick with half naked women.  It's actually got a lot of heart and a halfway decent storyline.  Of course the major draw to a film like this has to be the beautiful Hawaiian scenery, not to mention a few very nice tan lines, but like I mentioned, `Blue Crush' has a lot more to offer.  Director John Stockwell has proved before with `Crazy/Beautiful' that he has a delicate and mature touch when approaching the all too often generic teen movie.  He is able to infuse enough emotion and maturity into his films so that they come across new and fresh, inviting and, well, mature.  He does the same here with `Blue Crush', giving us a film that is far from chick flick feeling and one that young and old, male and female can appreciate.  It's funny when it needs to be funny, dramatic when it needs to be dramatic and soothing when it needs to be soothing.

The film tells the story of Anne, a young girl who dreams of becoming a professional surfer all the while taking care of her bratty kid sister Penny and working herself to the bone as a maid for one of the prestige hotels.  She lives with her two best friends Eden and Lena who enjoy her love of surfing and are determined to help her train for the Pipe Masters tournament where she'll surf the Bonzai Pipeline.  Anne has to face her own demons though, as a previous accident where she nearly drowned has crippled her in a way, mentally, making her incessant fear of drowning a major problem for her advancement.  Another problem surfaces in the form of hunky football player Matt who shows up and takes root in Anne's heart.

All the actors do a great job with the material.  Kate Bosworth is completely believable as Anne, and Mika Boorem is just as convincing as her sister Penny.  Both Michelle Rodgriguez and Sanoe Lake are effective as Anne's friends, but Michelle has the larger of the two parts and is the more outspoken one.  She plays Eden, the one who really wants to push Anne to succeed, and she does so with gusto.  Besides, at the time she was really the only recognizable name and so she's instantly separated from the crowd.  That's not to say she's the most entertaining of the bunch, just the most recognizable.  Matthew Davis may have been a recognizable face but he hadn't really had a break out role yet (Michelle had `The Fast and the Furious').  Consider this his breakout.  He does a great job as Matt, infusing enough charm to go with his rugged good looks to make you believe in Anne's apparent infatuation.

So from the beautiful ocean view to the compelling storyline and relatable, and likable, characters, `Blue Crush' succeeds on really all terms.  It's definitely a film that can stand up to multiple viewings and one that will be enjoyed each and every time.  So don't be turned off by the girly cover art or the fear of a simplistic and mind numbing prose, just pop in the DVD, sit back and enjoy the fact that not all chick flicks are avoidable, and some of them should be sought after.",1185926400,,3023,4.468123861566484

Only one problem, she almost drowned three years prior doing the same thing. Will she over come her fears and be able to go through with it. You will see, but the ending found a way out of the formulaic ridiculousness that I thought we were heading for.

The movie also has a subplot of Kate dating a quarterback in town for the pro-bowl (this character should have been named Tom Brady, because that is the person they are obviously trying to portray). Add to this that Kate must take care of her little sister after their mother ran off to the mainland with some guy, and you have a lot of pressure on our little Kate to come thru.

The movie was well acted for the kind of movie it was and made good use of locals for many parts instead of having movie stars hog all the screen time. The surfing scenes were something to behold.

I really liked the feeling I got from the film. I felt like I could be apart of their world.  It was just three young girls (4 counting the little sister) that were trying to live their lives.  I thought the shots of the ocean were beautiful.  This movie really makes me want to go there to see the beauty myself.

The film is about Anne Marie (Bosworth) and her struggle to succeed in the world as a surfer and a parental figure to her little sister Penny.  She is training for the Pipemasters, a huge surfing contest.  Her two best friends Lena (Lake) and Eden (Rodrigues) are her roomates and surfing buddies.  Lena is a free spirited, ""lets go surfing"" girl. Eden is a tough, encouraging friend.  They all work at a crappy job at a very nice hotel and resort. Penny is a young girl trying to grow up without a mom or dad... just an older sister and her two friends. While working in the hotel, Anne Marie notices Matt, an NFL quarterback, who she begins to date while trying to train for the competition.

1446147,3,B00005JLH0,"Blue Crush takes you to the Pipeline and throws a different break on the usual surfing yarn in that it focuses on a trio of girl surfers and the way they chase the waves.

Leading the bunch is Anne Marie (Kate Bosworth), a supremely talented surfer who has yet to get over almost drowning at the Pipeline some years earlier. Her friends are Eden (Michelle Rodriguez) and Lena (Sanoe Lake) who live and work with her and try to get her ready for the Women's Pipe Masters carnival at the dreaded beach.

However, just as Anne-Marie is stepping up her efforts she falls for Matt (Matthew Davis) a rich football player who is town on vacation with his teammates and her rigorous training routine flies out the window. Mind you, some of the movies most amusing moments come via his teammates - the room cleaning episode and then teaching them to surf.

Then it's time for the heroine to stand up and be counted where it matters most - on the waves - and what follows is some pretty spectacular surfing footage.

In fact, it is this exciting and at times stunning wave action that is the star of Blue Crush and you get up-close and personal with the power of the ocean.

Bosworth et al are very good as the surfers - in fact the whole cast is good - and while the plot is not an academy award winner, it has a believable and sensible ending.

1446151,2,B00005JLH0,"I hate to throw cold water (no pun intended) on a film that most reviewers seem to have enjoyed, but a thoughtful look at this movie reveals it's not really an awful lot to cheer about.
The story is old-hat cliche'; Young, aspiring girl overcomes fear based on an earlier accident and triumphs over obstacles. In the meantime, there is the obligatory romance with jock, fight with long-time girl-friend who is living vicariously through our heroine and much-expected and telegraphed final denouement.
The soundtrack is certainly nothing to write home about. Technically, it's not good. There are many places where the dialogue is all but unintelligible (turn on the captions). The selection of music is questionable, at best. This movie supposedly used surfing as its vehicle for getting its message across, yet the soundtrack is almost exclusively rap--great if you're a fan of Eminem, but where are the great old surf songs of the 60s?
The acting is passable, if predictable. We don't really care too much about these girls, with the possible exception of Penny, our heroine's young (12-13?), whiney, bratty sister who mouths off to her older sister and friends, smokes and displays her knowledge of sex at the drop of a hat. We never do find out what happens to her.
Anyway, the surfing footage is adequate, although I don't understand what the fuss is all about regarding the ""fabulous footage"". It's nice, but I've seen better camera shots on ABC's old ""Wide World of Sports"" when it used to cover the Pipeline championships. But the bonus extras on the DVD are nice.
Summarily, it's a nice movie to waste 90 minutes on, but don't expect it to live up to the hype of most of the reviewers here.",1088640000,5,1699,4.821917808219178

Despite the critic's ratings, the movie was good to watch.",1085702400,,457,4.404761904761905
1446154,4,B00005JLH0,"""Blue Crush"" is one of those flicks that you see at the DVD counter and you want to buy because it looks cool, but the happy-go-lucky smiles on the box make you think it's just another run-of-the-mill teenybopper flick.  That's what I thought, and, man, was I surprised.  ""Blue Crush"" introduces you to the wonderful world of ""girl surfers"" without being silly, smarmy or annoying.  In fact, it gives you a pretty good look into the hellish life of a young lady, her baby sister, and a couple of friends just trying to make ends meet.  They live in a rathole with a leaky roof and they're always strapped for cash.  Strapped, that is, until a handsome quarterback strolls into the main character's life.  All the while, she's trying to make it as a pro surfer.
The movie manages to give you some insight into the world of surfing without overwhelming you with information.  The love story does get a little cheesey about mid-way through the flick, but it's handled well overall.  The main character's love for her kid sister is evident throughout this flick, and you end up cheering for our young heroine based on her will to be the best.
This is an engaging and fun story about facing your fears and not giving up on your dreams.  It's good for most of the family, though there is a little language and one slightly intimate scene.  I'd say kids under 12 shoudn't watch this, but that's just me.

Anyway, this movie is  more than about surfing, maybe even surfing is just a backdrop to the story.  I really enjoyed the film because it didn't drag on, and the actresses were a delight to watch.  Bosworth, Rodriquez, and Lake really blended well and made their characters believable.  It is really about conquering your fears, believing in your friends and growing up fast. It is kinda sad that the movie portrayed most of the kids as marginally educated malingerers existing on this beautiful island waiting for the next perfect wave to hit. What else is there to do when you have paradise  as your backyard?  Well, this pretty much describes the three main characters but hey, this is Hawaii and this is about surfing.  And having met Hawaiin expatriates, this is pretty much how it is growing up in the islands.  That's why  this movie works because as much as we are waiting for the big finale when Annemarie rides that big pipe and lives happily ever after, it also shows a lot about trying your best to grow up in a less than ideal situation.  I also like the sub plot of the football player trying to romance the Bosworth character.  She wanted to believe that this is Prince Charming coming to take her away, even though it was obvious that she's just another pretty face that came with the place.  I wish the movie kept it this way. I thought it was a cop out that the movie ended with him turning into a  Prince instead of the reality that these guys are just frogs no matter how many times you kiss them.  It should have been good enough that Annemarie rode the big pipe and that's how she found her happy ending. Oh, well, I guess every movie has got to have its Hollywood ending.

I wouldn't call ""Blue Crush"" a ""Chick Flick"" because the characters in the film actually do things that have consequences and results, as opposed to a regular ""Chick Flick"" in which the characters don't really do much of anything.
In a regular ""Chick Flick"" the storyline is typically built around the leading female character, who more often than not, is having feelings that are difficult to deal with.  That's the story.
""Blue Crush"" is sort of a cross between ""Endless Summer"" and ""Don't tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead"".  While I wouldn't call it a not-to-be-missed screen epic, I'd have to say that it was worth seeing.  I'd rate it an A- for originality, anyway.",1076630400,2,898,4.737179487179487

1446206,2,B00005JLH0,"I admitt upfront that the visuals of this movie were great.  Hawii is a gorgeous location for any film, and the underwater camera work with surfers was astounding.  There was also an intriguing side plot with Annes younger sister going through a rocky adolescence that was dropped as soon as Anna's new boyfriend enters the picture.  Had the movie been about a woman raising her younger sister, paying the bills, and surfing, it would have been 100 times better.  But not even the good things can make up for the poor plot and outdated gender messages.
The plot is paper thin, and it could be excuseable as mindless fluff if this movie didn't revolve around the premise that Anna needs a man.  Annas friends who serve as her surrogate family are supportive, encouraging, and loving.  They try to get her to understand how awesome she is, but it isn't enough.  It is only though a boyfriend that she has known for a few days that she is able to screw up her courage and surf in the big competition.  Message: having a boyfriend makes you complete.  There are also some scenes in the begining where you see her ex-boyfriend verbally harass her and she totally plays right into it.  Later the same character shoves her around with no regaurd.  Message: it's ok for men to treat women like crap.  These girls are supposedly athletes but you see no muscles on any of them, just perfect sticks in bikinis.  Message: being thin is still the only way to succeed.  I'm personally appalled that Amazon calls this ""the kind of movie that girls and young women deserve to see more of"".  I think that girls and boys deserve movies where girls really accomplish things in realistic ways, not where they get all their self esteem from others, put up with abuse, and look like anorexics to win the day.
In the end, Anna surfs the big competition.  She doesn't win first prize, but a lucrative endorsement deal that will help her pay the rent.  Yippe.  It's a victory for all the emotinally dependent anorexic girls out there.",1070928000,5,2009,4.6112676056338024

That's not to say I give it a strong or even cautious recommendation. Hell, I'm not quite sure what to say, except that I found the cliched story mildly enjoyable and lead actress Kate Bosworth both quite pretty and talented.
Bosworth stars as Anne Marie, a hotel maid in Hawaii who lives with her two friends (Michelle Rodriguez and someone I don't recognize) and her younger sister, Penny (Mika Boorem). In their spare time, she and her friends surf, particularly as practice for the upcoming ""big"" competition that you know is going to pad out the lengthy conclusion. Anyway, complications arise when Anne Marie finds herself falling for a handsome pro football player (Matthew Davis) who's arrived for the pro bowl. Which will she place above all else, her newfound boyfriend or the big surfing competition?
As far as lightweight entertainment goes, Blue Crush delivers just enough that you won't feel you've completely wasted almost two hours of your life. This is thanks mostly in part to Bosworth's performance, she's sympathetic and likeable, showing hints of a promising career. Then there's Matthew Davis, who's shown he can deliver a good performance (Below, for instance) and is okay as the pro quarterback, but more importantly, he and Bosworth actually have some decent chemistry together.
Most people consider the movie's anchor to be the surfing sequences. Aside from a scene of horrible CGI, these setpieces are lovely to look at and shot quite well, but they are repetitive, and by the final competition, it just drags uncomfortably. Amidst the story are the typical cliches, including a scene in a bathroom stall that you just know right from the get-go how it's going to pan out.
Aside From Bosworth and Davis, the rest of the cast is serviceable at best. Michelle Rodriguez continues her ""angry chick"" acting and she's not very good at it, either. Mika Boorem is a talented young actress, but there's nothing here to stretch her acting chops. It's easy to see how Blue Crush became a minor box office hit. The ""girl power"" story draws in the scores of teenage girls and the tantalizing promise of girls in bikinis will have the guys salivating.
All this comes at the expense of the portrayal of the men in the story, who are almost exclusively seen as hot-headed, rash, and uncleanly. Only Davis shows some honorable qualities but even he is revealed to be a bit of a wild guy. Still, complain as I might, Blue Crush did entertain me for most of its running time, and I guess that counts for something. As Saturday night rental fare, this is a movie that should go down fairly easily.

The plot wasn't the part that ... well thrilled me (the plot was a little dull and lacked something as another reviewer said) but the entire ""fun-ness"" of it all. Just watching them surf wants you to learn, and then when you see those crash scenes (woa!) and it makes you have second thoughts about wanting to surf. Buy it if you think those fours time aren't enough.

I was neither disappointed, nor enthralled with this movie. What was most interesting were the surfing scenes and learning about a sport I knew nothing about. The overall storyline is okay, but it lacked something. There seemed to be some holes in the plot. We never really understand why Kate Bosworth's character's mother disappeared other than she found a new boyfriend. I know it happens often, but it just seemed far-fetched that her mom just up and left and nothing is really said about it.
If you're interested in surfing, watch this movie. If you're a guy who likes to look at women in bikinis, I'm sure you'll enjoy it. All others could probably find something else to watch that will interest them more.",1062460800,2,961,4.795180722891566

1446232,3,B00005JLH0,"I thought this film would have alot more surfing than it did. I mean, it did have surfing, of course. In fact, the entire plot was loosely centered around the sport, I just figured it would ONLY be about surfing. Thinking back, I realize that probably would have made for a pretty boring and repetitive two hours. I'm glad the film had a plot, I just wish it had been stronger and not quite so questionable.

This film was pretty good I suppose, but not something I would see again. The plot wasn't bad, but it seemed just a little strange to me. It seemed odd that Anne Marie (the main character, played by Kate Bosworth) was invited to compete in Pipeline when she didn't seem to be a very good surfer. I mean, she had been previously injured, and although she was physically healed, she wasn't yet emotionally restored. It seemed like everytime she caught a wave, she would become frightened and wipe out. I realize this is natural for even the most talented athletes in any sport, but Anne Marie was invited to compete in pipeline after this injury. Why would she be invited when she could barely even surf anymore? Actually, Anne Marie's best friends Eden and Lena (played by Michelle Rodriguez and Sanoe Lake, respectively) seemed to be better surfers than she was. So why was she competing when they weren't? Also, if getting a surfing sponsorship and winning Pipeline had been a dream of hers for so long, why would she let a guy she just met stand in her way? I guess it wasn't quite the female empowerment film they advertised it as being. The end was a bit too far-fetched for me as well, but, let's face it, that was to be expected.

Anyway, if you're looking for a real ""girl power"" movie, this definitely isn't it. Seriously, despite the fact that it's all obviously fake, even 'Charlie's Angels' (the first, of course) would be a better choice for that. If you're looking for something that's just plain surfing, you might want to check out some sort of surfing documentary. If you're bored and just want something to watch, that's when I would finally come around and recommend this film. Though I would advise you to rent it, not buy it. I can't imagine it's something one would feel the need to view a second time.

The movie kind of felt weird at times though like it was in fast foward,but that only happens at certain times of the film(not in the main parts).Also,sometimes it seemed like the were mumbling a little bit. But this movie does show you some surfing culture and it is more than just hot chicks in bikinis. There are some awesome surfing scenes,too. This isn't one of the greatest movies ever,but it is pretty good stuff. Overall I would give it a 3.5 out of 5.",1054771200,,565,4.66
1446234,2,B00005JLH0,"When you see the name of Oscar winning producer Brian Grazer (A BEAUTIFUL MIND, 8 MILE) in the credits, you could be forgiven for expecting something special. Sadly BLUE CRUSH (related to the earlier doco in name only) is about as formulaic as movies get and has everything a surfing fan could ever want. For guys who aren't into surfing, Kate Bosworth (REMEMBER THE TITANS) and Michelle Rodriquez (RESIDENT EVIL) are in bikinis for pretty much the whole movie. That's basically BLUE CRUSH's drawcard.
The shoestring plot surrounds Anne Marie (Bosworth) and her dream of winning the world's most dangerous surf competition, the PIPE MASTER. The only problem is the other competitors are all male chauvinist pigs (so that gives female viewers something to [ogle]) and so Anne Marie predictably (as is the case in so many movies coming out these days) sets out to prove them wrong and win the prize. Surfers will enjoy all the action, but anyone else will be bored stiff.
BLUE CRUSH is basically the surfing equivalent of COYOTE UGLY or FLASHDANCE. Flashy commercial garbage that people will watch anyway, and then feel annoyed at wasting 100 minutes of their time. When will Rodriquez finally get a chance to fulfill the promise she showed in GIRLFIGHT?",1054252800,2,1252,4.938388625592417
1446235,3,B00005JLH0,"This has none of the subversive humor that made ""Bring it on"" such a refreshing surprise.  The humor is pretty standard fare for teen/youth oriented movies:  toilet humor, an overweight guy wearing swimming trunks that leave nothing to the imagination -- stuff like that.  And there isn't a lot of bad acting in this movie, as some previous reviewers have criticized it for.  There is a lot of melodrama, though.  For instance, one of the ""dramatic"" scenes involves some of the Hawaiian locals bullying a tourist off a beach because its native-only beach.  Oh, dear.  And there's a sub-plot involving a conflict between the main character and her rebellious little sister, but that is abandoned about thirty minutes into the movie.
I also had a problem with realism.  I've never seen a woman as beautiful as the main character driving a junker like her character does in the movie, and have never seen a looker like her working as a maid in a hotel.  The pro football player characters look more like college players.  Other than that, it's pretty good lightweight entertainment, with great surfing scenes and plenty of eye-candy besides.
My final complaint is the music. I mean, surfing is pretty much the only sport (aside from skateboarding, maybe) that has a style of music specifically devoted to it.  I realize that, for the target audience, ""Cruel Summer"" by Bananarama is an oldie, which is why there's a hip-hop remix in the soundtrack.  But how about having an Orange County punk band doing ""Pipeline""?  Or better yet, have Jill Sobule sing ""Surfer girl""?

In need of money, she gives surfing lessons to a random football player, and of course she totally falls in ""love"" with him. But she has a surfing competition coming up and needs to practice, or she'll lose. In addition to needing practice, she's afraid because of an accident she had three years ago while surfing. Then comes the completion, which is painful to look at. I won't go into details, but it's a classic fairy tale ending and everything is perfect. So, if you enjoy that sort of thing, go right ahead and enjoy, but me, let's just say I was strongly disappointed. Shame, shame.",1052524800,4,954,4.488505747126437

Cons: The romance, the little sister, time taken away from actual surfing, story dwells too much on failure and loses steam on land, familiar territory, some corny teen events, more time on land than on the water, some of the acting is pretty bad, occasioanl cliches and underdeveloped characters, not enough actual surfing, unfathomable romance, predictable moral-of-the-story, lack of originality and plot, middle drags on, no story line, and the sex scenes took away from the movie",1052006400,,928,5.881481481481481
1446238,5,B00005JLH0,"Watching girls in bikinis is cool.  Watching girls wearing them while surfing is even better.  Kate Bosworth is wonderful in the title role.  She is both athletic and sexy, and she has a nice romance with a mainland football player in the middle.
The aerial, underwater and from-the-wave surfing shots are breathtaking.  The feeling of riding a wave - and wiping out - is captured wonderfully.  The rhythmic music heightens the athleticism.  And the movie reaches a climactic conclusion during the wave-pounding all-girl surf competition finale (after a fun and emotional luau, of course).
Kate spends most of the feature fighting her own demons.  In the final she watches another girl go down only to be carried off on a stretcher.  She herself gets caught underwater where she has to fight to regain the surface.  She is consoled on the beach, but returns to attack the waves.  The photography throughout the film is tremendous.  No sport has ever looked more graceful or awe inspiring.  And no movie before it has ever captured the relentless power of the wave (visually or aurally) as it pounds you mercilessly after a spill as this.
I thought that Blue Crush would turn out to be a chick flick.  But it is actually much deeper - without being too sappy or heavy-handed.  The message is all about achievement.  It also doesn't hurt that Kate Bosworth looks fantastic both in her plunging neckline black dress at the luau, and in her sleeveless tee (to protect her from the sharp coral) over a skimpy bikini at the end.  The finish is extra triumphant (of course).  And Michelle Rodriguez appears in one of her best roles as Kate's friend and conscience.

1446279,4,B00005JLH0,"This is a very enjoyable movie that takes a typical formula and puts it into an attractive setting.  It's the formula of the struggling young athlete, who has potential raw talent to be great in the field, but has some of life's obstacles thrown in the way to make it happen.  Some are character flaws,  some are being dealt some bad cards in life.  The athlete needs to overcome these obstacles in time for the big game so they can, well, you know.
But these stories can be very enjoyable when they take us to new worlds.  In this case, the sport is surfing, the location is Hawaii, and the star is a hot blonde who spends much of her time in bikinis or her underwear.  With all these potential winners going for it, Hollywood still has the ability to wreck it with the leering, sniggering attitude towards sex that today's teen comedies take.
Thankfully, this is bypassed.  We get all the good stuff described above, but without the potential blueprint for destruction.  There are no cardboard idiot characters in the movie.  There is grossness, like when the girls, working as chambermaids, discover a really trashed room, but it's handled realistically.  There is sexuality, but it's also handled tastefully, especially when the youngest sister shows an incredible amount of poise by having a mature discussion about the topic with a 400-pound football player.

To the point: The surf scenes work in ""Blue Crush"" and the romance is on low idle. Young girls and women may appreciate the romance angle between a hot young surfer (Kate Bosworth) and a hunk football player on vacation (Matthew Davis), but I didn't buy it for a nanosecond. In reality, I didn't buy Davis, period, as a quarterback.
The surfing scenes, done mostly with professional surfers in the Pipeline of Hawaii, are fun and startling, if a bit repetitive. No, they don't have that timeless feeling of the surf scenes from ""Endless Summer"" or the final sequence in ""Point Break."" Stockwell presents them as more a whooosh bam! crack! kablam! kind of deal, with some harmonious bliss thrown in when a wave is taken correctly. The DVD special features show you how the surf scenes were captured.

I think this was propbably one of the worst films I have ever seen.  The story, ha thats a laugh what story?, is supposedly a struggling amateur surfer who is trying to deal with some personal demons and conquer the surfing tournament thats comming up.  Her demons apparently are that her mother left and she had a bad accident while surfing once.  This is not clarified very well however and the actresses are pathetic at bringing out the emotion of it all.
  From this inner turmoil the director trys to build the story into a personal triumph tale but fails.  All the cliches to a surfing/skating/skiing film are here.  She has problems with her past, she doubts herself, she falls for a tourist who may be using her, she gives up and her friends get mad only for her to come out and overcome everything.
  The acting was downright lousy starting with Kate Bosworth.  She is flat and has no talent at least for this type of film.  The only criteria I guess she fit was she looked good in a bikini, which by the way seems to be the only point to this film.  Two hours of a bunch of cute girls in earth tone bikini's.  bosworth spends a good 90% of the film practically naked.  The surfing footage in the film was not all that spectacular.  I am sure you can find much better in another film.  The only thing I found good about this film was that the cinematography was very good especially with the wave footage.  The sounds of the waves also added some intensity but that was about it.  The story flops, the viewer is confused, the actors have poor emotion and everything plays out as expected.  The film really only garners a rental if you wanna see some cute people in bathing suits or kill some time with some ok surfing footage but other than that don't waste your time.

I was pleasantly surprised.  By no means is this a great movie, or perhaps even a good  movie.  But it is a pretty good movie.  It is pretty lighthearted and surprisingly well done.  Blue Crush tells the story of three friends (played by Kate Bosworth, Michelle Rodriguez, and real life surfer Sanoe Lake).  Bosworth plays the lead, Anne Marie.  Anne Marie is preparing to surf in one of the toughest surf competitions in the world, Pipe Masters.  It is at the Bonzai Pipeline in Hawaii.  People don't simply get hurt surfing there, people really do die at Bonzai.  Anne Marie lives with her two friends and is also raising her younger sister.  They live in near poverty, and to pay the bills (not all the bills in any given month), they work as maids at one of the resorts on the island.
The story follows Anne Marie as she trains for the competition, and focuses as much on her relationship with her friends, family, other surfers, and a guy, as it does on the training.  The cinematography is quite beautiful (we are talking about Hawaii here).  Director John Stockwell worked to get this movie as realistic as possible, filming on location, using locals who actually live the lifestyle presented in Blue Crush, and hiring top female surfers to give their insights (and also as stunt doubles for much of the surfing...Sanoe Lake does her own surfing, though).

We get to see her life surfing, working, home, love life.  We see her work towards her goal and be distracted along the way by romance, a rebellious little sister, etc..  I'm glad I saw Blue Crush.

The plot involves a local gal who wants to help put female surfing on the map, despite the taunts of her macho male colleagues, and yet finds herself distracted from her destinly by a cute, sensitive, equally athletic studmuffin. Michelle Rodriguez -- who had a similar role in the less-fluffy boxing movie, ""Girl Fight"" -- is also on hand to cheer Bosworth on, as is the clean-cut himbo who plays her newfound, earnest young beau. I gotta say, the plots and directing on these new teen-triumph movies -- ""Bring It On,"" ""Save The Last Dance,"" etc. -- have gotten so much better in recent years... they're actually worth watching! And this film is a fine example of that trend. It's a thoroughly entertaining look at the booming surf subculture, with some awesome marine  cinematography and a decent, well-paced story. Plus, all them gals are hella cute, in a pleasantly non-bimboed-out kinda way. A lot better than I expected it to be, and certainly worth checking out, especially if you're in the mood for something light.",1043280000,12,1739,4.8552188552188555

1446362,4,B00005JLH0,"""Blue Crush"", directed by John Stockwell, is a surfer's dream-film come true, especially if you are a female surfer, and even for non-surfers, it's the perfect summer flick.
PLOT SUMMARY: Kate Bosworth stars as Anne Marie, a young woman (probably around her early twenties), who lives in Hawaii with her younger sister who she takes care of, and her two best friends. Anne Marie and her friends are maids in a Hawaiin hotel, and they all love to surf. But after Anne Marie gets fired (and her friends quit, because she got fired), Anne Marie is given the opportunity of a lifetime when she is asked to compete in the Pipe Masters competition, the toughest surfing competition around. And to make money, she agrees to teach football player, Matt (Matthew Davis), and his buddies, how to surf. Sparks instantly start flying between Anne Marie and Matt, which starts to get in the way of things--like her friends and surfing. Her friends want her to concentrate on training for the competition...while Anne Marie wants to spend more time with Matt. But Matt isn't the ONLY thing holding Anne Marie back from competiting in the competition...what she REALLY needs, is more self confidence.
MY OVERALL THOUGHTS: I thought ""Blue Crush"" was well-done. There is a cute storyline and fun script, along with good acting by the entire cast. The surfing was absolutely amazing...and the film had nice special effects. But definitely don't rent this, thinking it's going to be another ""Road to Perdition"", with deep emotions and well-developed characters. It's probably the actual opposite of that kind of film. Light-hearted and fun, with a hip soundtrack to touch it up.
The DVD includes some nice bonus features such as, commentary by the cast and director, behind-the-scenes footage, deleted scenes introduced by the director, a Lenny Kravitz music video, a featurette on the surfing techniques used in the film, bloopers and best action scenes, and a document guide on surfing, including it's history, best places to surf, and equipment requirements. Basically, the DVD has everything a DVD fan could ask for. The DVD is available in wide screen and full frame formats.
I highly recommend ""Blue Crush"".

1446419,4,B00005JLH0,"Blue Crush tells the unlikely story of a surfer girl traumatized by a near drowning incident who is entering the big competition that could put her back on track to stardom.  Meanwhile, she meets an NFL quarterback, which complicates thing.  This movie was fine.  The CGI work was so bad it is hilarious, blatantly obvious heads stuck on real surfers.  It makes me wonder why, oh why, didn't they a) cast a real surfer in the lead role since it wasn't the most challenging acting role ever, or b) do a whole CGI character, which would have looked much more realistic.  The digital head thing just doesn't work.
My other main complaint is this movie's complete waste of Michelle Rodriguez, who is a talented actress not getting nearly enough great roles.  Girlfight showed she could act.  Here she's almost reduced to a cheerleader when it looks like she would have been the one who had what it takes to get to the top.
All in all, this movie is a fun watch if you don't take it seriously.  The guy that plays Leslie, the huge offensive lineman, is hilarious.

Once that sexist stereotype is out of the way, what you have is a really great action adventure flick about surfing, growing up and following your heart. Alot of movies in the past have tried to be inspiring (think Bring It On and the final competitions that took place), but without comedy in it and in the times that we live in, it just doesn't work. Somehow, this does. Anne Marie, the main character, is a teenager who is raising her kid sister. She's broke, left without any parents, struggling to make ends meet and still trying to hold on to her dream. It's hard, but that's life and that's the way it is today and that's what is so great about this movie. The honesty of the characters make you wanna believe in them and hope their dreams come true. It's a little corny, yeah, but in the end you'll see yourself in a few of these characters and though you may not admit it, you will hope they can achieve what they've worked so hard for. The shots of the actual surfing is just breath taking; being scary as hell or extremely thrilling depending on your feelings about the sport. I've never seen a movie where the camera was just as much in the action as the characters were. Just very beautiful. I recommend everyone see Blue Crush and let it take you back to the days when you used to wish for something so bad you could feel it in your veins.

I also loved how all the girls did all their own surfing for the movie.  It was a great movie.

Yes- it was a little mindless storyline, but hey - how many surfers could handle something deeper?!?  Isn't that who this was made for?  I fell deep into the movie.  Every scene had something I could relate to.  I could smell the ocean, taste and feel the salty water dried on my skin. Feel the rush of a wipe out that is so intense you don't know up from down when you're being thrown spinning in the water; and coming up for air only to take another hit and get that water blown up your nose again! Then, when you finally get out, find major road rash on your face that is burning from the salt water. Surfers - are you relating to this?  Anyone who has been there should. Surf Divas - your sex doesn't matter!  Surfing is surfing!  I have seen this movie four times and am now anxiously awaiting the release of the DVD.  I am planning a huge Luau on it's release date.

A 13 year old boy I know says that this movie has changed his life. It has motivated him to move away from his Utahn home and go to Hawaii.

1446488,3,B00005JLH0,"Blue Crush (John Stockwell, 2002)

It seems to me that most of the critics, who have universally panned this little flick, missed the point. Blue Crush was never supposed to be anything other than a mindless summer film, and in that, it succeeds tremendously. I mean, come on-what do you really want from a movie based on a magazine article, of all things?

The film centers around a trio of surfers (Kate Bosworth, Michelle Rodriguez, and actually surfer Sanoe Lake in her first film role) living together on Maui. One of them, Anne-Marie (Bosworth), is also playing foster mom to her younger sister Penny (Mika Boorem, the youngest member of the cast, and ironically the most experienced actress of the bunch). Penny is still on high school, and the other three are maids at a local resort when not out surfing. Anne-Marie has a chance to enter a national contest, get sponsored by a big company, and have a steadier, and bigger, income. Landing in the way of this particular dream is the young, handsome quarterback for the Minnesota Vikings, Matt (Matthew Davis). Love or money?

Yep, deep stuff there. The movie is an eighty-five minute excuse for lots of cinematography of waves and lots of model-quality actresses and surfers in small swimwear (and Goat Central would like to castigate whoever it was that thought Michelle Rodriguez needed to wear more clothing than everyone else throughout the film). The plot is thin, though not so full of holes as some have made it out to be (after all, when a plot's that thin, how can you really be too inconsistent?). It is perfect for turning off one's mind, sitting back, and enjoying. Just don't expect brilliance. ** ",1032912000,3,1669,4.804878048780488

Overall, I thought ""Blue Crush"" was a fun and entertaining movie that anyone who wants a break from violent, bloody, etc. movies should think about seeing.",1031529600,2,473,4.529411764705882
1446510,3,B00005JLH0,"The best we should reasonably expect from a movie like ""Blue Crush"" is that we will be treated to some stunning footage of surfers riding the world's greatest waves (along Hawaii's Pipeline, natch) to personal fame and glory.  We certainly get that in abundance - but what we have less right to expect, perhaps, is that the film will offer anything else of any real quality.  After all, we've been to these kinds of movies before, harking all the way back to those halcyon Beach Blanket Bingo days when Gidget, Moondoggie and the rest of those addle-brained, teeny-bopper cut-ups aspired to nothing higher than a life of eternal youth spent wallowing in the bleach-white sands of Santa Monica or Malibu.  In the case of ""Blue Crush,"" therefore, I am happy to report that the screenplay - by Lizzy Weiss (based on a magazine article by Susan Orlean) -provides just enough touches of realism to keep this new film both life-sized and interesting.  And the majority of the credit goes to the film's protagonist, Anne Marie Chadwick who, much to our surprise, engages our sympathies from first moment to last.
Anne Marie is no bubble-headed, bleached-blond bimbo with nothing on her mind but winning the big Pipeline competition.  Although that is, indeed, part of her life's plan, Anne Marie is, also, an intelligent, pragmatic young woman, fully aware of both her strengths and weaknesses and just trying the best she knows how to make her life work for her, the young sister in her charge and the two surf buddy girlfriends she lives and works with.  Anne Marie is also riddled with insecurities, as she struggles to overcome the fear instilled in her by a near-fatal accident in that very same spot a few years earlier.  Meanwhile, she and her pals work hard trying to eke out a living as maids at a posh hotel, earning just enough money to keep a roof over their heads and pay some of their bills so they will be free to head to the coast at the first sign of prime ""Surf's Up"" conditions.
The acting in the film is really quite impressive.  As Anne Marie, Kate Bosworth lights up the screen with her subtly nuanced, poised and dignified performance.  She knows how to use understated facial expressions to convey the thoughts and feelings of the character she is portraying.  Equally compelling are Michelle Rodriguez and Sanoe Lake as her fun-loving buddies, Mika Boorem as her little sister, and Matthew Davis as the professional football quarterback who becomes her love interest.  Director John Stockwell, to his credit, manages to keep the majority of the scenes intimate in tone and realistic in nature, rarely allowing the narrative to wander into overwrought melodrama or teen-movie farce.  Even the obligatory fight scene is kept restrained and believable.
There are occasional weaknesses in the film - a gaggle of snooty football wives and groupies who snub Anne Marie for being too lower class for their tastes are the primary offenders - but, on the whole, ""Blue Crush"" turns out to be a much better film than its subject matter would ever lead us to expect.

There must be dramatic tension and concrete story-telling in order for any film to be considered successful.

Some of what comes between the beginning and the conclusion are fairly interesting and the actors: Kate Bosworth, Michelle Rodriquez (always impressive and strong), Sanoe Lake and Matthew Davis all do a good job. But there is a nagging feeling that during most of this film Stockwell is merely marking time until the surfing contest and even that does not have the drama and catharsis it should have.",1031184000,2,846,5.00709219858156

Michelle Rodreguiz is always amazing in any role that she is faced with and plays (as usual) an exceptionally good bad-... Something that I also give thumbs-up to is the movie's chance at putting exceptionally new talent out there in the public eye.

They scrape by on what little they can, and surf when they're not forced to work to make enough money to eat.  Surfers have been doing some form of this activity on the North Shore since the 1950's, living 5 to a room on the floor of a shack, eating nothing but canned beans all winter long.  However, this time the young surfers also happen to be women, who in the genre of surf films are most often ""Bettys,"" pretty things to wait on the beach while the guys ride the waves.  In ""Blue Crush,"" we see the story instead of Anne Marie (Kate Bosworth), who is trying to make a comeback at Pipeline 3 years after hitting her head on the reef, and her two friends played by Michelle Rodriguez and Sanoe Lake.
The surf cinematography in this film was top-notch.  Simply gorgeous, whether shot from land, in the water, under water, a helicopter, or a camera board mount.  Shots taken after a wipeout were blurry and confused, very effective.  The sound was also fantastic.  At the luau the night before the contest you can hear the surf pick up.
However, the editing of the surf footage was sloppy.  Some of that can be expected.  Close-up shots in flat water of someone paddling (or being towed) cutting to far-away shots of a big wave is pretty typical.  But too many of the waves were edited together clumsily, and eventually the limited number of shots started to show through.  Watching someone from underwater get sucked over the falls is one thing, but the third or fourth time you see that same shot, it loses some impact.  Same for the shots of moves, or people dropping into waves, especially the digitally composited ones with stunt doubles' faces erased for the lead actress.  There's a later helicopter shot of a peeling wave where a completely fake (digital) surfer is inserted, and it's awful!  It looks faker than the XBox (or whatever) game the characters play.
Speaking of the characters, I liked them.  Well-acted and not the conventional ""surfer"" stereotype (male or female).  I felt like it gave me a good look at the difficulties of young surfers trying to scrap out a viable life on the north shore of Oahu.  We see just about the dirtiest aspects of the tourist industry, and the flip-side, the locals who don't want the ""haoles"" around even though they implicitly depend on the tourists for their livelihood.  Nothing is black-and-white; Drew is both an outwardly hostile local and yet he also tries to help Anne Marie (his ex) get some waves at Pipe to prepare for the contest.  I thought Chris Toloa was very good as Drew.  Keala Kenneley was also charismatic as ""the"" surf star, with the rest of the pantheon of world-class surfers that occupy the north shore of Oahu not present at all or shown in only a few shots (Layne Beachley and Rochelle Ballard in particular, who stunt-doubled for Kate Bosworth).
Overall, I enjoyed it and would recommend it.  It's a step far above most of the dreck that Hollywood produces in the ""surf"" genre, which isn't hard to accomplish given that the current cream-of-the-crop are films like ""Point Break,"" ""North Shore,"" and ""In Gods Hands.""  However, I'm still waiting for Hollywood to produce a surfing  movie that ""gets it,"" something I can point clueless friends and  relatives to and say here, this is ""why.""  For this film, too much  of the ""why"" revolved around the dangers of surfing Pipeline and the desire for contests and sponsorships.  All that was missing was shark attacks.
Yes, it was Anne Marie's (and her sister's) ticket out of a relatively bad situation, but ... why surfing?  Why did she put up with any of it, why not just move away and get a decent job on the mainland?  Those who don't know won't find the answer here... appropriate then that the best-represented member of surf industry in the film, Billabong, has as its motto ""Only a surfer knows the feeling.""  Aside from a touching sequence of surfers as the credits roll, I don't think viewers of ""Blue Crush"" will be any closer to knowing for having watched the film.",1030233600,2,4138,4.642857142857143

But what looks like another excuse to show lots of skin is actually a great, feel-good movie. It's not going to win any Oscars, but it's a great, laid-back, summer-fun movie to enjoy with friends of any gender.",1030233600,,351,4.5
1446558,5,B00005JLH0,"I had planned to see this film simply because I have a deep interest in surfing. I think that it is a cool sport riding those fierce waves on nothing but a board. Must take tremendous athletic prowess, bravery and skill.
However I did not expect to like the movie itself. Given Hollywoods lousy track record lately (especially with stuff like this) I expected it to be another rubbishy teenage film.
Boy was I wrong!
Apart from the visuals (surfing and cinamatography). I was tremendously impressed that they decided to go so deep into the characters themselves. I especially like Anne Marie the main character. I thought that she was fine young woman. She was strong yet still flawed and vulnerable. I got the impression that she was a former wild child who was trying to do good. Trying to fill in the mother duties and see that her little sister went to college. Wanting to win the contest so that she could ""pay her bills"" on time every month. I found it really touching.
I also liked the female bonding between Anne Marie, Lena and Eden. They were like a family and looked out for each other. I found it far more real and noble than the promiscuous antics of the girls in ""Sex and the City"". They really loved and cared for one another. There was no cattiness or jealousy. Sure they fought but it was the kind of fighting you see among siblings who have disagreements. As opposed to see who  would be #1 princess.
I found it really neat the way that at the end of the film all those young girls were gathering around Anne Marie in order to get her autograph. I think that she was a great role model.  Sure she had problems, but the difference is between her and heroins in other in such movies is that she works through her problems and doesn't fluff them off. How refreshing!
The audience I saw it with were absolutely captivated. It was not one of those films where you can sense the restlessness of the audience, everyone was absolutely riveted.
Blue Crush is one of the best films I have seen in a long time. It will inspire you.",1030147200,27,2038,4.432
1446559,4,B00005JLH0,"When this young lady was one of the very best young surfers around (boys and girls), she even got put on the front cover of a magazine. She was destined to be a great surfer. Then, her dream of surfing a wave called 'The Pipeline' came one time at the beach when she was to surf it (which was one of the hardest waves to surf in the world). She had 2 or 3 really close girl friends that always did everything together and she kept on telling them she would never let a man interfere with her life long passion. On the contrary, it almost certainly did. After she found out more about this jerk, she realized her dream was fast approaching and she better get prepared rather quickly. It was probably a 5 star flick, but I hate to give hardly anything 5 stars. It was the quarterback of a football team that was staying at the hotel that swept her off her feet (the girls even worked there as house cleaners; she got fired). She was insubordinate, to put it mildly. Well, anyway, at the end, she realized on the very last night before 'The Pipeline' was to take place to do it and on her very last attempt @ surfing the huge wave, she succeeded. It was a truly amazing accomplishment for anybody, especially a girl.",1030060800,,1213,4.278260869565218

1446590,1,B00005JLH0,"John Stockwell's ""Blue Crush"" is a film I can basically sum up in a few words; there are hot girls for the guys, guys with no shirts for the girls, monster waves for both and nothing else. That's right, nothing else. Bad plot, no character involvement, no fully drawn characters, weak dialogue, and no energy. The film actually reminds me of a film that came out earlier this year, ""Crossroads"". Obviously the two films have nothing in common as for as story goes, but, they both seemed to have taken the same approach in regaurds to the way the characters are set-up and the flow of the movie. Both films I think proved to be missed opportunities. ""Blue Crush"" I suppose could of been a good film, and it's not that the acting is bad or that the directing is off and there's bad cinematography that leads me to dislike the film, it's just that what exactly does this movie do? Where lies it's purpose? The movie just lags around, and I truly hate when that happens with movies.
 ""Blue Crush"" tells the story of a local surfer, Annie Marie (Kate Bosworth) who was on her way to the pros when an accident causes her to take time off. Now, everything in Annie's life is not perfect. Her mother left her and her younger sister Penny (Mika Boorem) on their own and now Annie has two of her friends Eden (Michelle Rodriguez) and Lena (Sanoe Lake) help her pay rent and get by. But, the thing that looms largest in her friend's and Annie's life is surfing. That is untill Annie meets a guy. Now Annie has to decide what means the most to her? Will she see where this romance takes her. Or will she continue to surf in order to enter a big tournament.
 Now, I don't want to give away the movie's story. Because I wouldn't want to spoil anything for anyone. But, I think the movie is fairly predictable. One wouldn't have to watch it very long in order to know which direction the story is going in. Though, in all fairness, I must give ""Blue Crush"" it's share of credit. The waves are amazing and though it may sound funny the audio sound is great. This is a movie that should get a nomination for best sound and I swear I'm not joking around. But, over-all ""Blue Crush"" is a movie that just isn't worth anyone's time.
Bottom-line: A slow moving poorly conceived mess that trys to entertain us by showing us big splashy waves. While the acting and directing is fine, there nothing else to enjoy.",1029801600,4,2388,4.400452488687783

1446593,4,B00005JLH0,"I had hoped this film would become to surfing what Kirsten Dunst's ""Bring It On"" is for cheerleading, a theme movie of the highest quality that champions a great endeavor.  It fell a tiny bit short, though, but not without a good fight.  The girls were all cute, they looked to be in good physical shape (even though their nutrition habits were lousy), and most of the surfing scenes were breathtaking (the main question being, ""Wow, how did they film THAT?).
The girls, whose encounter with a school official left the impression they had never been very academically inclined, eked out a living as hotel maids, pushing an equipment cart through the hallways and cleaning up all the horrendous messes left by wealthy, trashy guests.  It's good their occupation was not portrayed glamorously, and this movie likely won't encourage bunches of American teen girls to skip to Hawaii to surf and become hotel maids.  We never saw what the young surfer dudes did for a living, but their intellectual stature appeared about equal with that of the girls, so it's probably safe to assume they weren't neurosurgeons who surfed in their spare time.
The most poignant touch was a scene wherein surfer hotel maids expressed disdain for stupid football players.  Talk about irony there and back again!",1029715200,,1287,4.912442396313364

1446595,5,B00005JLH0,"Perfect summer entertainment, except not as cheesy as most summer films. I had a great time with Blue Crush. It entertained and amazed the hell out of me. I was in awe of the incredible surfing sequences. We are taken right into the waves and feel as if we are actually there. Very well done cinematography. The surfing scenes couldn't get more perfect.
Now the thing I've heard most complain about is the plot in between the amazing surfing scenes. And you know what? It really was not as bad as everyone was saying, in fact, I didn't think it was bad at all. I'll admit it was a little loose, but that's because the movie isn't really about the plot. It was less talk and more action and that was great, it doesn't give the viewer a chance to be bored. I thought they did a really good job with the actual story that was there. I never once found the diologue snicker worthy. Sure it's not Oscar material, but I have heard some really bad diologue in teen flicks (She's All That, Summer Catch) and the diologue in this movie doesn't come close to that.
I also liked the romance. It wasn't that original yet it was interesting and never bored me. Plus I like how it didn't make up the entire movie and never delayed the ...surfing scenes, we spend a lot of time in the water. The realistic ending was also nice, if not a little disappointing at first. It doesn't end how most will expect it to end, which isn't a bad thing. That made it less predictable and I've got to give it props for that. Now I don't want anyone to take what I said the wrong way and expect a bad ending, it's not a bad ending that will leave you [angry] while walking out of the theater. So don't worry, it does end on a high note and have a happy ending, it's just a different happy ending than we thought.
I think the diologue is getting unfairly bashed. Remember The Fast And The Furious? I thought that was a very fun movie, even if the diologue was cheesy. That movie was about the fast cars, not the plot. And although I knew it wasn't the best writing or plot it never bothered me once. I just sat back and enjoyed what was a very fun summer movie. And I can tell you for certain that the diologue here is not even close to as bad as it was in The Fast And The Furious. In that movie it was noticeable, in BLUE CRUSH I didn't notice at all. Maybe it's because the actors were able to pull it off with flying colors, or maybe it actually wasn't that bad. But whatever it was I didn't notice. The actors all did well with their parts, especially Bosworth. I can't wait to see her in more movies, like the upcoming RULES OF ATTRACTION. She's a star in the making.
Overall, BLUE CRUSH is an excellent summer movie that should be experienced at the cinema. The excellent cinematography just won't be the same on video. Trust me, see it on the big screen. It's not the most original movie, but most movies aren't anymore. Everything has already been done in one way or another. I had a great time watching it. It's the only movie I've seen at the theater this summer and it was definitely a good choice.

1446596,4,B00005JLH0,"I recently saw the film ""Blue Crush."" A had an intrest in seeing this film because I am a huge fan of Michelle Rodriguez and have enjoyed her in films such as ""The Fast and the Furious"" and ""Resident Evil."" I did not think much about the plot or the other actors. Well... I went into the theater with three of my other friends (they are female) so I would be able to see how they liked it. The plot was none to original,(a familiar hint of coyote ugly) but fit the film well. Kate Bosworth is amazing as a young surfer struggling to raise her 14 year-old sister and is still reeling after her near drowning incident three years ago. Some wonderful shots of hawaii and neat camera angles from underwater. I enjoyed this film and have no intrest in surfing! I was really surprised. The only thing that keeps it from being a five is that there is a lack of sex appeal. The producers figured that leading woman...Kate Bosworth had all the appeal that the film needed. WRONG!

1446597,5,B00005JLH0,"'Blue Crush' is marketed as 'the ultimate summer flick,' and, in many ways, it is. The target audience is the teenage crowd looking for something to do on a Saturday night. As a film whose purpose is pure entertainment, this film fits the bill.
Filmed in Oahu, Hawaii, there are plenty of beautiful settings to gawk at. Director John Stockwell has done a good job of creating that summer Hawaiian vibe; for example, the hotel at which the three main characters work as maids adds a nice touch to both the atmosphere and the financial state of the surfer girls. The early morning adventure that opens the film adds a sense of thrill and excitement to kick off the film. What is a surfer's life like? The camaraderie between the three girls is evident on the waters and in their small and messy home, where walls are decorated with faded photographs, dirty shoes are piled in a corner, and seashells hang on dressers. In essence, the cluttered life of the leads, juxtaposed with the surf, creates an exploratory feel that is filled with energy and excitement.
The plot is clichd, of course, but the photography is nothing short of stunning. In numerous interviews, the actors have applauded the real surfers; no surprise, as the film pays homage to the professionals by featuring them a few times. With all the spectacular views of the surf, coupled with the roaring sounds of the waters, one is left in awe of what female surfers do in real life. The cinematography is purely MTV: choppy and abrupt. But with the vicissitudes of the ocean, the style seems to fit perfectly.
'Blue Crush' carries many marks of the typical teen film; however, it is not completely mindless. Michelle Rodriguez and Sanoe Lake, not your typical teenage idols, carry the film more than adequately; in fact, their roles should have been bigger. Rodriquez is excellent as the motivator, while Lake provides comic relief with her antics. Newcomer Kate Bosworth, who no doubt will become a star after this film, holds her own well. This film is the ultimate surfing movie; it's fun, the soundtrack features several excellent summer songs, and it's worthy of a second viewing for a great thrill ride.",1029456000,,2172,4.794666666666667
