1818916,4,B00007L4OG,"""City by the Sea"" is an earnest, sometimes, empty headed, well-acted film about the age-old sociological/religious theory that a father's sins are passed down to his son.
Vincent La Marca (Robert De Niro) is a veteran NYC policeman who's past life comes to haunt him once again when his son, Joey Nova (James Franco) is suspected of murder. You see, La Marca's father was also suspected and convicted of murder. The tabloids proclaim that the La Marca's have a ""Murder Gene"" and Vincent's life is thrown into a tailspin; also upsetting his love affair with his neighbor, Michelle (Frances McDormand).
Michael Caton-Jones has directed without much wit, humor or style, which is very much needed in the scene, for example in which Vincent decides to open-up and reveal his past and present to Michelle. Vincent reveals a past and present so filled with pain, despair, murder, drug addiction, etc., etc that it is laughable. A good dose of humor is needed to bring this very real but preposterous scene to life. But Caton-Jones directs it very earnestly and the scene falls so flat that many in the audience of the showing I attended laughed out loud.
On the plus side there is of course De Niro and McDormand who command the screen and their scenes together are believable (except the one mentioned above) and touching. De Niro's last scene in the film is some of his best, most emotionally open and available work that he has ever done on film. Not to be missed.
But the real news here is James Franco who literally glows as if he were lit from within: the sign of a true star. His Joey Nova is a tortured, spoiled, drug-addled loser and even though you hate his actions, you like him. His part is not fleshed out in the script as well as it should be, but he makes up for this lack with ""it"": that unknown quality sometimes called, among other things...charisma and talent.
""City by the Sea"" is by no means a perfect film but any film with De Niro and McDormand is not to be missed. And if you can ignore some of the Caton-Jones turgid pacing and mise en scene there are several scenes that are gems. But the real reason for seeing this film would be to witness the emergence of a new star, James Franco who seems not one bit afraid to go head-to-head with De Niro and emerge unscathed and un-singed.",1032393600,3,2300,4.557971014492754
1818917,3,B00007L4OG,"I am giving this film three stars because of the wonderful performances by James Franco and Frances McDormand (who wouldn't know how to turn in a bad performance if she tried.) As well, Eliza Dushku does a fine job as Franco's girlfriend and mother of his child. However the film drags and would've benefited from some judicious editing before being released. While it may be based on a true story, the script is tiresome and provokes laughter where I doubt it was intended. Certainly, the audience chortled away through the screening I saw.
While Franco is wonderful and entirely believable as the left-behind, drug-addicted son of a New York City cop who couldn't get past his ex-wife (Patti Lupone, being tiresome as usual) to see his son, DeNiro's performance is, at best, workmanlike. And, weirdly, his cop partner is George Dzundza--who seems to be in a reprise of his role as Chris Noth's partner in the first season of Law & Order.
Points go to the cinematographer for an unfiltered view of Manhattan looking like Manhattan and not some production designer's idea of what the city ought to look like, and of Long Beach in all its desolate ugliness. As well, there are some beautifully framed and well-lit shots. But these attributes do not tally up to a particularly compelling film. There's just way too much exposition, a couple of places where people go completely out of character, and a lot dialogue and actions you can see coming from miles away.
Wait for the video on this one.",1032134400,9,1492,4.786821705426356
1818918,4,B00007L4OG,"I saw City by the Sea, and in general it was very well-acted. It was a good story. At times it was a little slow. But unlike what your editorial review says, it was set in Long Beach, NY, on Long Island, but filmed in Asbury Park, NJ. Vincent Lamarca was a cop in New YOrk city in the movie, and in real life he was a cop in Long Beach. I live in the town over from Asbury, Ocean Grove, and it was cool to see both in the film.

1818919,4,B00007L4OG,"This adaptation of a true story should appeal to fans of cop movies, especially NYC area residents and movie goers who appreciate well directed stories with excellent performances by good actors. Robert DeNiro is superb as Vincent LaMarca, a veteran cop whose estranged son Joey Nova (well played by James Franco) is accused of the murder of a local drug dealer and then of DeNiro's partner (George Dzundza who reprises his Law and Order persona) during an arrest attempt. Patty Lupone adds energy in her brief appearance as DeNiro's embittered former wife and Frances McDormand makes the most of her part as the downstairs girlfriend who gets involved in the unfolding drama and gradually learns of DeNiro's past, including the fact that his father had been executed for murder when he was still a boy.

This is not just about Vince Lamarca saving his son from a police force bent on vengenance for a fellow officer's death, but rather an examination of how a father and son attempt to understand and overcome their estrangement and the many wrong turns in their lives that have led to the present situation. The movie has only brief scenes of violence, a moderate amount of action, and is primarily a story of the deterioration in the life of Joey from a high school football hero to a drug addict set against the skillfully illustrated counterpoint of the deterioration of the boardwalk in the town of Long Beach where the family lived and most of the movie occurs.

In addition to the uniformly good performances by the cast,there were several other elements that made me decide to rate the movie as high as a four. First, the direction and editing were also first rate; the story was told in an absorbing manner and the complexities of the characters and their interrelationships as the situation unfolded were developed in a manner that kept your attention. Second, the fact that the story is true is what makes it riveting and separates it from the traditional cop movie or TV series. Third, the violence is only used as necessary to tell the story, not for shock value or sensationalism. And last and very important, despite the depressing nature of the story, the ending leaves you with some hope for the repair of broken relationships and shattered lives (especially for the next generation), rather than being either a nihilistic conclusion or a contrived feel goodism ending such as ofter occur in this movie genre.",1031702400,6,2427,4.84578313253012
1818920,5,B00007L4OG,"In this gritty New York drama, De Niro and Franco add two first rate performances to their already impressive cinematic repertoires.  De Niro is a Vincent, aworld-weary cop, divorced and haunted on a two generational front: his father was executed for the murder of a kidnapped child, his son is a junkie on the streets struggling to survive.  Franco plays De Niro's tortured son, wandering through the burnt out former Long Beach boardwalk area looking for his next hit and dreaming about escaping to Key West to find a better existence.  The basic plot revolves around the self-defense killing of a drug dealer which leads to the shooting of an investigating police officer, but the real drama lies in the unresolved pathos sensed between father and son.  De Niro is fantastically unable to express his disappointment verbally, yet emotes openly with his eyes and body language.  Franco, reminiscient of 50s icon James Dean, should win an Oscar for his totally believable portrayal of a son that feels he has lost his father's love and can do nothing positive in his life until he gains the recoginition he deserves as a son.
Look for Patty LaPone (Evita) as the mother who simultaneously rips De Niro apart while wanting so desperately to believe her son when he tells her he wants to get clean.
Powerful, memorable performances all around.  Recommended highly.",1031356800,11,1364,4.934497816593886
1818921,4,B00007L4OG,"Once again, the great Robert De Niro hits another one out of the park, taking what might otherwise have been a standard cop film, and making it something special.
  City by the Sea tells the true story of Vincent LaMarca, a cop whose junkie son was the prime suspect in the murder of a Police Officer. (I haven't read the article, by Crime reporter Mike McAlary, on which the movie is based, so I don't know how faithful the movie is to the real deal. I do know that the real LaMarca was retired when his son was wanted, not on active duty, as he is in the movie.) This seems like a TV movie-of-the-week, but Director Michael Caton-Jones has drafted some top-notch actors, and they help elevate what might otherwise have been a predictable drama. De Niro delivers an Oscar-caliber performance; just look at his scene with James franco towards the end...All of the guilt this man has been feeling for abandoning his son comes welling to the surface as he fights to save him. They're virtually strangers, but they both wish things could be different. Franco is a revelation as the accused Cop-killer Joey LaMarca; I've never seen him in a non-pretty-boy role, and he does a good job, as does Frances McDormand, who makes the best of the stereotypical ""Girlfriend"" role.
  While far from DeNiro's best, City by the Sea is a gripping film, and definitely worth a look.",1031356800,,1364,4.62396694214876
1818922,4,B00007L4OG,"For me, City By The Sea (based on actual events) is the story of three generations of LaMarca men. In spite of his father (who desperately kidnapped a baby that accidentally died and was ""given the chair""), New York City homicide detective Vincent LaMarca (Robert DeNiro) has had a long, successful career. The stakes are highest in his latest case: trying to protect his estranged and only son Joey (James Franco) who, on a high, killed a dope dealer in Long Beach (the ""City by the Sea"") and possibly a cop, Vincent's partner Reg (George Dzundza). Frances McDormand plays Vincent's girlfriend who he keeps at arms length. Her apartment is just below his, yet she knows nothing of his personal history. Vincent can't seem to escape his past, the bad name set by his father, yet he wants to finally do right by his own son as well as his girlfriend and himself.
Some will say this film is slow. I say, not all movies are fast-paced and action-packed. City By The Sea is full of emotional turmoil and an all-star, award-winning cast. DeNiro's role is a bit calmer that his usual, but it's still a DeNiro performance with some emotionally heart-wrenching dialogue, especially with his son. James Franco, who received a best actor award for TNT's James Dean, has whatever it is that makes the audience unable to look away. His character Joey isn't a bad kid. He's just honestly trying to get himself out of the messed up life he's made for himself. Franco has that James Dean intensity on screen, most definitely. Frances McDormand's role is pretty subtle, but she makes it as real as possible. William Forsythe, who I usually see as one of the ""good guys"" (cop, FBI), plays Spyder, boss to the dope dealer that Joey killed. Keep your eyes open for a pretty news reporter named Vanessa. She may not look familiar, but she's DeNiro's daughter, Drena. - B+",1031356800,35,1851,4.680981595092025

1818949,3,B00007L4OG,"Vincent LaMarca (Robert De Niro) is a police officer who has problems with intimacy, sharing, and commitment. These issues are reflected in his estranged son Joey (James Franco) who is a drug user and is wanted for murder of a drug dealer named Picasso (Jay Boryea), a murder he did commit. Frances McDormand plays Michelle, the girlfriend of LaMarca, someone who Di Niro has a hard time confiding in. Eliza Dushku is Joey's drug using girlfriend.

As De Niro and the cops are looking for Joey, so is Spyder (William Forsythe) the drug partner of dead Picasso. This is low action cop drama, which delves into the character of LaMarca, and is perhaps a study in psychology on how we are affected by our relationships with our father. The drama overshadows the crime aspect of the story. Well acted, directed etc. I just wasn't overly entertained by the film...and I blame my father for that.

1818950,5,B00007L4OG,"Robert De Niro is one of my favorite actors ever. I have seen a lot of his movies and this one is his best by far. He plays highly decorated New York Cop Vincent LaMarca. De Niro as LaMarca displays an array of emotions. Those emotions consist of pride, compassion, and ultimately guilt. LaMarca is also a conflicted man, who's partner Reg Duffy (George Dzunda) gets murdered. The suspect? LaMarca's estranged son Joey (James Franco). LaMarca is in the precarious position of being a cop and a father, hence him being a conflicted man. De Niro captures all the emotions of LaMarca perfectly, making this De Niro's most impressive acting performance by far. As Joey, this is what put James Franco on the map. Joey is a lost cause, who's life is in shambles. You root for him to turn his life around and feel sorry for how his actions have impacted his life. Vincent is adamant about helping Joey turn his life around, but the estrangement makes it easier said than done. Franco's performance here is also impressive. Other notable performances here are Frances McDormand as Vincent's very understanding girlfriend Michelle, William Forsythe as the menacing drug dealer Spyder, and Eliza Dushku, who more than holds her own as Gina, Joey's druggy girlfriend. But the performance of this movie belongs to De Niro. His monologue towards the end of the movie is one of the more powerful scenes in a movie. A total must see movie.

1818952,3,B00007L4OG,"""City by the Sea"" is a good example of what's wrong with Hollywood film making. It comprises little more than writing and acting clichs, and was probably green-lit only because Robert de Niro agreed to appear in it. Any competent script reader would have tossed it onto the slush pile.

Much of the blame has to be laid on De Niro. Most actors (seem to) take such pleasure in acting that they're always looking for new projects. Actors with taste (such as Robert Duvall) know how to pick projects, and rarely make mistakes. De Niro doesn't seem to know a good script from a weak one, so viewers hoping to see ""something special"" with de Niro in it are forced to sit through tedious bombs like this one.

On the other hand, his father is a cop (Robert de Niro) who scarcely earns to live into a modest apartment. His childhood was a tortuous nightmare when he lost his father at eight.

Due the random wings of the fate, father and son will have to reencounter themselves and every one of these inward conflicts will blossom making both worlds collide.

1818955,3,B00007L4OG,"City by the Sea tells the true story of three generations of the LaMarca men.  It is a story about fathers and sons and the devastating effects the sins of the fathers have on their sons. Vincent LaMarca (Robert DeNiro) is a homicide detective who has had to live down the reputation of his father all his life. When Vincent was a young boy his father, in a desperate attempt for money, kidnapped a baby from a wealthy family hoping to collect a hefty ransom. Before he could be paid off the baby suffocated to death and he was branded a baby killer and given the electric chair. When Vincent had a son of his own he couldn't handle it and walked out on him leaving him to be raised by his mother. Now Joey (James Franco) who is a junkie, has grown up and is wanted for murder. During a drug buy a dealer came at Joey with a knife and in a questionable act of self defense he stabbed the dealer to death. The police begin an investigation which Vincent heads up and as more and more evidence comes in Vincent realizes that the suspect description matches that of his own son. De Niro does a great job of showing the sadness and guilt eating away at Vincent as he begins the task of bringing Joey in and hearing more and more damning testimony about his own son. Franco  does a fine job of showing how desperate and hopeless Joey is. For all of his tough bravado he is really just a scared little boy who has nothing but resentment towards his father. The film works good as we watch both men deal with their angst and head off towards their fates alone but towards the end  when the two are finally brought face to face the film stops being good and becomes predictable and fake. The two men are crying and apologizing,calling each other son and dad. It doesn't work with what came before it and it feels like too much of an attempt at a happy ending. It really detracts from the film which up until that point was a gritty true story that was very well acted. Now it just plays as predictable and full of the usual cop movie cliches. The supporting cast has a few good performances which include Eliza Dushku as Joey's girlfriend and the mother of their child together, William Forsythe as a scary thug who is after Joey since one of his dealers was the man that Joey killed. Frances McDormand deserves special mention since she takes the most cliched character out of all of them and makes her a strong woman rather than a victim. She plays a woman in Vince's building who is seeing him despite not knowing anything about him. She doesn't know about his father or the fact that he is a father himself. In the film's funniest scene Vincent saddles her with all this information at dinner and to cap it all off he tells her that his son is wanted for murder. The next time she sees Vincent she is going to his apartment to end things  when Vincent opens the door and he is holding his grandson. McDormand and De Niro are the best things going for this film.

Much of the film is set at a seedy, mostly abandoned, seaside resort.  My IMDB research tells me that though the film is set in Long Beach, LI the movie was actually filmed in Asbury Park, NJ and efforts were made to make that beach town look even more run down than it was at the time and the work paid off in atmosphere and a real sense of geographic place.

His father, the cop (DeNiro) must try to stay within the boundaries of his job while at the same time clear his troubled sons name of the crime.  It is not very suspenseful and the end result, regardless what avenue they take, is dull.  There is no wonder for who really committed the crime, who framed who, or who will come out the victor in the end of the movie.  It just falls flat and it's to bad that DeNiro wasted his time and talents being in this film.

Robert De Niro, James Franco and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!

1818964,4,B00007L4OG,"De Niro is a great actor. No one questions that, but lately people have been criticizing him for the roles he chooses to take, with his presence being the only saving grace in some of those films (Showtime for example). Fortunately this movie does not require De Niro to make it stand although his presence in it definitely makes it that much better.

The story is an excellent one that reminds us all of the importance of family in the development of a child. De Niro is a dead-beat dad whose refuge from his failures is in his job as a policeman. His son, possibly as a result of his lack of a role model in life turns out to be a junkie who feeds his habit by any possible means.

One night while buying some drugs, the situation becomes ugly and he murders the drug-dealer unintentionally. From there things go downhill (as if things weren't already bad). He is wanted by the supplier of his supplier and by the Police (including his father) for the murder of the drug-dealer. To add to the already messed up situation, his girlfriend is almost penniless and has to look after his son while he finds a way to clean himself up. In addition to all that, Deniro's already inimical relationship with his ex-wife becomes even more strained when he has to face her to talk to her about their son.

This is realistic drama and it deals with the choices that we all make in life and the responsibilities we have to face up to, some of the speeches in the film really drive this point home. -

Deniro : I remember the day you were born

Son: I remember the day you left

(When Deniro tries to convince son to hand himself over)

 An earlier reviewer mentioned the realism in this movie and I would have to agree, Deniro is a versatile actor, and he is convincing in this role (you completely forget he was the Don once) the supporting cast is brilliant and make this film entertaining.

I would highly recommend this film, a good message and a great movie.",1093564800,7,1951,4.397222222222222

 The plot involves Robert DeNiro playing a seasoned cop who starts investigating the homicide of a drug pusher. He soon finds that his estranged son in the prime suspect in the homicide and is brought back into the torments of his failed family life.

 Yes, the movie does touch upon a failed father's attempt to show his son that he's looking out for him but, with that low-life heroin fiend son of his, you wonder: why? The son is portrayed as such a pathetic loser that the film simply evokes no sympathy for him. I came out feeling more for Robert DeNiro's character in having to accept his conception of such a pathetic wretch for a son.

Both Oscar winners, they infuse their characters with such humanity and imperfection, they make this movie much better than it would have been in other hands. James Franco, although obviously ""in"" to his performance, comes across attempting to repeat his Emmy award winning role as James Dean. The mannerisms, the false bravado, the hurt and pinched face, are trademarks of the late Dean, and Franco seems to enjoy using them again. William Forsythe approaches a caricature of his role, but it's still spinetingling enough to make your skin crawl. Anson Mount as the moralistic cop Dave Simond, gives a strong, understated performance, showing that all cops aren't bad. George Dzundza as DeNiro's partner is also good, as is Linda Emon, as his wife in a very touching and sad scene where DeNiro confronts her after Dzunda's death---apparently at the hands of DeNiro's son.

 The movie is to be commended for giving us characters with flaws, and in understanding the way some relationships never fully materialize or heal.

Instead, we see DeNiro, but AS THIS CHARACTER: a warts-and-all cop &  bad father, looking for a second chance.
Also, DeNiro's star power doesn't overshadow this movie's second plotline, about a junkie (DeNiro's son), also looking for a second chance....and some kind of family life.
Likewise, the physical setting and peripheral relationships all have a REAL feel.  Viewers will come away with the feeling that this is the seamy, redeemable side of real life.. a place you wouldn't want to live, but a state you can recover from.

1818968,4,B00007L4OG,"""City by the Sea"" begins as a typical cop drama - Vincent DeMarca (Robert DeNiro) is a good solid New Jersey cop with a history.  His father was executed as a ""baby-killer"", and now Vincent's own son Joey (James Franco), whom he abandoned as a young boy, is a strung out junkie suspected of killing DeMarca's partner.  The scenes are predictably dingy and muted, with Frances McDormand popping out of her apartment now and then as DeMarca's girlfriend. The first part of this movie honestly felt like the pilot for a new television drama - with calculated character introductions and back story.  But then something marvelous happens:  the quality of the acting kicks in to elevate the film beyond its script.  James Franco is astonishingly convincing as a junkie who both loves and despises his father, and DeNiro fools us into believing he's just an ordinary guy until the moment when all the layers are stripped off.  Frances McDormand does a competent job with what she is given (not much) while adding a needed texture to DeMarca's life.
This film is probably the quietest cop drama I've ever seen because it's not about crimes one can be arrested for.  It probes the fragile relationship between fathers and sons, and the obligations each needs to face.  The film never picks up the slow paces it sets up in the beginning, so those hoping for the high action of traditional cop dramas will be disappointed.  Make no mistake:  this is a three-star movie raised to four stars by the performances of DeNiro and Franco.  Still, the pivotal scene is a powerful one.",1077840000,23,1566,4.762962962962963
1818969,2,B00007L4OG,"""City By The Sea"" commits what is, in my opinion, the worst cinematic sin of all: wasted potential.  Even with a cast featuring Robert De Niro, Frances McDormand, and James Franco, this movie never quite gets off the ground.  Or, to put it more accurately, it gets off the ground only to come crashing back to it as things wear on.  The concept is promising enough: with his estranged junkie son on the run from a murder rap following a failed drug deal, De Niro's veteran homicide detective must try to bring him in safely while simultaneously facing up to his own shoddy record as a husband and father.  This led me to expect an interesting take on the traditional cop fare, especially during the movie's admittedly strong first half.  Set in New Jersey, ""City By The Sea"" is helped by the some great visuals of a decaying suburban landscape that perfectly augment its overall mood of despair.
The problem is, the people who made this movie don't know when to quit.  This is the classic drama that tries too hard, becoming increasingly more earnest until it collapses under the weight of its own seriousness.  One problem after another gets piled on the embattled De Niro, and it seems his principal response is to become ever more befuddled by his situation.  With its combination of cop drama and family drama, ""City By The Sea"" takes on some serious subject matter, and it ends up becoming TOO serious, with nothing to lighten the emotional load on the audience, especially when the characters start speaking in sound bites and monologues.  Even the occasional moments of humor found early on dissipate after a little while.  The best and most entertaining thing about this movie is William Forsythe's mullet.",1070668800,8,1714,4.779661016949152
1818970,5,B00007L4OG,"Starring Robert DiNiro, this film is based on a true story.  It's about a cop, himself the son of a convicted murderer, whose junkie son is wanted for murder. That's the theme, although the facts of the case were changed in order to make the film play well to the largest possible audience.  Even the location was changed.  It's supposed to take place in Long Beach, New York, a place I'm somewhat familiar with.  However, the setting didn't look at all like the Long Beach I know.  It was only later that I found out it was shot in Asbury Park, New Jersey.  It might seem like a small detail to those not familiar with the  geography.  But to me it sounded a discordant note throughout.
This is a good story though and it didn't matter that it wasn't authentic. It was well written, well paced and called for exellent actors.  James Franco is cast as Joey, the drug-addict son. He made me feel disgusted with him as well as sorry for him all at once as I got caught up in his escalating predicament and his resultant terrors. He's a fine actor and I can see him as a rising star to watch.  Patti LuPone plays his divorced mother.  I could see she felt love for her son in spite of her anger and feelings of hopelessness.  Frances McDormand plays DiNiro's girlfriend. She's a wonderful actress, and this is a small part for her.  She plays it well though and I could feel her conflicting emotions as she is forced to deal with DiNiro's guilt and psychological burden.  There's also Eliza Dushku as the young mother of Joey's child, George Dzunda as DiNiro's cop partner and William Forsythe as the bad guy.  All are excellent.  But the film belongs entirely to DiNiro, who is such a good actor that we tend to take his magnificent performances for granted.  In this film I could forget he was acting and identify with this man who was trying to hide his feelings. His suffering comes through clearly and I could relate to him completely, especially in the scenes with his baby grandson.
This will probably be considered a small movie by the critics and not worthy of awards.  It a way it seems like just another well-done episode from a cop show on television.  The plot is predictable.  There are some scenes worthy of a soap opera.  And it's all done with a low budget. But I wasn't bored for a moment, there were tears in my eyes, and I found each of the characters so well developed that my heart went out to each of them.  Don't discount this film.

CITY BY THE SEA is about fathers and sons.  It's about guilt, frustration, abandonment, estrangement.  Yet despite the bleak tone established by this movie--along with a lethargic pace--the bond between father and son perseveres.
Robert De Niro is almost one-dimensional throughout most of his role as veteran Manhattan Police Detective Vincent LaMarca.  Vince stays on a fairly even keel, even though the audience knows he's suppressing a ton of emotional baggage and guilt.  When at last his troubled son is on the verge of being taken out by a very motivated police force, Vince lets everything spill out:  his guilt, his remorse, his pain--his love.  It was marvelous acting, chilling to the bone.  And extremely effective.
James Franco and George Dzundza headline a wonderful supporting cast.  Unfortunately, Frances McDormand's character added nothing to the story, other than a sense of frustration when she exhibits less than stellar loyalty to Vince upon learning about all of his troubles.  CITY BY THE SEA is highly recommended for all fathers and sons who have had to mend some fences over the course of their relationships.  You will be affected--guaranteed.

Sadly for me the concept of the film and script seemed to part company after about a third of the way in, and began to point toward an all too predictable ending. DeNiro plays a street wise, tough respected cop of many years, who reflects with melancholy on the demise of his childhood vacations, and home life in the title location, now turned into a run down haven for drug addicts, bums and criminals. A long standing divorce and estranged son, add to his already overburdened lack of inner peace along with the revelations of his fathers criminal past, played in flashback sequences. The movie revolves around these attempted sub plots, and his lack of knowledge about his sons fall from high school football hero to petty thief and drug addict. The two inevitably cross paths when the son is accused of a murder, and the investigation falls under the auspices of DeNiro and his long time partner. DeNiro must then juggle his loyalties whilst upholding his beliefs, and attempt to seek the truth at all costs.

Robert De Niro is a detective trying to solve a murder case, unfortunately suspected to be caused by his own son.
The main focus in this movie is not exactly the 'action' the audiences were looking for. It was not much of a cop-and-car-chase kind of movie. And not quite a solve or unsolved mystery thriller either. It was generally a drama about the relationship between father and son -- and the turmoils of abandonment (turning to drugs, having family insecurity, basically all of the above in the long list of tragic, weaker decisions in coping with family problems).
In short, the essentials needed in order to make a decent film fit just fine. The 4 stars are given, only because the drama may have been much more felt if it had given the audience a better understanding of the characters and their development. The way De Niro leaves his family, and then becomes concerned for his son happened all too quickly. It seemed to have lacked something. I'm no Ebert, so I can't really put my thought on it.

1818979,3,B00007L4OG,"""City by the Sea"" is a competent thriller that covers familiar territory in workmanlike fashion. It is based on the true story of a highly regarded New York City detective whose father was executed for murder in 1959 and whose junkie son is himself involved in a murder. [In real life, the detective was not the investigator in the son's case. In the movie, he is. While this makes the story more dramatic, it also makes it much less plausible.]
Detective Vincent La Marla [Robert De Niro] grew up in Long Beach, a seaside tourist town near Manhattan. The once thriving resort is now derelict. He moved to New York to work for the NYPD after his marriage ended disastrously. Now, fourteen years later, he has had very little contact wife or his son. The boy, now going by the street name Joey Nova [James Franco] kills a drug dealer in self defense one rainy night. The body washes up in Manhattan, and Vincent, having no idea his son is the perpetrator, is assigned to the case. Back in Long Beach, not only is Joey on the run from the law, he is being hunted by the dealer's supplier, Spider [William Forsythe]. Vincent is about to face some very difficult choices, ones which will determine the fate of the son he long ago abandoned.
De Niro is superb as always, as is Frances McDormand as his girlfriend. The problem is that the material is not that strong, and their presence shines a spotlight on the movie's weaknesses. The lesser known James Franco does a great job of playing Joey, helping us to have empathy for a somewhat unlikable character. His is the movie's best role.",1046563200,,1583,4.557894736842106

As such, I was a bit disappointed after the film ended, but then in retrospect, realizing what it is - I've come to accept that it is really a decent film.
DeNiro is always great.  McDormand is excellent in a small part.  Franco is sympathetic at times and repulsive at others - it's exactly what he should be.  Patty Lupone is right on as usual.
However....the script, while good, is really no better than the best of Law and Order episodes, which this could have ostensibly been.  The difference is the actors in it.  The actors make this film worth watching and paying to see them do it.
I kept expecting some really neat car chases and explosions.  I got none of them.
So while I enjoyed this film, because the acting is really top notch, it wasn't the whole meal I was expecting.  It was much more reminiscent of an old 1970's cop drama on TV or the current crop of Law and Order episodes.

1818982,4,B00007L4OG,"This is an above average cop drama. In addition to the typical murder plot and good guy vs bad guy theme, the primary focus is on the intense and tumultuous relationships between a few finely developed characters.
The guilt, regret and heartache of DeNiro's character do not allow him or the film to be be humorous however a few scenes generate an unexpected laugh. This film is virtually all drama. The relationship of Deniro's character with that of McDormand's and Franco's, richly illustrate man's ability to confront all of the grief and anguish of his past. Robert DeNiro, Frances McDormand and James Franco are all excellent in their acting.
Because the relationships are so intense and the characters so richly developed, you can't help but to empathize with every one of them. The twists and turns in the plot make you wonder how much DeNiro's emotionally closed off character can handle before something changes. This movie makes you sit with the discomfort of each of its characters.
City By The Sea was filmed in the decayed ruins of the shore town and boardwalk of Asbury Park NJ. The Atlantic Ocean and the dilapidated remains of the boardwalk and vacant buildings provide an excellent urban yet coastal set for this story which takes place in the seaside NY town of Long Beach just outside NYC. There are also a few excellent and vivid images of the Twin Towers in this film which only add to the emotional experience by reigniting more feelings of anguish and loss. The Dolby Digital background sound effect of the ocean surf in a few scenes adds a sense of tranquility to this drama.

We slowly discover that a kid whose father was a 'murderer' was saved by a cop and now plays that life role, only to have deserted his own boy through a tangled divorce. Both the father and the son and the grandson need to love, to belong, to find some degree of sense to the mutations of time. The general driver of the film is a reconciliation of boys and fathers despite all the real and imagined distance that can occur.  The film is beautifully atmospheric but the true glory here is the cast: Robert DeNiro, James Franco, Frances Dormand, Patti Lupone, William Forsythe, and some new faces that really light up the story - all are consummate pros and really deliver top notch performances.

I'm not sure how a mother would react, or a father with daughters, but for me, the movie touched me on a level I wasn't expecting.  It is a cop movie on the surface but the real story is male identity and father-son relationships in modern America.

The cast is very well selected...these are ACTORS who can apply their craft very effectively when given a good story and script.
There are a few minor weaknesses in the plot which tests plausibility a little, but it still has a realistic grittiness and ""feel"" that most movies miss.  It is about real people, relationships and issues in America, especially urban America.

The film has a broad appeal in that it doesn't offend or challenge its viewers; rather, its just an OK day at the cinema. Maybe DeNiro owed a family friend a favor by starring here. Who knows?",1035849600,,561,4.62
1818990,3,B00007L4OG,"CITY BY THE SEA stars Robert DeNiro as a tough, sharp New York City cop who becomes caught up in a murder case in which his son (brilliantly played by future Oscar winner James Franco from SPIDER-MAN fame) is the main suspect. Not to mention, that murder runs in the family. DeNiro's character's father was convicted of murder.
  This is the stuff compelling dramas are made of and for the most part, the film works. While the two films are very different in plot, ROAD TO PERDITION and this film both boil down to being about the relationships between a father and a son. All of the performances are great except for William Forsythe who seems out of place as a comic book like villain who rides through drive thrus menacing young girls at the window. I recommend checking this out.  It's not great but you will be entertained.
Directed by: Michael Caton-Jones (ROB ROY)
Cast: Robert DeNiro (TAXI DRIVER), James Franco (SPIDER-MAN), Eliza Dushku (THE NEW GUY), William Forsythe (HARD CASH), and Frances McDormand (FARGO).",1034553600,6,1022,4.795454545454546
1818991,3,B00007L4OG,"In a sentence, the plot of this movie:  Vincent La Marca, whose father was executed for a 1950s kidnapping of a child, grew up to become a police officer, only to see his own son become a murderer.
The events leading up to this are a bit more dramatic.  The elder La Marca divorces his wife and leaves his kid behind in Long Beach to start a new life in New York City after a domestic violence charge was brought against him by his wife.  Things seem to be going well for La Marca in NYC; he found a new girlfriend and is well-liked by his police department.  That is until the floating corpse of a drug dealer lands in his jurisdiction.  He decides to investigate this further which leads him back to his hometown of Long Beach and the prime suspect turns out to be Joey, his son.  Joey still despises his father but attempts to contact him and tell him what really happened.  The Long Beach police department also suspects Joey of killing Vincent's partner, so they're willing to shoot first and ask questions later.  Vincent wants him to turn himself in before things get any worse.  You can pretty much guess the rest of it.
This movie just dragged on and on.  I wasn't too impressed with De Niro either.  And when Joey says the magic three words to his father from the back of a squad car, I just gave up on this movie.  It tries to be emotional.  It begs for attention and understanding.  But to patronize it would be to encourage mediocrity.
I cannot recommend this film because it is neither a drama nor action film but it tries to be both.
LEAP rating (each out of 5):
============================
L (Language) - 3.5 (nothing striking, lacks humor, non-passionate acting)
E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a)
A (Action) - 2 (final confrontation between Joey, Spider and Vincent in a warehouse, shots fired)
P (Plot) - 3 (cop father wants his estranged drug-addicted son to turn himself in for a murder, but the son is still bitter about the father leaving him years ago and refuses his help)",1033689600,,1985,4.462603878116344
1818992,3,B00007L4OG,"I was really hoping this would be a great movie since Robert DeNiro is such a great actor. It turned out I was wrong. I would call ""City by the Sea"" a so-so movie. The concept was (I guess) ok and the ending was far FAR from spectacular. All-in-all I probably won't see it again. I don't know, maybe 3 out of 5 is being too kind.
Other than ""City by the Sea"" I recommend ""The Score"", a great DeNiro movie.",1033344000,,405,4.012345679012346
1818993,4,B00007L4OG,"City by the Sea is a cop drama starring Robert DeNiro and James Franco. Surprisly this movie is really good because it was real. The storyline of this movie was based on a true story. I think that is why the movie is good. Because it is not a big fake movie that Hollywood wrote to make money but a real movie that Hollywood wrote to make money. But why the 4 star rating and now a five. City by the Sea started off strange. The theme music in the backround at the very beginning made it look like a comendy when it really is a strong drama. Anthor reason why I gave the movie 4 stars was because of the amount of profanity that is used in it. I thought that that amount was way to hign and they could have definalty killed at least half of the times they used major profanity. If those two things were adjusted to the movie this definalty would get a five star rating.the plot was good,the acting was good especially but Robert De Niro who gives one of the best preformances yet in this. James Franco playing a junkie was very into his character and didn't drift away from it at times. The movie is fast paced and all and all is just a good movie. Now let's get into the plot...
Joey(James Franco) is a drug addict who is trying to cut down while living inside an abondand casino in Long Beach Long Island(or the city by the sea) untill he could afford traveling money to move to Key West in Florida. One night he gets hign and goes to get drugs from a man named Picosso with his junkie friend. Picosso pulls a knife on Joey and they fight ending with Joey the winner. Joey and his friend throw the body in the river where Picosso and the 4 grand he has inside of his pocket washes up onto the shore. Vicent LaMarca(Robert De Niro) is a New York detective who left Long Beach years ago to get away from the trama of his father who was charged with killing a baby and then getting executed. When he and his parterner investagate a body washed up on shore his parterner takes the four grand out of the mans pocket. This causes Spyder who is a drug lord to think that Joey stole the money and now he wants his money back because that four grand was going to go to him. Vicent lives in an apartment where he lives upstairs from his girlfriend Michelle. When Vicent learns that the prime suspect of the murder case is Joey is tries to protect him and get his relationship back with his only son.
City by the Sea is very touching and a very emotinal film that I think everybody should see. This is probally the first Oscar contender for the 2003 Oscar year. See it now!",1033171200,4,2564,4.1923076923076925

1818995,1,B00007L4OG,I was really looking forward to this.  De Niro usually does good pictures and refuses the stinkers.  But I was really let down by film's ending.  It needed to wrap up 4-5 of the storylines that it started.  The viewer is left to make up his/her own ending and guess what happened to all of the rest of the characters.  An episode of Law and Order tells as good of a story and does a better job of dealing with the details.,1032480000,4,422,4.097560975609756

It is an excellent movie with a lot of action. James Franco is at his best as was Frances McDormand.

This is a hard one to watch due to the drug use, homelessness, regrets, missed chances and lost love but at the end you will smile.",1521763200,,356,4.144927536231884

You almost forget it's Di Nero because there are so many sides to the character he plays. The first time I saw this, it was my first time seeing James Franco, and he is also compelling.

7977777,5,B00007L4OG,"This movie was put together with style.  I saw it on TV.  It seemed like it would be depressing at first glance.
I almost did not watch it.  And, I can understand why it might not be liked if not watched through to completion.
The acting was first rate.  The movie was powerful.  It bundled together a lot of life's struggles and wove them together
into a stick of dynamite.  For me, it gave me more sympathy for the plight of a drug addict.  The story behind the addiction was a winding one.
I loved the music.  The selling of the guitar in the intro was a wonderful touch.  And, I especially liked the motel stakeout scene.
The father and son reunion in the bad guy's lair was also dead on!",1468195200,,692,4.221374045801527
