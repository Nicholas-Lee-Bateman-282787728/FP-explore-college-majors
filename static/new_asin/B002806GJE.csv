Most importantly, I had never heard of diastasis recti, until I watched this dvd. As I learned in the dvd (and later confirmed by my OB/GYN), many of the common pilates exercises  need modification, for safety purposes and, to prevent weakening of the abdominals. To my great frustration, many of the other ""prenatal pilates/yoga/exercise"" dvd's DID NOT include these modifications, nor did they include some of the other American College of Exercise modificaions that are also reviewed in the dvd. For more exercises, I followed the DVD with a private training session with Annie Martens and her class, which was fantastic!",1322870400,,757,5.056
