8268229,5,B001810EIS,"I don't know what axe EH has to grind with Mr. Rotcop, but I think this DVD is great at what it does - motivate you to write, get your script into shape, and understand the real process of how scripts are sold in Hollywood. As a script reader for three studios, I KNOW what the process is like and every writer who's starting out (Including EH) needs what Ken's many years in the business provides in this DVD's and in his workshops and lectures. I can watch this DVD over and over and it inspires me still. Ken is the one script doctor/writing mentor with a heart of gold. No other lecturer I've seen cares more about the writer than Ken does. And he's been doing it at the top for over 25 years.  In fact, Ken Rotcop STARTED the whole pitchfest concept with his PitchMart pitching events. You'll love this DVD.",1426809600,,812,4.30718954248366
8268230,1,B001810EIS,"I received this DVD free in a gift basket when one of my screenplays was an ""Honorable Mention"" at a local filmfest/screenplay competition.
Now I know WHY it was free.
It is indeed WORTHLESS.
They probably HAD to give it away to move the remaining units.
Rotcop (who, incidentally, if you look on IMDB does not have a credit to his name... not that I could find, at least) is a dinosaur. His advice is antiquated, irrelevant (in today's Hollywood, anyway) and largely inaccurate.
He seems to have only a dim understand of modern technology and mostly fills the time on the DVD with anecdotes (none of which are terribly funny, interesting, informative or useful).
Also, Rotcop talks about how screenwriting books are worthless... Even though he wrote one himself (though his was a book on the ""best pitch"").
He also talks endlessly about how proper screenplay formatting isn't important (!!!).
How all you need is creativity... When, I can tell you from experience, any script agency will TOSS your script the second they see a slug line out of place.
Really, I can't see this guy impressing anyone other than the completely inept or bored housewives & retired grandmothers who want to write a screenplay.
In the end Rotcop gives vague answers to a lot of the questions posed to him and some questions he doesn't answer at all. This DVD is about as informative or useful as a pet rock.
But the clincher is when Rotcop is telling one of his anecdotes and he uses then word ""schlep"". He then stops and asks his audience,
""Do you know that word?... Is that a BLACK word?""
His audience informs him, unanimously, that it is Jewish slang, and he chuckles for a bit about this before moving on.
YIKES!!!!!",1362009600,,1698,4.682274247491639
8268231,5,B001810EIS,"This is a great DVD for anyone interested in breaking into the Hollywood ""scene""! I was also lucky enough to attend one of Ken's Los Angeles based classes and I also got to go to his last ""Pitchmart"" as he calls them. It was great! At least 25 producers from major companies were there and I got to sit down one on one with them and tell them all about my script. With Ken's help (and this DVD) anyone can make their good script great and learn to pitch it like the pro's to the people who can actually help you get your idea made. This DVD helps cement your ideas and abilities into place so you can get going. Ken's a great guy and a great teacher! I know he's helped me a lot with my goals! Thanx for reading this!",1215820800,,717,4.056338028169014
