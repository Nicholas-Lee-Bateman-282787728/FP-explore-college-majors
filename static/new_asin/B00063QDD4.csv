8038173,1,B00063QDD4,"I have always been satisfied with my buys from Amazon, but this product was a colossal waste of money.  $49.95 for 14 minutes of sub-standard information.  I would give it away free......Do not buy this DVD...less than a star, maybe 0.25 of one.",1206403200,5,245,4.674418604651163
8038174,2,B00063QDD4,"I bought this for use in my classroom, but it was dreadfully dull.  Chaucer is funny; he's bawdy; he's ironic.  But as told in this drab DVD, it's almost as good as Ambien.  I ended up talking about the Prologue as I usually do, which according to my students is both animated and engaging--two qualities completely alien to this film.  And at $49.99 for 14 minutes??  What was I thinking???",1179360000,9,391,4.5285714285714285
8038175,3,B00063QDD4,"Our high school recently bought this item.  It is a basic introduction to the key figures in ""The Canterbury Tales"" presented in ""stop action"" style, with the camera panning various illustrations of characters. Main characters are introduced, such the Squire, Wife of Bath, etc.  After previewing, the teacher thinks it will be helpful but students (esp. high school) might be put off by the ""cartoon style."" Please be warned that this video is only 14 minutes long, which seems short for the price. Consider for purchasing - but do not expect lavish production or in depth material.",1134000000,30,583,5.0
