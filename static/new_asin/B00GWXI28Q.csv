6122957,5,B00GWXI28Q,"Jack Taylor returns in Series 2 with  good episodes. I have seen the first series, but for some reason enjoyed this series more. Jack Taylor played by Iain Glen seems to have an easier personality. Not so angry, his scruffy side is certainly apparent, but he seems easier to becwith. His turf remains the same, the tough roads of Galway.

In this series we have a new Kate Noonan, played by Siobhan OKelly. She seems to be as tough but she has a medical problem that is causing concern. She also has a nephew played by Killian Scott who we are supposed to believe is just out of the slammer, having spent three years for some sort of crime. Now, this guy seems too nice, too clean cut but it seems he found Confucius while in prison, and he is now a mellow man. He is an assistant of sorts to Taylor.

The tepisodes are entertaining and give us more than a glimpse of Galway. Episode one is Cross, episode two is Headstone and Episode three is Purgatory. After viewing these three, I am looking for series four. Do you think Jack will ever shave his scruffy beard?

6122974,5,B00GWXI28Q,"Gritty Irish crime series based in Galway. Jack Taylor left the Garda in disgrace and makes a living investigating cases the police are not interested in. His drinking habit sometimes gets in the way of a healthy lifestyle, but Jack never shirks a task and always follows throught for his client. Iain Glen nails the role of Jack Taylor and Nora Jane Noonan brilliantly plays the feisty police officer dancing around a relationship with Jack.

6122993,3,B00GWXI28Q,"There's a decent plot to this series but the star plays a typical down-on-his-luck alcoholic who can't keep his mouth shut and frequently gets the crap beat out of him.
And, there seems to be a trying-to-blossom love interest between him and an attractive young female cop, young enough to be his daughter which I feel is unlikely, at best, and disgusting at least. I hate to use that word and my bias is showing as I was a substance abuse counselor.  Jack Taylor annoys me but I watched -- for the story -- anyway.",1464566400,,515,4.421052631578948

This man is so sexy, so gritty, so wonderful to listen to -- I love everything about him. Where has he been all my life.  Perhaps because he is an acclaimed stage actor in London  -- I was not as aware of his work as I might have been if he worked more in America.  I thought he was great in Downton Abbey, but Jack Taylor -- WOW.  It is very rare that a performer so self-possessed and so capable graces my tv screen.  I know there are new episodes coming, and I will await them with bated breath.  He embodies Jack Taylor so well, I can't imagine anyone else for the part. Also, he has an expressive, beautiful face.",1461024000,,727,4.077464788732394

As Jack Taylor he really brings the character to life.  He's delightful.  He gives the flawed Irish character a depth not usually seen.

6123009,5,B00GWXI28Q,What an exciting series! Jack is one of the most mesmerizing actors we have seen in awhile now. We are hoping for more,1440633600,,118,4.173913043478261
6123010,4,B00GWXI28Q,Good series. Would by Set 3 if it existed. Seems like there are a lot of drunken UK detectives...,1437264000,,97,4.157894736842105
6123011,4,B00GWXI28Q,"The second set of Jack Taylor made-for-TV movies, consists again of three 90-minute stories.  Each can stand by itself, but there are threads that carry through the sequence, developing Jack's relations to his ""helpers,"" Kate, the Garda detective in the Galway force who isn't supposed to be having anything to do with him, and Cody, his assistant, who attached himself to Jack in the second movie of the first set,  Since these are basically noir-ish detective stories (with an Irish accent), it's not appropriate for me to go into details of the plot, but suffice it to say that once again, Irish culture, religion, and history -- as well as Jack's personal history, of course -- give weight and emotional gravitas to the stories.  I don't think it's giving too much away to say that the child abuse scandal in the church is very much in the picture in this set, as is the social circumstance of the ""traveling people,"" whom Jack becomes involved with in the third movie of this set -- and one that gets us out of Galway and into the Irish countryside, a setting that makes the dangers and  violence all the more horrifying.  One of the movies makes ingenious use of Synge's play ""Deirdre of the Sorrows,"" and in another the idea of Irish music as affecting people's lives and decisions is important.

Jack, you will remember, is an ex-Garda detective himself -- his ignominious dismissal is part of the very first story in Set 1 -- and his relations with his old colleagues are still strained.  Kate Noonan, whose relationship with Jack -- is he a mentor, father figure, or romantic figure for her? -- is developed further again has to figure to what extent her relationship with Jack is holding back her career.  Young Cody is more fully realized in this set too, and his relationship with Jack is tenser.  Does he deserve Jack's occasional condescension? Does Jack fear a rival?  It's all vey engaging.  Once again, Iain Glen is splendid as Jack -- the voice itself is a thing of beauty, and his melancholy, his struggle with alcoholism, his basic decency and feel for the underdog are all here.  Very enjoyable.",1435622400,,2117,4.7073170731707314
6123012,5,B00GWXI28Q,"This is a great series! I hope it continues--hope there are more sets to come. It is gritty, fun, moody, atmospheric, and has an incredible cast. I particularly like the contrast/chemistry between young Cody and Jack Taylor.",1434326400,,224,5.081081081081081
6123013,3,B00GWXI28Q,Jack Taylor is a great series. When I ordered Set 2 I thought it meant Season 2..which to my great disappointment was not the case. It was just the second part of Season 1 which I had already seen.,1431475200,3,197,4.076923076923077

6123038,5,B00GWXI28Q,"Set in Galway and Dublin, this Irish mystery series features tormented detective Jack Taylor; Iain Glen deeply inhabits this character. Art and pathos combine, with an overflow of booze, in this finely nuanced set of stories. The best mysteries ask questions about life's struggles, and the quest for truth. This second collection further deepens the narrative. While Glen is superb in ""Game of Thrones,"" in ""Jack Taylor"" he stretches his acting-chops to a harrowing degree. Reminiscent of the great film noirs of the 40s and 50s, Raymond Chandler, stained with whisky, smoke, and sea. Jack Taylor wonders, ""Why is it that family can push our buttons so effectively? It's because they installed them."" I don't know why this series isn't more widely known! The writing is clever, incisive, and atmospheric - not to be missed! We just wish there were more to come.",1405468800,,862,5.034965034965035
6123039,5,B00GWXI28Q,"The series is great. However if you watched Jack Taylor on Netflix streaming video you would have seen all 6 episodes. Which turns out is set one and two. I was watching the last 3 Jack Taylor videos, on Netflix, the same month that they were being released on DVD. Netflix streaming video lists all 6 videos as S1. So I thought that set 2 videos were new ones that I hadn't seen which they were not. In fact since Netflix streaming video is only $8 per month with a free month you might want to consider signing up for Netflix instead of buying set 1 and 2 of Jack Taylor for a total of $73.69.",1404777600,19,595,4.137931034482759

6123042,5,B00GWXI28Q,"JACK TAYLOR, (2010), Set 2.  Broadcast in the U.K. in 2013, and located in and around beauteous Galway on Ireland's rugged western coast, Ken Bruen's bestselling crime novels leap to life in this acclaimed series of Irish television movies featuring Jack Taylor.  The title role, self-destructive, pigheaded, and the shady side of 40, is fully inhabited by the Scottish Iain Glen, who holds down significant supporting roles in the two biggest TV hits currently around, DOWNTON ABBEY and GAME OF THRONES.  These hardboiled mysteries find their protagonist, kicked off Ireland's police force for booze-related infractions, apparently gaining nothing from his years on the Garda but a threadbare overcoat, now working as a ""finder"" (private eye) in his native Galway, taking on, from his favorite barstool, cases the cops won't touch.  He's battered, disheveled, hard-boiled, and shows himself, every so often, as a softhearted defender of the lost and broken. Exteriors are filmed in Ireland; interiors, in Germany, as the series was financed by a German company.  This boxed set of Series 2, includes three feature-length mysteries on three disks, running approximately 280 minutes, plus bonus programing.  And, thank goodness, and RLJ Entertainment/Acorn, subtitles, else how would viewers on this side of the pond possibly comprehend the west coast brogue.  But be warned, it's for mature audiences only, containing coarse language, nudity and violence.

The episodes are:

The Dramatist
While continuing his attempt at sobriety and healthier living seven months after his mother's stroke, Jack is asked to investigate the death of a female university student, who has fallen from a roof while in theatrical costume. A letter attached to her wrist appears to contain a suicide note written in her blood; the Gardai assume the death to be drug related.

Priest
Jack investigates the death of a priest who has been beheaded in church, and discovers the cleric abused two boys several years earlier, was then sent to Boston, from which he has just returned. More church secrets are revealed; Jack drifts back into his old habits, discovers more of his own demons as he discovers the horrendous consequences the victims of the priest's earlier abuse still suffer.

Shot Down
The police make no headway in the shooting death of a Traveler woman; Taylor volunteers his services to her grieving family. He believes the woman's 11-year-old daughter saw the killer and may now be in danger. A family feud rages within her Tinker community while Taylor does his best to help the girl recall her mother's murder and protect her.  Thank goodness, the girl cast in the case in no way resembles the way the part might have been cast in the United States.  She's not adorable, not dressed in pink, not pretty or precociously witty: she's a believable tough little Irish Traveler girl.

Glen carries the series - he's in almost every scene -- with brilliant wit, presence, power and dark humor: we may yet see him achieve superstar status.  He is here surrounded by excellent supporting actors, and, often, beauty.  The plots are satisfyingly intricate, thought-provoking; pacing's tight; crac's enjoyable.  Private eye shows really don't come much better than this.",1401148800,13,3252,5.199233716475096
6123043,5,B00GWXI28Q,"Action again finds Jack: ex-cop rogue PI with a jagged heart. Never tamed after his wife's murder, Jack Taylor (Iain Glen -Downton Abbey) has become the bity character from the Ken Bruen novels. His investigations get into the dark lives and locales within the beauty of Ireland's quaintness. A well-developed pair of crime fighter partners including: Assistant Cody (Killian Scott) & Garda Kate (Nora-Jane Noone) a cop help from inside and romantic interest. Expect some coarse viewing with the exceptional writing. Season two turned grittier, older teens and older fare, even though it is bonny Ireland. Always expect the unexpected ending.
Although each episode can be views as a stand-alone, they do play a bit off events of previous episodes. Set 1 is also recommended, and suggested being watched first. After the last episode of Set 2 my wife shouted, ""WELL DONE!""

SDH SUBTITLES for all three 93 minute features.
The Dramatist _ _2013
A sober Jack soon finds himself involved in a psychotic thriller case. He's hired by a local professor for investigating a student's death from a roof fall/jump/push, but dressed in a theater costume. The costume is part of the plot involving an historical cultural tale/play ""Deirdre of the Sorrows"" by J.M.Synge. It becomes critical for finding the culprit. Jack deals with family grief while Cody goes undercover and finds secrets. A second death; is it a serial killer?

Priest _ _2012
A Galway sanctuary bloody beheading of Father Royce (John Kavanagh -Braveheart). Then, Father Malachy, Jack's Ma's priest, is threatened and asks Jack & Cody for help. Back on the occasional bottle, Jack gets Kate involved again. Hidden church secrets lead to two primary suspects. More church secrets become darker and provide added motive. It's racy content with an explosive end.

Shot Down _ _2013
Jack is traveling, drunk, and working ""anywhere but Galway."" Cody is yet in a coma. Jack investigates free, out of guilt over Cody's condition, a woman's death. It may have been witnessed by her 11-year-old daughter, who's not talking. Hazel Doupe does a grande job of playing this young girl Rosie. A clan feud muddies the investigation. Local County Wicklow [filming locale] cops do little, putting it off to a gypsy feud. As always, a thriller-type ending is a must for Jack Taylor.

6123044,5,B00GWXI28Q,"This is a terrific adaptation of the excellent series of crime novels by Irish writer Ken Bruen.  I absolutely love the Jack Taylor novels.  It is maybe the most underrated crime series in current fiction.  Jack Taylor is an incredibly compelling protagonist, up there with Rebus and Bosch as the best of the genre.  The television adaptation is not quite as good as the novels but it is excellent.  Iain Glen always gives interesting performances and he is strong as usual in the role of Taylor.  Glen really does a great job getting under the skin of the former guard turned private investigator.  Nora Jane Noone is also excellent as Garda Noonan who risks her own career to help with Jack's cases.  One of the best aspects of the series is Jack's relationship with his young partner Cody.  Their relationship brings some much needed humor to this otherwise pitch black series and is at times unexpectedly touching.  Killian Scott shows real acting range in his role as Cody, playing a character very different to his most well known role as Tommy on ""Love/Hate"".  The adaptations are not strictly faithful to the novels, but the tone and feel of the show is true to Bruen's vision.  Overall, ""Jack Taylor"" is as good as it gets.  I can't wait to see new episodes.  Hopefully, this series will keep airing for years to come.",1391904000,16,1327,4.688311688311688

8628186,3,B00GWXI28Q,"""Jack Taylor"" Series 2 begins with Jack on the wagonwe know how that goes. There are three 90-minute episodes starring Iain Glen as the eponymous burnt-out, drunk private eye, based loosely on the novels by Ken Bruen. Two of these episodes take their titles from Bruen's novels, but I don't know how much the plots align with the books. By the admission of director Stuart Orme, the series takes more character than plot from its source material. ""Jack Taylor"" relies exclusively on Iain Glen's ability to make its dysfunctional hero lovable, or just watchable. He gets no help from the plots, unfortunately, which are beyond preposterous in two cases and full of holes in the other. Having Iain Glen sing (sort of) and strum a guitar while oozing sentimentality was not a good idea. British journalist Euan Ferguson described Jack Taylor as ""an ex-alcoholic maverick ex-cop with a catalogue of spurious ditto."" He felt that Iain Glen elevated the hackneyed material sufficiently. I don't.

The DVDs: Disc one includes an interview, ""Director Stuart Orme on Jack Taylor"" (20 min), in which the director of both Series 1 & 2 talks about the character of Jack Taylor, the source material, setting, shooting the episodes, actor Iain Glen. Discs two and three have slide show Photo Galleries of production stills. Optional English subtitles on all discs.

The episodes are:

""The Dramatist"": Six months on the wagon, Jack is caring for his ailing mother (Aine Ni Mhuiri) when student Sarah Bradley (Kathleen Rayner) falls from a window to her death, a note wrapped around her finger containing a quote from the play ""Deirdre of the Sorrows"" by John Millington Synge. The Guards rule the death a suicide while under the influence of drugs. But Sarah's eccentric drama professor Eugene Gorman (Niall Buggy) hires Jack to investigate, as he can't believe that Sarah was suicidal. When another young woman goes missing, Jack discovers that she and Sarah had two things in common: a heroin habit and an affair with lothario literature professor Lawrence Doyle (David Murray). There seems to be a serial killer at work, and the Guards are apt to blame Ronan Meyers (Fionn Walton), a drug dealer whom Jack blinded while in a drunken stupor.

""Priest"": Father Royce (John Kavanagh), a priest recently returned to Galway from Boston, is beheaded while kneeling at the altar. Without a case in two months, Jack is approached by his mother's friend Father Malachy (Paraic Breathnach) who has received a threatening letter: ""The day of retribution has arrived."" Malachy was Father Royce's assistant decades ago, before the latter was transferred to Boston. He tells Jack that he was aware that Father Royce was sexually abusing two altar boys but took his time reporting the offense. Jack tracks down the altar boys, thinking that one of them might be out for revenge. Tom Reed (Aaron Monaghan) was convicted of a similar crime himself and now is an indolent drug addict. The other altar boy, Michael Clare (Ronan Leahy), is now a successful real estate developer with an aggressively protective sister Nuala (Valerie O'Conner).

""Shot Down"": Jack has been wandering the countryside, wallowing in guilt, drinking, and accepting dreaded divorce cases to eke out a living since the events of the last episode. Stumbling around the woods one night, he sees a young girl splattered with blood running toward him. Jack catches her just as she loses consciousness. The girl is 11-year-old Roisin Mangan (Hazel Doupe), a Traveller, whose mother Sinead (Ruth Magill) has been beaten and shot to death. Jack is concerned for Roisin's safety, as he thinks she saw something that could incriminate the killer. At the Mangan trailer encampment, Jack manages to offend them but is ultimately hired by Sweeper Mangan (Michael Collins) to find the killer lest he be blamed. The Mangans and Kellys keep an uneasy peace since Sinead Kelly married Eddie Mangan (Karl Shiels) to reconcile the families.",1516579200,,3967,5.041158536585366
