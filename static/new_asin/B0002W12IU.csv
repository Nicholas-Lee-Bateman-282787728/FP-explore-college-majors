Bruce Lee got beat out for th roll by David Carradine. The idea

of a white guy being a Saolin monk was silly. This only reminds

me of the words ""Read not the times Read the eternities."" Or in this case watch not the times watch the eternities.",1101168000,,305,4.135593220338983

The Temple Teachings from the famous flashback sequences are now a part of the american heritage, as Finally, East meets West and both philosophies complement each other as Humanity should; each and every regular character (actor) in this series could not possibly improve on their performances; actors, writers, directors, producers, all were at the top of their art during those memorable three years. David Caradine, Keye Luke and Philip Ahn have inspired me as a young man and will live on and inspire future generations thanks to their colossal performances.

The occult worship scenes and the crow flying around the church on a string totally destroys that episode. The one episode that I found particularly good was ""The Tong"". This story is a parallel story to the Christian message of redemption and salvation and is an example of good TV stories that are missing from the modern tv that fills the programming of today. I find most of the shows in this series delivering good wholesome messages. The peaceful nature of Kwai Chain Cain gives me a peaceful feeling as I watch these episodes,something that I really welcome in our chaotic world of today. That is something that I cannot say about any other programming or even movies these days.",1442707200,2,800,4.5625

The extra interviews and info are extremely interesting also to fans of the show like me. But be sure to start with the first season which has the pilot. That gives the background on how Caine ended up in the Wild West, his life in the monastery, etc. For those not familiar with this show, they were only allowed to include 2 minutes of Kung Fu per episode, so it has a more spiritual slant. Don't expect something like the usual martial arts movie. Fans of the old Charlie Chan movies from the 1930s and 1940s will be interested to see Charlie's sons in their later years: regulars Philip Ahn (his son-in-law actually) and Keye Luke as Master Po, and also Victor Sen Yung and Benson Fong, not as regulars but in some episodes.",1412812800,,835,4.5

3863240,5,B0002W12IU,"If you grew up in the 70's, then you may remember this t.v. show which aired at that time. I was only 11yrs. old then and can vividly recall just how much of an impact this show had on me back then, just as much as it has helped to shape some of my philosophies in this present day.

Granted, by today's standards, the show may be slow paced and at times presents some seemingly awkward dialog.

But if one has the patience and willingness (traits that are also illustrated example lessons brought up for consideration as part of the storylines) to slow down and really 'absorb'  what is trying to be said... the main character's situation as a stranger in a foriegn land...wanted (regretfully but unjustly, also a matter of perspective) for murder... despised and looked down upon because of the ignorance of those who do not understand his race and culture and yet he posseses a physical discipline and spiritual wisdom to deal with how and why these things are all part of the human condition, you'll find the character of Kwai Chang Caine a very inspiring and unique individual.

Pretty deep stuff for an 11 yr. old (or for that matter, American television back then).

Great life lessons are a part of the benefit of this show.
As much as I loved Kung Fu, it would be great to see a tv show today which (perhaps in an updated sophisticated setting that younger people can relate to, although I do have a hard time endeavoring to be tolerant with some of today's moral standards) would present some of the thought provoking scenarios that were prevalent in alot of the episodes in this series.",1385942400,3,1597,4.56993006993007
3863241,4,B0002W12IU,"Kwai Chang Caine, a peace-maker in a violent and troubled time.  KUNG FU is a landmark show for a few reasons.  But what kept returning to my mind is its wonderful examination of what it means to be a peace-maker as opposed to a pacifist.
""The Hoots"" episode brings this out the best.
Caine is a man who seeks and brings peace, not a man who appeases the cruel and aggressive.

I had a father that did not like this show at all and sadly we were not able to see every episode that came out.  Now years later I have the chance and the money to order every episode on DVD and I can't wait until I can see every show back to back just like they appeared 38 years ago.

3863245,5,B0002W12IU,"Season 2 of ""Kung Fu"" was the middle of three seasons that the show was on. I know there are a few who believe that the third season was the best of the show starring David Carradine but I have have always thought that season 2 was the best of the three. There were I thought some really strong stories from that season. Also a collection of big name actors appear s well adding to strenght of the story lines. Of course the series continues with Kwai Chang Caine roaming the countryside in search of his half-brother and the people and incidents he encounters along the way. And as always he brings his peaceful ways and humble attitude along with him as well as the confidence the teachings the Shaolin temple gave him to face whatever life may put in his path.

Along with David Carradine Keye Luke , Philip Ahn and Radames Pera return to play in order Master Po, Master Kan and young Caine, otherwise known as ""Grasshopper"". The list of actors who do appear in the second season include Harrison Ford, Don Johnson, Slim Pickens, Tina Louise, Ed Harris, Gilbert Roland, Howard De Silva, Diana Muldaur, Barry Sullivan, Jack Elam and reprising his roll from the first season John Carradine as Serenity Jones. The other great thing with this season, as with all three seasons, is the list of great oriental actors who make appearences throughout the episodes. Included among them is Richard Loo, Robert Ito, James Hong and Soon Taek Oh.

As I mentioned earlier the stories were strong in season two and while there are some better then others there really isn't a weak episode in the bunch. Chalk that up the the great writting that was going on during that time for the show. I am sure such an original series as ""Kung Fu"" probably inspired the writers of the show to come up with original ideas and stories that in many instances would be out of place in a ""normal"" kind of western or any other series for that fact. Some of the better episodes from season 2 include: ""The Well"", ""The Squawman"", ""The Hoots"", ""The Elixer"", ""Empty Pages Of A Dead Book"", ""A Dream Within A Dream"" (my all time favorite episode from Kung Fu), ""The Passion Of Chen Yi"", and ""The Nature Of Evil"".

There are some good extra features as well including David Carradine giving commentaries on a couple of the episodes. The one he does for ""A Dream Within A Dream"" I thought was especially interesting and informative. Also there is ""Zen and Now: A Dinner with David Carradine and Friends"" which includes some of his costars from ""Kung Fu"" and ""Kill Bill"" movies along with other friends talking about David career and his work on ""Kung Fu"". You get to learn some interesting things in how the show was developed and even more important how David Carradine worked to develope the charecter of Kwai Chang. All in all this will be a must have for anyone who considers themselves a serious fan of the show. I highly recommend getting this season as well as seasons 1 and 3.",1347235200,2,2946,4.554716981132075

3863251,5,B0002W12IU,"The TV series ""Kung Fu"" with David Carradine is one of the most enduring programs around, for its ability to touch the desires of most of us as humans, that we all want to live in peace without violence. It is of course but a dream in the world we live in now, so to watch something that can still move the spirit and emotions and yet be entertaining without the graphic detail so predominant in the visual media today is refreshing.
The character of Kwai Chang Caine is gentle and caring yet remains true to his course when confronted with violence and discrimination along with moral unfairness. He is strong in his personality, yet meek without arrogance. Qualities that endear him to others.
The DVD is well presented and with great picture quality and sound. Its looks great on my large screen TV. The special features are informative.
When you watch this DVD set you'll know why it proved to be such a popular TV series in its day (1970's)

3863252,5,B0002W12IU,"This is an outstanding series.  If you enjoyed watching this on television ( or even if you never saw it before..) you will not be disappointed in the DVD collection. The quality of the video is excellent and the sound quality is also well above average. This series is a landmark of television creativity. What makes the series so enjoyable is observing the clash of cultures between far eastern philosophy and western pragmatism and hardship. Kwai Chang Caine is an unusual hero. Loathing violence, yet coming to the rescue of those who are thrust into it.  He is often at odds with his temple training trying to understand the violent, arrogant and desperate situations he encounters. And often he has to act to stop violence before it takes the innocent. That means that he often has to use his martial arts training to defend himself or others who are faced with unreasoning brutality. But he never goes beyond what is absolutely necessary to stop the violence around him.  David Carradine has an absolutely serene quality about his face which makes him perfect in the role of a priest, and his voice always soft and steady as he tries not to bring his own emotion to bear but rather to pass on the teachings of the philosophy he was trained in. Almost always he ends up making new allies and friends as he journeys, leaving people a little more enlightened about themselves and the world. There is grace and beauty in the series, a very high class production and very entertaining. One of the great joys of the series is seeing the flashbacks to Caine's formative years as he goes through his training under the wisdom ( and they are very wise indeed ) of the Shaolin Temple Masters.  Seeing the strangeness and beauty and cultural variety of the social order in and around the temple makes it a fascinating series. I highly recommend the entire Kung Fu series to anyone interested in great entertainment.

3863282,5,B0002W12IU,"Ideally, an Asian or Asian American actor, instead of David Carradine, should have played the lead role of Kwai-Chang Caine in ""Kung Fu.""  Why do I say this?  Because ethnically Asian actors do not have equal opportunities to play lead roles in the U.S. entertainment industry, and the part of Caine was a rare Asian main character in Hollywood.  But ""Kung Fu"" has so many other positive and excellent qualities that I am willing not to let the perfect become the enemy of the good.

According to the first-season DVD's ""making-of"" documentary, the creators behind ""Kung Fu"" at least *considered* a number of Asian actors -- including martial-arts exemplar Bruce Lee -- for the lead role, and the character's mixed racial heritage was germane to the story.  On both points, I cannot say the same for the Broadway musical ""Miss Saigon"" (1991-2001), another high-profile work whose Asian male lead went to a Caucasian actor.  I'm willing to believe that at the time ""Kung Fu"" was made in the 1970s, there weren't enough Asian actors in Hollywood's talent pool to choose from.  (I say this because many of the same Asian guest stars keep cropping up as different characters on the show: James Hong, Benson Fong, Richard Loo, Clyde Kusatsu, etc.)  I'm confident that the situation is different today.

Also, I see Carradine's wonderfully understated performance as Caine to be a transition of sorts.  Prior to ""Kung Fu,"" American audiences still saw white actors in heavy Asian make-up, and with caricatured Asian mannerisms, as acceptable.  A mere decade before ""Kung Fu,"" Mickey Rooney went uncriticized for his cringe-inducing grotesquerie of Mr. Yunioshi in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" (1962).  We can breathe a sigh of relief because ""Kung Fu"" (1) cast a Caucasian actor whose natural appearance was believably half-Asian and did not need heavy cosmetics; (2) does not require Caine to affect an artificial ""foreign"" accent; (3) allows Caine to speak in complete sentences instead of the fractured pidgin gibberish common to Hollywood's Asian characters at the time.  In today's entertainment industry, if casting white actors in Asian roles -- a practice dubbed ""yellowface"" by its critics -- isn't exactly prohibited, Hollywood has made important progress in recognizing the custom to be at least problematic.

The DVD's documentary seems tacitly designed to deny the rumor that Bruce Lee initiated the concept that eventually became ""Kung Fu,"" giving creative credit instead to New York writer Ed Spielman.  But many Lee fans insist to this day that their idol came up with the idea for ""Kung Fu"" and was robbed of the role of Caine by the Hollywood honchos who took over his property.  I'm willing to believe this version of events, but I haven't been persuaded yet.  However, the very existence of this story, true or untrue, speaks volumes about the ""Enter the Dragon"" star's enormous iconic stature.  In many situations when I bring up the TV series ""Kung Fu"" to others, it's not long before I hear something like, ""Didn't Bruce Lee have something to do with that show?""

To me, the true tragedy is *not* that Lee lost the role of Caine, but that his death at age 32 was so untimely.  Had he lived, Lee's career post-""Enter the Dragon"" would surely have surpassed Carradine's career post-""Kung Fu,"" relegating the martial artist's involvement or non-involvement in the TV show to a trivial footnote in his biography.  With his ghost continuing to haunt a series that he officially had little connection to, I think that Bruce Lee is having the last laugh.

Episodes of special interests are ""The Chalice"", where a priest steals his own art, begging Cain to return it to the Church.

Although I had taken lessons in martial arts since age 15, and had watched the series like ""Green Hornet"" with the legendary Bruce Lee, the way that ""Kung Fu"" presented the full measure of life was very important. It also inspired me to pursue a more rigorous study of the martial arts when I was in grad school. The effects of this series were profound in my life, not as mere emulation but as an example of an optional approach to life that worked.

The lives that our parents lived were rewarding but didn't allow enough space to breathe (and they would agree.) The richness and complexity of human life has to be pursued experientially and experimentally to be full appreciated, and this series was part of that process for me.

Of course, others in the same vein would be Richard Feynman who wrote several books, two general titles of merit: ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman?"" and ""What Do You Care What Other People Think?"" Strong mind, strong body, to vary the phrasing a bit.

3863310,5,B0002W12IU,"""Kung Fu"" catapulted actor David Carradine to fame. He didn't even know it because he didn't have a TV and was living in what he describes as a ""shack"" (my guess is a very nice one) in Southern California according to the commentary track on ""The Well"". The classic 70's TV series had an impact on many kids (including this one) when it aired giving us our first taste of Kung Fu, eastern philosphy set in the wild west.

Carradine plays Cane a half Chinese Shaolin priest searching for his half brother Danny in America. On the run when he causes the death of a member of the royal Chinese court, Cane has a bounty on his head. The second season consists of 23 episodes and is presented in its original 1.33:1 full screen format (unlike season one which was cropped for a widescreen format of 1.78:1). The image quality is exceptionally crisp and clear with solid blacks and exceptionally good color given the fact that the series is over 30 years old. The images have been cleaned up and there's little in the way of dirt and hair to mar the images. The sophisticated storytelling in every episode feature a plot involving Cane as a man contrasted to Cane being trained at the Shaolin temple by his teachers. This unusual use of flashbacks as a ""subplot"" enriched and made the series unusual and memorable. This device hasn't been used in a series since and, while it could easily have become a gimmick, most of the writers and directors used it to compliment the more modern stories they were telling. With stunning cinematography and sharp direction that frequently used unusual camera angles, ""Kung Fu"" sadly only lasted three seasons (Carradine left when it became successful to pursue a film career).

The extras are particularly fun. We get rambling but fascinating commentaries from Carradine on two episodes; ""The Well"" where Cane drinks contaminated water and must be nursed back to health by an African-American family and ""A Dream Within a Dream"" in which Cane discovers a body in a marsh. When the body mysteriously disappears, the tension escalates in the town. Carradine relates a number of interesting stories including his habit of NOT reading the script (he would study it just before he needed to do his scenes learning the lines and picking up a general idea of the plot). Carradine claims that this helped foster the idea that the foreign Cane couldn't understand the culture or what was truly going on around him a lot of the time. Carradine also points out that only two directors in three years ever figured out he was doing this (although I suspect he probably did read the two hour pilot).

The only extra is a great featurette wittily entitled ""Now and Zen"" where Carradine has a dinner with friends from the series and castmates from ""Kill Bill"". They discuss the series, the character and the impact ""Kung Fu"" had in its day. We also get hear from Kam Yuen one of the technical advisors on the show and Radames Pera the man who played Cane as a child in the flashback episodes of the series.

Kudos to Warner Brothers for returning the series to its original format and for doing a great job of delivering this classic series. Unlike many companies (are you listening Universal?)that put out series as so much ""product"" a lot of care went into putting this set together. A note about the packaging. The package designer Paul Lanner did, indeed, spell the title of the the cenotaph correctly but it was changed without his consent for the domestic release. While I'm not a fan of the two sided dual layer discs (we have 23 episodes spread over four discs as a result) because they can easily get damaged or scratched, the exceptional package design works well at protecting the discs and providing key info on each individual episodes.",1106265600,56,3764,4.707132018209408
3863311,1,B0002W12IU,"I recently purchased this set and put the first disc in my dvd and it looked fantastic, after they started the dialoge it was quite noticeable that the soundtrack did not match the visuals, it was totally off. This was the first disc, first episode,the second episode didn't have that problem, but there were two sccenes that just faded out. The third episode was ok. Iam not even going to go thru the entire set and plan on returning this as it is defective. I purchased it at a major warehouse club. Has anyone else had this problem? I was all set on watching this in it's entirety. I am sure my rating will improve when i get another copy.",1106092800,4,642,4.358333333333333
3863312,5,B0002W12IU,"Oddly, the second season seems more antiquated than the first, and relies more on dialogue and character development, than action to capture the audience's attention. It does this well.  These episodes have a simplicity, innocence, and an uncanny way of drawing you into the sense of distant place and time.  ""The Brujo"" is in my opinion one of the greatest episodes of the series, beautifully directed, acted, and with Carradine in top form. The contrast of Carradine in the special feature informal dinner chat, with Caine, confirms that Caine was a character that Carradine seem to channel, as evasive as the melancholy notes from his flute, the graceful and clumsy slow motion ballet, the simultaneously unfocused and penetrating vision. No episode stands alone.  Each season gives us a chance to see that unique character in cinematic history, Caine, evolve, and it captures the imagination, is life affirming, and empowering.",1106092800,8,931,5.23489932885906
3863313,5,B0002W12IU,"In the 1970's, there wasn't much in the way of action shows for kids and teens.  Most of the action dramas were cop shows like Kojak, Starsky & Hutch, etc, or Saturday morning fare that was aimed at younger kids.  Then Kung Fun came along and probably did more to spur interest in the martial arts than any single event in history.  But more than an action show, Kung-fu doled out equally amounts of wisdom and life lessons to go along with those fists and feet of fury.  Today, there'd no doubt be outcray about having a caucasian playing the role of an oriental, even if he was supposed to be half American.

David Carradine perfectly underplayed role as the wise Caine set this show so far apart from anything else in the 1970's.  Season two features 23 episodes:

The Well

The Assassin

The Chalice

The Brujo

The Squawman

Spirit Helper

The Tong

The Soldier

The Salamander

The Hoots

The Elixir

The Gunman

Empty Pages of a Dead Book

A Dream Within a Dream

The Way of Violence Has No Mind

In Uncertain Bondage

Night of the Owls, Day of the Doves

Crossties

The Passion of Chen Yi

Arrogant Dragon

The Nature of Evil

The Cenotaph, Part I

The Cenotaph, Part II

The Best in my opinion are:

""The Chalice""  A Franciscan priest, Benito Cardona, has stolen a golden chalice he made for the tabernacle at San Blaise. Caine sees him murdered by four men, the Gilchrist gang, who steal the chalice. Before Cardona dies, he begs Caine to retrieve the chalice, which he stole because he was obsessed by it.

""The Assassin""  Caine witnesses an ambush by a Ninja and is mistakenly identified as having been part of it.

""The Spirit-Helper""  Caine helps Nashebo, an indian boy, who thinks Caine is a spirit-helper sent to guide him in becoming a man. When they discover that Nashebo's mother has been kidnapped and his father killed, the young man expects his guide to help him with rescue and revenge.

""The Gunman"" - Caine befriends a wounded gunman who is being tracked by a bounty hunter. The gunman insists on being taken to the ranch of a widow whom he first met during the war and to whom he feels he owes $50.

""The Way of Violence has no Mind"" - A mine owner assumes Caine is involved with the Chinese 'Robin Hood' who has been stealing from him. When the mine owner takes the law into his own hands, Caine is almost drowned and a farmer is shot twice.

""Arrogant Dragon"" - Caine, delivering a message given him by a dying man, becomes involved in an internal dispute in a local Tong. The daughter of the former Tong leader begs Caine to help her father who is about to be executed.

""The Nature of Evil"" - On his way to Eureka, Caine gets a feeling which leads him to his old friend Serenity Johnson and a town called Ninevah that is full of fear.  Guest stars John Carradine.

This really was an amazing series, especially for the time.  Well-written and superbly acted with outstanding location shootings for a TV show.  So glad this is out on DVD!",1106092800,9,2967,4.455223880597015
3863314,5,B0002W12IU,"Caine, a Chinese-American  immigrant, conflicts with  a violent 1870's  American West as he seeks a way of peace. The conflict that he feels within himself as  a peaceful man who practices martial arts is portrayed excellently. The flashbacks that he has of conversations and lessons in a Shaolin temple are a glimpse  into another world. An outstanding series.

The series has been criticized because Bruce Lee, an American actor of Chinese descent, was passed over in favor of an actor not of Chinese descent.
