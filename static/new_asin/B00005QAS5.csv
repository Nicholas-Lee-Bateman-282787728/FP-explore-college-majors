7949988,5,B00005QAS5,"""Home is the nicest word there is."" These are Laura Ingalls' sweet and touching words that help kick off the ""Little House on the Prairie"" video series in ""A Harvest of Friends."" The Ingalls family has decided to settle at Plum Creek in Walnut Grove. Pa builds a house for the family, and they are all happy there. Pa starts working for two men named Mr. Hanson and Mr. O'Neil to ensure that he can earn the supplies he needs for his harvest. Mr. Hanson is a kind and caring man, but Mr. O'Neil is pushy and unrelenting. So, when Pa falls out of a tree at a family picnic and is ordered off to bed, you could probably guess which one of those two men is understanding and which one refuses to cut Pa any slack. I was very touched when the title of this video came to life and presented itself so beautifully at the end. This is a good one--I give it 5 stars and I definitely recommend it.",1018137600,13,888,4.1686046511627906
