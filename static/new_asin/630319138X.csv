589644,3,630319138X,"This isn't a bad movie about AE but it's not in the same class as 'Amelia' with Hillary Swank. For starters, the aircraft used was a Beechcraft 18 and not a Lockheed Electra 10 (correct) or the smaller and similar Electra 12 (OK, the one used in 'Amelia'). In the real Electra, Fred Noonan (navigator) sat in the rear of the aircraft near the door and not where he was in this film, just behind the cockpit. The character of George Palmer Putman was not convincingly played nor was it given enough space in the film given his importance in AE's life. The character of AE seemed rather subdued and her supposed difficulty in learning to fly the 'Electra' made her look like a novice pilot, which she wasn't. Fred Noonan was made to look like a drunken bum, which he wasn't, even if he did have an alcohol problem. The end of the flight seemed overdone.

The movie didn't try to speculate on the ultimate fate of Amelia, Fred and the plane. One is led to believe that they ran out of fuel and went into the ocean, which is normal for the several AE films I've seen.

This isn't bad, but it's not that good. I think the people that made 'Amelia' had a good long look at this one before starting and noted most of the above, using their observations to produce a much better film.",1386115200,2,1276,4.334728033472803
589645,4,630319138X,"I must admit, I was very surprised that this movie came near to the quality T.V. film it was.  Clearly, Keaton's Golden Globe nominated portrayal of Amelia Earhart made the difference here.  The performance even struck me as spooky in how close this actress came to Amelia's mannerisms, speech patterns and appearance.  I realized I was watching the work of a great actress.

I was also surprised this made for t.v. movie took on a controversial issue to suggest the U.S. government was helping Amelia on the flight primarily due to interests in obtaining information on the Japanese military bases on the islands in the Pacific.  After much study from credible sources, there is actually some relevance it was partly a spy mission, because Amelia needed the government funding offered for the plane's repair after her first intial plane crash.

Sadly, I have come to the realization Amelia's plane was forced down by the Japanese military, prior to WWII and the bombing of Pearl Harbor, in order to obtain the Lockheed Electra's latest advanced technology to implement into their fleet.  There is evidence this quantum leap in Japan's aircraft design did occur shortly after Amelia's plane disappeared that couldn't have happened other than by studying the engineering of the plane itself. (""Age of Heroes"" Henri Keyzer-Andre)

After researching much about the life of Amelia, this film did the best job imaginable to portray her life during those flights accurately. The only thing it lacked was an accurate portrayal of just how famous Amelia was, having left out the big moments such as when thousands of happy admirers greeted her in 1932 in a huge welcome home parade in New York. After having viewed documentaries about Amelia Earhart, the N.Y. parade equaled, in its enormity and celebration, those parades that followed the end of world wars! For leaving this historical parade out, probably due to a low budget, I give this 4 stars.",1097366400,9,1942,5.009316770186335
7840279,1,630319138X,"Appalling...script. appalling acting and THE WORST miscasting. Cardboard cutout characterisations. COMPLETE RUBBISH ending. I'm surprised that an actress of Keaton's calibre accepted the role.

The more recent film with Gere does a better job...but the ending is ALL WRONG. As a lifetime pilot/engineer of vintage aircraft and former film/TV worker, I appreciated the trouble that was taken in disguising a ""time ex"" Beech18 as a Lockheed 12 (that masqueraded as a Model 10).
Only silly points were the trimotor ""drama"" of trying to fall out of the cabin and the ""romance"" of Noonan's crude drunken advance on Amelia in Lae..  Latter is an unfair reflection of a recently married man totally ""head over heels"" in love, separated from his bride.  Noonan was a brilliant navigator, drunk or sober.",1520467200,,795,5.1953125

7840283,3,630319138X,"Seems like some scenes have been edited from its original television airing. Also the print was rather disappointing considering the price, especially towards the beginning of the film.

7840285,4,630319138X,"I'm a bit of a Earhart ""expert"" - I knew Paul Mantz - my cousin. I'm always interested in the many portrayals.
I was disappointed that they veered away from many of the established facts about the flight.
Keaton was good, however.",1436140800,2,230,4.5
7840286,5,630319138X,Loved this movie. Diane Keaton was great.,1436140800,,41,5.0
7840287,4,630319138X,"It looks as though the producers followed Earhart's history pretty well, but tended to embellish slightly for ""human interest"" reasons.  Diane Keaton did her usual exemplary acting job, but her companion on the ill-flated flight had about as much masculinity appeal as Edward G. Robinson.  Also, Bruce Dern, her husband's character seemed to be overblown.

Taken altogether, this film is worth viewer effort.",1418774400,2,408,5.444444444444445
