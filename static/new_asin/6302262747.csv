7823505,4,6302262747,"Between 1909 and 1923 there were 15 major league ballparks built in the United States.  Today, only three of those parks remain: Boston's Fenway Park (1912), Chicago's Wrigley Field (1914) and Yankee Stadium (1923).  When this documentary was produced in 1991 you could have added Tiger Stadium and the ""old"" Comiskey Park to this list.  You have to doubt that any of these last three will celebrate their centennials.  ""The Story of America's Classic Ballparks"" looks at these grand stadiums as not only examples of urban architecture integrated into neighborhoods, but as temples constructed during the golden age of baseball.  If you remember, as I do, going to see your first ball games in places that are now apartment complexes or whatnot, then you will enjoy this particular trip down memory lane.  Perhaps the greatest testament to these classic ballparks is that their spirit lives on in the latest generation of stadiums such as Camden Yard and those new ones I can never remember the corporate names of in Detroit, Houston, Pittsburgh, etc.",987724800,8,1051,5.046242774566474

Sorry Tiger Stadiam was not more involved, although this was  a documemtory from 1991, and this is September 29, 1999--two days after its closing. A sad day  in Detroit and Michigan.",938563200,6,249,4.904761904761905
