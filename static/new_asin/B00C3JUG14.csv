5689825,5,B00C3JUG14,"The greatest DVD of James Last I have in my collection. It was a trap at first when I received the copy from America and I was a little disappointed, but then my copy arrived from the UK and it's sooo much better, almost double the length with the complete concert, just simple magic. If you buy make sure it's the UK DVD and you will be so impressed. I don't understand why they have done this to produced two different DVD's I am just so happy I have the UK version now. Love live James, simply the best.",1307836800,,506,4.121212121212121
5689826,3,B00C3JUG14,"This DVD while true to the great style the has made James Last, it lacks the greatness of other DVD's.  Maybe this is because it was edited and the good parts left out.  This being aside it is still a great DVD and well worth it.",1290816000,,229,3.9565217391304346
5689827,4,B00C3JUG14,I heard James Last on PBS some years ago and was impressed. He has a unique style which to me seems to be the influence that started the outstanding Andre Rieu programs. They are both tops!!,1273363200,,190,4.305555555555555
5689828,5,B00C3JUG14,Super ! James  Is without a doubt the King of them all. I have enjoyed many hours just relaxing and listening to the beautiful sounds they create.,1236816000,,146,4.407407407407407
5689829,5,B00C3JUG14,Recently became aware of James Last - Sorry that I had not had his music in my life for the past many years.  Intend to purchase more of this magnificant music.  Very entertaining as well as great to listen to. Have recommeded this to all of my friends.,1223942400,,253,4.25
5689830,5,B00C3JUG14,"Music can clearly transcend all languages. James Last has been a driving force in instrumental music for well over 50 years, and he shows no sign of slowing down. This concert, shot in London's Royal Albert Hall in 2007, proves that his love for music, and his fans, knows no bounds. I attended one of his concerts in Germany about 22 years ago, and the formula remains the same. From rock and roll to classical, from lush strings to biting brass, Hansi does it all. His audiences are multigenerational. I saw grandparents, teenagers, and young children, and everyone in between, all having a terrific time with the music. People dancing in the aisles. Everyone singing along. People of all ages having fun. It was an experience I'll remember. This concert featured a fantastic rendition of ""Hero"", one of my favorite songs, sung by two members of Hansi's chorus. They do it with true feeling. And ""Tequila"" gets the audience involved. Hansi has a way with that. This program was also filmed for presentation on PBS stations during their fundraising drives. Sadly, the two PBS stations in my area didn't show it.
  The DTS surround sound is terrific. I didn't listen to the Dolby Digital track; I prefer DTS for its ""high definition"" sound. On this disc, it shines. This concert is fun, entertaining, and a great way to introduce Hansi's music to those who still haven't discovered it.",1221350400,3,1385,4.815126050420168
5689831,5,B00C3JUG14,"We saw this on VHS at my parents (they are in their 80's).  We all enjoyed it but it was time to upgrade it to DVD, so we had this sent to them.  It has a wide variety of popular music done with interesting arrangements.  It is a favorite of my parents & we also enjoyed it.",1219276800,,274,3.7719298245614037
5689832,5,B00C3JUG14,I loved James Last's music ever since I heard it on PBS and will most likely buy more of it.,1215648000,,92,3.65
5689833,4,B00C3JUG14,Liked the music ...maybe a little bit too much leaning toward jazz...rather than typical james last,1212969600,,99,5.25
5689834,1,B00C3JUG14,"A disappointment. Only 55 minutes of music. The first half sounds like heavy metal rock-n-roll. The audio is not the usual. The red spotlight(?)colors everything in a dark shade of red. Jumbo TV screen behind performers is very distracting. Audience participation: Three rows of ""cheer leaders"" in front of stage. If I had paid $100 for front row seats and all I saw was the back sides of these folks trying to be kids again ... I have all the earlier James Last videos and they were fun to watch over and over. This one I fast forwarded thru the first 11 tracks, too loud, too slow. Orange Blossom Special and the Polkas were up to past standards. Interview with James took up the rest of the 77-minute  ""running time."" His accent made him very hard to understand. This was not a problem with the interviews on the earlier James Last tapes. I don't know if the $10 I paid for ""Live At The Royal Albert Hall"" was worth it.",1211500800,11,922,4.423529411764706

8577071,3,B00C3JUG14,"We ARE fans of James Last.
This one has the highest quality sound of any we have collected.
Three stars because the music is mostly modern, modern ,modern. Not the James Last music we have loved over the years.",1383177600,,210,4.410256410256411
8577072,3,B00C3JUG14,"James Last at his best again!! I specified the EU/UK DVD because the US version was edited. The music was more contemporary than other DVD's I have of his.
I am still partial to his ""Gentleman of Music"".",1373587200,,203,4.368421052631579
8577073,2,B00C3JUG14,"My appreciation for James Last started with Music Box Dancer. So the wife and I settled in for what we thought would be an enjoyable evening of music. The evening ended at the third song... a medley which included Signing In the Rain. At that point yellow ducky umbrellas suddenly appeared. Hokey beyond belief.

James Last was not conducting, he was strolling around the stage... it was pathetic and sad. The musicianship, what I heard of it, was quit good, though the orchestra dressed as if they were at a rehearsal.

My plan is to edit the audio, burn a CD, and get trade-in value at Best Buy.",1370649600,,597,4.518518518518518

8577075,5,B00C3JUG14,"First,I rate this dvd five stars because the James last performace not this US version dvd. Go buy UK version that you won't be regret and sorry!! From my opinion, Paul Mauriat & James last still are the best composer and orchestra in the world!!..",1316736000,4,248,4.533333333333333
