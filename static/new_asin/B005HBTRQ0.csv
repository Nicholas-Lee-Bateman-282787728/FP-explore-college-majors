8472822,4,B005HBTRQ0,"The picture and title pretty much says it all including expectations. The title is plural on the inside credits i.e. ""Centerfolds."" Three centerfolds are finalists for ""Plaything of the Year."" One overdoses on an experimental drug and well, you can guess the rest from the cover.

The film is not just a campy silicon fest, but also pays homage to other films like ""The Invisible Man"" and ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.""

I will say they missed an opportunity by not naming Mark, Harry.

No f-bombs or sex. Just wholesome T&A nudity (Janey Jaye North, Raelyn Saalman, Penthouse Centerfold and adult film actress Tammy Parks)
