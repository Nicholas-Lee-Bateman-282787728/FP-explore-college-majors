5043974,5,B006ZYCH2E,This film did waste some time watching scientists talk .... but not too much. It's informative and LONG (3 hours) so there is a lot to see.,1359849600,,139,4.185185185185185
5043975,5,B006ZYCH2E,Absolutely amazing.  My husband and I saw this on T.V. and had to have it in our collection.  Great wholesome educational we have watched it several times.,1346889600,,155,4.703703703703703
5043976,5,B006ZYCH2E,"Exceptional collection on whales and dolphins. In places all over the world, camera crews and experts follow the animals, exploring their behavior, their intelligence, and their social structure. The camera work below and above water is spectacular, and the various species are magnificent to behold. Highly recommended.",1344729600,,320,5.829787234042553
5043977,5,B006ZYCH2E,"It is probably a marker of just how unutterably mind-boggling nature documentaries have become in recent years that, last night on BBC One, I found the first episode of a new series about the largest animals on the planet, well, mildly underwhelming. It wasn't really Ocean Giants's fault -it had all sorts of footage of massive whales slapping their fins, spuming heroically and gliding endlessly by like the spaceship at the beginning of Star Wars.",1343520000,,450,5.013333333333334
5043978,5,B006ZYCH2E,"This is a 3-part DVD on whales and dolphins.  I saw one part on TV and decided to order the DVD through Amazon so I could see the other parts as well.  All 3 1-hr parts are extremely interesting.  The DVD arrived in the mail promptly -- I should say both of them arrived promptly.  I received 1 BluRay copy and 1 regular copy, even though I don't have BluRay equipment.  My sister does though, and so she is enjoying that copy.  Great filming of whales and dolphins in the wild...",1339027200,7,480,4.21978021978022
5043979,5,B006ZYCH2E,"I am so glad I made this purchase. I love how these documentaries
whether on lands or seas show us the magnificient beauty of this earth.
Whether animals or people in far away places...it is so wonderful to
see LIFE!!!",1335312000,4,218,4.475
5043980,5,B006ZYCH2E,"I saw this on PBS about 2 weeks ago and was just captivated - I need to have this to show my daughter!  They showed the documentary in 3 one-hour segments and I couldn't move away from the television the entire time. The documentaries were just so well done in every way - the beauty of the creatures, the more ""inside"" information about them, i.e any pertinent history of the particular animals, what their body language meant, the story of what was happening, etc. It was very moving (you'll see what I mean if you get this - I think I cried, and I'm not the crying kind). Get it, get it, get it!!!!! You will have no regrets!",1331683200,16,628,4.277310924369748
5043981,5,B006ZYCH2E,"If you love whales you will be thrilled with this video and if you never thought about whales one way of the other, you will find this video fascinating.  My husband and I could watch this over and over and marvel at the footage that was shot of these creatures in the oceans all over the world.  This is DVD group is amazing and so worth owning and you will be amazed at the volume of content packed into this!  We were amazed.  One gets one's money's worth, one could say!!",1391644800,2,475,4.186813186813187
5043982,4,B006ZYCH2E,"'Ocean Giants', by BBC Earth and Nature, consists of three documentaries which explore the lives and times of whales and dolphins.  The first episode covers information about the largest whales, including the Bowman Whale and the Blue Whale. The second episode is a fairly technical program which describes the intellectual abilities of dolphins.  The third episode discusses how the various cetaceans use sound in their lives, including in capture of prey and purported communication.

Overall, one cannot quibble with the photography - it's simply amazing.  To see these giants so close up is just amazing.  It's notable that there has been very little footage in the past of the Blue Whale, and this series covers it well, showing how its body is so narrow yet so massive.  There is also a lot of footage of other interesting cetaceans, including the Sperm Whale and the river dolphins in the Amazon.

If I had to lodge any complaint (and I hesitate to use that word because the series was overall very good), it would be that it doesn't have the sweeping grandeur of other BBC Earth documentaries I have seen.  The music isn't quite right, and there is a lot of footage of scientists which, while necessary to the stories, takes away from the overall feel of the series.

Most importantly, the narration of John Benjamin Hickey just doesn't cut it.  Admittedly, he has a hard act to follow compared to David Attenborough (the gold standard of nature documentary narrators), but his narration isn't as smooth or dramatic as other series I have seen.  Even Tilda Swinton in 'Galapagos', who wasn't quite as good a narrator as David Attenborough, was better than Hickey.  Although not completely distracting, this was the low point of the series.

Overall, this is a very nice series and one which should be on every nature documentary lover's shelf.  It's so difficult to see these magnificent creatures up close, that any chance you get to see them is wonderful.  Ocean Giants, while not perfect, fits that bill very nicely.",1388188800,5,2027,4.903225806451613
5043983,4,B006ZYCH2E,The video consists of 3 episodes of a series of encounters with great whales and dolphin groups in various parts of the world. The  videography is very good quality but is essentially a movie about 2 videographers filming cetaceans. There is mention of marine biologists studying the whales and describing the nature of their various studies but it is very non-technical and the science content is rather minimal.,1387670400,,413,5.073529411764706
5043984,4,B006ZYCH2E,It's funny my daughter only loves the dolphin parts. There are lots of interesting info about these ocean animals in it.,1378166400,,120,4.761904761904762
5043985,5,B006ZYCH2E,What a wonderful experience for me to view the wonder you created with such high quality workmanship; it was thought provoking,1375747200,,126,5.0476190476190474
5043986,4,B006ZYCH2E,This is an all region BD disc and NTSC DVD combo set and it comes with good English subtitles. It is not in the Attenborough style and there is a bit more on screen chit chat with the human participants than I would have preferred but overall I found this a well planned and informative set. Good value.,1371772800,,303,4.241379310344827
5043987,4,B006ZYCH2E,"I was expecting a typical BBC documentary, but this program is more similar to Discocery documentaries. BBC documentaries tend to focus just on the animals (until the ""behind the scenes"" portions at the end), while this one included a significant amount of footage of the film crew and scientists discussing the animals on location. There is nothing wrong with this style, I just prefer BBC's traditional style.

The footage was also not up to par with your traditional BBC documentary. Part of it might have to do with the color grading process which is always excellent in most BBC shows. And some of the locations you will recognize from other documentaries (after all, they aren't going to skip something just because its been filmed before).

Regardless, although this series wasn't all that I had hoped it would be, there was some pretty interesting content that I had never seen before, especially in episodes 2 and 3. If I had known about the style ahead of time I might not have bought it, but in the end I'm glad I did.",1371427200,10,1029,4.711111111111111
5043988,5,B006ZYCH2E,"Watched it online and loved it very much.
If you like nature shows then add this to your collection.

5043989,4,B006ZYCH2E,We have been on several whale watching trips and rarely get to see many whales.  This movie was recommended by the tour guide in Hawaii if we wanted to see more footage and under water activities of many different types of whales.  Very information and interesting.,1368057600,2,265,4.739130434782608
5043990,5,B006ZYCH2E,"In this extraordinary, sometimes heart-stopping, documentary about the lives of whales and dolphins, the BBC's Nature show travels the world to photograph many species.  Underwater photographers Didier Moreau and Doug Allen dive among them to capture remarkable footage of these underwater mammals.

The first episode focuses on the courtship, mating, and parenthood of whales, although it also gives the viewer a glimpse of the blue whale's mysterious feeding off the coast of Sri Lanka.  We get up-close, underwater glimpses of the gentle orgy of the right whale and of the violent, aggressive chase of the humpback.  The second episode explores the higher level thought exhibited by these creatures.  From dolphins playing from bubble rings to highly evolved and group-specific hunting methods, the cleverness displayed is amazing.  The last episode concentrates on vocalizations used for communication, echolocation, and hunting.

The two-disc version comes with a regular DVD and a Blu-Ray one.  If you have a Blu-Ray player, take care to select the right disc because the photography is breathtaking, especially on a large-screen TV.  The advantage of having both formats is the ability to watch the documentary on both types of players.

The camera men risked their lives to shoot these images.  Because some species view air bubbles as a sign of aggression, the camera men often descend among them only with snorkels; one swipe of a massive tail could drown them.  In the Arctic, the extreme cold, even with scuba gear, gave the camera man mere minutes before hypothermia started to set in.  For viewers, their determination pays off in unforgettable footage.  In true Nature style. the narrative gives such detailed information that one cannot help but become more educated about these giant marine mammals.  If you have any interest in marine mammals or even animal behavior in general, this film will delight you.  I loved every minute.  Note:  I received a review copy of this DVD.

8507328,5,B006ZYCH2E,"The three episodes of this show are the best I've seen on the subject. I watched them on Netflix and wished there was more.
They contain:
1. Giant Lives: How the largest whales live, and why natural selection favored size.
2. Deep Thinkers: Looking at the intelligence of various whales and dolphins, both individually and working together to hunt.
3. Voice of the Sea: Explores both navigation and communication, and the potentials for our understanding.

Some other reviewers complained about the presence of the two cameramen in the videos, and I can see their point, but it didn't take away from the documentary to me. In a way, it seemed more respectful to the animals they were capturing on film, by showing the fear, love, and awe of the human animals visiting their homes.",1494288000,,780,4.82089552238806
8507329,1,B006ZYCH2E,This is probably the worst Animal documentary I've seen. BBC is usually really good and we own many of their discs but this one is terrible! No where on the listing or pkg does it say it's ALL about Sex! We turned it on as a family time showing and it's all about pictures of whale penis and actual animal sex. Not mating rituals which are in other shows but they keep saying SEX and PENIS and how big whale penis are and such! NOT A FAMILY TIME MOVIE!!!,1473292800,,454,4.112359550561798

8507331,3,B006ZYCH2E,"I see quite a few great reviews for this item and wanted to offer a more critical review. There are quite a few things that would surprise die hard BBC Earth fans. First, this is recorded in stereo, so if you are expecting an immersive experience with your home theater, you will be disappointed. Navigating the menu was also difficult as it would not respond to selecting ""episodes."" The only option is to play the disc from the beginning. While most Blu-ray players remember where you left off, if you were to take this over to a new player, you would need to play from the beginning and skip to your desired episode.

As far as the content goes, this is no David Attenborough documentary (although Stephen Fry's narration isn't bad by any means). There is a considerable amount of focus on those behind the camera vs. the subject of the documentary. You hear the names ""Doug Allen"" and ""Didier Noirot"" so often, you would think they are the ""Ocean Giants."" Their contributions to the documentary should come at the end of each episode (as in other BBC Earth films) or in a special features segment.

Even with these shortcomings, the overall production isn't bad, especially if you are particularly fond of ocean mammals. There is some great footage, albeit sandwiched between discussions of the cameramen about how they are feeling, which hurts the pacing of the film (and caused me to lose interest repeatedly). So, if you're a lover of cetaceans, this is probably a must-see, just don't expect the level of work you'll find in other BBC Earth films.",1461715200,6,1555,4.734317343173432
8507332,5,B006ZYCH2E,Fabulous program with incredible photography and information on all cetaceans.  I cannot recommend it highly enough to anyone interested in the oceans and their amazing mammal inhabitants.,1457481600,,188,5.962962962962963
8507333,5,B006ZYCH2E,"When it comes to nature documentaries, BBC EARTH collection tops it all. This is the best documentary about whales. Must see documentary. Bravo.",1449187200,,144,5.304347826086956
8507334,4,B006ZYCH2E,"This is a very entertaining and beautifully filmed documentary.  The blu ray picture quality really is amazing.

I deducted one star due to the fact that the menu would not work on my copy,  I could not get the player to select the individual segments,  I had to select play all and skip through all the scenes until the next program world start.  I own over 1500 DVDs and about 300 blu ray,  first time I have encountered this.",1423440000,2,428,4.3544303797468356
