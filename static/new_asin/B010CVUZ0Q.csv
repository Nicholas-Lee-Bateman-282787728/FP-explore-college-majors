7308936,5,B010CVUZ0Q,"Of course the Sun King is a direct reference to King Louis XIV of France, but I contend that the more apt comparison is with Napoleon Bonaparte.  Louis never conquered the world, but Napoleon came fairly close.  Louis was actually shorter than Napoleon, but due to differences between the lengths of the French and British inches and the fact that Napoleon was usually surrounded by exceptionally tall bodyguards, the myth that Napoleon was short is the one that has come down to us.  Finally, while both men had plenty of women, only Napoleon was truly in love with one woman and one woman only:

the Empress&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Josephine/dp/0345522834/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Josephine</a>, an unconventional woman, who was older than he was.

At the age of 15 Livius I is the ruler of his world, following a three-year campaign of conquest characterized by military brilliance and utter ruthlessness that began when he ascended to the throne after his mother's assassination.  You could say that the murder of his mother changed him, even unhinged him, but you'd better not say it in his presence.  Livius' victory has brought peace and prosperity to most peoples in most places, because (unlike Napoleon) he is about as competent at ruling as he is at conquering, but Livius is a little bit bored with peace.  He is never more alive than when he is dodging assassination attempts and calculating how to use them as excuses to justify crushing his remaining enemies, whether they had anything to do with it or not.

Somewhere in all of this the decision was made that it was time for Livius to marry, but as with everything else, cold, ruthless calculation was behind it, not love, and certainly not lust.  The far off (but not far enough off) Principality of Rain was told that if they wished to keep their autonomy, they must provide Livius with a bride from among the four royal daughters, all of whom possessed the royal family's traditional magical power of summoning rain, something that would be very useful in Livius' home country, the Sun Kingdom, an arid land Livius had already put considerable effort into building an irrigation system for.  Though generally accepting of the idea that it was the duty of at least the younger royal daughters to make advantageous marriages for their homeland, having heard nothing but bad things about Livius, no one was willing to volunteer for the job so the youngest, 17 year old Nike got the nod after losing a game of rock, paper, scissors.

As expected these two initially got along about as well as matter and antimatter (within minutes of meeting Livius, Nike gets herself thrown into prison to starve; she breaks out that night spouting threats to kill, fillet, and eat Livius), but gradually grow fond of each other as they begin to understand each other through various shared adventures that run the gamut from comical to deadly serious.  In the manga the story continues, but this is a pretty good place to end the anime, though I'd prefer to see more.

Note: This show is only subtitled in English. There is no English voice dubbing.",1446422400,4,3153,4.980952380952381
7308937,5,B010CVUZ0Q,Great story and artwork. The artwork could be little better. The story is bite child like story. I would like it to bite more grown up. The only other thing is the age different. I myself would like the boy to be older. Closer to the girl age!! I think the girl's would like this one more then the guy's.,1446249600,,304,4.083333333333333

Fantasy Shoujo is hard to find nowadays, especially a good one. Nike loses a bet to her sisters and must marry the Sun King, Livius. His short stature, temper, and clouded past are just some of the many obstacles that get in the way of their relationship. With Nike's power to bring rain to the Sun Kingdom, Livius must learn to not only see eye to eye with Nike, but to appreciate the world as it is.

For a short anime, it hits most of the right things. Romance, action, adventure, a beautiful soundtrack, great animation and very well done voice acting are some of the many things you can expect. There were a few parts where the characters would suddenly ramp up the drama due to misunderstandings, but at the end of the day, the anime was still very enjoyable to watch. It ends rather cheesily but considering what the show offers and how it tackles certain things, I was pretty accepting of the cheese in the last part of the final episode.

I really hope the manga gets a license. Still, I am so happy Sentai picked this up. Now I can have this gem in my collection. Give it a chance-it will definitely make you see the world in a different way.",1440633600,8,1240,4.477876106194691

7308942,5,B010CVUZ0Q,"I started this with questioning expectations, but it is absolutely magnificent.  So excited to watch this again, I had to pre-order it!  I am not fond of the age difference, but understanding their personalities and who they are is essential.  I think a lot of romances forget that.  If you like romance, please do yourself a favor and watch this.",1440028800,2,347,4.733333333333333
8722050,5,B010CVUZ0Q,It's a very interesting story. It was different than I expected but still very good. There's not a lot of action. This is definitely more of a girly anime=p,1527120000,,156,4.413793103448276
8722051,5,B010CVUZ0Q,"I wished thy did a dub for this series. I love this love story, it has action, drama, comedy, romance everything you want in an anime series. The manga is lovely as well.

8722054,5,B010CVUZ0Q,Wonderful Story. Love it. I just wish it was in English. You have to read it as it plays. But you get use to it. I have played it many times. It is a feel good movie with a great storyline. Beautiful art work throughout the move. Top quality production.,1489708800,,253,4.08

8722056,4,B010CVUZ0Q,"I love the anime. But ... I despise the yellow subtitles!  I have so many Sentai anime DVD's and I've never understood why they choose yellow for the color of the subtitles ... it's irritating. (;)  So again: great anime, great quality, but horrible subtitle color.",1461024000,,265,4.739130434782608

8722058,4,B010CVUZ0Q,"Good anime shoujo romance anime, which reminds me of Fushigi Yugi, but without the fights and reverse harem element. As most anime lack a proper ending, I would have to say The World Is Still Beautiful ending ends the series on a good note.",1453507200,,240,4.4772727272727275
8722059,5,B010CVUZ0Q,"Not a huge fan of this kind of stuff, and I didn't know how it would all workout BUT I really did enjoy it. Watched it on Hulu and fell In love with it. Great character development in the 12 episodes, and it's just a refreshing story that takes span of about 3 months? I think, but it was great. The music and singing is good too. Yes, there is singing but it's not like the Disney stuff . Had to buy this :) wish it was a novel",1452038400,,428,3.8202247191011236
