At the time of release, It was headlined as starring Stephen MacNally and Gail Russell (her final loan out on her
Paramount contract). But in point of fact it has no main lead as Richard Long and Charles Drake have as much screen time.
The subplots are familiar and forgettable (though well performed). It is the air sequences that make the film a bit of a lost gem.
some great stuff at Andrews Air Force base make up for any script problems.
Rock Hudson also has a nice little part (before he became a major star).",1487548800,,580,4.2342342342342345
