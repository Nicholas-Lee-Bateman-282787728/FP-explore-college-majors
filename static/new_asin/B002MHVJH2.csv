3952261,5,B002MHVJH2,"The GTO Anime is faithful to the manga as far as the events go, but the way some things happen and in what order they happen may have been changed. The anime is considerably cleaner than the manga as well.

Eikichi Onizuka, 22 years old, still a virgin, has just become a teacher at Holy Forest Academy, being assigned the problem class, who hates teachers, and he turned them around in less than a year. The anime is hilarious with countless shenanigans, and several references to other anime as well, my favorite being the 0080 reference. On a class trip, one student says ""We get room 0080,"" and another says ""Like War in the Pocket!"" which is a reference to Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket, and they proceed to geek out about Gundam. I myself haven't read all of the manga yet, and am still collecting them, but this manga is hilarious, as is the anime. It teaches many lessons, such as don't judge a person based on appearance, don't judge people based on background or profession, and that not all people are the same. Though Onizuka is a pervert and he first became a teacher trying to be close to high school girls, he does have a good heart, and restores class 4's faith in teachers and adults. I will say this though: This is not an anime for children. I recommend that the viewer be at least 16 years old, but that's just me. The manga goes on for a bit after the anime ends, as well as having a sequel and prequel, 14 Days in Shonan and GTO the Early Years, respectively. I highly recommend both the anime and the manga. One more thing: The man who plays Onizuka is none other than Steve Blum, who many of you many know as Spike from Cowboy Bebop, and Guilmon from Digimon Tamers.",1393804800,5,1691,4.368253968253968
3952262,5,B002MHVJH2,"This was a gift for my son, so I can not comment directly on this series.
However, I can tell you that he was very happy when he opened the box.
Each year for the holidays, I ask him to make a list of things he would like to have, both big and small items. Then I choose several from his list. What ever looks interesting to me, and what ever fits into my budget.
He did come to me later in the week after receiving this and thanked me again. He said that of the things he had listed this was on the top of his ""really want"" list.",1390262400,,530,3.827272727272727
3952263,3,B002MHVJH2,"Its an interesting series, but it looks as old as it is. The dub is basically just five people used over and over again making it kind of annoying. Also, their are some minor technical problems that will annoy some and others won't even notice at all. Its worth watching if you have read the manga otherwise their are other old anime worth looking into",1385683200,,352,4.430769230769231
3952264,5,B002MHVJH2,"GTO ran originally from 1999 to 2000.  It is dated.  That means it is old.  It means the character designs are different and look kinda crappy compared to today's standards.  The art is kinda crappy.  The voice acting is mediocre at best(both Japanese and English, though the English fails to even reach mediocre).  The animation is really crappy.  The video, crappy.

None of that matters though, at all.  What Great Teacher Onizuka is is a great story, with lots of humor that works, and a lot of heart.  Onizuki is a 22 year old ex-delinquent and mostly a failure.  How he becomes not just a success, but a great teacher is great fun to watch.  The humor is mostly slapstick and over the top, and it works great.  It somehow never gets old watching Onizuka accidentally destroy the vice principal Hiroshi Uchiyamada's beloved Toyota Cresta.

43 episodes on 7 DVDs in sturdy packaging, no frills, but a great value.  I really do not much care for older anime, but this one is well worth watching, and deserving of the term ""classic"".",1381968000,8,1035,4.640883977900552

3952266,5,B002MHVJH2,"I watched the GTO anime series before I watched the tv series. I felt that the TV series is not the same as the Anime though there are overlaps in characters. One needs to sit and watch this series with  a different set of eyes. It is a low budget production, but it is still very entertaining watching Onizuka's character come to life.",1336089600,2,336,4.333333333333333
3952267,5,B002MHVJH2,"At the time I write this, there is a seller trying to get $300 for this set claiming it is ""not an import"" and that it is ""rare"".

But this product was never released in the US, the only versions available in the US are imports from other countries.

The copy I have is 3 DVD, includes the entire live action series and sells as an import for less than $50.

Anyway, it's a good series, just don't let anyone try to trick you into buying it for hundreds of dollars claiming that this is not imported, even the picture he has up of the item is the import version.

3952268,5,B002MHVJH2,"Great Teacher Onizuka live action is one of the best series ever to come out of japan. it mostly follows the anime series, and the actors, especially mr. onizuka, are all very good. i personally liked the live action better than the anime. its really a shame their own company made lots of the movie for the US (also very good/same actor, see on amazon for $29) but there is only this one copy of the series i can find, and at a rediculous price at that. maybe if enough people pester Tokyo Shock/[...], Mr. [...] can have some healthy competition, and there can be more copies available, other than this copy and the bootleg i saw.",1265068800,6,632,4.410256410256411

8373904,4,B002MHVJH2,"Welcome to Holy Forest Academy, one of the most prestigious private schools in the country. On the surface, Holy Forest is a great place to further the students education but, in actuality, its a school overflowing with the most disrespectful troublemakers around, especially Class 3-4. Mrs. Sakurai, the director of Holy Forest doubling as the lunch lady, sees that the teachers are helpless against the outrageous antics of the students. Because of this, Mrs. Sakurai hires the most unorthodox teacher in history, a young man who stepped into her office after igniting a cross-city car chase with the police, and after she accepts him for the job, Mrs. Sakurai says of the upcoming school year, Im sure itll be very interesting, which turns out to be the biggest understatement in anime history. The person she hires is none other than the 22-year old explosion of a man Eikichi Onizuka.

What can be said about Onizuka that hasn't been said before? He is a teacher at Holy Forest that isn't the smartest guy around (you should see his resume in episode 2) but hes absolutely dedicated to helping his students succeed in life. Onizuka is not by any means a perfect human being (he is a former gang member that drinks, smokes, curses, womanizes, and pulls pranks, among other habits, with a passion) but he performs so many heroic feats that you cant help but believe in his legendary status. In episode 15, Onizuka single-handedly defeats a gang of kidnappers armed to the teeth and then he aced the infamous national exam while bleeding from a gunshot wound. During episode 22, in what remains my favorite Onizuka moment ever, animes greatest teacher speeds into a vacant school set to explode and saves a girl (as well as a really heavy organ) right before the building blows up. This series couldve been titled Great Janitor Onizuka or Great Truck Driver Onizuka (like in episode 2) and it would still be thrilling. With an award-worthy acting performance from Steve Blum, the immortal Onizuka remains the greatest teacher/ former gang member/ martial artist/ motorcyclist/ producer/ swimmer/ fugitive/ prankster ever.

Although the main setting of the series is at Holy Forest, a lot of screen time is devoted to other places, like the downtown area nearby the school (the streets look especially beautiful at night), the scenic countryside in Hakuba, and the gorgeous Okinawa Beach, as a few examples. Just like the consistent change in setting, the plot continuously shifts between episodic and progressive. Great Teacher Onizuka is a series with deep moments but its known for humorous scenes as well, like the famed Doraemon scene in episode 8, but my favorite is the scene where Onizuka thinks of double meanings when a fellow teacher tries to help him study in episode 14. A lot of hilarious moments occur when the series allows the characters imaginations to fly, like Onizuka in episode 17 or Vice Principal Uchiyamada in episode 24. Although GTO is 43 episodes long, the series maintains equal amounts of quality and quantity in its work, unlike a lot of other lengthy anime.

What really sets Great Teacher Onizuka apart from other anime is the amount of episodes in the series. Theres the pilot episode (who can forget The Wall scene?), the fourth episode (where Onizuka is framed in a career-threatening scandal), and episode 11 (the Phone Call scene is easily among the series most memorable), all three examples serving as great episodes in a lengthy list of them. Another aspect which really shines in GTO is the soundtrack, the majority of the series songs being blood-pumping rock tracks or beautifully Western-themed blues. The best song in the series has to be Shizuku, the second ending theme. While the singer unleashes a soulful voice full of emotion, while a pretty guitar piece plays, the series plays a bunch of clips from the anime with the focus on them being a part of Onizukas trip down memory lane. At first, the 2nd ending theme may look like a jumbled collection of random clips but, if you look closely at the outlines surrounding these clips and pay attention to every detail, you can see that the ending theme is telling a story, something that doesnt occur often with anime ending themes, and is (in my opinion) the best of its kind (I especially enjoy everything after the train flies by the screen). At this point, Im going to tell you what every GTO fan will say about this series. Great Teacher Onizuka is a heartwarming story similar to the Kevin James flick Here Comes the Boom, a story about a slacker of a teacher that, over time, builds a strong friendship with the students. Great Teacher Onizuka is an unforgettable show with more than its fair share of deep-thinking life lessons. Great Teacher Onizuka is the must-watch series for fans of slice-of-life and comedy. Above all else, Great Teacher Onizuka is a series that goes down in history as one of the Golden Age Classics in anime history. The end.

Now you're probably looking at the score I gave to GTO and you're saying Its cool and all that you really like this series but um why the 7, man? I normally don't make a big deal about animation and I know Great Teacher Onizuka is a fairly dated series but I have to take off points for the subpar graphics (The most glaring example is in the many exaggerated expressions Onizuka makes throughout the series. I know its for comical effect and everything but characters shouldnt be THAT UGLY). Then, theres the situation with the animes side characters. Azusa Fuyutsuki is the beautiful teacher that supported Onizuka since the beginning; she also views him as a role model that she aspires to be similar to (and, in episode 36, its revealed that Ms. Fuyutsuki has depressingly low self-worth). Urumi Kanzaki is the worst of the infamous Class 3-4 students, a prodigal heterochromatic blonde who ends up hanging around with Onizuka after a near-death experience. Kunio Murai is a fellow Class 3-4 student with a short temper and what Onizuka dubbed a mommy complex. The main issue with the side characters is that although they receive a considerable amount of depth, they're mostly stuck to commenting in awe of Onizukas latest feat (the only exception is Vice Principal Hiroshi Uchiyamada, a middle-aged man prone to hallucinations and violent outbursts who shined in three classic scenes in the series: the speech in the Gorilla vs. Police fight (Ep. 24), the Sunflower Scene (Ep. 41), and the speech against the Board of Education (Ep. 43)). The other big issue is that their screen time is incomprehensibly inconsistent, the characters sometimes vanishing for multiple episodes at a time. The most glaring example is the psychotic math teacher, who was by far the second most interesting character in the series before disappearing five episodes after he made his first major appearance (He earns a painfully brief cameo in the classic final episode). By no means is Great Teacher Onizuka the perfect series but I would highly recommend you check out GTO because of everything I just told you, especially episode 43 and the beautifully brilliant second ending theme. Again, Great Teacher Onizuka isn't perfect but it is definitely a classic.",1464048000,,7203,4.896805896805897
8373905,5,B002MHVJH2,Looking forward to watching this. It is great to see that the dub is still by tokyopop. Awesome.,1444348800,,96,4.388888888888889
8373906,5,B002MHVJH2,This is my favorite comedy of all time,1437004800,,38,3.875
8373907,5,B002MHVJH2,"Most people who search for this already know what this show is about. But for those just browsing or interested in a change of pace in anime, this is a great old show.

The dvd version has english subtitles and japanese audio. The case is thick and contains 5 or 6 dvds. Very good transcoding job. The animation is just old so don't expect it to look like anything 2008+.

This is basically a show about a young punk who becomes a teacher at an affluent school. Though the faculty and class he is assigned to teach largely dislike him for his brashness, unorthodox teaching methods, it is very apparent he cares deeply about all his students and wants to teach them the meaning of being good human beings. Make no mistake, Onizuka is not perfect. He is a man-child who is just as immature and explosive as the students he teaches. But when he has solemn moments, they are powerful and heartfelt. While the show is a comedy, has a lot of slapstick and is has a lot of in-your-face antics, it's a nice change of pace from other anime. There are no major sensual elements in this genre. It's not a harem anime. It's a pretty honest and clean anime.",1434844800,5,1145,4.39622641509434
