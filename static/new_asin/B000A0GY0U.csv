8071409,2,B000A0GY0U,"I purchased this DVD so I could enjoy this early '90s program again -- oops!  The 4-DVD package has only about 8 episodes of the original program as it was broadcast and the rest are episodes of a spin-off of Second Chances.  Most of the episodes of the original show were fun to watch, but I was disappointed that most of the original characters disappear about halfway through the series with little, if any, explanation.  J-Lo is in all 16 episodes and as enchanting as she is, she alone could not carry the story lines created for the other characters.  Speaking of story lines, it seemed as if the writers gave up about half way through and phoned it in for the rest of the program. Second Chances had plenty of promise and the plot lines could have been concluded in a variety of ways, but the only direction the producers took this show was down-down-down.",1265673600,6,863,4.512820512820513
