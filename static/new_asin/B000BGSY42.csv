Her boyfriend Johnny has a scheme. Kitty asks Chris to pay for a studio apartment. Are Chris pictures worth money? Will this all lead to murder?

The Stranger (1946) is the story about a hunt for a Nazi war criminal who has take refuge in a small college town. The background tells about college life then. Could a wanted Nazi become part of the faculty of this college? [No background checks?] Some parts seem implausible, but its still a good story.

8086599,5,B000BGSY42,"I bought tis for ""The Stranger"".  E.G. Robinson gives a great performance, very low-key.  Unfortunately, in scenes with Loretta Young, she comes off as overacting.  Had she played the scene WITH him, it would have been much better.  She wasn't very good with ensemble acting, apparently.  Anyway, it's worth it just for Mr. Robinson's performance.  A-Plus, as usual!!!  A great actor!!",1414627200,,385,5.213114754098361

8086601,5,B000BGSY42,"I am a huge fan of Edward G.'s, so I admit I'm biased.  However, ""Scarlet Street"" is one of the finest examples of film noir I've ever seen.  The camera work is extremely clever, using mirrors to reflect images that would not otherwise be seen if shot head on.  It certainly gives the viewer a different perspective.  There is a great story line here, and lots of suspense.  ""The Stranger"" is a suspenseful war crime story with Edward G. Robinson playing a ""Nazi hunter"".  In my opinion, this is a great buy.",1239580800,,508,4.467391304347826
