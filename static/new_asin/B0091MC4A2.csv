8534347,3,B0091MC4A2,Niagara Falls is one of my favorite tourist attractions. See it in eye-popping 3D. I would like more options such as a night view with the lights on.,1400630400,,149,4.357142857142857
8534348,1,B0091MC4A2,"I thought to save a trip to Niagra Falls by purchasing a 3D blu ray. Well, if it was made by IMax, my thought would be right. This DVD was filmed by somebody less than amature, what is the term for that?
  Here is the impression after I watched the DVD (most part I used fast forward). The video is 75 mins long. Divided by 15, then it is 5. There are total of 5 scenes there because of this. Look like the cameraman shot the scenes like fishing: drop the fishing rod, go buy a cup of coffee, then come back in 15 mins. Hence you have 5 scenes to watch. If you take out your 3D glasses, you see slightly double images. The offset between the two images is very small. Have watched many 3D movies, you'll notice that the bigger the offset, the closer of the scene in front of you. The two images will be together at the infinity. In other words, there is almost no 3d effect. There is no narration, just some background music.
  You don't need to buy a 3D dvd like that. You can look for 5 scenes from internet, then duplicate them and put together to make 3d. The producer has no respect to viewer's time and effort. I have benefited from Amazon for long time, just want to share with fellow customers and amazon. Don't buy this junk DVD, don't fall victim to this DVD.",1357948800,2,1269,4.16734693877551
