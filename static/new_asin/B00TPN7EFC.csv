8702617,2,B00TPN7EFC,"This kind of low budget obnoxious and entirely uninspiring and uninformative fluff is what is used to fill the surfeit of channels available through cable. I do watch it once in a while because I like aquaria  but my method is to record it and fast forward to the final 3 or 4 minutes of the episode- unless you want to see seemingly endless juvenile highschool-level humor you won't be missing anything. Lastly, I don't think that the owners of the company apply nearly enough attention to the well-being of the aquatic animals, except to endure they don't die too soon. While many freshwater tropical fish sold for the aquarium trade are bred here, most marine specimens are harvested from the sea and the process is very wasteful ( I have read that for every exported fish which makes it into an aquarium alive several died along the way) and is resulting in depleted fish populations and badly damaged reefs. Thus, I wish more of their aquaria were freshwater instead of marine. This crappy production skips over all of these very inconvenient details. They do make some nice tanks, though, and once in a while I will watch the last few minutes of an episode.",1503100800,,1163,4.673170731707317
