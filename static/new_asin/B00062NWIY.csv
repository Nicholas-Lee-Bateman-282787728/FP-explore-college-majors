8039211,3,B00062NWIY,"This is a fun little DVD. If you have already seen Prison Of The Dead, The Killer Eye and Totem, go ahead and skip this as they are the movies that are contained on this disc. Otherwise, if you in for some super-cheap, low budget entertainment or are a diehard Full Moon fan, I highly recommend this!",1224547200,,300,4.280701754385965
