4517151,5,B0050P3XN6,Excellent quality dvd of this 1964 movie. I saw this movie when was I teen and have been hoping the movie would eventually come out in dvd format. It was worth the wait. Totally different from the book but the movie is very good. Can't go wrong with Glen Ford.,1334016000,3,260,4.22

4517153,4,B0050P3XN6,"The other reviews previously posted pretty well describe the film itself.
It has a very good cast, Rod Taylor is great as the sometimes misunderstood pilot Jack Savage. Glenn Ford is fine as his usual scowling self.
I also enjoyed Wally Cox and Nermiah Persoff's performances as a former crewmate of Savage, and an airline rival of McBain, repectively.
The script gets a bit overblown at times, but it holds-up much better than many similarly-themed films of the era (The High and the Mighty and Ceiling Zero, to name two).
The flashback technique works very well, and is effective in showing you the sides of Savage his detractors missed.

About this product, it has great picture and sound quality. It was a real pleasure to finaly see the film in wide screen.
Extra features are limited to the trailer and isolated audio track, which finally lets you hear Jerry Goldsmith's haunting theme played by piano in the bar scene.
There is also a well-written apreciation of the film included in the well-illustrated DVD case (including some color promotional photos).

Well done to the DVD producers! It was well worth the wait.",1328832000,,1124,4.87958115183246
4517154,4,B0050P3XN6,"This ""Fate is the Hunter"" is an excellent what-done-it movie from 1964.  It uses flashbacks to flesh out the personality of one of the main characters (deceased near the begining of the movie).  The acting is pretty good too.",1326499200,,225,4.743589743589744
4517155,5,B0050P3XN6,"This story is nothing like the book, but is really good in it's own right. I enjoyed it as much now, as I did the first time I saw it , many years ago. I have been waiting for it to come out on DVD, and my patience was finally rewarded.",1319760000,3,237,3.6666666666666665
4517156,3,B0050P3XN6,Fate is the Hunter is one of those movies I remember watching as a teen in the late 60's and really enjoying the twists and especially the way they recreate the accident at the end of the film.

4517157,4,B0050P3XN6,"I think this is a very good picture, almost a documentary about a plane crash in the early sixties. If the model used in the film is not very convincing ( it looks like a DC7 with jet engines mounted on the tail!) Glenn FORD is perfect, so is the rest of the cast, the most annoying thing being the constant flashbacks 20 years before. This Twilight Time DVD has a very crisp transfer, the CinemaScope frame in black and white, filmed by the great Milton KRASNER is stunning. There is a music and effects track as well, to appreciate Jerry GOLDSMITH score (not a very long one) The amusing fact is that the FOX Fanfare on this track is in stereo, when it sounds mono in the edited film.",1309478400,16,686,4.2846153846153845
4517158,2,B0050P3XN6,"I saw this many years ago and had fond memories of it. When I finally got a chance to buy the DVD and see it again, I was somewhat disappointed. The opening and closing scenes are really dramatic, but a lot of the rest is pretty bad. I understand they were trying to cope with a book of the same name that was actually kind of impossible to translate to the screen (great non-fiction book by the way, same name as the movie, author Ernest K. Gann).

Nevertheless some really good actors give some bad performances here, and some of the lines poor Glenn Ford has to say are laughable.

So, *sigh*, another childhood memory bites the dust. If you want to see a really good movie with a similar theme, see ""No Highway in the Sky"", also based on a great book (fiction in this case).",1308614400,3,778,4.285714285714286

4517160,5,B0050P3XN6,"Very loosely based on the book by international flying and sailing expert, Ernest K. Gann, Fate is the Hunter has finally been captured on dvd in a pristine format with excellent, distortion-free video and audio components - the audio track is captured separately as an extra feature.  The story follows the character of Jack Savage - playboy, adventurer, and a seat-of-the-pants pilot - ably portrayed by the venerable Rod Taylor.  Following a fatal passenger plane crash in which the tragic pilot is singled out as the cause, the story is told in a series of flashbacks that attempt to restore the unfortunate and voiceless victim.  Saddled with the investigation and the ultimate reconstruction of the crash, is airline executive Sam McBane, wonderfully and capably played by Glenn Ford.  McBane flew with Savage in the past and understands his complex character - he knows that Savage was a man of compassion - who wanted to help and not hurt.

As the dead pilot is continually villified via media crucifixtion, we are introduced to the many people who interacted with him.  Wally Cox, Suzanne Pleshette, Nehemiah Persoff, Nancy Kwan, Dorothy Malone, Mark Stevens, Robert F. Simon, Robert J. Wilke, Jane Russell, and a stand-up cast of some of the finest character actors in Hollywood help to make this semi-documentary as real as the headlines.  Passenger aviation had reached an apex in the mid-sixties - the demand for air travel had reached a tipping point and the new jet technology was venturing into areas that were fraught with unforgiving situations - each crash provided information that was part of a continuing evolution of hard and costly lessons that have slowly led to one of the safest modes of transportation.

In a form of life imitating art, the crash of a twin-engined 737-400 in Kegworth, England in 1989 - Flight 92 - involved the misidentification of a malfunctioning engine - the crew decided to shut off the fully functioning engine - the aircraft subsequently crashed with a tragic loss of life.  In 2009, U.S. Airways Flight 1549 sustained bird strikes rendering both engines inoperable.  The flight crew, led by Captain Chesley Sullenberger III, made split second decisions that ended with the unpowered aircraft gliding into the Hudson River without a loss of life.

As an accident reconstructionist, I can say that this movie and ""No Highway in the Sky"" were factors in my early interest in crash interpretation and analysis.  And, yes - it's easy to speculate that the dead operator was the sole cause of an accident - but proper reconstruction techniques allow for highly advanced evaluations of causal factors. While attending a seminar at the NTSB Training Center in Ashburn, Virginia, I finally decided to take a tour of the TWA Flight 800 remains that are sequestered in the basement/hanger. 230 passengers and crew perished in that controversial disaster in 1996. As I solemnly examined the elaborate patch-work reconstruction of the fuselage, I couldn't help but think back to ""Fate is the Hunter"".

It is welcome to see Twilight Time enter the DVD production world.  I hope to see many wonderful and exciting new titles that have been here-to-for unavailable.",1305676800,59,3202,5.0397727272727275

Probably a little known movie of the '60s, but one which heralded the future coming of more ""air tragedies"" (i.e., 1970s ""Airport"", etc.).  It embraced (important to the story-line) two points-of-interest during those days of early commercial jet aviation - focusing-in on the ""retired life"" of former US Air Force pilots (WW-2 & Korea), who now fly commercially; and those conflicts they faced with the real confrontation experienced with aircraft manufacturers' and their adopted attitude (toward aircraft engineered safety) of ""fly until failure"".  A well played ""suspencer"" by leads Glenn Ford and Rod Taylor with accompaniments by Suzanne Pleshette, Nancy Kwan, ""Mr. Peepers"" (Wally Cox), and Mark Stevens (note: unaccredited cameo, Dorothy Malone ??).  Although you'd figure the ""good guy"" would bring ""it all"" to a favorable conclusion - not ""pilot error"" - the trip along the story-line was captivating and enjoyable.

I'd recommend this DVD to any military oriented individuals and, equally, those who enjoy the ""white knuckle"" experiences of such ""flicks"" of ""Airport"", et al.",1399507200,2,1195,5.443243243243243
4517173,3,B0050P3XN6,"Fate is the Hunter- the book- is excellent, but it would be very difficult to make into a movie, as evidenced by this one.  The book dealt with Earnest Gann flying DC-2 and DC-3 airplanes for American Airlines.

This movie is set in the early jet age and if you know anything about airplanes, or airlines, then you're going to be sitting through this thing commenting on the errors within.  For instance, the airplane:  It's a DC-7 made to look like a jet, with the engines mounted beneath the horizontal stabilizer.  A real airplane built like that would be so tail heavy that if it did manage to take off it would climb almost vertically, stall and then crash.  Another mistake is after the engines quit on the first flight, the airplane still has interior lighting and landing lights.  At the end of the movie, during the re-enactment of the fatal crash, the flight crew manages to start and engine that has just had a fire bottle pulled on it.

I like Nancy Kwan, but she's a lousy actress.  The others do well, but have little to work with.

Younger people will be able to see Mr. Peepers as not being Mr. Peepers, and Nancy Kwan not singing about how much she likes being a girl, The planes look a little funny, probably because none of manufacturers would want their planes to be depicted in a crash.",1387929600,,672,4.42741935483871

4517178,4,B0050P3XN6,"Imperfect, and not even remotely true to Gann's aviation classic upon
which it is purportedly based, Fate is the Hunter is nonetheless a fine
and compelling film.

Essentially a character study and technological ""whodunnit"", an airline
executive strives to exonerate the pilot after a deadly airliner crash.
While some minor spoiler to this review, I will not give away the big
surprise behind the cause of the accident.

But there is some interesting speculation about the peculiar-looking
airliner central to the movie. A modern jetliner (of its time) that
resembled nothing in aviation. Why did they take a DC-6 and replace the
wings, modify the nose and tail and stick on prosthetic jet engines -
when they could have just as readily used off-the-shelf models and real
aircraft, at lesser cost?

The answer lies in the accident and nature of its cause. No aircraft
company - Boeing, Douglas, Lockheed, BAC, etc, wold put up with having
their aircraft associated with such a story. The airliner had to be
completely fictional.",1379116800,,1029,5.041176470588235

4517182,5,B0050P3XN6,"Fate Is the Hunter is a movie about character  personal ethos.  In terms of plot, Fate Is the Hunter is the story of an airline executive and former pilot who must investigate a disaster, in which a cockpit crew (and many passengers) were killed.  The dead pilot is someone with whom the executive had dealt since their service together in the military, someone whom he regarded as an inconsiderate, self-centered jerk.  Many, including the management of the firm, are increasingly looking to blame that pilot for the crash.  But the executive wants the truth, and his investigation makes him ever more reluctant to blame the pilot.  The executive brings his career to a crisis, but finds his way to the truth.

I saw this movie many years ago, and thought it moving and remarkable.  And then  it just fell away.  It wasn't shown on television; when the home video market developed, I didn't find it offered on VHS or (later) on DVD (except when pirated).

Every now and then, I'd mention it to someone else who'd also at sometime seen it, and his or her reaction would almost always be similar  it stuck with us, and we didn't know why it had been unavailable.

I guess that, at some point, some of the people with such a reaction got themselves in a position to do something substantial about that, because, well, here it is.  Those people have my thanks.",1372204800,4,1357,4.623430962343096

A personal comment :

  I've been pronounced dead twice by doctors and came back, was paralyzed in a car accident and came back from it, have almost died twice from pneumonia and came back from nearly dying and I firmly believe in the fact that something things are destined to be and are immutable yet others can be changed by our decisions or the decisions and actions of others. I also firmly believe that we all choose the paths that we take in this life but that there are alternate timelines. I've also had experiences that allowed me to look into the past on 3 separate occasions. My Mother and I are both psychic. She's very intuitive and knows when people in our family are ill, even when they're thousands of miles away. Myself, I know when events are going to happen but can't quite put my finger on it. Her skills are more attuned to it than I am. But I have had the spirits of relatives, friends and pets come back to me as has she. Our lives do not just stop when we die but continue on some plane. In other realities, I'm not alive. In others, I finished law school went into the Air Force, etc. My current home is haunted by several pets who periodically show that they still know how much I miss them.

  That's what this movie is all about. A series of events that happen, some trivial in nature but all leading up to a disaster, yet could not be avoided because it was meant to be by the hand of fate.

 I saw this movie in the theatre when it came out on first run. It used to be on tv a lot then suddenly nothing.

 Fate is STILL moving its long hand, thus this comment from Film Score Monthly :

  Posted:  Jan 5, 2011 - 5:15 PM
  By:  George Komar  (Member)

FATE IS THE HUNTER is fairly ridiculous in it's aviation aspects, despite being based on (a small part of) a novel by Ernest K. Gann who wrote ISLAND IN THE SKY and THE HIGH AND THE MIGHTY, yet it works on an emotional level because of the hard working cast and Goldsmith's spare, mournful score...

Ridiculous was the word I used when I thought about the film's premise last night... only to wake up to the news -- equally ridiculous -- that spilled coffee forced a United Airlines jet to make an emergency landing -- in the year 2011, some 47 years after the film's release.

Goldsmith also scored the music for another of Gann's literary works: MASADA (based on Gann's ""The Antagonists"").

 I give the film 5 stars but only rank this release 4 stars because of the excessive price, just like when M Squad came out for $ 79.95 which was /is also outrageous. The price has dropped considerably since then.

Its one of the lost air disaster type films which backtracks to find out what happened when all of the people on the plane are dead save one.

I've had a copy I got on Ebay from its running on the Mystery channel years ago.

A great cast, an interesting score ( which is now available on cd by the great Jerry Goldsmith ) and a film which everyone should see just once if you want to get some idea of how they reconstruct aircraft after a crash and how they try to determine who's at fault, but all too often they try to blame it on dead pilots.

I just wish the price wasn't so expensive. But I will be getting this one as soon as I can.

The character actors in this film are worth it just for that if nothing else.

And you get to see Wally Cox without his glasses and looking incredibly young too !

:)

And Suzanne Pleshette who was also so sexy and is missed as are many in the cast including Ford, Persoff, Cox, Stanley Adams ( if memory serves, he played the trader in OST : The Trouble With Tribbles.

Now if they'd only release Rod Taylor's Travis McGee film Darker Than Amber on DVD, which has probably the bloodiest fight scene in film history and one where both actors injured themselves in filming it and the villain in the piece actually broke his leg !",1367798400,4,4282,4.260869565217392

A few years ago I looked for it on DVD but couldn't find it, then I checked again a few weeks ago and there it was - for $60.  Not too many movies I'd spend $60 on, but this is one of them.  The transfer and sound quality are excellent, and the movie stands up well these many decades later.  I still wonder about a commercial jet with the engines mounted on the horizontal stabilizers (as opposed to the fuselage like the DC-9, 727, etc.); maybe there was one like that but I've never seen it.  But that's a minor matter.  The plot is great, as are the characters, especially Suzanne Pleshette - you can see on her face in that critical moment that she's certain she survived one plane crash only to die in a recreation of that crash.

Ernest Gann's theory that sometimes Fate is the Hunter. Put in the

Rod Taylor has always been one of my favorite actors from that era,(and still is), this movie stands it's ground against new Hollywood, all day long. It was great to see this again...even though it is alleged that the other guy held racist views. but, considering over half of Hollywood probably had the same views back then...hell, probably still does, I refuse to let stupidity ruin my enjoyment of a classic. BTW...Nancy Kwan was HOT!!! LOL!!!",1358035200,,477,4.829268292682927
4517196,5,B0050P3XN6,"this is one of my favorite air crash stories. it's an older b/w movie with glenn ford and a host of fine character actors. that final scene is still riveting even when you know what is going to happening, the reaction of the stewardess (the lone survivor of the original crash) when she realizes everything is starting to happen all over again is chilling. overall, just a really fine job of hollywood professionalism.",1354233600,,418,4.739726027397261
4517197,5,B0050P3XN6,"For the times I consider this movie to be one of the best misteries of it's day. Unlike many diasters where at the end it happens, this one starts out that way, and than begines the human angle. Glen ford and rod taylor are at there best, and the ending ranks with some of the best thrillers.",1352246400,,292,4.140350877192983
4517198,5,B0050P3XN6,"What a great old aviation flick!  This was one of my favorite ""late show"" movies (back before 24-hour cable/satellite TV when only 1 or 2 stations in your ""viewing area"" stayed on until 2 or 3 a.m.--anybody remember 'test patterns'??).  It's about time this one came out on DVD!  A definite ""must have"" for any hard core aviation movie buff!",1346803200,3,341,4.65
4517199,1,B0050P3XN6,This DVD was disappointing as it had neiter Closed Captioning nor Sub Titles. For a senior citizen like myself a DVD without Closed Casptoning or Sub Titles is worthless.,1343606400,6,170,4.896551724137931
4517200,5,B0050P3XN6,"I enjoyed this movie years ago, but it dissappeared from view.  The casting is great with lots of familiar faces from the sixties.  The story zips along as a group of investigators try to determine the cause of a horrific plane crash.  Was there error, deliberate fault or is it more subtle that that.  Is there synchronicity in events that lead to an inevitable outcome?  Can a person maintain faith in the ability of another when all else says otherwise.  This is a detective story of sorts. First, what caused the crash of the airliner?  It is also an investigation into the personal relationships of a group of people.  It looks at he biases both good and bad that we hold a d challenges them.  The title says it all though.  Fate is a hunter that will not be denied.",1334966400,,771,4.442857142857143

Then I had not heard of the movie at all for years, but never forgot it.  I was really glad to find it available once again.  It is somewhat dated by today's standards, but personally I enjoyed it very much.  Thank You...",1477958400,,353,4.043478260869565
