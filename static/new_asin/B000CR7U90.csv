2470476,5,B000CR7U90,"This DVD presents in detail a two hundred years' old way of fishing that is largely unknown or dismissed here in the United States.  If the instructions are followed, the viewer will find a very active, engaging and effective method of fishing.  There is no staring at an indicator,  no split shot to weigh down the line, and no ""matching the hatch.""  Instead we learn how to add life and motion to a cast of three flies presented upstream, or across, or downstream.  Much of the presentation imitates the rise to the surface of many trout food items.  The effects are amazing, as I have caught more fish with more fun this way than any other method of fly fishing I have used.  It works on small streams when you adjust the number of flies and presentation to a small stream's currents.  It works on big rivers (e.g. the North Platte in Wyoming, where the method produces dozens of  big beautiful fish).  I haven't tried it on stillwater, but it's worked in the UK stillwaters for centuries. I plan to try this for Great Lakes tributary steelhead fishing, adjusting the size of flies and depth of presentation to catch these beauties. I have fly fished for 8 years and am intermediate in ability. Dave Whitlock described this method in a great article in Fly Fisherman magazine this past summer.  This is a must buy DVD, unless you really enjoy staring at an indicator all day and missing the beautiful scenery around you!",1321920000,4,1423,4.607142857142857
2470477,5,B000CR7U90,"I think the third or fourth fly tying thread I purchased was a Pearsall's silk in orange.  I was immediately drawn to the minimal beauty of a North Country Spider and loved the buggy look of the wet-fly patterns.  I found some books by Leisenring and Nemes and read them.  But I could never really understand how a wet fly was supposed to be fished.  I thought I understood, but I didn't.  But I've always been curious and I keep searching.

I bought this DVD with some trepidation.  It lacks pretension in its packaging, location, etc - it frankly looked a little suspect to my eyes which have become trained to associate those qualities with Bass Masters or something.  Which I now see is telling of how I thought about wet fly fishing (the more backwoods style, less precise, etc).  Even with my suspicions, I watched it as soon as it arrived.  It sheds light on an ENTIRE method of fishing that most contemporary anglers do not even remotely understand.  If you have an open mind and are curious about this time-honored way to fish, buy it.  You won't be disappointed.  Davy Wotton is smart, talented and about as eccentric as they come.  He communicates clearly and with an ease that conveys a real mastery of the material.  Our companion on the adventure, a Florida guide, is a proxy for ourselves as the new angler to the method.  To my eyes, even he started off a bit disapproving and was won over in the end.  Interesting.  This is a lot of material, unfamiliar material, from the tactics to fly selection to tackle to strategy.  I'll certainly be watching it again, and this time with a notepad on hand.

And while I'm at it, for a look at the way we strive to fish dries, read A Modern Dry Fly Code by Marinaro.  The two systems could not be further apart.  And each are beautiful and catch fish like hell.  Why one approach won out over the other is a question for the historians.",1321228800,4,1892,4.451895043731779
2470478,4,B000CR7U90,"A o.k. dvd lots of info ,so far hasn't produce anymore of a catch rate for me, knot tying very good. My rivers here are a little smaller than the dvd one so maybe some ways don't work very well.",1178668800,3,194,3.875
2470479,4,B000CR7U90,"Generally, I'm not given to flowery oratory about video products. To be sure I have my favorites just like anybody else. But in the case of Mr. Wotton's offering I must say it is a very well done product. The camera work is very good to excellent. The backdrops and riverine scenery are wonderful! The commentary and technical discussions will be of help to just about anyone who has an interest in expanding their knowledge of fly fishing and particular aspects of this wonderful pass time. There is much to be learned here but the almost textbook chapter format of the video lends itself well to constant referencing of a particular subject or technique. For my part I'm very glad I stumbled across this very well done tutorial. Thank you.",1168300800,7,741,4.707692307692308
