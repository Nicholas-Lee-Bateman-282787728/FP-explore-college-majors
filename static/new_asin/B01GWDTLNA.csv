8764091,3,B01GWDTLNA,"If you like old spaghetti westerns of the 60's and 70's, this is worth a watch. It moves along at a good pace and has plenty of good gun action. The obligatory romance is sudden and underdeveloped, but at least they don't dwell on it much. The story is really about three men, including our hero, who are not who appear to be. You have the bounty hunter turned sheriff, the cattle rancher who's trying to run all the farmers off their lands, and the old bandit who is now a reformed farmer. Anthony Steffen and Frank Wolff are particularly good in this. Not exceptional or mind-blowing, but a good, solid western.",1493164800,,613,4.482142857142857
8764092,3,B01GWDTLNA,"This is another Django film that was made in the 60's, there's probably hundreds of them out there. Not many stand out, it's just average. If you like Westerns you can pick this out, it won't matter.",1395878400,,199,4.405405405405405
