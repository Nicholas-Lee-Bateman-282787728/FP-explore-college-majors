8046315,4,B00079RC1O,"The DVD has two people, a man and a woman speaking the words/phrases slowly and normally.  I like the way they do this so you can learn how to pronounce the words then learn how to say the words/phrases faster, like normal conversation.

There were quite a few useful words/phrases, but I would've liked it to teach me more menu items.  Right now, all I can order is water, coffee, beer and wine.  I have no idea what the words for fish, chicken or beef look or sound like, but if I see those words, I can probably figure out how to pronounce them. I would recommend this DVD.",1125792000,9,576,4.256880733944954
8046316,5,B00079RC1O,"Excellent for travelers or for learning the basics of conversational Brazilian Portuguese when you do not have access to a formal class.  I homeschool my daughter and am using the DVD to introduce my 8-year old to Portuguese.  I plan to buy the other languages in the series as well.  Although there are some excellent software programs for learning or teaching Portuguese, this is the only DVD or video I have found -- with the exception of Bilingual Baby, which is clearly geared to toddlers and teaches only basic vocabulary.  I am delighted to find this series!",1122163200,9,565,4.793814432989691
