812821,5,6304252137,"I have watched this movie about a zillion times, I really love it! I saw it at the video store one day and could not resist, Tim Roth is one of my favorites and he is so great in all his films, and very sexy and sensitive in this one. Most films Roth is in, he usually plays villains, he seems to able to tap into that very well. This film has a rather dark story and Julia Ormond is a dentist and had recently split from her husband who was cheating, she works at the prison Roth is finishing up his sentence in. They begin a very intense romance until things start to get complicated! Don't pass this movie up, british films are far better!!",998006400,12,643,4.111111111111111
812822,5,6304252137,"If you're a fan of Tim Roth (like I am - I think he's the greatest actor ever) or Julia Ormond, or if you're someone who enjoys a great romantic (not to mention, sexy) thriller, then you mustn't miss this movie!
The  chemistry between the 2 leads ie. Rachel (Ormond), the dentist and Philip  (Roth), the convict, is absolutely excellent, beautiful to watch and very  convincing. This movie projects such a good feeling in me - it's so tender  and sweet to see the beauty and depth of the love that Rachel and Philip  has for each other, and the extend they're willing to go just so the other  doesn't get hurt.
I simply love this movie and highly recommend it. The  ending's a happy one - TRUE LOVE RULES!
Oh, check out the beautiful  tattoos on Roth's arm and hand (they're REAL).",953856000,7,781,4.4125874125874125
812823,4,6304252137,Ormand and Roth have wonderful chemistry in this tale of love against all odds. One of the most erotically charged films I have ever seen. The anguish and longing the actors convey through their eyes alone is  breathtaking. A movie for all true romantics!,945907200,2,255,4.795454545454546
812824,5,6304252137,I had never heard of this movie until I had attempted to rent another movie and I came home with this by accident.  I decided to watch it and was tremendously suprised in its quality.  The relationship between Roth and  Ormond is something we can all hope and strive for.,934675200,,271,4.38
812825,5,6304252137,"If you're in the mood for raw, brutal emotion this is it.  Superbly acted story of the desperation of loneliness and the  lengths one will go to  for passion.  BEAUTIFUL!  Buy it, watch it.  One of my Top Ten films of all  time.",916099200,5,228,4.162790697674419
813000,3,6304252137,"Despite your love of Tim Roth avoid this borefest. It's predictable, characters running in and out acting strange without explanation. Anyone could have done Roth's job, he brought nothing to the table. As a result the film falls flat on it's face.",1252886400,,248,4.928571428571429
813001,5,6304252137,"Let me disagree with the statement that movie makes it look like it's a justifiable homicide. I think what the movie does excellently is revealing and developing Roth's character - and he is obviously not a ""common"" criminal. He is what we might call a normal man who happens to feel perhaps more deeply/strongly than some and that makes him react the way he did to his wife's affair. He is shown to have a had a normal life once, with a normal job of ""wiring and rewiring houses"" - a person who just happened to make a critical mistake, a wrong turn you might call it. He is not a violent man yet he has to learn to defend himself in the environment he found himself in - that's shown so well in the scene with the two ""pillow case"" attackers (what do they say about prisons actually making people worse than they used to be? it's all the environment). I think the movie shows that not everything can be called black and white, good or bad, but things in real life are more complicated, people are complicated creatures, they make mistakes.

I almost agreed with you that Phillip is not shown with enough caring for Rachel's well-being, safety and right to know the character of the man she is with. Yes, sometimes when I watched the scene where he gives her a hug in the university, I thought - come on, man, is that really all the support you can offer your woman, a shoulder to cry on? But then again I think the movie attempts to show just that - he is not the perfect man, a knight on a white horse, he is a broken man who found his life took an unexpected turn and brought him where he never expected to be, an environment of gangsters, murderers, rapists. So he is deeply vulnerable and in a way powerless - he doesn't have the outside-of-prison connections like Towler does because was never from that environment. Remember the scene when he hangs up making it look like they got disconnected, how he knocks on the phone stand revealing utter nervousness - ""vulnerable"" is written all over that. So again I think the movie does an unbelivable job of showing the depths of the character, never black and white.",1234310400,4,2118,4.41687979539642
813002,5,6304252137,"I've been watching this movie for years and enjoy it as much each time I watch it. It is definitely a keeper. I would love to entertain Roth in a john somewhere, or anywhere for that matter. And Ormond, beautiful and awesome to watch. Both did consummate jobs of this movie.",1190419200,2,274,4.392156862745098
813003,5,6304252137,"I was inspired to write because I like this actor SO much. The movie's script may seem improbable (jail dentist having affair with inmate)but who really knows...certainly the acting ability of the leads (Julia Ormand and Tim Roth)convinced me that the characters were destined for each other. The depiction of life inside, people's motivations, both good and bad seemed very realistic and thought provoking. I liked to see at least one movie that doesn't equate criminality with being evil or insane....sometimes it's just the bad, stupid actions or mistakes that good people make. Yes he committed the crime but he is paying for it. Also, I'm a hopeless romantic and the movie indulged me, e.g. the sex scenes were incredibly erotic and Tim Roth is my ideal of a man with intelligent sex appeal. I believe this movie would appeal to both sexes for different reasons.",1122508800,5,867,4.945205479452055
813004,4,6304252137,"I first saw this film about two years ago but did not think much of it. I watched it again when it was broadcast late at night. How my opinion has changed. I found the relationship between Ormond and Roth beautiful, amist the cold and starkness of prison life. The contrast is what makes the love story different to many others around. The love and chemistry that bloomed between these two lonely people is what makes the film so compeling to watch. Both characters come from very different backgrounds with one thing in common; their devotion and seemingly true emotions for eachother. A great cast and script (especially the conclusion) pull at the heartstrings of the viewer. This proves that true love can survive all-there is a chance for us all.",1119225600,5,751,4.740458015267175
813005,5,6304252137,"When I rented this movie I really didn't think it was going to be very good. I had never seen Tim Roth and Julia Ormand in anything before. Normally I would have thought that is an off the wall movie that most people wouldn't like. There was definitey something passionate between Roth and Ormand. It wasn't really overly sexual, just enough excitement to keep you on edge. It was very suspenseful and adventures and the ending was a little bit scary at first but turned out to be a surprise. If you want to see a great movie that you might not normally pick by chance, try this one because it will surprise you.",1104969600,5,612,4.37719298245614
813006,4,6304252137,"I never saw Tim Roth come off so sexy as this -- just loved it (especially the parts nearer the beginning when he is first talking to her across the tables in prison visitors room and then in diners). J.O. is beautiful and captivating on her own --very believable and much too vulnerable. I'm amazed to read other reviews here that saw Roth's character as being so sincere and in love. I did not see him that way. I saw him as short of being truly in love with her -- that he cared for her, probably, but deeply in love? I never got that. He was all too willing to put her in too much danger for one thing. Call me old-fashioned, but in my opinion a man that really cares for a woman wants to protect her. If that component is missing, give him three bright red flags!
It's a good watch though. I found it frightening to see how J.O.'s character kept falling for everything about him, hook line and sinker, ignoring *huge* red flags. Example: She told her best friend early in her romance with Roth's character that she didn't want to ask Roth what he was doing time for, feeling it was invasive. My gosh, whatever happened to the idea of expecting that a man should honor the need for a woman to feel *safe* with him? If he is worth his salt, he won't mind you checking him out and will be glad you did -- because, if he really cares about you, he is going to respect a woman's need to learn important things about him -- especially convicts and people met through personal ads. I mean really! When she finally breaks her resolve and looks it up, she learns he is in for murder -- of his wife.
She is quick to notice that court documents say it was a crime of passion because his wife had been cheating on him. Oh good, she seems to think to herself, ""Jusitifiable homicide."" HELLO-OOO-OO? Is anybody out there? I don't care what his wife did, violence and murdering her was NOT okay, and NEVER the answer and does NOT make him out to be a ""deep, soulful, sensitive and passionate"" lover of most women's dreams. It makes him *dangerous*. I'm not saying he can't reform and I'm not saying she can't forgive that about him when he does, but this movie did not touch that. It was as if it was just like OKAY that he murdered his wife.  Pleeeeeez.
Now, this does not make it a bad movie. In fact it makes it a very realistic movie, sadly, because a lot of us women keep falling for men who hurt us, and big-time. One shudders to think of how many women in America were beaten by their husbands or lovers this very hour today. To me this is not so much a movie about a tragic love affair as it is about some of the all-too-common vulnerabilities of a lot of women. Women with these vulnerabilities are women-at-risk.
Roth was charismatic, sexy and captivating but I did not see him as a truly loving lover. I don't care how sensual and ""deep"" he is, when it's not true love it just ain't a love story. Too many things about the character he played showed that he did not (and was no doubt incapable of) truly loving her. It did not torment him what he was putting her through. I never saw him try to resist his desire for her so that she would not be put at risk. Simple caring was missing.
Anyhow, I do think this movie is a fascinating character study -- both watching the film and reading the reviews of it.  I suggest getting ""True Romance"" with Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette, who play it like genuine and romantic love in addition to this film so that you can watch a 5-star movie (""True Romance"") even while you are in the mood for this genre of film. And besides, TR is one of my favorite movies of all time and never got the marketing that would have clearly taken it to the top of the heap. It's star-studded with so many ""favorite"" scenes in it that I like to mention it whenever I can and it's on-topic. If you can only get one movie? Get ""True Romance"" instead!",1070668800,7,3878,4.253387533875339
813007,5,6304252137,"I, like other reviewers happened to stumble across this film.  I could not believe how sexual Tim Roth was. I was a little confused by the ending, I'm assuming they continued their relationship. I'm purchasing the DVD today.",1038182400,,224,4.894736842105263
813008,5,6304252137,"I stumbled upon this video very late one night about two weeks ago, quite by accident.  I was drawn in immediately and held absolutely spellbound by the performances of both Tim Roth and Julia Ormond.  Since then, I have purchased the video and rewatched it more times than I can count, each time loving the movie more.  This is a love story against all odds, a tender, heart-wrenching, passionate love story, of two people drawn together by lonliness, need, and desire.  I agree with one reviewer who said this was one of the most erotically charged films ever seen.  I have never seen Roth portray this kind of character and, I must say, I have become an avid fan and only hope he will take on more roles of this nature.  His performance was riveting, i.e., tender, sensitive, poignant, and very human.  I certainly don't mean to downplay Ormond's performance, it was superb as well.  The chemistry between the actors was incredibly real, both of whom conveyed so much feeling through their eyes, facial expressions and body language.  Since discovering this gem, I have read a lot of the reviews, and I totally disagree with one movie critic who said Roth was miscast in the part. The fact that he does not look like Brad Pitt makes it even more believeable for me.  Roth may not be handsome in the classic sense, but he has a unique look, very sexy, intense, charismatic and sensual.  This movie touches me deeply, I only wish that the ending had not been so rushed.  I would love to see this movie make it to DVD.",1007337600,34,1518,4.560885608856089
7865478,4,6304252137,"I watched this movie because of Julia Ormond. Having seen her in First Knight, I was struck by her natural beauty and unpretentious acting.  Then I see Tim Roth and I am enthralled with this man. The casting of this film is genius, from the incredible chemistry between Rachel and Philip, Lenny to whom Elvis is religion, Towler the handsome prison drug pusher, Sexton a guard who has hots for Rachel, Maggie a cockney prison wife, and the rest are all so memorable.  This is a rather unlikely romance between two people of different social classes, Rachel, a dentist and Philip, a former blue-collar tradesman.  I at first found Tim Roth's appearance unappealing, but as the attraction grows between Rachel  and Philip, so did Roth's sheer raw sexuality and boyish appeal grow on me.  I found the performances of all the actors in this movie compelling and that's what makes this movie watchable, but give it four stars because  the ending leaves a lot of loose ends.",1508198400,,968,4.766467065868263

7865481,5,6304252137,"Like another reviewer wrote, I could watch Tim Roth do just about anything. She could watch him read Barney, and I could watch him read the ingredients of bug spray and be spellbound. He's just that great. If you like him, you'll LOVE him after this; if you already love him, you won't mind paying the insane amount this movie costs. I got it years ago for .99 cents on a clearance rack at midnight on a fluke. So glad I did. Julia Ormond is fantastic as well and you'll be on the edge of your seat the whole time.",1443225600,,514,4.15
7865482,5,6304252137,"I can't believe how many people seem to think this is a romantic movie that just happens to be set in a prison! This story is NOT a romance, people... this is a psycho-sexual thriller, about an affair destined to come to a very bad, and probably very bloody, end. Tim Roth, as Philip Chaney just oozes sex, despair, desire, vulnerability, rage. (What an absolute master Tim Roth is!) And Julia Ormond is very good as Rachel, a somewhat spoiled professional woman who comes to work at the prison part-time as a dentist, looking for something totally different than her estranged husband, who is ineffectual and almost effeminate, and who cheated on her.  Rachel is looking for someone to ""hold me like his life depends on it,"" but she doesn't understand her own motivation, so she is outraged when Philip accuses her of using him, of coming to the prison looking for ""a bit of rough."" Philip has started analyzing her motivation because he cares about Rachel, but how much is real feeling, and how much is just a normal response to the sudden proffer of female companionship and sex after five years without a visitor, is not clear. As the wife of one of the other prisoners (the proverbial ""old hand"") tells Rachel, ""...he holds you like his life depends on it because at that moment he feels like it does.""

Rachel, on the other hand, is so immediately besotted that she cannot even bring herself to ask Philip what crime he committed, and she repeatedly denies that he could have done anything serious, that he could be a bad guy.  Even after he explodes and walks headfirst into oncoming traffic when she tells him she's looked up a newspaper article about his murder of his wife, she still can't see the red flags. She says to her friend that he murdered his wife because the wife had an affair, and he couldn't forgive her. She insists that this means ""he must have loved her very much.""  But Philip had to be the source of the information that his wife had an affair, because the newspaper clipping about the murder says no such thing.

Now we begin to put Philip into perspective: he is a man with some seriously scary issues. He is coldly and impersonally and efficiently violent with other inmates. When first coming on to Rachel, he bites her finger while she is examining his teeth. When Rachel tries to slow him down, as they fondle each other in a cafe on the one day a week he's let out of prison to attend classes (it's Britain, people--- there is still some pretense there of rehabilitating prisoners) he suddenly seizes her by the neck and snarls ""I'm risking my freedom here."" Cut to the sex in the bathroom stall, which is a smokin' scene (in the cleanest damn bathroom stall I've ever seen) after which he playfully covers her eyes with his hands, as if to prevent her from actually seeing him. Later, she sends him a tape, and he listens dreamily to her talk about how she longs for him, until she interrupts herself to take a phone call from a male co-worker who is taking her out for a drink. Philip rewinds the tape several times to listen attentively, not to her words of love, but to the information about her having a drink with another man.

When Philip finally tells Rachel about the murder, he says his wife ""... broke my heart without even knowing what she was doing, like a child would."" He says his wife was two hours late, and he knew she had someone new in her life... so when she opened the door and smiled at him, he smashed her head against the door jam. He marvels at ""...how fast the blood drained out of her."" He says ""I can't believe it was me. I mean, I'm not mental or anything.""  We wonder, though.

Unfortunately, as Philip has told Rachel, inmates spend all their time in prison trying to read each other, and other inmates have ""sussed"" their affair. Philip is told by the resident dealer (who also has some IRA connection that isn't clear) that Rachel must smuggle some drugs into the prison for him, and although Philip tries to refuse in her behalf, the dealer's outside accomplice has already located her flat and identified her friends, so she has no choice. When she gets the package she's to smuggle in, it's not drugs, it's a gun. At that point, Philip seems to decide he can't let Rachel be endangered in this way, and he reports the gun-smuggling scheme to the administration. Rachel shoots the outside accomplice in self-defense, and as they take her away, she asks where Philip will be transferred. ""Probably the Isle of Wight,"" is the response. ""So I'll have to cross the water to see him,"" she mutters.

As someone else once said, I'd watch Tim Roth reading Barney stories. Even at the age of 53 he's still one of the sexiest men on this little blue green planet. But this movie really is engaging, Tim's sex appeal notwithstanding. There are so many complications and so many levels in the relationship these characters are forging, and so many pitfalls and power struggles to come... they are such fully formed characters that we can imagine a whole slew of future scenarios with them, but unfortunately, most of the future scenarios are pretty damn grim.",1420675200,,5119,4.567538126361656

7865485,5,6304252137,"I ran across this movie late one night on one of the ""classic"" cable channels. I don't know how I missed it before now, but I am so glad I finally did see it.  After seeing it the first time I had to have my own copy. This movie is an incredibly beautiful romance staring Julia Ormond and Tim Roth. Tim Roth has played dozens of different characters in his movies.  Each of his roles is unique because of his amazing ability to invent different personalities for each new character, but he takes this role to a totally new level.  Captives takes place in a UK prison and his portrayal of a sad and lonely prisoner is done with such intense passion that you can't help but fall in love with his character.  After watching Tim Roth play so many heavies in other movies, it was refreshing to see him playing a sexy, hot, and very lovable guy.  His character, Philip Chaney, is basically a good person that has done something wrong and is being punished for it in jail and in his own conscience with his feelings of guilt and regret.
  The on camera chemistry between Ormond and Roth is amazing.  But this movie is also special because of the story itself.  It is about a love affair that develops between a dentist and a prisoner and sets the groundwork for one of the most erotic, sensual, and tender love scenes I've ever seen.
  Angela Pope has done a magnificent job of filming this superb romantic drama.  Rachael and Philip are caught in a dangerous situation with everything to lose, but can't stop the inevitable love affair that was destined to happen between them, no matter what the cost.  This is one romance you'll enjoy watching over and over again and still get the same thrill you felt the first time you saw it!",1356739200,,1725,4.438095238095238
7865486,5,6304252137,"Captives is a very enjoyable film.  Tim Roth is superb and showed a full range of emotions during the movie from very quiet and emotional to violent when necessary.  The relationship between Tim and Julie was thought provoking.  As always, you must watch Tim Roth's face - it says so much more than just words.  The other main characters were also very good.",1316304000,,358,4.634920634920635
7865487,5,6304252137,"I realize this isn't actually a 5 star movie, but the acting by both Tim Roth and Julia Ormond was excellent and their chemistry amazing.  The premise didn't make much sense, a female dentist working in a prison and why at the beginning, this job was so important to her.  She was insecure as her husband had cheated on her and Philip Chaney (Roth) was in prison for killing his wife for the same reason.

She still continued to love and trust him, even after the truth became known to her. He was lonely, desolate, isolated and yearning for female contact.  Their rapport and connection was immediate and I would like to think his actions were beyond his control and he was seeking redemption.  I can't tell you how many times I watched this movie for the marvelous acting and their relationship.  The way he looked at her at the end, when he said that he'd go to the Governor and protect her, was so moving and sincere.

Should he, who was so insecure and yearning for love, be trusted by her, I don't know.  Personally, I'd be very leery as he committed murder out of jealousy.  Could he have changed during those 10 years of isolation.  He appeared so, sweet, kind, empathetic and understanding, but there was a violent side to him.  She felt dreadfully betrayed and violated, losing trust for her husband.  Philip was there attentive, witty, attractive and intelligent and doting on her.  I'd like to think her trust in him wouldn't be an error but I might be as vulnerable as she was.  She was mesmerized by him.",1258675200,,1518,4.533088235294118
