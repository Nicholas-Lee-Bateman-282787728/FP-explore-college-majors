3748377,5,B001PMRK0K,"If you haven't seen these guys in action all you have to do is go to YouTube and watch a few clips for Top Gear and you'll never look back!

Three guys talk super cars and do stupid challenges with hilarious consequences.

But for a real fan you CANNOT watch Top Gear on Youtube. You'll be like the whole of UK and Australia and just need every excellent episode right away!

Highlights are:
- A roadtrip through Europe to find the greatest driving road ever in a Lambogini, Porche 911 and an Aston Martin (so much funnier than it sounds)
- Three attempts at making an amphibious car
- A race between a fighter jet and the fastest production car in the world
- Watch the three hosts cross the uncrossable desert in three african cars that cost $1000.
- See the birth of Motorhome racing

BUY WITHOUT REGRET!",1239494400,2,807,4.395973154362416
3748378,5,B001PMRK0K,"Wonderful, witty, and completely entertaining show, without a doubt, the best stuff on TV. This is not a car show. This is straight up entertainment. If you enjoy British humor, I promise you will love this show.

On the off chance you're on this page and  have the misfortune to not be familiar with Top Gear, basically, it's three overgrown boys ""cocking about"" with cars (their words, not mine, albeit, very appropos).

My household grinds to a dead stop at 8pm every Monday when Top Gear comes on, and our whole extended family can routinely quote Clarksonisms.

I was sorely disappointed when iTunes didn't include Botswana in the Season 10 Pass, and am delighted the DVD set will include the African Special, as well as extra Season 10 content not available from iTunes. (Later iTunes seasons did include extra content not available on the US broadcasts.)

Season 10 includes the fantastic Channel Crossing featuring the infamous ToyBota and the VW cabin cruiser; the classic (and gorgeously filmed) Bugatti versus Veyron race; wickedly funny motorhome racing; the 24 hour endurance race; and a personal favorite (as if I could really pick one!); the ""British car under 1,000 Pounds"" challenge.  And, of course, there is a liberal dose of the mysterious race-car driver Stig throughout.

But, the piece de resistance of this collection is the African Special, which is hands down one of the best hours ever broadcast on TV. Funny, a record setting endurance challenge, and with the benefit of a film crew that would grace any National Geographic special.

BTW, the unseen and unheralded video, audio, and editing crew on Top Gear is talented and amazing enough to compete with any major motion picture, and the show, particularly the Botswana, is just absolute eye candy, even if you're not a car fan. This show goes the extra mile of always hiring a helicopter pilot, and the airborne footage helps lift it out of the realm of the ordinary, too. I just can't compliment the whole Top Gear crew enough.

And, if you enjoy the sometimes maddening but always entertaining posturing of Jeremy,  I'd also recommend you check out the ""World According to Clarkson"" book series. He is a funny, but thought provoking, writer in his own right.",1237248000,18,2240,4.917771883289125

Since writing the original review below, we went to watch more old seasons of Top Gear (since they are no longer available on Netflix), but Amazon is now charging for them. The older seasons used to be free and you had to pay if you wanted to watch the most recent ones. Now you have to pay for all of them. I'm sure it has to do with increased demand of this popular show and the fact that they now have the market cornered, but charging for seasons that are over 5 years old...really?? Very Disappointed in Amazon.

They are classically daffy in the tried and true English sense of wit, which Americans will either find humorous or twitty, or both.  The show is at its best when the three hosts are really hopped up about a car they are reviewing -- typically something in the million dollar range, with 700 horsepower.  The filming is excellent, you get a lot of great views of machines you would not normally get close to and it's fun to watch the pantomime race car driver, The Stig, put these cars through their paces.  Alas, there are only so many ""cool cars"" out there and when one isn't available the show is about as enjoyable as watching someone peel a bowl full of grapes.  There are all sorts of stupid attempts to make banal things interesting -- racing campers, riding mopeds across China, racing from Paris to some industrial city in England.  And then of course, there's the pain of watching some poor celebrity try to drive a Honda Civic around the Top Gear track as quickly as possible.  How they get a steady stream of famous people to embarrass themselves is truly amazing, even if it's also boring... So you basically pays your money and takes your chances.

During a previous episode when they try to grow bio-fuel, Clarkson ""discovers"" they grew diesel vs. petrol. Since he hates diesel, they decide to burn it all in an endurance race.  I don't want to give too many details, but the sheer emotion of all of the drivers; the tenacity, the humility, the absolute joy are palpable.  It should make anyone who drives, want to do an endurance race with your mates/friends/BFFs (I need to figure out how to do this with my son).  BTW, their normal, wisecracking humor is there, but becomes subdued when the sheer magnitude of what they are doing becomes apparent.  There is a point where Clarkson wants to poke fun at May over the radio but knows the weight that May is carrying since he was in his shift at driving and driving at night; Calrkson as a compasionate human is pretty fantastic.

Imagine my surprise when Top Gear 10 was released on DVD. The show deserves DVD release, but not this way. I understand and accept changing the soundtrack - beating copyright laws are akin to burning a wet dog.
What I am not clear on is the other editing. Removing 10-15 minutes per episode just does not make sense. The news segments have largely been cut (why?), and it feels like other segments of the show have been shortened.
I will echo another reviewer - the video quality is not what we watched on TV, or the interwebs for that matter. It feels brighter (in a bad way) and sharper...in a bad way.
If this stuff matters not to you, buy the disc. But do it knowing that you are contributing to mediocrity.",1251244800,5,881,4.444444444444445
3748567,5,B001PMRK0K,"I'm not attuned to the entertainment industry, but I've read somewhere that they're considering making an American version of Top Gear.  Having consumed most of these episodes in about a week, I'm not sure it would work here.

To begin with, the show is very British.  The humor, the ""regular bloke"" looking hosts, the lack of politcally correct self regard, and, most importantly, the hosts' absolute love of cars.  If they make an American version, is Adam Carolla going to have the same passion for cars that Jeremy Clarkson has?  Or is he just going to be looking for another opportunity in show business?  Tough question and maybe not very fair.  But the show won't work unless you have guys (yes, guys) who (a) love cars and (b) know how to ""present"" on camera.  Not an easy combination.  As with ""American Chopper"", there's an integrity at the core of Top Gear and it would be essential to have that same integrity in the States for an American version to work.

Another problem is money.  I'm not sure to what degree Top Gear is government financed or if it is profitable, but it sure looks expensive.  The trips to Africa and Italy, the entry into the 24 hour race, etc.  It probably costs a heck of a lot more to produce than Dancing with the Stars (great in its own right).  Top Gear wouldn't work without the trips to Africa and Italy and races against military jets and so forth.

I'm coming up with reasons why an American version wouldn't work, but I wish it would work.  Because Top Gear is freaking great.  It has the spirit and fun of early David Letterman shows (80's and early 90's) combined with respect and passion for cars.  I've watched nine of the ten episodes and I'm genuinely sad that I'm about to run out.  The test drives are informative and entertaining.  There is an American tendency not to be overly critical.  It's a good attribute generally, but what's refreshing about Top Gear is they don't hold back the criticism of the top vehicles on the market.  Eg. Clarkson saying why the Ferrari doesn't really excite him as much as it should or admitting that while he loves the Audi supercar's performance, he isn't that crazy about its looks.  You know he means what he says.

And the special events are marvelous.  The drive across Botswana, the RV race, Clarkson's tears upon finishing the 24 hour race (and Hammond's genuine shame at almost knocking them out of it), crossing the English Channel in the amphibious vehicle, the boat racing up the Thames, etc. . . . all of it is great entertainment.

Well, if they don't produce an American version, here's hoping they'll sell DVDs of the previous seasons.

Highly recommended.

3748568,3,B001PMRK0K,"I love Top Gear, I watched almsot all of the episodes from the first season in in 2002.

Top Gear Season 10 is very good, but the DVD isn't as good, the original airing of season 10 is better than this DVD.

The problems are:

1. News segments are non existent or missing, there is maybe only one episode with the Top Gear news.

2. The music, Top Gear season 10 had great music in the original UK airing, on the DVD all the music is replaced by a bad music probably because of copyright issues with the original music, no matter the reason, this reduces the enjoyment of the episodes.

3. Region 1 DVD, why would you make it a region 1 DVD? Should have made the DVD region free.

4. No extras as far as I can tell, there's only the show, no behind the scenes, no special commentary, nothing, it's just the show.

Imagine Jeremy Clarkson reviewing this DVD, he would point out it's flaws with no shame.

Overall Top Gear season 10 is fun to watch many times over, the cars are great, Jeremy Clarkson is hirlarious, despite the DVD flaws I'm happy I bought it because the video is in good quality and the show is really good.

3748572,1,B001PMRK0K,"I'm not even going to bother extolling Top Gear's virtues.  It's the best show on the air.  Go watch it.  However...

This DVD set is terrible.

First thing to notice is that the packaging is cheap, flimsy, and extremely minimal.  The retention clips in mine were already broken in two places.  Two of the DVDs overlap, like shingles, and scratches are inevitable.  There is no insert, other than a BBC survey about the discs, which you might want to keep and use, though I suspect no one actually reads those things.

Second thing to notice is the quality of the video.  It's oversharpened, probably to try to cover up the blurriness.  The blurriness is probably because the widescreen video appears merely to have been zoomed up from the central portion of the letterboxed BBC America/Canada airings.  You end up with blurry, sharpened, aliased mud.  It's almost painful to see on anything other than a 23"" tube TV.

Third thing to notice is that, content-wise, these are apparently nothing more than the BBC America/Canada airings.  Language is bleeped and the shows are cut down to make room for commercials.  I could have made these discs, nearly verbatim, for pennies, by archiving the identical recordings off of my TiVo.

There's more fiddly stuff, but isn't that enough already?  Unless you need an archive of what's already been on the air, pretty much as-is, for $32+tax, don't bother.

Do a better job next time, BBC.  I won't buy another set if you don't.  I'd even go so far as to say you should recall these discs and (re)do them properly.",1243468800,45,1554,4.745318352059925
3748573,5,B001PMRK0K,"With a budget as limitless as their iconoclastic imaginations, the producers and presenters of Top Gear have created a brilliantly funny television show which is in equal parts clever, thoughtful, informative, and entirely deranged. Great television about an unlikely subject, presented with devious wit, unexpected production values, and a kind of mad mixture of British masochism and inner-directed sociopathology that makes one think the writers are the intellectual heirs, in equal parts, of Evelyn Waugh and Hunter S. Thompson. A petard rolled in the door of automobile journalism.",1243382400,,586,5.670454545454546

Top Gear! The best British televison comedy to hit the air waves since 1970's hit ""The Good Life."" Top Gear is hosted by Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May.

Within each episode there are car performance runs with audio/visual commentary by the driver, celebrity car runs around the Top Gear track, performance car trials by the elusive, man of mystery ""The Stig"", The ""Cool Wall"" where Jeremy and Richard rate cars according to the categories of ""cool and uncool"" based on performance/style of the automobile, and a challenge for the team to perform. The best feature about the show are the ""road trips and challenges"" the team have taken around the world.

3748580,4,B001PMRK0K,"The product description and the other reviews give a good breakdown of why you should like Top Gear- a trio of insane presenters who'd be as at home in a sitcom as they are behind the wheel of the supercars they love.

I'll stick with the DVD itself, which is nice to have but has a few flaws.

The first flaw is that the contents aren't perfectly uncut. Most of the ""news"" segments that featured in eight of the ten episodes of Season 10 are missing- only two are included. Some of the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car segments are also missing- specifically, rugby star Lawrence Dallagio, Absolutely Fabulous star Jennifer Saunders, and comedian Keith Allen. The back of the box says, in tiny print, ""For clearance reasons certain edits have been made."" Presumably, to save license payments to certain carmakers and celebrities, they dropped less memorable and more Brit-centric material. However, so far as I can tell these are the only cuts; there is ample material remaining that wasn't present on the BBC America broadcasts. (And the Star in a Car bits retained include Simon Cowell and David (Doctor Who) Tennant, and the two News segments retained are pure comedy gold... so it's not a total loss.)

Other cuts include: a very short attempt to do the Cool Wall (Season 10 was shot right after a studio fire destroyed the Cool Wall and other props); the in-studio conclusion of the Silverstone Britcar race; the Stig speed-testing the Vauxhall VXR8; and other bits and pieces here and there that I can't verify based on secondhand info, not having access to the original BBC versions.

The second flaw is that there's really not much in this three-disk set besides the episodes. There's no outtakes reel. There's no information text, background on the cast, or even optional trailers. (Each disk does have auto-playing trailers for other BBC DVD sets, which you can't play voluntarily after you get to the main menu.) There's no alternate language subtitles or dub- this is strictly an English-language release for what the BBC apparently believes is a one-language-if-that-many United States. Granted, there are English subtitles, but that's pretty much the only feature.

The final flaw is minor indeed; a dearth of track skip points. The credits (front and back) are NOT separate tracks; skip the opening credits and you also skip the opening film bit, and you can't skip to the end credits, period. None of the segments has skip points partway through, so you can't queue up anywhere close to a specific point in the film- you have to start at the beginning and fast-forward through.

These minor imperfections rob Top Gear 10 of what, otherwise, should be a well-deserved fifth star. Next time, BBC, when the package says ""Complete Xth Season,"" please give us the complete season...

... but even if you don't, I'll still buy it. Now give us 1-9 and 11-12, please.",1240444800,69,2875,4.855102040816327
3748581,3,B001PMRK0K,"I have waited for the day when TG would be released on dvd and I am slightly let down by series 10 dvd release.  First off all the episodes are EDITED on this 3 dvd release which does include the Botswana special.  I have not fully viewed each episode but on the 1st episode supercar challenge (looking for the best driving road in Europe) the music had been changed and I can only assume its the same through out the series.  As I have stated this series is broken down into 3 discs which is as follows

Disc 1: run time 204 minutes

Ep 1 51:27

Ep 2 50:25

Ep 3 50:32

Ep 4 (Botswana special) 51:28

Disc 2: run time 150 minutes

Ep 5 50:08

Ep 6 49:08

Ep 7 50:35

Disc 3: 152 minutes

Ep 8 50:34

Ep 9 51:06

you would have thought they would have left the language unbleeped for dvd they didn't I guess they thought I'd be offended by such words as ""[..]"".  I would have been even madder had I paid the $[...] (I bought this as a pre order in a combo with Clarkson's Heaven & Hell for $[...]) pricewise I really shouldn't complain but still the cuts are unforgivable.  If Auntie Beeb intends to release any other Top Gear series I say don't bother unless you go the whole way and release them with NO cuts.  I would have gladly paid $50-$80 (call me mad) for an uncut uncensored series.
