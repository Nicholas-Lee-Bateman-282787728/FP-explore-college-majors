8356340,4,B0028K3HHI,"This video is great because it accurately depicts what a trip to the Solomon Islands is like.  They went to most of the same places we went on our trip and used most of the same modes of transportation--open boat, Twin Otter, etc.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the commentary can get a little insipid at times.  Otherwise it was much like watching a video of our own trip to the Solomons.",1299369600,,403,4.207792207792208
