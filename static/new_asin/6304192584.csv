7865707,3,6304192584,"D.W. Griffith was a powerhouse during the early silent era, but as the times began to change, his popularity began to decline. Presented here is his last film, a talkie with a political agenda and featuring little-known actors. The Struggle is opened with a message about the rampant use of alcohol in spite of prohibition. It is strange for us to think today that this country prohibited the sale and consumption of alcohol, but when this film was made, these practices were illegal.

This story focuses on one man's family. Jimmy Wilson (Hal Skelly) is a social drinker; people like him when he's drunk because he becomes vibrant and funny. His girlfriend Florrie (Zita Johann- of The Mummy fame) doesn't like him when he's drunkk because his behavior worries her. She confesses her love but tells Jimmy that she won't marry him unless he gives up the bottle. He agrees and the two start a happy life together. Everything seems fine for a while; they have a daughter together and make the most of their meager earnings. Then one day, Jimmy's friends at work invite him to a bar and coerce him to drink. From then on, he is dependent on the stuff and pulls his family down with him.

Sometimes powerful, sometimes dull, this film tries to evoke deep emotions to convey its message, but does not quite succeed. The issue was important to Griffith as he himself struggled with alcohol abuse, but the limitations of early talking film and the use of unknowns make this film less than classic. It is a simply a curiosity for fans of a silent-era genius.",1208131200,,1550,4.673992673992674
7865708,4,6304192584,"""The Struggle"" has two main distinguishing features:  firstly, it is an unpretentious and quite realistic approach to the social problem of alcoholism and its effects on family and friends, and secondly, it is the last film directed by D.W. Griffith, the pioneer of early cinema and best remembered for dramatic silent epics such as ""Intolerance"" (1916) and several others thereafter.  In the new 'talkies' era, Griffith returned to a much smaller budget production not unlike his earlier short films for Biograph (1909-1913) with the emphasis on content, drama and 'social comment'.  ""The Struggle"" even begins with the words that the film is intended to depict the real-life struggle of thousands of Americans, but that it is ""not preachment"" for or against alcohol, and rather asks the question whether the problem of alcoholism can be controlled by law (ie the Prohibition) or is it a matter of individual character.

After this sombre introduction we are treated to a lively, entertaining film that focusses on individuals and their emotions.  First we see a social scene from 1911 where everyone is shocked when a woman becomes tipsy after too much drinking.  Then we see the situation in 1923 where being mildly intoxicated is quite acceptable and even the norm at social gatherings.  These two innocent scenes already get you thinking - which was Griffith's intention with every film.

The main story of ""The Struggle"" then revolves around a happy family, and we see it fall apart when the husband and father succumbs to a few drinks with friends after work and quickly spirals downwards until he ends up as a bum on the streets.  I found Griffith's handling of the characters and the drama to be as good, touching and even heart-wrenching as any of his earlier good work in silent films, and I was also impressed by Hal Skelly's fine acting in portraying the victim of alcohol.  Furthermore, the story was written by the husband and wife team of Anita Loos and John Emerson, who were instrumental in the success of many silent films together with Griffith and also for other successful stars such as Douglas Fairbanks, Sr.

For those who are not familiar with Griffith's prior work or with silent films, ""The Struggle"" still stands alone as a special early 1930s film which makes an impression and leaves a strong message.  It shows how alcoholism was viewed by society at that time and gets you wondering how much things have really changed since then.  In summary, for anyone who appreciates a 'statement' film with good drama, familiar with Griffith's work or not, ""The Struggle"" is worth a good look.",1096156800,,2613,4.938356164383562
