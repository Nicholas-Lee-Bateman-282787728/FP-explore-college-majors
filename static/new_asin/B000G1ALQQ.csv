2597360,5,B000G1ALQQ,"This season is great, along with every other season of Footballers Wives, I will buy this DVD for the show, but I wish we had some extra features. This Season in the UK includes outtakes and Hazel Baily's World of Football. Why is it that the US versions never have features, well except for the Slang Dictionary, but lets face it that is hardly a special feature. Anywho, the show is great so buy it for that!",1156723200,5,410,4.337662337662338
2597361,5,B000G1ALQQ,"With the addition of Amber Gates, Tanya Turner has a great new enemy.  Amber's bi-sexual husband Conrad is messing with anybody who'll play and with any(thing) his wife get's her hands on...well, you just have to see that scene!

Tanya's got her hands full with Frank...trying to off him and maintain her lifestyle...and the fun continues!

Too bad we can't produce a mainstream TV show this awesome and gloriously wicked in the States.

If you haven't watched this series, check it out soon...

from the beginning if possible.

Peace :o)",1156204800,12,538,4.9222222222222225
2597362,5,B000G1ALQQ,"I loved it! I bought it from London I was really happy when I found out that they sell it there!

 There are many new characters and that made it really interesting... my fav. characters are Kyle & Conrad, they are really good.

 I didn't like the ending...maybe you'll do!

 I cant wait for the fourth!",1156204800,2,303,4.321428571428571
2597363,5,B000G1ALQQ,"I love to watch the Footballers Wives it's a great series. I hope they will soon edit the rest of the series, so i can purchase all of them as soon as they do this  I will also purchase them.",1359504000,,191,3.775
2597364,5,B000G1ALQQ,"Wow, if you like sleezy, catty and funny sitcoms,then Footballers Wives is for you! Mind you , it is all tongue and cheek, but it is so much fun and Season 3 is one of the most fun of all. Tanya Turner (brilliantly portrayed by Zoe Lucker) is the villainess par excellence. but all of the characters are well acted. Just when you think you are falling off the cliff in one episode, you find another cliffhanger at the end of each episode. WARNING : The version I have has the interviews and outtakes as well, but some of the interviews have spoilers in them, so don't view the bonuses until after you have watched all nine of the series episodes.",1304899200,,646,4.347107438016529
2597365,4,B000G1ALQQ,"my dvd came in a very timely manner, before its due date. it was in new and prefect condition, exactly what i ordered. and im always happy to get the programs from the U.K. that i want on amazon.com.",1273968000,,199,4.128205128205129
2597366,5,B000G1ALQQ,"Drama, drama, drama!  This is my favorite season.  Introduced is Conrad and Amber, who is a pretty Bollywood star and becomes Tanya's greatest rival!  Super juicy.  The last episode leaves you hanging....watch it!",1230768000,,213,5.363636363636363
2597367,5,B000G1ALQQ,This series is great.  Very addictive.  i am sad to see this show come to an end.  BBC gem,1208995200,,90,3.6315789473684212
2597368,4,B000G1ALQQ,"Great show thats a bit over the top but its entertaining as Hell!

Its sad to see a lot of the more familiar actors get written off the show but the new storyline and characters adds so many more new twists and turns.  I can hardly wait for season 4 but someone has written it will take 1 1/2 years for it to reach our retail market but BBC America is already selling Season 4 and 5 in Region 2 which doesn't make any sense to us Region 1 fans.  Also, bootleg copies are already surfacing on Ebay with enticements like unrated.  If you can't wait then go to the footballers wives website and totally spoil it for yourself.",1173571200,2,622,4.201680672268908
2597369,5,B000G1ALQQ,It is ALL about Tanya. Notice any resemblance to Victoria Beckham? Annoyed that Amazon does not carry episode 4 & 5. Feel like I am left hanging.,1168387200,4,145,4.407407407407407
2597370,4,B000G1ALQQ,"Loved it! Tanya Turner is still around doing what she does best..being disruptive, manipulative and very funny. I do miss Jason Turner though.",1168300800,,142,5.217391304347826
2597371,3,B000G1ALQQ,"This show should have been relegated to the lower divisions at the end of the second season. What started out as a not bad idea has been giving away penalties since the beginning of the match and this season should have certainly been sent off if the referee had been keeping his eye on the ball.

Much of the impetus for this season has been the inclusion of a transfer in player who, it is claimed is based on the life of David Beckham. Certainly it has enabled the writers to give additional dimensions to the series but as the game rolls on the more preposterous it gets.

There is a little more than a token nod to actual football throughout the performance but some of the central plots are a little lame and should have been stretchered off. The main players lack a bad boy as a mainstay and tania and hazel are not quite the best substitutes for that.

This remains chav heaven and clearly includes a lot of titillation. The new girl, the scouser (Liverpudlian) is pathetically annoying and her voice grates while the character of Amber could have been more interesting.

The main appeal of this show lies in it's tawdriness, but it will require more than just that if it is to continue into extra time, now that all of the available substitutes have been used up.",1161907200,2,1272,4.469827586206897
2597372,5,B000G1ALQQ,"Much like the who shot JR story line on Dallas, you would think that after the second season cliffhanger the biggest question surrounding the third season of Footballer's Wives would be who killed Jason Turner. You would be wrong. In fact, that question is answered on the very first episode of this season. Instead, the focus of the third season of Footballer's Wives is on the new recruits to Earls Park and their interactions with the old favorites--like Tanya Turner.

The new blood on the team includes:

Conrad and Amber Gates: Conrad is pretty much the David Beckham of the team. He's got the looks, the body, and the has-been wife... but not the kids. Amber's a former Bollywood actress who is having more than a little trouble getting any work.  Conrad and Amber have an open marriage and Conrad makes it no secret that he plays the field. He may have met his match, though, when Tanya sets her sights on him.

Harvey Lawson and his girlfriend Shannon: Harvey is a seventeen year old kid who proves that age really doesn't matter on the pitch. His girlfriend Shannon is a bit country and not at all up to par with the other footballer's wives. She's also jealous, possessive, and can't hold her liquor, which makes for excellent television where this show is concerned.

Noah Alexander: Noah fills in when one of the show's key players is injured, but causes more than a little scandal when his personal life starts to overshadow his performance on the pitch. When he gets in the way of what Tanya wants, she puts him in his place quickly and let him know who's boss at Earls Park.

There is nothing that the writers of this show will not do. There isn't an American equivalent to the over-the-top campiness of this show, Desperate Housewives and Passions included. It's almost too much sometimes, but I just can't look away. If you've never seen Footballer's Wives cocaine addiction, hermaphrodite babies, and gambling addiction are just a few of the story lines you have to look forward to if you give this show a chance.  If you enjoyed seasons 1 and 2, I can guarantee that you won't be disappointed with this season. The only problem is the length of time it takes the American DVDs to be released. They're already on season 5 in Britain, and it'll probably be another year or so before we get those on DVD.",1159660800,16,2321,4.618932038834951

8128279,5,B000G1ALQQ,"I LOVED this series through about the first 4 seasons.  The DVD I ordered would not play - I suspect it is in UK format but it was the only one available.  However I had seen the 3rd season on BBC America and found the characters completely entertaining.  They are so self-involved but the show makes fun of them for being so enough to keep it from getting stupid.

After Season 3 the main characters that made the show work were mostly gone and the story lines got harder and harder to deal with but I'm still glad I watched and still have a few ""going Tanya"" moments in my life!!",1381190400,,581,4.207207207207207
