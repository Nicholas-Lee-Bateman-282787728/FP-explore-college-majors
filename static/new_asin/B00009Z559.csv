7994538,1,B00009Z559,"This DVD is ridiculous. The price is ridiculous when you consider that it has a sum total of TWO episodes on it. It opens with a shoddy introduction that looks like it was shot in somebody's garage. The DVD cover case is very poorly made with the cheapest materials possible, and the DVD itself rattles around inside the case, because it was not made to fit properly inside.

Highly disappointed. You'd do better to find a torrent online and download it, rather than buy this junk.",1384473600,3,481,4.593023255813954
7994539,3,B00009Z559,"Does anyone remember when Josh Webb (Erick Mitsak), took Blake Dean (Les Hill), and Adam Cameron (Matt Stevenson) on a camping trip in Home And Away, only to terrorize them and eventually kill them one assumes, but fails in the end.  This criminally forgotten story was one of the greatest cliffhangers ever to be filmed in an Australian soap, and all episodes concerning this story and the tidbits inbetween of course, should have seen a DVD release by now.  If they do have genuine intentions of releasing Home And Away's best ever episodes, these have got to be in it, no question, just releasing romances and weddings has become a little boring.  This is purely an example of an ultimate Home And Away boxset I suppose, however some of the much later stories involving Peter Baker for instance, were pretty entertaining too.  Life long fans of the show will know exactly what I'me talking about here, there's no need to elaborate too much, one of these days it's got to be done.",1284336000,,982,4.691860465116279

They're rare and pretty hard to find.
Thanks in advance.",1259366400,,124,4.434782608695652
7994541,1,B00009Z559,"Please take my word when I tell you to avoid this Australian soap drama at all costs. It was bad enough 20-30 years ago when it started as a B-grade drama show, but least back then, the show did not take it self seriously.

It used to be that every season finale, they would end it with a big fire, or flood, where the whole town would have to chip in to rescue each other. Once they received a useless Australian Logi award for it (something like an Emi or Golden Globe for Australia, only no one outside of the event knows or cares about it) they decided to film the show like a movie... and now every single episode tries to be an award winner... the show is now a joke, it's painful to watch now, and I highly recommend you do your best to avoid ever having to watch such a pathetic attempt to win 'best actor' awards.

In the 80's the shows most climatic moments was some surfer dork being knocked off his board and almost drowning, now it's all murders, who done its, some bad guy comes to town... this show tries too hard, and I mean TOO HARD that its now just a pathetic high-quality parody of it's former self.",1211155200,5,1119,4.2
