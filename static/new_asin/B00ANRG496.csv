8554809,3,B00ANRG496,"Elfie Hopkins: Cannibal Hunter (2012) is a deceptive British horror/comedy, where what seems to be a rather pedestrian mystery story, abruptly explodes in a display of violence.  Elfie Hopkins (Jaime Winstone,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Made-in-Dagenham/dp/B003UESJGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Made in Dagenham</a>) is a strange and often angry young woman, who talks into a tape recorder, and has the unlikely ambition of becoming some kind of detective.  Living in a small village with her family, she and her geeky friend Dylan (Aneurin Banard,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Citadel/dp/B009NP1ZR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Citadel</a>), seem to have little to do except smoke weed, until the Gammon family, moves into the house next door.

Mr. Gammon (Rupert Evans,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hellboy/dp/B000OT6V00/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hellboy</a>), and his wife Ruby (Kate Magowan,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Lonely-Place-to-Die/dp/B006JSY2GU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Lonely Place to Die</a>), are in the travel business, and arrange to send some of the residents, off on some exotic adventures.  The Gammon children Ruby (Gwyneth Keyworth), and Elliot (Will Payne) are also a bit odd, and Elfie suspicions about her new neighbors grows.  As she attempts to learn more about the Gammon's family, the film unfolds like a PG-13 teen mystery, until things take a radically dark turn, and Elfie unexpectedly finds herself in a battle for her life.

While the film certainly earns its R rating in a bloody third act, the audience for this kind of gore, might be a little distracted by the protracted build up, featuring characters who carry on like junior grade kid detectives, and with Elfie antagonizing nearly everyone she meets.  While sick and twisted horror/comedies are an English tradition, a little tighter focus might have worked better.

Things fly apart a bit at the end, after Elfie transitions into the ""cannibal hunter"", but the action scenes are pretty nicely executed, and matters are concluded quickly, with help from an unexpected source.  For a black comedy, the acting performances serve the material well enough, and the stage is set for a sequel, should one be in the cards.  A good effort, but one that doesn't quite have it completely together, Elfie Hopkins Cannibal Hunter may be something of an acquired taste for comedy/horror fans.  The DVD release is not subtitled, and has absolutely nothing in the way of extras.",1379203200,,2647,6.2845303867403315
8554810,4,B00ANRG496,"Elfie (Jaime Winstone)lives in the quiet town of Thorntree Valley. She plays detective along with her stoner friend Dylan Parker (Aneurin Barnard). When the Gammon family moves in next door, Elfie immediately becomes suspicious of them. What they are up to, she doesn't know, but along with the help of Dylan, she is going to find out. The family operates a specialty vacation agency, so the people they book, stay gone for a long time.

The audience is left in the dark as to what is going on, if anything, as things have an explanation outside of the Gammons.

This is a cult film which is a light dark comedy, pardon my oxymoron. Elfie operates in an amateur fashion using 1980's technology. She clearly plays her hand too soon. Just a fun cult popcorn film.

8554811,4,B00ANRG496,"The British Horror Film has seen a resurgence in the past decade with some really nice gems in the mix of all the blood and guts.  Here we have Director Ryan Andrews's 'ELFIE HOPKINS: CANNIBAL HUNTER'-2012, a film which builds into a pressure cooker frenzy by the last 30 minutes. It's really hard to give a synopsis of what goes on before entering spoiler territory, suffice it to say that the DVD cover does not do the film justice as its advertised as a splatter fest in 'BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER' mode.  The film is very subtle in its build up, the characters are eccentric (you may want to press the subtitle button because the British dialects are hard to fathom sometimes), and the story is wonderfully original.  Jamie Winstone is excellent as the title character and her father Ray Winstone who is also Executive Producer on the film plays a nice cameo which abets the mania.  Beautiful location photography by Tovia Sempi and a melancholic music score by Jordan Andrews round out the mix.  Unfortunately, the film's title gives away some of the plot but if you like your mystery clues to unfold gradually, then this film is for you.  I was thoroughly surprised and I hope they make the character of Elfie into a series.  Screen Media Films releases it in a nice 2.35 widescreen transfer with perfect digital sound. Click the add to cart button and be prepared for one of the most brutally original horror films to grace your cranium in quite some time.",1374796800,,1462,4.6434108527131785
8554812,4,B00ANRG496,"This is a horror movie that literally sneaks up on you which also gives it the quality of being a ""murder mystery"". Outwardly, at first, you can't really believe that the premise is what it seems to be.  Then - BAM (or better yet, MUNCH) - the pace of the movie and its various revelations come cascading rapidly at you. With Rupert Evans (see his bio on IMDB), a superb actor, in the lead along with other fine cast members, this film is given a more realistic touch than most others in the genre.  Little hints are given throughout the movie as to what is really going on, but there is a strong element of deception owing to the fact that some of the actors have been cast against type. ""Appearances are deceiving"" as the old adage goes.

Since I don't wish to give away any Spoilers which would ruin the ""fun"", my review of necessity must be somewhat generic. The following might help: Pay close attention to all details; actually take certain things on face value; if necessary, go back and review earlier parts of the DVD; listen closely to what's being said (though the British accents, particularly that of the so-called ""Cannibal Hunter"", are extremely difficult to follow at times); is the title of the Disc justified?; what role does the corner butcher play?...

I gave this movie 4 stars because it does suffer periodically from having a disjointed quality and sometimes lacks credulity the way some people interact with others and the way they enter other people's homes without properly knocking. But this is the kind of thing that one too often sees in filmdom and especially soap operas.  ""Elfie Hopkins"" is not your prototypical heroine and looks as though she bleached her hair one too many times and some of it seeped into her head. However, in the end, I would highly recommend this movie for those who enjoy horror/mystery with just the right
dash of gore that isn't a continually ""in your face"" situation. Bon appetite!",1369353600,3,1940,4.67741935483871
