7100367,5,B00VNQWW2E,"A true story of a family of Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys living in the highest forests in the world at some 14,000 feet elevation where there is much less oxygen but because of mother nature, a patch of an amazing jungle. These monkeys live in forests so beautiful that it is something else to see with those 20,000 feet snowy peak mountains as the background with lush vegetation and trees which would be the dream of any nature lover to travel there and stay in the camp where those monks take their yaks to make butter all summer for the rest of the year. These are Beverly Hills looking monkeys with faces unlike regular faces where the plastic surgery has gone wild with full drama of Beverly Hills one percent. This is the story of two half brother monkeys where one gets to live a life of a prince with all the attention in the world but the other brother is abandoned, becomes an orphan who has to live at the border of not only the social group but at the border of survival from finding his food to losing the only father who offered him love who gets killed by other monkeys in the rank of securing more wives. A good way of introducing your kids to human drama and reality of life through the least expected and rarest specie of all, in the most remote, difficult, beautiful, treacherous train of mountains, rivers and valleys of Tibet, the breathtaking and challenging Himalayan. It is not China, it is Tibet and for political reasons, obviously the producers had to do what it required to make a documentary since after all, it is about those monkeys.

This item for sale is in a DVD format so it will not offer the same quality as the HD version but the info is the same. You will do much better watching it streaming since you will be able to see it in HD format which is a must. You need to look for in the streaming section of NATURE programming on Amazon.",1430438400,4,1871,4.376436781609195
