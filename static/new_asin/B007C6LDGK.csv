5076792,5,B007C6LDGK,"Foreign Letters is beautiful, insightful, and heartfelt.

Ela is an exceptional writer, director, and might I add a force to be reckoned with actress!

Turn off your cell phones and cut out the lights, take the time to watch Foreign Letters, it is a Golden Star!",1337904000,2,262,4.673913043478261
5076793,5,B007C6LDGK,"Great, great film.  This film should be shown in all schools as well as in the theatre.  It deals with the pleasures and pains of being different, best friends, bullying, shame,  and family love  - and does an amazing job.  I strongly recommend this film.",1336435200,2,255,4.5777777777777775
5076794,5,B007C6LDGK,"Ela Thier has created a loving, funny, beautifully paced, honest view of young friendship, and the angst of leaving a best friend and discovering a new one. Every moment hit home with nostalgic laughter and heartfelt empathy. This is a real movie with real people and relationships. You feel the love when Ellie leans against her grandfather, when her mother tries to comfort her, when her brother jumps on the bed with her, and when she dances and ice skates with her new best friend. It's rare to find a movie where the audience reacts as one, feeling the same emotions portrayed on the screen. A great script and skillful direction allowed young non-actors to give powerful performances.",1336435200,3,690,4.8559322033898304
5076795,5,B007C6LDGK,"I wanted to call up my best friend and tell her how much I love her after watching this film.  The events Foreign Letters portrays are even more heartwarming when you discover that they represent the director's own childhood story.  I became so interested in how the two girls communicated when one barely spoke English after first moving from Israel to Connecticut or how friends an ocean apart could still stay in touch, but you learn that geographical distance and cultural difference aren't enough to separate real friendships.  Their relationship flashes you back to a time of prank phone calls, dress up, and deep dark secrets that only your best friend can know and it made me want to turn the clocks back, just for a day.  I was also surprised by how great the director was at playing her own mother, and how I felt like I was a part of these memories that she was bringing to life again.  This film is a treat to watch all the way through to the last credit.",1333584000,3,967,4.471590909090909

5076799,5,B007C6LDGK,"I loved this movie! A lot of foreign films are hard for me to get into, but not this one. It was easy to follow, and once Ellie began speaking English more there were less subtitles to read. This is based on a true story, which makes it even better! It highlights the struggles of moving to America as a child that does not speak English. I would recomend",1473897600,2,355,4.159420289855072

5076808,5,B007C6LDGK,"Lovely, touching  story about two preadolescent girls and their problems as new immigrants in America.  One girl is Vietnamese, the other is Israeli.  Both are outsiders who find consolation in each other.  But it doesn't all go smoothly.  Very good acting from the children and a nicely polished story line give this movie a ""must see"" in my opinion.",1455580800,2,351,4.88135593220339

5076812,5,B007C6LDGK,"Foreign Letters is a beautiful film that deals with the theme of adolescent friendship between two girls from different cultural backgrounds. This theme is explored with credibility and poignancy, and my ten-year-old daughter and I loved it. The film explores the friendship  between two immigrant girls, Israeli Ellie and Vietnamese Thuy Le. Ellie feels lost in her new surroundings in the US, and exchanges frequent letters with her best friend in Israel, Shlomit. Ellie also struggles to master the English language, and finds herself being marginalized at school, until she meets Thuy, who has been in the States longer (I inferred this by Thuy's more masterful command of the English language). Thuy too is a bit of a loner at school and the two girls eventually connect and become good friends.

However, like most adolescent friendships, Ellie and Thuy's friendship does not always run smoothly - Ellie is rather bossy and demanding and has high expectations of her new best friend, expecting her friendly overtures to be reciprocated by Thuy, not realizing that Thuy has familial responsibilities and is also from a more economically disadvantaged background than Ellie.

Both my daughter and I loved watching the blossoming friendship between the two girls - one particular scene sticks in my mind: that of the two girls wearing the traditional Vietnamese costume, the ao dai and dancing a traditional Vietnamese dance together atop Thuy's apartment complex. Beautifully told and filmed, this is a poetic and poignant film on adolescent friendship that transcends cultural differences. Highly recommended.",1448323200,,1614,5.346456692913386

5076822,5,B007C6LDGK,"I think this is one of my favorite movies.
First, it is 100% clean, and deals with a deep friendship instead of a romance, which to me feels refreshing.
Second, it's hilarious. I am Jewish and spent time in Israel, so I am familiar with Israeli culture. So much of what the director has to say was spot on, in a very subtle way.
The acting was amazing, the plot, simple and sweet.
Thank you for this touching film.",1418428800,,414,4.253164556962025

5076826,4,B007C6LDGK,"I enjoyed viewing ""Foreign Letters"" because the film had a natural way of showing the adjustment immigrant children must make to life in the U.S.  Besides learning a new language, the child must also learn the different ways and customs of the new country.  ""Foreign Letters"" was able to show an Israeli family and a vietnamese family trying to fit into American society in a humerous and compassionate way.  I enjoyed watching the two girls forming a deep friendship.  In additon, the singing by Chava Albertstein at the beginning of the film was very nice.  She has a beautiful voice.",1403481600,,586,4.82

5076828,3,B007C6LDGK,"Not as charmed as I thought I would be given the other reviews.  First of all ""foreign letters"":  it's a pun, a double entendre--make sure to get the joke.  The film tries pretty hard, and that is part of its problem:  so much feels forced and obvious.  ""America is a tough town.""  Kids are rambunctious and not always courteous.  It's hard coming somewhere where language and culture are different.  We get it.  From an educator's point of view, the film was a little aggravating.  The ESL teacher is subtly--but inexplicably--blamed for Ellie's initial problems with language and culture, but why aren't the parents helping her with English in the home?  And early in the film, rather than thinking the teacher of poor quality, one is led to believe that Ellie is either stupid or doesn't try very hard:  she meets most of her teachers' honest and straightforward attempts to teach her with bovine looks of incomprehension--in fact, this aspect is so overplayed that Ellie does seem a bit slow.  However, after she is unable to learn English from a very capable and helpful teacher she deems ""bad,"" she begins to magically take it in from another otherwise mute international student.  Then we get the equivalent of a ""Rocky Gets Into Fighting Shape In The Time It Takes 'Gonna Fly Now' To Play"" scene in which Ellie suddenly masters English--the process exceedingly blurry.  After several seasons, one asked why Balki and Latka weren't adjusting any better than they were.  (That is pre-mise, Coosin Laarry!  Don't be re-dick-u-loos!) Maybe all they needed was each other...  All that said:  nice friendship flick...it's cute...but I was not so very taken in by it, and I was put off by the Taxi/Perfect Strangers stereotype of international students in the first third of the film and what is implied about them throughout.  (Most internationals are not nearly the poor little wandering sheep portrayed in this film--I mean, by the end, despite mastering English during a three minute song, Ellie STILL has no other friends!--and neither does Thuy after two years in the States!..)  (I guess I can't help mentioning two other laughable stereotype scenes before ending this:  the one in which Ellie has NEVER heard of Christmas--she is from Israel, you see, and her family is Jewish, so how could she have ever heard of Christmas???!  And then Thuy's mother does not believe that Ellie does not curl her hair--because, you see, most Asians have STRAIGHT hair and have never heard of naturally curly hair!  These scenes are just insulting...)",1374710400,2,2544,4.945754716981132

5076830,5,B007C6LDGK,Cuts to the heart of a lot of complicated political and social issues by showing them through the straightforward lens of a child's eye. Wonderful acting and directing. Couldn't be better. FYI - Noa Rotstein is one of the young actors... Ela Thier should be listed as the author/director of the film.,1347580800,2,300,4.788461538461538
5076831,5,B007C6LDGK,I thoroughly enjoyed the directors story of her own early teenage years. The film was moving and thoroughly enjoyable. I highly recommend it.,1347321600,3,141,5.173913043478261
5076832,5,B007C6LDGK,Such a beauty of a film! I was deeply moved by the extraordinary friendship between the two girls. The quality of the writing and the directing prove that Ela Thier is a proficient filmmaker. She has the talent to tell us sweet simple stories with straightforward and expressive filmmaking. The two girls are adorable and the story touched me very deeply with its universal appeal. I strongly recommended it!,1338940800,2,408,4.927536231884058
5076833,5,B007C6LDGK,"I had the pleasure of seeing a screening of Foreign Letters on a big screen last night, at the 92Y Tribeca Cinema in NYC.  It's a beautiful film, and I was deeply moved by it.  The story weaves a number of threads into a whole that is heartfelt, touching, and both specific and universal.  I found myself in tears a few times as I connected to the heartbreak of the girls and their struggle to find friendship and acceptance in a new country with a new culture.  The direction is excellent, the two young girls are fantastic, and the film looks incredible.  There is wonderful music as well, and it's a story that I believe will touch anyone who watches it.  I heartily recommend seeing this film!",1338422400,2,697,4.448818897637795

5076835,5,B007C6LDGK,"Childhood is both heartbreaking and breathtaking.  With extraordinary craft and soul, not to mention massive talent, Ela Thier unfolds before us this complex world through the friendship between two ""outsider"" girls in 1980s Connecticut.  The nuances of a classroom, a cafeteria, a walk in the forest, a dance on a roof, dinnertime in two different kitchens, and an ice skating rink filled with boys - all illuminate without one wasted gesture or world the universe these two young friends navigate.

I had not realized, until watching Foreign Letters, how the story of childhood friendship so rarely gets told unless something is being blown up. But Foreign Letters proves that the story of love between friends, unfolding without special effects, is the real action adventure.",1338422400,6,778,5.258064516129032
