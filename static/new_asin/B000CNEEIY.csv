8099524,4,B000CNEEIY,"The production quality is not very good: the colors and shading are noticably washed out and the shots of the screen are notoriously fuzzy (I had to go back and forth to my Pro Tools software to be able to see what they were talking about at times).  However, the coverage and perspective they gave me in pulling together all the parts of this complex program was VERY well done.  I took an online 12 week course at Berklee College of Music to learn how to use Pro Tools and I don't think that I knew how to pull it all together until this video.  I have not compared this to other products so I don't know how it compares.  I'm very happy with the time spent on this DVD, however. You need to use the pause button and take notes.  Some pretty dense material.  Prior nodding familiarity with Pro Tools is recommended.  It features version 6.x on a Mac, but as a PC user, I still got 98% of the material.  I noticed that the hand clapping finally stopped about a third of the way thru the movie.  They must have reviewed the earlier takes during the filming.  THAT was annoying, but I'll get over it.",1139616000,,1099,4.265700483091788
8099525,5,B000CNEEIY,I was able to get moving with this a lot faster than I did with the manual that comes with Pro Tools... Great Job!,1138492800,,114,3.7916666666666665
8099526,1,B000CNEEIY,"This DVD is a completely amateur production. I've seen better high school video productions. The material was not presented in a straightforward manner. There is more footage of Bob & Brett than of the Pro-Tools interface. There is little to no attention paid to detail or accuracy. For example, they show you how to arm the click track for recording as if they were going to record audio to the click track itself. Brett probably says ""So"" and claps his hands about 50 times. I don't know the total for sure because I couldn't stomach the whole DVD. It looked as if they had no script at all. They were kind of just winging it as they went along. It was a very unprofessional and uninformative production overall. Not worth the DVD case it came in.",1138233600,,749,4.514705882352941
