Lynn is an excellent instructor. Her cuing is spot on. She explains the moves before she does them but without overdoing it. Who wants to stand around while an instructor talks and talks.

There is a modifier for people who want to take it down a notch. I have tried both variations and the workout with the modifier will still get your heart rate up.

I have done kickboxing for several years and after getting burned out on Billy Blanks, I purchased a previous DVD from Lynn. I was excited when this one became available.

There is a learning curve as some of the moves are different to what one is used to, but that is what keeps this DVD from becoming boring.

There is also an instructional section for those who have never done this type of workout before.

All in all an excellent workout and one that I have recommended to friends.",1227139200,3,1009,4.397849462365591
