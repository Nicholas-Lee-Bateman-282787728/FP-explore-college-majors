My only issue is after episode six on the set I bought, the translations are terrible! Even the names are changed! Had I not watched it on YouTube like 75x already, I would not be able to follow. But other than that, I was still happy over all!",1441497600,,386,4.375

8609352,5,B001GQV4CU,Shibatora is one of my and my kids' favorite Japanese series.  The development of both the stories and the characters were interesting.  We practiced our Japanese and it was fun.  I loved the surprises in this series and many times we would point our finger at someone and say that this was the culprit but then we found out that it was someone else.  Guessing was fun.,1255910400,,369,4.462686567164179
