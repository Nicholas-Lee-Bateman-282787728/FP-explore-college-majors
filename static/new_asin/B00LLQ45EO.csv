6490484,5,B00LLQ45EO,I just reviewed the trilogy. Salting the Battlefiled is a great ending. Except we'd all love more ;),1417219200,,100,4.611111111111111
6490485,5,B00LLQ45EO,"Third in the trilogy of Johnny Worricker (Page Nine and Turks and Caicos were the first and second ones).  These stories are GREAT.  Great writing, fantastic acting, and the settings are really wonderful!  The heading on Amazon says ""Ralph Fiennes"" on it as though he is a star - he's only the Prime Minister.  The Star and the story line is about Bill Nighy's character who has scruples, values and works as a analyst for the MI5.  Also appearing is the wonderful Helena Bonham Carter.  Watch all three one right after the other.  You cannot go wrong!.",1417219200,,553,4.639175257731959
6490486,5,B00LLQ45EO,"Along with ""Page Eight"" tis I now a classic, and it will last forever.  It was wonderful to watch, and to think about.",1416614400,2,118,4.130434782608695
6490487,2,B00LLQ45EO,"...is that Johnny Worricker, despite the sympathy that Bill Nighy inspires in the viewer and all the tough but ethical characters he encounters over three episodes ends up not being anyone's idea of a proper hero. He jettisons the two genuine emotional relationships in his life in order to return to a job in a system where ""the establishment always wins"" and where it's revealed he was actually only a pawn.

I loved the legion of talent involved here, but the whole Worricker trilogy was a disappointment. David goes up against Goliath and at the moment of confrontation, he wimps out. Finally it was a true shame to blow all that jazz on just another cog in a corrupt machine. Cool music is for heroes....And just because it comes out of England and looks stylish, doesn't mean it's up to snuff.",1416268800,8,799,4.666666666666667
6490488,2,B00LLQ45EO,"Like the suffering inflicted upon the audience with The Politician's Wife, the operatives are given terrible things to express while maneuvering an enemy target out of the circle of influence.  It's expressed in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.  And like TTSS, this final episode encourages enemy operatives to turncoat because unrealistically,  it might work out for you if you whistleblow - which if they really wanted to successfully propagandize this, Edward Snowden would be back in America and employed.

The previous episode Turks and Caicos only picked up near the end with Helena Bonham Carter's arrival after Winona Ryder at rolled out her touching/manipulative/explains everything confidence/hint that she was passed around to Funny Uncles as if the characterization of child sexual abuse is  a cart pushed out by some flight attendant with the ginger ale and peanuts.

This entire episode spares us that (very American?) just add water emotional plunge.",1416182400,2,959,5.402684563758389
6490489,3,B00LLQ45EO,"The third part of this trilogy starts out very slowly with agents Johnny Worricker (Bill Nighy) and his partner Margot Tyrell (Helena Bonham Carter) on the run. A half an hour into the episode, not much had happened but Worricker and Tyrell hopping trains, cabs and running.  The plot is a carry over from the last episode - something about the prime minister involved in a dodgy investment company which builds secret prisons for terrorists which Worricker knows about and wants to divulge to the press.  But Worricker and Tyrell are being followed by about everybody it seems.

There's lots of running around with interesting characters who are underdeveloped, and more interesting actors: Ralph Fiennes, Judy Davis, Rupert Graves etc.  The acting talent may be superior to the plot here. Felt it lacked cohesiveness and a compelling central conflict. It was written by David Hare, award winning playwright, director and screenwriter.  The action just meandered, but that may be subjective on my part. It does have a kind of offbeat charm, so am conflicted on it.  Really fun to see the actors engaging with each other on this film.  The director is talented, so maybe I'm just not seasoned enough with good drama to appreciate it.  It's definitely not formulaic. I considered turning it off, but like the actors and setting.  Maybe it just wasn't my cup of tea. See what you think. Enjoyed the scenery.",1416096000,5,1405,4.919491525423729
6490490,5,B00LLQ45EO,"This was an incredibly well-written and well-acted spy drama. It was very remeniscent of the George Smiley dramas of the '90's, with the over-lay of the British political  and bureaucratic web constantly playing into its resolution. While there was no Alec Guiness, it was very very close.",1414195200,32,289,5.148936170212766
6490491,5,B00LLQ45EO,Great performance by Bill Nighy and Helea Bonham Carter.  Also Judy Davis and Ralph Fiennes.,1431820800,,92,5.133333333333334

6490496,5,B00LLQ45EO,I liked this spy movie. I like the acting and the story line. It was a British style series and I like it because it was different.,1425686400,,131,3.888888888888889
6490497,4,B00LLQ45EO,"Not quite as good as Page Eight but with many of the same virtues. And definitely superior to the middle episode, Turks and Caicos. I'd say the character of Worriker is the definitive Bill Nighy role. BTW I thought the Worriker trilogy was similar in tone and story line to the excellent State of Play, another good Bill Nighy vehicle as the no-nonsense newspaper editor. My only disappointment is that in the featurette there's no interview with Judy Davis, a fairly significant omission since one could argue her character sets things in motion and continues as puppet master throughout. What I liked about Battlefield was that they left quite a bit open. Can we dare hope for a fourth installment?",1425427200,,700,4.841666666666667
6490498,5,B00LLQ45EO,Great 3 part series. Really enjoy Bill Nighy!,1424908800,,45,4.75
6490499,4,B00LLQ45EO,The final installment in the Johnny Worricker trilogy and it did not disappoint. Bill Nighy is as affable as ever and Helena Bonham Carter surprises as a spy once again. This political/spy movie is great for a night off when you don't want to think too hard and just want to be entertained.,1424736000,,290,4.490566037735849

6490515,5,B00LLQ45EO,"Having seen the first two movies in the series, I had to see the third, so I picked it up as soon as I could.  I enjoyed them all, but I think this is the best, so for me the series finishes strong.  As David Hare admits, in the ""Special Feature"" that comes with the film, it IS the most generic of the three -- an apparently rogue spy, on the run in Europe, with a woman he loves, and trying to stay one step ahead of the pursuit. Shades of Jason Bourne?  No, don't worry!  Meanwhile back in London, an increasingly worried Prime Minister (Ralph Fiennes), is reduced to asking, ""Where's Worricker?"" at frequent intervals.  What Worricker (Bill Nighy) is doing while on the run is trying to use his contacts in the press to get questions raised about the PM's financial connections to a company called Gladstone and a non-profit called The Bridge, which he seems to have used to connect himself to certain CIA operations that have cost the American taxpayer dear as well as seeming to have set up something for himself, using the Bridge and its CEO (Rupert Graves) to disguise the fact.  Fiennes as the PM, Alec Beasley, gives an excellent performance as a very tough, hard-nosed politician under pressure.  How tough? Just see him on the rowing machine and you know he's formidable.

In the interest of avoiding spoilers, I'll say nothing of how Worricker gets his story out, but as it develops -- and it's not an overnight scandal -- the Acting Head of MI5, Jill Tankard (Judy Davis, last seen in ""Page Eight"") smells blood in the water and seeks to make contact with Deputy Prime Minister Anthea Catcheside (Saskia Reeves), who would become PM if Beasley were to resign.  The meetings of these two, in what might be called ""an undisclosed secret location"" are little comic gems.  Meanwhile Worricker and his girlfriend Margo (Helena Bonham Carter), herself an ex-MI5 operative, work hard to sneak back into England to be there when it all hits the fan.  This goes relatively smoothly for Worricker, but Margo has to do a little running.  It's not at all in the Bourne class.  Back home, though, Worricker has to deal with a resentful pregnant daughter in addition to the PM himself.

Up to this point, the generic elements in the plot have been very enjoyably disposed, with never a gun in sight, and some nice European location shooting, and with plenty of suspense.  Where the movie transcends the generic, however, is in the writing of the final confrontation between Worricker and Beasley.  It's a credit to both actors that this scene has nothing generic about it, and we realize how well their characters have been written throughout the series to make this showdown credible.  In fact, the writing has been excellent throughout, and Nighy, Fiennes, Davis and Reeves do very good work, even if Davis and Reeves have rather flatter parts than the men.  The woman who has a more complicated character is Margo, and Helena Bonham Carter gives a very appealing performance in the role -- one of her best, I think, and as far as one can get from the neo-Gothic excesses of Bellatrix LeStrange in the ""Potter"" movies.  In a strongly-acted series, her performance was a particularly pleasant surprise, and to say that she's aging gracefully would be an understatement.",1419638400,6,3270,4.725352112676056

6490517,4,B00LLQ45EO,"Salting the Battlefield is the last of the Worricker films. Part one (Page Eight) was great, Turks and Caicos for me was a little disappointing. But the 3rd installment was a return to the British approach to the end of the story. True, he didn't come out the hero but thats real life right? The guy you want to win, doesn't. It's funny how Worricker in Page Eight rushed to leave the country, and in part 2, he's hiding out, and in part 3 he just sort of walks back into the picture, right into the office of the prime minister....like, no real consequences, he never had to leave in the first place.....they offered him his job back, and all forgotten. Those details aside, the Worricker trilogy is a well done and very well acted spy series, and I hope they make more, though they are saying no on that....I recommend the series. Bill Nighy rocks it.....he was made to play this role. Tall, thin, well dressed, well mannered, he owns the role...funny though in all 3 films, he loses the girl, all attractive female co-stars, they all go away...nice work Bill!",1418688000,,1062,4.536458333333333

8666472,4,B00LLQ45EO,"If you have not watched any of this trilogy, I highly recommend that you sit down and watch all three in order. I saw these with big gaps between them and that didn't help. The first one is the best and is a stand alone film. Bill Nighy is the lead in all of them and that is the trilogy's strength. It is about a British spy who came into opposition with the prime minister and his affiliations. The PM is played by Ralph Fiennes who has tended towards more villainous roles of late. Nighy had to hide out in the islands for awhile, which forms Part 2 of the trilogy. In this last part he comes back to England. The question is how is he going to finish up his life. Is he going finish up the fight with the PM and go back to being a spy? Or is he going to make a life for himself and his girlfriend, played by Helena Bonham Carter. His oldest friend even tells us that he was ideally cut out for the Church. The only problem was that he didn't believe in God. Coming home also means he has an ex wife and a pregnant daughter to bring back into his life (or not). I liked this from the standpoint of finally wrapping everything up and they do so with a strong element of realism. On the negative side, I feel they were also running out of steam with this vehicle and at some points the story dragged because there wasn't enough material to use in this last part. So we got scenes which were totally unnecessary and others which were much too long for what they were. So on one hand, I did want to see the ending and I achieved that BUT they definitely did not have as much material as they needed to make it a rousing finale.",1432512000,2,1626,4.084375
