For the true PB fan, I would also recommend the CD of the soundtrack.  Not only will you get to hear what a fine singer she is, you will also appreciate more how the music meshes with the movie, for example when Alys sings 'Amour' to her cherished little brother from the stage in Montreal.  Being a non-French speaker, you might get distracted by the English subtitles during this scene.  Listening to it in your car on the way to work, as the French words take shape in your brain, you will better understand why this particular song was chosen for this scene, and just how perfect it is.

But back to the movie--great acting, great music, great singing and dancing by Pascale Bussieres, and great costumes.  She has never looked more fabulous.",1314230400,4,854,4.592105263157895
8070077,5,B0009XXHQ2,"If you've had your fill of Hollywood biographical films with more emphasis on the actor playing the role than the subject of the bio - this film is a cure. Pascale Bussires gives a stunning performance reaching far beyond her usual, beautiful, subtlety. So ""Chica Chica Boom"" isn't just a book for kids!",1175385600,4,303,4.735849056603773
