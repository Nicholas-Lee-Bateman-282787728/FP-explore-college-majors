8159934,5,B000L21DNU,"I bought this DVD mainly for two reasons: first, because it's Placido Domingo, and second, because of the views of Seville. If you love to hear beautiful operatic arias sung by a superb singer, with beautiful background scenery, then you'll love this DVD. The entire DVD is beautiful, but I don't want to write a long review, so I'm just going to mention my two favorite sections, starting with my second favorite, Finch'han dal Vino from the opera Don Giovanni. He sings this aria from atop the balconies, hallways and roof of a beautiful tower in Seville. On the ground, we see an elderly Leporello gesturing to Don Giovanni. Look closely, and you'll see that Leporello is also Placido Domingo. He plays two parts in this scene, even though he only sings one. This is a baritone part, but he's been known to sing baritone roles on film or audio in the past.

On to my favorite scene: the duet between Count Almaviva and Figaro from the first act of the Barber of Seville--All'idea di quel metallo.  Placido Domingo plays the part of Figaro, the baritone. And the tenor part of Almaviva is sung by (who else?) Placido Domingo. What a beautiful duet, with the ""two of them"" walking through the streets and alleys of Seville, rather than being confined to a small stage, as is usually the case. You have to look very closely because the make-up (and the editing) is done so well, you'll swear it's two different people. Brilliantly done. I love this part so much that I'm going to wear it out on the DVD. I wish he'd done the entire opera singing both of these parts himself.

The rest of the DVD is just as beautiful, visually and musically. I must also mention the Flower Song and the finale from Carmen with Victoria Vergara playing the part of the gypsy temptress. Placido Domingo was the perfect Don Jose in these beautifully executed scenes.

This DVD is one that I'll come back to again and again. It has a special place on my opera DVD shelf.",1294531200,,1949,4.56
8159935,5,B000L21DNU,"Lip-syncs and all, I loved it!  But then, I love Domingo!  My husband, The Opera Hater, even watched and enjoyed the travelogue aspect.

An especially nice feature: Domingo's duets with himself.",1250812800,4,194,5.193548387096774
8159936,4,B000L21DNU,"Greatly enjoyed this DVD. However, no credit was given to the two sopranos. Their names were completely ommited. Especially, Virginia Alonso was wonderful in El Gato Montes.",1204329600,3,173,5.444444444444445
8159937,5,B000L21DNU,"Ditto to the two former reviewers comments.
I saw this program years ago on PBS and I made a VHS tape of it.
I am so glad to have it now on DVD.
I just watched it for the second time and I am sure I will watch it many,many times.",1199404800,2,229,3.5098039215686274
8159938,5,B000L21DNU,Beautiful musical performance and scenery. I enjoyed this DVD very much and can highly recommend it.,1192060800,,100,5.3125
8159939,4,B000L21DNU,"This somewhat dated 2007 DVD release of a 1992 Domingo tribute to the city of Seville, Spain and the operas that came from this romantic setting is as much a loving tribute from the star as it is a travelogue, of sorts, that admirably lives up to the name of the DVD ""Hommage."" Directed by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, with James Levine conducting the Weiner Symphoniker orchestra the listener (and viewer) will be lip-synced through some of the more familiar melodies in the opera repertoire - and a few extras, such as the opening title, ""Sevilla es"" - a combination of travelogue and song and the various commentaries that I found as interesting as the music. Mr. Domingo's personality and affection for his topic and the city's history are transparent, and the vitality and easy romanticism of the people of Seville is compelling and seductive. So, what's not to like? Other than the lip-syncing and contrived operatic scenes, very little. For the musical numbers I would much rather have seen Domingo in a studio intermixed with scenes of the city and countryside. But, that's a director's choice that in this case and in my view detracted, and always detracts in DVDs such as this. Even though dated and with the preceding caveat, this DVD is saved by its rich color, its rich subject matter, and the voice of its guide, Mr. Domingo. I sat listening to and was transfixed by Mr. Domingo's passion, his voice and the wonderful scenes of steeped churches, castles, busy markets, festivals, dancers -- and the charm of Seville's narrow alleys, colorful streets and historic architecture. Too bad this wasn't filmed in widescreen. But, you can't go back. We have what we have, and if you own it on tape and enjoyed it, this upgrade to DVD is a worthy item to stock and own.",1190592000,16,1768,4.762214983713355
8159940,5,B000L21DNU,"This is a very special DVD.  The scenery is splendid; the commentary, as only Domingo can give it, and the music outstanding.  The surprise duets of Domingo and Domingo were innovative and beautiful.  Evey Domingo fan should be the proud owner of this DVD.",1184457600,8,256,4.7727272727272725
