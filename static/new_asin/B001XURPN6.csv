8347742,5,B001XURPN6,"I love watching Indian movies and have been curious about Taj Mahal, so I bought this DVD. I actually enjoyed watching it because it was not a fancied up tourism video. I also thought this DVD captured the real Indian people's life on the street and public places very well around New Delhi and Taj Mahal area. Of course, people in video were not Mumbai movie stars we see in Indian movies, but normal friendly Indian faces. I was always wondering what rural areas of India was like, and this video gave me pretty good idea. The photos taken at Taj Mahal and other places with white monkeys were very charming.",1452556800,,610,4.504504504504505

8347744,1,B001XURPN6,"This dvd was like the narrators home movie of his trip. Although, he does give some historical backgrounds to the sights it is definitely not worth what you pay. I was bored with it and it didn't even excite me to want to go on my trip!",1277942400,2,236,4.042553191489362
