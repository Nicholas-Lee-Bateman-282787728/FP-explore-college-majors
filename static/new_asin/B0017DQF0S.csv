8265803,1,B0017DQF0S,"The title and the artwork on the cover are what drew me to this DVD from 2002.  Unfortunately, both are a lie.  I shall break it down:

TITLE: School of Bondage Volume 1
The story *is* set in a school, and there are a teacher and a student who both accept a male student as their ""master,"" but at no point is anyone bound.  Also, there is only one half-hour episode on the disc, so it is hardly a ""volume.""

ART: A Japanese schoolgirl, bound in her gym uniform in a gymnasium, in obvious distress
This is a scene that is not even on this DVD.  It's probably from one of the two other episodes of the series, but at $20 per half-hour episode, I'm not about to waste more money to find out.  Especially not for a boring ""slave-master"" story.

The art is only okay, and the voice acting leaves a LOT to be desired.  Even the Japanese audio track looks like it was dubbed, as the voices don't come close to matching the mouth movements.  Finally, there are problems with the sound, as the level drops and rises several times throughout the show.

The sex scenes are alright, and they are quite graphic, depicting a boy taking control of his teacher and student president with sadistic glee, but this is not what I expected when I bought the DVD.

My recommendation?  Skip this one and save your money.",1313280000,,1297,4.354166666666667
8265804,5,B0017DQF0S,Anime + Bondage. I'm pretty sure this has been out of print for a while. It's a classic bondage piece.,1307059200,,102,4.15
