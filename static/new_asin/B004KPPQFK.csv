4398059,5,B004KPPQFK,"""Dhobi Ghat"" is a film that revolves around five characters: firstly, the city of Mumbai itself, followed by four individuals, some of whom have been drawn to Mumbai from other parts of India.  Arun (Aamir Khan) is an angsty, moody artist whose inner life we never fully penetrate; Shai (Monica Dogra) is an Americanized Indian who is on sabbatical from her finance job in the US; Munna (Prateik) is a washerman (in the Dhobi Ghat area of the city) and aspiring movie star, who came to Mumbai at a young age to escape poverty; and Yasmin (Kriti Malhotra) is a young woman who migrated to Mumbai from Uttar Pradesh after getting married.  The film is a window into their four lives, as individuals and also in the ways their lives intersect.  Mumbai stands as the connecting element - the city that, for very different reasons, drew them to itself.  Although the city's landscape and movement is filmed beautifully by writer/director Kiran Rao, we also get the sense that Mumbai can be an imposing, and perhaps coldly indifferent, presence.  Not all of the characters' lives are affected positively by their time in the city.

The performances are top-caliber from all involved.  Aamir Khan has the least lines of anyone, but he conveys everything necessary (and more) through his face alone. He is utterly convincing as a sullen but gifted painter.  The character of Shai is immediately grating, which is probably a testament to the performance of Monica Dogra, as it seems her character was meant to be jarringly at odds with the landscape around her; she is seemingly unaware of the easy affluence of her life.  While Arun lives in a decaying (but bright and airy) apartment in a crowded neighborhood of the city, Shai lives in a hermetically sealed highrise apartment, cloistered from the city's sounds and smells.  She belongs to a circle of wealthy, educated urbanites who are skeptical of her plan to photograph the inner workings of the city.  Whether you see Shai's interests as grounded in a genuine desire to understand Mumbai, or simply a desire to photograph ""the natives"", as it were, probably depends on your reaction to her character as a whole.  She breezily initiates a friendship with the young man who washes her clothes, without fully understanding the consequences of that friendship.

The young man is Munna, the aspiring actor.  I had only seen Prateik in a small role in one other film, and I was very impressed with his performance here.  He is perfect as a reticent and still-naive laborer with other goals for his life.  Some of his scenes can be heartbreaking, but his narrative arc will leave you feeling that he'll make it in the world, somehow.

The character of Yasmin was the standout for me. She is the most enigmatic figure in the film, yet somehow also the most revealed and certainly the most touching. The pace of this film is slow, but there is a moment toward the end involving Yasmin's character in which Arun and the audience make a simultaneous, sudden realization that will have your heart skipping a beat.

Overall, the film is a thoughtful meditation on Mumbai and its inhabitants, punctuated with beautiful photographs (ostensibly taken by Shai, though they feel like they could be Kiran Rao's own photographs). The minimalist musical score combined with the city is slightly reminiscent of scenes from ""Lost in Translation"", though I don't want to imply that this film needs an American comparison or equivalent - it certainly doesn't.  The stories end ambiguously, as stories tend to do in real life as well.",1302134400,13,3557,4.868988391376451

8433294,5,B004KPPQFK,"This movie haunts me.  The characters moved into my life, bit by bit, step by step.  They are nicely realized because the story is not rushed, does not throw drama at the viewer.  This is a bit of life and should be enjoyed with a pace that our own lives don't often allow.  See the light as it changes, hear the echoes of other voices, and feel the emotions of these people as they pass through--then watch it again to see and feel more.
I have discovered the pleasure of the extra features, and the tracks on Dhobi Ghat will reward the viewer: the auditions will reveal surprising attributes of the players; and Kiran Rao shows deleted scenes that she regrets having cut and not restored to the final version.  Please, Ms Rao, please re-release the film with some of those cuts and give us a better resolution to Arun's plans.
Aamir Khan's Arun may not be the central figure of the story, but he gives us another compelling performance.  The others are all splendid, but nobody can compete with Aamir Khan.",1453161600,,1008,4.510989010989011

8433296,5,B004KPPQFK,"Not your typical Bollywood production: no song and dance numbers, an understated score, and quite short in length, at least by Bollywood standards. The story is subtle, yet filled with pathos; tragic yet recognizably human. I was deeply touched by both story lines: Intense painter, Aamir Khan becomes fascinated by mysterious video tapes left behind in his new apartment; and the parallel story of the visiting photographer and her friendship with laundry walla; the tangential intersection into each other's lives was perfectly executed. This is probably not a movie for everyone, many would find it slow moving, but I could watch this movie over and over again and not tire of it. Dhobi Ghat is among my top 5 favorite Aamir Khan films. Nice that the screenplay was written by his wife. Excellent husband-wife teamwork.",1447027200,,822,5.0962962962962965
8433297,4,B004KPPQFK,"I enjoyed the film and I have watched it several times.  I am not Hindi-I'm an American, but, I have been addicted to Hindi films for over 20 years.  Dhobi Ghat is a good `think piece' and it reminds me that people are the same everywhere.  The same experiences, problems, emotions and reactions. one point that stood out in my mind is that poverty is the scourge of the world.  America has just as much a caste system as does India.  Sad.

8433298,4,B004KPPQFK,"Not the usual musical rom-com from India but a triangle love drama that seems to borrow more from Argentinian and European film in showing the love, tragedy and suspense as the wealthy and the poor interact in Mumbai. Naturalistic cinematography showing how Mumbai breathes life; comfortably well acted by both novice and experienced actors; an acoustic stringed musical score by Santaolalla that gently guides the viewer through the life of the city along with our three protagonists. This is one of the few westernized Bollywood movies that I've seen that integrated both worlds without seeming commercial, shallow, misleading or culturally compromising.",1326931200,,656,5.5049504950495045
8433299,4,B004KPPQFK,"The most successful movies are the ones which draw the viewer into the story. Where we feel the pain, the agony, the happiness and the unsurity of the characters. Dhobi Ghat is Aamir Khan's unique attempt at making a movie which is NOT larger than life instead it is life itself. His most sterling performance to date. To be enjoyed WITHOUT company.

8433300,5,B004KPPQFK,"Dhobi Ghat was released in January 2011 in India. It constitutes the directing debut of Kiran Roa, Mrs Aamir Khan.

The story (spoiler-free):
The lives of 4 people in Mumbai (Bombay) who happen to cross paths and to develop relationships with each other. Arun is a lonely painter. He meets Shai and bonds with her during the inauguration of his artwork in a gallery. She's on a sabbatical year and want to devote time to her hobby: photography. She becomes friend with her dhobi (washerman), who is also Arun's dhobi. He's a simple guy dreaming of becoming a bollywood actor. At his new home, Arun finds video recordings made by Yasmin, the previous owner, and he becomes fascinated...

The first great achievement of this film is its screenplay, written by Kiran Rao. The danger for a mosaic movie is to have its story drift endlessly or split in too many branches. It's not the case in Dhobi Ghat, and on the contrary it keeps a strong core around which the various characters and stories revolve. What is this core? The city of Mumbai of course, the 5th character of the movie, as the director claims... but not only.

The english title of the movie, Mumbai Diaries, could also have been ""Mumbai Visions"". Yasmin makes video recordings of Mumbai as she discovers the city. Shai wants to photograph the real Mumbai. Munna creates another self through Shai's camera, to reach the filmi scene of Mumbai. Arun gets his inspiration by watching the city, or watching the city as seen by Yasmin. One scene I really appreciated is Shai unnoticed taking pictures of Arun watching Yasmin's recordings. So, instead of just having the characters wander in Mumbai, the core of the movie is the sights the city impresses on its inhabitants and our protagonists.

The next achievement of Dhobi Ghat is its direction: refined, subtle, it delivers sights of Mumbai in a very intimate way. It's completely appropriate for the screenplay (well, logical, since both story and shooting are from Kiran Rao), and probably helps us rapidly feel close to the characters. I particularly liked all the scenes recorded by Yasmin, featuring small everyday events, but yet really meaningful and emotional. But it's also a strong technical direction, as is enough to prove it that scene where Munna runs in the middle of Mumbai chaotic trafic. A real moment of cinema.

To finish, the third good point of the film is its cast. Aamir Khan is flawless, as usual, though in the rather unusual role for him of a loner (he's done that kind of roles before, but not very often). Kriti Malhotra is a particularly moving and very beautiful Yasmin, Prateik Babbar excels in the role of the shy Munna, and Monica Dogra (who's also a singer and can be heard for instance on the soundtrack of Break Ke Baad) plays very naturally the modern American-Indian Shai.

The only thing I liked less in Dhobi Ghat is its end, a bit too open to my taste. But that's very subjective and on the whole the film deserves praise for its coherence, its sensibility and its artistic direction. A very good movie.",1308528000,4,3055,4.754716981132075
8433301,4,B004KPPQFK,"Full of light, rain, color, joy, sorrow and all that is life: it's a must-see. Absolutely loved the film. For a debut film, it's superb. Not perfect, but in the aggregate, phenomenally moving, sweet, powerful. Unforgettable.

Yasmin...heartbreakingly lovely.",1306540800,,258,5.7894736842105265
8433302,4,B004KPPQFK,"Dhobi Ghat marks the debut of Kiran Rao and is a a video diary of Mumbai, shot mostly on location in Mumbai. There are four characters in the film, Aamir Khan is Jai, the reclusive painter, Shai ( Monica Dogra ) who is an investment banker on sabbatical from the U.S. Munna ( Prateik Babbar) the washer-man, the young bride Yasmin ( Kirti Malhotra)whose video diaries chronicle her elation at arriving in Mumbai as a young bride to her fateful decision. Finally there is the background, which I would call the fifth character which is city of Mumbai. Ms. Rao the director carefully weaves all these stories together in an uneven mosaic which stays with you after the film.
Aamir as Aarun excels and that is expected but I give him more credit for staying in the background in his own production and letting the other actors and story do the bidding. Monica Dogra, is an investment banker who in in a platonic friendship with a laundry man, etches a balanced role and adds an important dimension to the film,watching her in the final scene in the car is a treat. However I feel that the accolades should go to Prateik Babbar as Munna who essays this role with such a conviction that makes you think if acting is in the genes ( he is the son of Smita Patil and Raj Babbar). Then there is Kirti Malhotra as Yasmin who records her mumbai experience for her brother who cannot visit. Her characters conclusion will shock you. Then there is Mumbai, it has been shot so beautifully and never looked so full of life. I loved the film and I think you will too. Four stars 4-10-11",1302480000,3,1570,4.473867595818815
