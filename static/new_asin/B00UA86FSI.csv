7031569,2,B00UA86FSI,"Despite the reviews, this is a mediocre performance at best.  Macbeth is a much more difficult play than many realize, especially for the two leads.  Both he and his lady are not just bellowing thunder hammers, but many of their finest speeches require a deep and quiet mode of introspection.  I did not hear that kind of performance here.",1440806400,13,339,4.711864406779661

7031571,5,B00UA86FSI,"I have not seen the Scottish Play performed in a long time and was quite pleased with this rendition. Like the other Shakespeare Globe Theatre performances it was wonderful to see it as you might have seen it in the first production with costumes of that period.
I have a very personal relationship with this play being a distant descendant of Duncan, and Malcolm on my mother's side.",1437350400,5,384,4.661764705882353

8704908,5,B00UA86FSI,"""Hamlet"" is widely thought to be Shakespeare's ""greatest tragedy."" Those who love ""Hamlet"" may have it. I much prefer ""Macbeth"", Shakespeare's fascinating and frightening tale of ambition leading to murder, paranoia, and madness. I have looked for years for a perfect production of ""Macbeth"", and this Globe On Screen presentation may well be it. This presentation comes the closest I have seen to capturing the immediacy and excitement of live theatre on video; an extremely difficult thing to do. The Globe is ""Theatre in The Round. And somehow, the cameras get SO CLOSE; and in High-Definition at that. Much of the action practically takes place in the audiences' laps. Just as Macbeth and Lady Macbeth (Joseph Millson and Samantha Spiro) are trapped in their own web of murderous mayhem, the audience likely feels trapped inside the play as well.
  ""Macbeth"" is often called ""The Scottish Play"" and ""The Cursed Play"" as well. Appropriately, this production begins with the loud sounds of Scottish bagpipes. Those bagpipes grow annoying pretty quickly. But this is all done to establish an off-kilter, disturbing mood. The cast enters with drums and other instruments; all of this sounding like a screaming battle cry.
  Macbeth is surprised by the predictions of Three Witches, who hail him as Thane Of Cawdor (which immediately comes true) and he who ""shalt be King hereafter."" Their predictions for Macbeth's friend Banquo (Billy Boyd) sound  much more
 like odd paradoxes. When King Duncan (Gawn Grainer) names his sons Malcolm and Donalbain (Philip Cumbus and Colin Ryan) as his heirs, Lady Macbeth comes up with the idea for Macbeth to murder Duncan. When Macbeth has a crisis of conscience and almost backs out, Lady Macbeth spurs him on by insulting his manhood, After Duncan's murder, his heirs flee in fear of their own lives.
  Thus, begins a vicious cycle. An increasingly paranoid Macbeth is quickly ordering senseless murders right and left: without any help or encouragement from Lady Macbeth, who is soon left out in the cold and out of his life. Director Eve Best establishes a swift pace, which is a great asset to the production. Just minutes after Banquo is murdered, for instance, Macbeth literally jumps over his dead body. The effect is truly startling. Joseph Millson and Samantha Spiro are superbly spellbinding as Macbeth and Lady Macbeth disintegrate, slowly but separately into madness. The supporting cast is equally excellent; and this ""Globe On Screen"" series may re-spark interests in Shakespeare.",1463616000,4,2532,5.158536585365853
8704909,5,B00UA86FSI,"I love any of these Globe theater productions. For me seeing Shakespeare plays at the Globe tops my bucket list. So, until I actually get there these DVD's are the next best thing. Beautiful products in a wonderful recreation of the historic building, great music, excellent actors. I would recommend any of these Globe Theater DVD's to anyone.",1463529600,5,344,4.948275862068965
8704910,4,B00UA86FSI,"The actors portraying Macbeth, Duncan, and Banquo do a great job.  I like that actors portray more than one character--just like you see at the theater.  The actress playing Lady Macbeth was a fine actress--I just didn't like the directions she was giving to play her role so very vehement.  Banquo was really good.  No closed captions, and with some Scottish accents, my kids needed them!  I know this play nearly by heart, so was able to ""translate"" for them. Very well done.",1459468800,4,477,4.698795180722891

I've always loved Macbeth, so it was a real treat to see it in an original setting. Here's hoping the DVD gives it justice.",1455062400,,271,3.7719298245614037
8704913,5,B00UA86FSI,"This is a moving performance of a ferocious play. It was filmed on the stage of The Globe Theatre and played to the thatched roof. It is large, loud, extroverted, and intensetheatrical, not filmic. And if you watch it as a play rather than a film, it works wonderfully.

The production is carried by Joseph Millson, who manages to preserve a surprising degree of sympathy for Macbeth. From first to last, he seems a man horrified by his own actions, out of his depth as a villain, dragged along by the chain of events he is agonizingly aware of having set in motion. He comes across less like an Iago or a Richard III than like a Raskolnikov, a man too decent for the bloody deeds he is committing but unable to stop. Most actors give us a morally ambivalent Macbeth before the killing of Duncan, but present him as hardened of heart thereafter. Millson's Macbeth races in panic from atrocity to atrocity, but never succeeds in numbing his soul. His response to the news of Lady Macbeth's death and his delivery of the ""Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow"" speech are genuinely tragic.

Some of the scenes are played with a freshness that makes you feel like you're seeing them for the first time, even if you can practically recite them. Billy Boyd plays a buoyant, semi-comic Banquo (he really does mock the witches), but when he appears to Macbeth after his death, his bleeding wounds and stern silence work with Millson's terror to be deeply disturbing; bringing Banquo on stage is always a gamble, but here it works. The witches, for their part, show how the uncanny can be evoked with minimal aids. The cauldron scene is mimed, chanted, and sung in a way which is both creepy and eerily beautiful. There is no physical cauldron and no macabre ingredients; it's all just suggested by the actresses; and it makes you realize that any modern special effects would be gratuitous.

""Macbeth"" has had a number of excellent recorded performancesincluding those starring Nicol Williamson, Ian McKellan, Patrick Stewart, Jon Finch, Anthony Sher, and Toshiro Mifune (I haven't seen Fassbinder yet)and this is an excellent addition to the collection. While others may be more terrifying, this may be the saddest.",1451088000,21,2206,4.8153034300791555
