602198,5,6303215882,"I loved it when I found this DVD.  For many years I had watched the original campy Batman series and eagerly waited for the chance to see the cross-over Green Hornet episode.  This DVD is what seems to be three or 4 episodes pasted together.  Worthwhile to find, since so little can be found of the Green Hornet of DVD or VHS for that matter.  A particular point of interest is the Black Beauty documentary.  I think fans of all super hero/crime drama genre will enjoy this program.",1061424000,9,482,4.431818181818182
602199,4,6303215882,"First of all to set the record straight to correct a few common mistakes by reviewers here...This DVD is the first of 2 films originally released to theatres back in 1974 to cash in on BRUCE LEE's death in 1973, & the huge popularity of the film, ""ENTER, THE DRAGON"". FOX took 4+ episodes of their 1967 half-hour television series, THE GREEN HORNET, & chopped & spliced them together into a 90-minute mishmash, making fans think this was an all-new feature starring BRUCE. ""THE GREEN HORNET"", as titled, was released in some areas as part of a double bill with some AIP-style BlackSploitation vehicle in 1974(I was one who was dropped off on a saturday afternoon at a now long gone theatre at Beach 20th/Cornaga in Far Rockaway, NY, & sat through it almost twice while my mother was shopping for nearly 4 hours. I have no idea what the other film was except I remember an in-bed naked love scene, tons of cursing & shoot-ups, & being the only lone 10-year-old/kid in the theatre. Most likely it was something along the lines of BLACK CAESAR or SHAFT). About a year later, I saw all ""5"" PLANET OF THE APES films in this same theatre for a buck! What an amazing time to be a kid! I guess this first ""Hornet"" film did the job cashwise as the second film was released soon-after, titled: ""FURY OF THE DRAGON"", which sounds like an all-desperate last attempt title to ""cover up"" that this film is just more poorly-edited GREEN HORNET episodes, & not some newly discovered major unreleased feature of BRUCE LEE in all his glory like the newspaper ads made it seem.(FURY OF THE DRAGON is about to be released on DVD any day now here in the US,& has been on DVD for some time now in JAPAN & is also available in the UK). It would be great for the original ""GH"" series to be released on DVD(as well as the 1966 BATMAN TV series), yet it seems that TV shows that only lasted One Season(like the G.H.) & were not syndicated well, were considered flops & losers money-making-wise by the studios. If the show was never officially released on video & never syndicated on Cable or Network TV, these two DVD's of the 1974 films may be the only way we are going to see the 1967 GREEN HORNET for a long, long time. Hopefully not. FOX did such a great job of the 1966 BATMAN Feature film on DVD, that a BATMAN/GREEN HORNET DVD BOX would be amazing, & I am sure would sell very very well. This DVD, though, is very good. For a gooey gumbo of a cash-in, this film is presented here in excellant quality on the DVD, & includes a Widescreen matte(as theatrically released), which cuts the top & bottom off a bit, yet is interesting to see in this format. Being that I have about 10 grey market episodes of the Original series, to see it like this is a-plus, for the quality is far way-superior than any copies of the show available on the grey market. Actually, this is the closest & best way to see the 1967 GREEN HORNET for now. So I recommend this & the FURY DVD when released, to see a so-so representation, yet EXCELLANT audio/visual quality. Again, as someone else corrected here,...it is Producer WILLIAM DOZIER's voice who announces the opening narration...""ANOTHER CHALLENGE FOR THE GREEN HORNET""...Not Gary Owens. Also, it was Car Customizer DEAN JEFFREYS, not GEORGE BARRIS, who created & built the ""BLACK BEAUTY"" Car for the show. As someone else mentioned, it would be great to find episodes of other late 60's shows that BRUCE LEE appeared in, like LONGSTREET. Now that's a rare treat.",1050796800,64,3476,4.5015822784810124
602200,4,6303215882,"After seeing a movie and documentary on Bruce Lee, I became
interested in seeing more of his stuff (especially his early
work). In the doc, they mentioned that Bruce played Kato in the
Green Hornet, and that back in Hong Kong the series was known
instead as ""The Kato Show""!  After seeing this video, I can see
why. Bruce totally kicks 4ss in these episodes, and is clearly
the best fighter by far in them. He's in very good and crisp
form, and many of his moves are comparable with those in his
movies. I have the feeling there was no one else quite like him
on American TV in the '60's :-)
  This particular video was listed on amazon with essentially
no descriptive info (and the seller didn't provide any either),
so I really wasn't sure what I'd be getting ... but the price
was low enough to take a chance. I think the date info for the
last episode on the tape was 1967, so it's probably not a copy
of ""Vol. 1"" or ""Vol. 2"" listed elsewhere on amazon ... but those
aren't very well described either, and I don't know how to use
the listed ASIN numbers to get the crucial buying info.
  On the copy I received, there are 3 episodes, none with titles
given. #1 is mobster-related and includes ""The Explorers Club"",
#2 opens with aliens from a crashed UFO (wtf???) and involves
an H-bomb, and #3 involves Chinatown Tongs and has lots of Kung
Fu action by several fighters. The last episode alone was worth
the price :-) Some of the plot elements and dialogs aren't
exactly stellar, but if you're a Bruce Lee fan, by all means add
it to your collection.
  One thing I don't like about the copy/episodes I received is
that often the picture is too dark, and some of that great Kung
Fu action I bought the tape for isn't very visible ... but it
seems to be a matter of the production quality itself. Too bad,
but what can one expect from a '60's TV show?
  Anyway, I enjoyed the tape (running a bit over an hour),
hokeyness and all :-)",1031788800,15,1935,4.293956043956044
602201,3,6303215882,"This DVD (despite it's reference on the cover as a theatrical release in 1974) is actually 4 episodes from the series sandwiched together (including the two parter that actually were the last 2 episodes of the series).  I would rather see all the episodes in proper order.  By the way, 1 clip from another 2 parter also appears in this disc.  This is the dumbest mistake as there is no reference to the particular character.  One who hasn't seen the series in 1966 on ABC or the reruns on FX in 1994 would think the Green Hornet just diverted to knock another bad guy down, just for the sake of it, while en route to the real crime.  Buy the DVD and it's pending sequel to preserve the series, yes, but know what you're getting first.  By the way to the person who quoted the opening above, that opening was done by William Dozier NOT Gary Owens (doesn't anybody watch Batman anymore?)",984960000,92,885,4.432098765432099
602202,1,6303215882,"I have to echo the comment sof the last reviewer of this movie. First off,  the editting of the bits and pieces of the episodes is terrible.  The film jumps from one bit to the next with no apparent order. Secondly,  the producer promote this product as being made from remastered prints.  That's a laugh!  The film looks like it was made to resemble an old Hong Kong martial arts film.  The lighting was low and dark and the overall color had a yellosish quality. As for the audio,  the editors tripped on this one to!  There are scenes with Kato fighting where his yells and kicking sounds are conspicuously missing from the final edit. The Green Hornet is a great TV series!  Once and for all,  if the distributors of classic tv shows want to please the fans, release this and other great shows in the original broadcast format.  Anything less is any insult to the fans!",976924800,130,873,4.462025316455696
602203,1,6303215882,"The fact that this is episodes of the TV series edited into a ""movie"" is insulting, but not the worst part. The fact that the cover blurbs make it sound like Bruce Lee made a series of ""Green Hornet"" movies, and never mentions the TV series, is also insulting, but again, not the worst part. The worst part is that they added black bars to the top and bottom of the screen in a lame attempt to make us think that it's in widescreen format. Did they think we wouldn't notice every time somebody's head disappeared off the top of the picture? Additionally, the editing looks like it was done with an axe. The only thing worse than a scam is a poorly-executed scam. Avoid this.",976406400,26,674,4.357142857142857
602204,5,6303215882,"The year was 1966, September 9th 7:30 p.m.to be exact, and my brother and I and two other childhood friends are gathered around the TV for the very first episode of The Green Hornet (""The Silent Gun"" 9/9/66).  We were we all big Batman fans so this show by the same producer, William Dozier didn't let us down. Although it lacked the campy kitsch of Batman, The Green Hornet had a car equally fitted with gadgets and weapons i.e. two way TV communication, telephone, etc. all built by the same builder or the Batmobile (George Barris). While Batman had Robin the Green Hornet had Kato played by the late martial arts expert, Bruce Lee. The similarity ends there though as The Green Hornet featured much more realistic plots and story lines and is based on the popular radio dramas ""The Green Hornet"" created by George W. Trendle  The full cast: Britt Reid/The Green Hornet-Van Williams, Kato: Bruce Lee,Lenore ""Casey"" Case: Wende Wagner,Mike Axford: Lloyd Gough, District Attorney F.P. Scanlon: Walter Brooke, Executive Producer: William Dozier,Music: Billy May,Theme: Rimsky-Korsakov's The Flight of the Bumble Bee,Theme Played by: Al Hirt, Music Conducted by: Lionel Newman,Director of Photography: Jack A. Marta,Art Directors: Jack Martin Smith,Gibson Holley, Film Editor: Noel Scott,Makeup Supervision: Ben Nye. 34 years after the first broadcasts and countless marginally adequate video release, come the first DVD issue of this classic Television show. Having recently viewed a few of the early episodes, it is amazing to see how well it holds up when held up to similar shows of that era. Die-Hard fans will thoroughly enjoy this and first time viewers will thrill to the similarities and dis-similarities of Batman. In the words of Gary Owens: ""Another challenge for the Green Hornet, his aid Kato, and their rolling arsenal the Black Beauty. On Police records a wanted criminal, Green Hornet is really Britt Reid, owner- publisher of the Daily Sentinel, his duel identity known only to his secretary and the district attorney. And now, to protect the rights and lives of decent citizens, rides THE GREEN HORNET.""",969667200,29,2121,5.127167630057803

One person came up to me and voiced the issue: ""What do you mean making Bruce Lee a houseboy?""  The fact that he was clearly the hero didn't undo the status problem.

I have been a customer of Amazon for many years & have completed several collections, like the James Bond series. Amazon is a great company & I am a big fan! I ordered this collection from Ghiblet & they were very promp, actually I received the dvd's sooner than I expected! I saw the first DVD which had the 2 movies (compilations of several episodes). Then I saw the rest. I really wasn't expecting too much because I have bought the series several times both on video & DVD & the copies were not all that great. Also some of the reviews here on Amazon were not very encouraging, so I figured I just bought another lousy copy. But since I am a Bruce Lee fan & saw the Green Hornet when it came out as a kid. I figured I'd take a chance. I also skipped to the Green Hornet serial just to check them out.
They are in black and white and somewhat old (as can be expected).

As for the the 1966 Green Hornet DVD's with Van Williams & the Legendary Bruce Lee, I was impressed, I have not seen this good a copy since I saw the show back in 66. I know that these are not the Fox originals, but copies. But I must say my copies are awsome! I finally got a copy of Bruce Lee's Green Hornet worthy of watching & enjoying! The video is clear (sometimes a little dark) but it does not distract. But again it is as if you were watching the original airing back in 1966.

If any fan out there wants the Green Hornet, I do recommend this set! I think you will enjoy it!

602758,4,6303215882,"I purchased this DVD out of desperation. I loved The Green Hornet TV series in the 60s, which, thanks to the morons running the network, lasted only a single season. Unfortunately, at this time, the series isn't available for purchase, streaming nor rental that I can find.

So, I came across this DVD of shows pulled from the series into a movie to showcase Bruce Lee, who became huge in martial arts films not too long after the short run of The Green Hornet.

So, basically this is a few episodes spliced together into a single film with some extra Bruce Lee fight scenes thrown in from other episodes (yes there are times when you think, ""where'd that guy come from?"" while Kato is kicking his butt).

For what it is, this DVD is enjoyable nostalgia. I loved seeing these few episodes as period pieces. The special effects are hokey, the plots are thin, though more serious than the more successful Batman TV series that was all camp, the video quality is pretty good and the Black Beauty rocks! There's even a nice documentary on how one loyal fan tracked down the original Black Beauty and restored it to original condition.

This DVD will tide me over until the entire series is released, which will probably happen when the upcoming Green Hornet movie comes out.

While this has been done before with TV shows like ""The Master"" or ""The Gemini Man"", this is a whole new level of atrocious. What makes it so bad is that they spliced in completely random fight sequences from other episodes, or even from ones that they already used. For instance GH & Kato will be fighting some bad guys in a hotel room, then suddenly Kato is alone in a warehouse they fought some othe bad guys in just a half hour ago in a different episode, then its a jump cut back to the current episode.

602761,3,6303215882,"From reading reviews on what is available on DVD from the Green Hornet, I decided on this DVD. I figured the the quality wouldn't be that great, but just to see the old Green Hornet TV series would be a thrill(it was one of my favorite shows), and the documentary on the Black Beauty would be a nice added feature. Well, I was right about the quality of the video. It's grainy and not very sharp. Also very dark at times. Even though the quality wasn't that good, it was good seeing the Green Hornet & Kato kick butt again. All the episodes on the DVD had pretty decent story lines except the last 2. The last 2 episodes were really rather dumb and a little chopped up...scenes didn't flow together. Unfortunately, my copy of this DVD didn't include the documentary on the Black Beauty, which was a major disappointment for me. Without this documentary, I feel this DVD is not worth (...).(The seller claims it does have the documentary on it. I have returned the DVD to have the seller review it and either instruct me on how to find the documentary, produce a copy that does, or just issue a refund. I will update this review if I'm provided a copy of the DVD that does have the Black Beauty documentary on it.)
UPDATE/April 6th:
After the Seller review the copy of ""The Green Hornet"" DVD I returned to him, he confirmed that it didn't have the ""Black Beauty"" documentary on it. He sent me out another DVD which does have the documentary on it along with a trailer for the ""Green Hornet"" movie. The documentary on the ""Black Beauty"" is pretty interesting and a welcome addition for die hard fans of the ""Green Hornet"". This DVD will do until someone in Hollywood wakes up and puts out a remaster box set of ""the Green Hornet"" like it deserves.

I will say something that no one else seem to care about, look the show was a little campy anyway and more then a couple shows in a roll and blood sugar might rise. BUt as someone who also has the classic Green Hornet radio shows on CD, the best part of the whole DVD was the 13 Green Hornet Movie/Serial episodes from 1940.

It's not cartoonish like Batman was, so I can still watch it. Although it doesn't have the tongue in cheek humour Batman had either.

Though the stories are a good blast from the past, the quality of the images is a bit sketchy. Some episodes are fine, while others are a bit difficult to watch, such as the two Batman/Green Hornet episodes. The audio is bad on those episodes, and there is an irritating strobe-like effect going on as well, with dotted images occasionally flashing in and out. Looks like some sort of digital malady.

602834,3,6303215882,"It's a shame this is the only way to watch THE GREEN HORNET these days.  I have vague memories of watching the show as a young child.  Today, I still admire the concept behind the series and characters:  lots of action with fisticuffs flying instead of bullets, cool kung fu action from the incomparable Bruce Lee, an intelligent crime-fighting duo working together as a team, and the Black Beauty car fitted out with as many nifty gadgets as any auto in a James Bond film.

With all that said, I'm glad I'd read previous reviews of this ""movie"" and therefore had some warning.  It is three episodes joined together without any sort of continuity between them.  Fair enough.  However, you should know that there are a few action scenes spliced into the story action that have clearly been pulled from elsewhere and are present simply to help lengthen the ""movie.""  The first one that I noticed was fairly unobtrusive.  The second one featured a baddy in a white jumpsuit rather than the metallic ""spacesuit"" the others were wearing, plus Bruce Lee was fighting with him in a burning warehouse of cotton bales which was a total location jump.  Then there's the lengthener that's the real stinker, where suddenly Reid and Kato are abducting some Caucasian guy and hypnotizing him in ""The Tangerine Room.""  It's jarring, interrupts an excellent storyline about protection rackets and tong warfare set in China town, features a character obviously not in this episode, and makes no sense whatsoever.

Even so, I am grateful to find even this much Green Hornet material.  Too bad we can't have the whole season released so we could enjoy the program as it was meant to be seen.

As for the bonus material:  if you're a fan of the Black Beauty (the Hornet's rocket-fitted Chrysler Imperial) then you might enjoy seeing the creator of the car and how it was saved from rusty neglect and restored.  There's also a montage of trailers from the show and a Bruce Lee film that again have been stuck together without much cohesion except to show Lee in action.

A pity the bonus material doesn't include the very interesting screen test for Lee when he was auditioning for this show.",1246320000,15,2171,4.746666666666667

The DVD cover states that it is from a ""brand new"" 35mm print of the original 1974 movie.  DVD is not in stereo, but something the DVD cover describes as ""Digital Dolby Mono.""  DVD has excellent bonus features including a Featurette called ""The Black Beauty"" which details a Green Hornet fan's restoration of one of the original Black Beauty cars.  Also included is a loop of Bruck Lee's greatest fight scenes from the movie along with a photo gallery.

Even in this limited format, I was struck by what an amazing show ""The Green Hornet"" was, especially for 1966 television.  Great writing, excellent casting and superlative design must have made this show jump off the tv screen in 1966, even if you had a black & white set.  It's rumored that the staggering cost of each episode made the network drop the series and I can see why.  If not for the shoddy editing, this compilation of episodes stands right alongside ""James Bond,"" ""Our Man Flint"" and ""Matt Helm"" as a prime 60's super-spy movie.  It is one of the few TV shows I have ever seen that actually LOOKS like a movie.

I agree that the movie is hard to follow in places due to the poor editing and the focus on The Master Bruce Lee, but it's the ONLY non-bootleg DVD of anything having to do with the 1966-67 TV series available.  Note to all who have bootleg Green Hornet dvds: if you see an ""FX"" logo in the bottom of your screen, that means the person that burned it taped it (or the person that you bought it from who bought it from someone else who taped it) from re-runs of the Green Hornet that FX network did over ten years ago.  It's sad that Fox or whoever holds the rights to this character are letting dvd bootleggers rob them and fans of money (go ahead and do a google search on the Hornet and see what the first hit is!).  It's also sad that the FORTIETH Anniversary of the TV show has come and gone with NOTHING to commemorate it!  Hopefully, the eventual DVD release of the 60's ""Batman"" TV show (the two shows had a crossover) will inspire someone at Fox to release the Green Hornet in the format that this excellent show deserves, but until then, this is all we have.",1171497600,9,2274,4.443373493975904

602840,3,6303215882,"Okay, here is the deal for all you other reviewers. Bruce Lee shot to fame in this country AFTER HIS DEATH. He had a huge hit with the movie ""Enter the Dragon"" which was released here after he had died. In the months that followed he picked up a huge cult following as other dead celebrities like Marilyn Monroe and James Dean had before him. Many studios were looking to cash in on his fame. An American biopic was discussed but did not materialize until ""Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story"" was released two decades later. Columbia Pictures was busy making deals with Lee's Hong Kong movie studio to release Lee's incomplete masterpiece ""Game of Death"" which would later be butchered in order to splice in new scenes with Hollywood stars. Another cheap film distributor managed to grab up the rights to three of Lee's HK martial arts films, and retitled one of them ""Return of the Dragon"" in hopes that it would be mistaken as a sequel to ""Enter the Dragon"". This would be followed by ""Fists of Fury"" and ""Chinese Connection"", and I won't go into how the distributor bungled the film titles in the English language release.

It was about this time that 20th Century Fox realized that Bruce Lee had starred for them in a failed television series back in the 60's called ""The Green Hornet"". Made after the success of the Adam West ""Batman"" television series. It was well made but unlike ""Batman"" was not a comic book parody, and therefore did not catch on with their audience. After about half a season it was cancelled, and did not have enough episodes to be offered into syndication.

Now nearly a decade later the studio was thinking about re-releasing the episodes as television movies. It was common practice by the mid 70's to reedit popular but short lived series into movies. Fox had done so with their ""Planet of the Apes"" series editing two episodes back to back as one film. But somewhere along the line they realized that Bruce had been given little to do as the Hornet's Asian sidekick and decided not to bother. Instead they sold the footage to another company who decided it was good enough for a theatrical release.

The episodes picked were based on how much screen time Bruce Lee was given. About three episodes were shown back to back. But the problem was that unlike the Batman series, the fight scenes in Green Hornet were usually brief. So footage from other episodes was edited in to lengthen the fight scenes in the movie. Some of you who have seen the movie may have noticed the continuity error of the Green Hornet & Kato fighting men at a marina with small boats inter-cut with them fighting on a dock with large ships.

The movie was released and failed miserably at the box office. Still looking to make a fast buck the same company edited more Green Hornet footage together and released it as ""Fury of the Dragon"". The movie poster showed a shirtless Bruce Lee in a fighting stance looking like he was giving off one of his famous screams. Even the opening credits did not give away that this movie was actually Green Hornet episodes. It was animated in the same style as the title credits in Bruce Lee's Asian movies. It was only after the opening credits ended that you saw Bruce Lee as Kato chauffeuring Green Hornet that you realized you were suckered.

As for the Green Hornet not available on video, the main thing holding everything up is the Trendle estate. George W. Trendle had created and owned the character, and has sold the television rights to Fox under the agreement that it would not be campy like ""Batman"" was. After the series aired Trendle accused them of camping up his character, possibly he had seen the Green Hornet's guest appearance on Batman. He tried taking steps to revoke Fox's rights to the character, but once the series was cancelled for bad ratings he decided there was no reason to bother. Years later Fox's rights to the character expired and reverted to his estate. Allegedly they are the ones who kept Fox from releasing Green Hornet on video. [ 20th Century Fox's video company CBS/FOX had much success releasing the Bruce Lee films and wanted to continue the trend ] I know that Good Times home video released this movie and eventually had to pull it after the Trendle estate threatened a lawsuit. I am not surprised that they stopped Brentwood from releasing the sequel. But then again as the rights to this character pass from one Trendle family member to another, it won't be long before one of them prefers money over family honor.",1156723200,23,4498,4.631578947368421

602873,5,6303215882,"Prior to purchasing this Green Hornet release for myself, I'd read all of the preceding reviews, and to a degree I agree with the views concerning this theatrical/dvd release. Watching it from start to finish I did notice that it'd appeared to be a product of episode splicing and merging in an attempt to feature what many fans of the series and of Martial arts flicks wanted after 1973...MORE BRUCE LEE!!! True...it did seem thrown together in hopes of passing it off as a kung-fu flick, but for die hard Bruce Lee fans like myself(who didn't make it into the world until 1976), this dvd is a must have. The quality wasn't the best, but I'd never seen a single episode of the Green  Hornet, and to see him in action on the Hornet series(and with his own voice...no dubbing) was a dream come true. So I recommend Green Hornet Vol. 1 to those who are dying to see more Bruce...and hopefully one day we'll either see a Vol. 2 to this disc if not the entire GHornet series released in a box collection. Long live the Little Dragon(Bruce Lee, R.I.P.)!!!",1122595200,8,1050,4.49738219895288
602874,3,6303215882,"Good extras, and an excellent overview of the Black Beauty but how long will we have to wait for an offical TV series DVD?

While it is interesting on its own right it is only recommended for the die hard fan as the editing is way below par.  As is the film quality.

A DVD series is a must for release,

602875,2,6303215882,"This was released as a theatrical release to cash in on Bruce Lee's death.  I actually saw it at an old drive-in that no longer exists in East Rutherford, New Jersey.  It's exactly as it was shown it the theater and was so butchered up that it was almost unwatchable. But with Van Williams, Bruce Lee, Wende Wagner and the rest of the cast, along with the high quality for a half-hour series from the sixties, it was worth it.  The Action Channel still shows the Green Hornet (along with Time Tunnel and Combat) and I also truly wish they would release the episodes complete on DVD. But, until then, if you don't have the Action channel - this will have to do !!",1112659200,7,662,4.32258064516129
602876,4,6303215882,"So much of my childhood that later influenced me as an adult-- Lost In Space, Batman, Land of the Lost, Land of the Giants, the Time Tunnel, The Six Million Dollar Man & Bionic Woman-- are the shows that I would love to see again on DVD or even video, but many of those shows has been lost or destroyed, or for some silly contractual reasons, may not ever be seen again.

While I am a little disappointed with the the 1974 compilation movie of the Green Hornet, I am very glad that at least some of that great television show has survived and is on DVD to bring me a blast from the past. I guess they do try to make up for the poor quality of the movie (as most compilation movies usually are), the creators of the DVD at allow us to choose which fight scene we would like to see as well as give us a detailed look at the Black Beauty and it's history.

I can only dream of the day when there'll be a DVD with more episodes of the Green Hornet on a DVD with the original titles and the opening and closing credits, but until that day comes, I'm glad to have at least this much to watch.",1105488000,8,1086,4.023148148148148

In re: to your wish to see 'those' series originals on dvd, I think you may never see that day.  From what I understand, the ORIGINAL GREEN HORNET tv series 'film' archives were destroyed some time ago in a fire -  hence, why you don't see the title on dvd.  A real shame - especially for those of us fond of nostalgia . . .  Think this may be as close as it's going to get for the GH",1102982400,4,514,3.811320754716981
602879,5,6303215882,"To everyone around him, Britt Reid is just the owner and publisher of  ""The Daily Sentinel""  newspaper. What they don't know is that he wears a mask and fights crime as The Green Hornet with the aide of his sidekick, Kato. The police and public believe the Green Hornet and Kato are nothing more than criminals. Reids identity is only known to two people, the District Attorney and his secretary Lenore Case.

Well, here are my thoughts on the 1974 classic ""The Green Hornet"" with Van Williams as the Green Hornet and Bruce Lee as Kato his high kicking sidekick and bodyguard. Just like Batman and Robin this crime fighting duo had no special powers, but what they did have was a lot of cool crime fighting gadgets and the ultimate battle machine, the ""Black Beauty"" ; which rivaled the Batmobile.

The Green Hornet movie is compiled of several episodes from the 1966-67 TV show and it was never released on DVD in the United States until just recently. Since its release it seems to have gone out of print very quickly and copies on DVD are hard to find. This film was released in theaters after Bruce Lee's tragic and untimely death to capitalize on his new found fame in the U.S.

The movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1:1.85 and has allegedly been re-mastered from a new 35mm print. The picture is relatively clear but does suffer from some bad editing and the sound is good enough, although it's only Digital Dolby mono which is a shame. The catchy Green Hornet theme song and spectacular fight scenes should have been presented in 5.1 digital sound to bring us the best Green Hornet audio possible. In this movie Bruce Lee shows off his high kicking and furious fighting ability and leaves no doubt as to why he was chosen for the role of Kato. Its really too bad that the TV series only lasted 26 episodes, it was just as entertaining as Batman.

There is a bonus feature on the design and restoration of the Black Beauty and a Green Hornet / Black Beauty photo gallery. There is also a menu giving quick access to Bruce Lee's best fight scenes. If you liked the 1960's ""Batman"" movie you're sure to enjoy the ""Green Hornet"". Unless the studio does a complete restoration of this movie were stuck with this DVD version. I hope that one day the complete ""Green Hornet"" TV series will be released on DVD and this movie will be included as a bonus feature.
