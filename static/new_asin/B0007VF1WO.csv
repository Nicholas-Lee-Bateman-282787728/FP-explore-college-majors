8542269,4,B0007VF1WO,"This is a typical Filmark ninja movie from the 80's. It's two stories (that has nothing to do with each other) edited into one, and related by dubbing. The shorter story, unfortunately, is the ninja story. We follow an Interpol agent, ""codename - Silver Dragon"" and his sidekick, both of them White ninjas, on their mission to defeat the evil Black ninja empire. The longer story is about a renegade cop who is taking a revenge for the death of his wife and son against a powerful evil businessman. We are also to believe that the Silver dragon has sent a female cop to infiltrate the evil businessman's empire from the other story, and we see them on a few occasions talking over phone. That is the ""connection"" between the stories.
The opening sequence is pretty awesome! We see the two White ninjas practicing their ninja skills on the top of the Signal Hill Garden in Hong Kong. After the practice they talk about the code of the ninjas and how the black ninjas are destroying the good reputation of the ninjas, and that they have to be stopped. Then suddenly they are attacked by a horde of black ninjas, and the battle raves on... There are two more ninja fighting scenes, one some 20 minutes in the movie (where only the Silver dragon fights the black ninjas, again on the top of the Signal Hill), and the final showdown at the end of the movie. The very end is pretty awesome too, but I don't want to reveal it...
I won't trouble describing the renegade cop part of the movie, it's not in the title...
No matter how good (or bad) these ninja movies are, I simply enjoy watching them. If you feel the same too, than this is a must-have. If you're not a fan and looking for something else in these movies, then you probably won't enjoy it as we ""truly fans"" do :)",1288915200,,1769,4.412844036697248
