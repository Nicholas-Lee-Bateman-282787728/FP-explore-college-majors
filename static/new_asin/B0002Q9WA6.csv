8030611,5,B0002Q9WA6,"""Singin' in the Rain"" is, of course, enjoying a revival due to the passing of Ms. Debbie Reynolds, its great star, but don't pass up this classic as a great date-night flick choice or just to share the heyday of Hollywood with your family.  This film more than earns its status as one of Hollywood's greatest musicals, from the golden era of the old studio system when musical productions earned their epic status with fabulous production values, elegant costumes, incredible dancing and, of course, their classic tunes.

Gene Kelly, already a legend, protested Debbie's casting because of her inexperience.  She got the role partly due to the influence of Lillian Burns, MGM's ""training expert"", who took studio prodigies under her wing for special instruction in voice, acting, presentation and etiquette as well as dance.  Debbie later recounted the tale of one particularly trying day, when Kelly's criticism, her feet bleeding from dozens of takes and her own self-doubt drove her to seek refuge under one of the studio's pianos in tears.  Another of MGM's stars looked underneath and asked why she was crying. When she explained, he led her to the soundstage where he was working on another production to show her how much work he, the great Fred Astaire, had to do.  She returned to work with greater confidence, and the result is history.

Some of the production numbers may seem overlong to modern audiences more accustomed to a 2-3 minute hoofing, but they're not to be missed.  The meticulous choreography is well executed by Kelly, Cyd Charisse and Donald O'Connor, and of course Debbie Reynolds' efforts, which are all the more admirable when one considers that she had had no dance instruction prior to her contract with MGM.  The plot is more believable than so many of today's movie musicals, which often require a viewer to suspend all common sense.

""Singin' in the Rain"" is an ageless classic that everyone can enjoy for decades to come.

""The Music Man"" is somewhat less entertaining, and probably more memorable for its famous ""76 Trombones."" Still, Shirley Jones gives a grand performance, so check it out. Great two for one deal.",1485648000,,2152,4.95
8030612,5,B0002Q9WA6,"A childhood favorite. The Music Man offers not only delightful performances from Robert Preston and Shirley Jones, two American stand-outs, but a charming slice of Americana served up as one of our classic musical comedies. It seems to be from an entirely different era, both in our culture and the history of our theater. A definite must for anyone who still cares about our muscial and theatrical heritage.",1186099200,,408,5.014705882352941
