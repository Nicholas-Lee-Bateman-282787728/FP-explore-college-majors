1192670,4,B000006BTW,"Before there were the Bowery Boys, there were the East Side Kids, and if you thought the Bowery Boys was a low budget series, wait until you catch the East Side Kids. Compared with the production values in the East Side Kids Series, the later Bowery Boys semeed like MGM.
A note of difference: though both were released by the same studio, Monogram, the 22 pictures of the East Side Kids were independently produced by Sam Katzman and his Banner Films company. Once the popularity of the series was established, the Boys wanted more money and so Katzman gladly turned the series over to Monogram, who renemd it ""The Bowery Boys. For the 60 or so films that would come out, each was a money maker for this ""B"" studio and helped finance some of their stabs at ""A"" billing and the respect it brings.)For students of film, Katzman has a defined niche in history as one of the giants of the exploitation movie. Consider the title of this movie, ""Bowery Blitzkreig."" One would assume that somewhere along the line Nazis and other bad guys of WWII would be added.
Nope, this is a film about Golden Gloves boxing as Muggs (Leo Gorcey) fights the crooked racketeers of the game while still finding time to donate blood to pal Danny (Bobby Jordan), shot while resisting crime. The performances are nothing new: Gorcey and company simply honed their roles from their previous stint as the Dead End Kids for Warner Bros., but they are entertaining.
The transfer is not the greatest, but we must keep in mind that prints of this movie were probably treated with benign neglect at the best. (I wonder how many of the 22 movies actually survived.) Even so, the movie is clear with only a few glitches and actually lacks the darkness that distinguished most of the series on television.
All in all, it's a little slice of nostalgia (How many of us remember whiling away our Saturday or Sunday afternoons watching these on a local channel?) at just the right price.",1044835200,7,1948,4.632947976878612

1192675,4,B000006BTW,"It's kind of corny now, but I saw this when I was a little kid. I enjoyed seeing it again just because it made me remember those good old days. Not the days depicted in the film, but MY good old days.",1395705600,,200,3.7857142857142856
1192676,5,B000006BTW,"I grew up watching the Bowery Boys when I was a kid. I really enjoyed watching their movies. They were also called ""the East Side Kids""",1395705600,,135,4.230769230769231
1192677,3,B000006BTW,"Bowery Blitzkrieg

The film begins with a man falling out of a store door. Muggs is a local big shot. Monk manipulates Danny with gossip to start a fight. The talk at the dinner table tells about their lives. Monk gets Danny to drive his car. Muggs is in the Reform School, but he can leave for a new home. Muggs trains for his fight and wins. The ability to fix a fight can make money for professional gamblers. [Like insider trading on Wall Street.] Muggs moves out, Danny is warned about Monk. Will they try to pay Muggs to take a dive?

Danny gets in trouble following Monk, and winds up in a hospital. The radio carries the fight. Can Muggs win after donating blood? Yes, but he has a problem. There will be a happy ending for the good guys.

This movie is more serious than the other films that followed it. The series became a sort of soap opera that told of the adventures of a small group of city youth. Its popularity measured the interests of America in the 1940s. It was never brought to radio or television.

The Bowery district was destroyed by ""urban renewal"". Its old neighborhood and businesses serviced the docks along the East River. Foley Square replaced the historic Five Points neighborhood. These changes happened in other cities, and eliminated the people and the small businesses in historic neighborhoods.",1265673600,,1331,4.60337552742616
1192678,3,B000006BTW,"While the Platinum Disc DVD quality is probably better than others for Bowery Blitzkrieg, it is a severly edited print.  There is a 5 minute chunk missing from the film about 1/3 of the way through.  This basically renders the disc worthless.  Platinum lists the orignal running time of 62 minutes, but it is shorter than that.  I've seen the missing footage on a 50 movie pack, but there were different scenes edited out on that one.  I haven't seen the Alpha disc.  This was also an Astor Pictures re-issue.  The East Side Kids films desperately need someone to take an interest in putting out decent copies of them.",1245283200,2,618,4.614678899082569
1192679,3,B000006BTW,"Bowery Blitzkrieg is one of the more enjoyable black & white East Side Kids films.  Danny Breslin (played by Bobby Jordan) is a promising Golden Gloves boxer who gets lured into a robbery-funded high-life by scumbag Monk Martin (Bobby Stone).  Danny's pal Muggs McGinnis (Leo Gorcey) gets busted for fighting but is released from a reform school into the custody of a policeman (Warren Hull) engaged to Danny's sister (Charlotte Henry).  Muggs has to go into training to go after the Golden Gloves contest in which Danny would have competed.  Underworld characters pressure Muggs to throw the match.  On the day of the contest, the police catch Danny and Monk Martin, both of whom get shot.  Muggs donates blood to Danny and goes off anemically to box Johnny Ryan (Bill Cartledge) in the Golden Gloves with both the police and the underworld watching.  How will things turn out well?

This is a solid East Side Kids film.  The language is as expected.  There is no sex.  The violence is of both the street brawl and Marquess of Queensbury variety.  The skin shots are of Danny, Muggs, Limpy (Huntz Hall), Peewee (David Gorcey), Ryan, and the policeman (photo) performing in boxing trunks.  The characters go through a bad time and come out better for it.

I had preferred the Platinum edition to the Alpha Video one before.  The A2ZCDS Remastered edition has an overall slightly cleaner picture than the Platinum and has the big advantage of showing a 63 minute film rather than a 58 minute one.",1200614400,,1495,4.78515625
1192680,3,B000006BTW,"This East Side Kids melodrama introduces Huntz Hall, one of the original Dead End boys, to this series, and quaintly casts Keye Luke, Charlie Chan's ""Number One Son"" as a pool hall manager (named Clancy!), but each performer plays only a small role in this story of Muggs McGinnis (Leo Gorcey) and his gang. Released before the U.S. entry into WWII (ergo the Teutonic title), the film is devoid of the customary wartime propaganda that the series featured, but it is also shorn of the snappy ad libbing that caught the Gotham flavour of most of these affairs, and we must settle for a rapidly moving but largely uninvolving account of Muggs' decision to go straight amidst the usual background of the fight game and gangsters.",1174435200,,726,4.76984126984127
1192681,5,B000006BTW,"""Once a resident of the famous East Side myself, I seldom miss a movie whose plot centers on this fascinating corner of New York. Naturally I am thrilled at seeing this fabulous movie on DVD. I don't know how they do it but the film has been excellently preserved. The visuals are clear and the audio is as good as something recorded yesterday! I sure am glad that directors like Wallace Fox took it upon themselves to guide misguided kids back then. Thanks Wallace (If you are listening) and thanks a2zcds for this treat.""",1146528000,,523,4.574468085106383
1192682,3,B000006BTW,"Huntz Hall now joins the East Side Kids, who was over with Billy Halop, Bernard Punsly and Gabriel Dell as the Dead End Kids helping the Little Tough Guys and still will until 1943.
 Well as you can see Leo Gorcey with Huntz Hall, Sammy Morrison, Donald Haines and David Gorcey are still up to no good.  Leo hits ""Monk"" (Bobby Stone) and then puts shoe polish on his nose.  Policeman Tom decides to stop them and reminds the gang of reform school. He wants to talk to the kids in the Pool Hall.  In the Pool Hall is Clancy (played by Keye Luke of Charlie Chan film series, Kung Fu tv series, 1972-75,86 as ""Master Po"").  Later, Monk tells Bobby Jordan a lie that Leo had said something about his sister.  Monk's plan works and Leo and Bobby fist fight.  The police show up and the kids make a run for it.  Leo ges caught.  Policeman Tom talks Leo into fighting in the ring for the Golden Gloves.  Can Leo and Bobby ever be friends again?  Bobby ends up in the hospital and Leo gives him a special gift of life.  In the next film, the boys meet Bela Lugosi and have to chase some spooks in SPOOKS RUN WILD (1941).",1079568000,3,1112,4.193396226415095
1192683,2,B000006BTW,"If you are a Bowery Boys - East Side Kids fan, you know these low budget dramadies are entertaining.  Unfortunately, the DVD issued by Gotham Distributors/Alpha Video is almost unwatchable. A Washed out picture and distorted soundtrack take away from the enjoyment of this movie.
HOWEVER, if you can find the PLATINUM DISC CORPORATION DVD, you will enjoy a sharp clear picture with excellent contrast and a crisp clear soundtrack worthy of DVD.",1053907200,10,444,5.082191780821918
