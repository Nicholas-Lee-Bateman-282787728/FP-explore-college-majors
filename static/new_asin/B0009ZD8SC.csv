8416639,4,B0009ZD8SC,"The DVD about the battle is much of what to be expected, informative in an entertaining way.  The Special Features are very nice on this one though.  You get a battle field tour with the great civil war historian Ed Bearss, three days of the reenactment of the battle, and a very interesting tour of the battle field that Winston Churchill took back in 1929.",1372982400,,358,4.492307692307692
