326897,5,6301390725,"Quite simply the best Disney film ever made! Yes I've read many reviews by the so called experts telling us about how weak it is compared to Mary Poppins, well 'rubbish' is what I say. This film is a league above Poppins. Its so much more enjoyable to see the brilliant (now late) David Tomlinson play a good guy as opposed to the villain in Poppins and especially The Love Bug. Its one of those films that seems to be over before its started, even though its almost 2 hours long, the time just flows away when watching it. And as they say, time flys when you're enjoying yourself. The children are suberb, the animation is excellent, the special effects are extremely convincing and the spells are addictive. Come on now kids.. you can't tell me you weren't shouting ""..traguna mercoides tracorem satus dee.."" at the top of your voice in the vein hope that it might work?.. LOL! My final appraisal has to go to the marvellous Angela Lansbury who's suberb performance in this film is whole key to its success. She's prim, she's proper, she's English, but most of all she's a true gem of actress! Her talent is wasted on too many highly predictable Murder She Wrotes!",980467200,8,1166,4.557142857142857
326898,5,6301390725,"It's war time and several orphaned kids are placed in with a remote person  (Angela Landsbury) who is secretly practicing her lessons to become a good  witch. Pranks are playes, adventures are launched straight into cartoon  settings. This film is great fun. But if there are young ones viewing, it  might mean Mom and Dad need to stick by. Can be a little scary. Not major  scary. Just a tad.",968198400,4,393,4.557142857142857
326899,5,6301390725,"Equally as excellent as MARY POPPINS, this fantastic part live, part animated film is made memroable by both performances and magnificent visual  effects. Superb from beginning to end this is another in a huge line of  Disney classics thats ageless in appeal.",967075200,,259,5.142857142857143
326900,5,6301390725,"Although this is not my favorite Disney but one of the best ones. Marry Poppins would have to be the best one they have made but although this is not a clear or as fun as Mary Poppins. But Kids enjoy it and at 18 years  old i still enjoy. During WWII when the bombings of London are occuring  they evacuate children to the country side to live with people who will  take them in. When Carrie, Charles and Paul Rollins go to live with an  eccentric women who wants to be a witch played by Angela Lansbury. First  they don't tske to her but in the end they do. When Paul has a bed Knob he  takes off the bed. Ms Price cast a traveling spell on the bed and they go  on some wacky adventures.
Even to an island inhabited by animals.  Combining live action with animation this is a magical movie with great  songs and some very funny adventurs. Directed by Robert Stevenson who made  the magical Mary Poppins. This is great family fare and will always be a  movie i will enjoy watching every time.",964310400,,992,4.195767195767195
326901,5,6301390725,"You will love every minute of this film. It's a classic Disney title with some of Disney's best characters. Songs are warm and cheerful, sets are so detailed, and the animation and effects (considering how long ago this was  made) are fantastic - it won Disney awards! Landsbury is a delight and it  is a pretty faithful adaptation of the stories from which the film  originates. Watch out for great guest stars too! It's a fun packed film  which I guarantee you will have great delight in watching over and over  again. I must mention the song 'The age of not believing' - it is one of  the most heart-warming songs I have listened to. A great film. 5/5!",957571200,6,655,4.46218487394958
326902,5,6301390725,This is a really good movie one that your whole  family will love. Its one of my favorite movies. I remember staying up late just so I could watch it on Disney. My favorite scene is when the eels are dancing and Angela  Landsbury and her partner  are swimming with the 4 fish piece band playing.,957052800,,295,4.232142857142857
326903,4,6301390725,"I enjoyed this movie a lot better than Mary Poppins. It's a lot more fast paced, interesting, and loveable. Forgive me for saying so, but it's my opinion. Like all other Disney movies that match reality with animation,  this is a very insane movie too but seems to promise more fun than Mary  can.",952300800,,297,4.481481481481482
326904,5,6301390725,"When I was young,there were things about this film that PETRIFIED me. One was the opening credits with the eerie bagpipes and the Nazis. The second thing was the invisible soldiers at the end. If I watched this part I had to  turn the lights on and grab something to put over my ears. Bloody  silly,right? Well,to change the subject,as a child,despite the fears,it was  one of my fave Disney flicks. Angela Lansbury is the most spunkiest  witch,and the kids are so cute! Wimpy David Tomlinson obviously won't tame  the red-headed vixenish Angela,so I really don't pin too many hopes of him  getting back together with her  after the war. The best songs are 'Age of  Not Believing','Portobello Road'and the song that triggers the flying  clothes sequence. Needs a sequel!(Hint-Hint,Disney!)",949968000,2,789,5.007692307692308

The ending drones on a bit, but then again I think most movies are like that when you get to the supposed ""dramatic climax."" Very fun premise, if you like this you might like the spooky comedy with Peter O'Toole and Beverly D'Angelo that I can't be bothered to look up right now. I want to buy that one too. Another good occult-tinged comedy is Hello Again with Shelly Long, I own that and it's also aged well and is nostalgic if you like that sort of thing, but it's more romantic comedy than the other two.",1507939200,,585,4.185840707964601

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Director Robert Stevensons BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS marked quite an advance in quality and entertainment value on the earlier two Walt Disney musicals produced in the wake of the fabulous success of Mary Poppins; The Happiest Millionaire and The One and Only, which were genuine, original family entertainment. Its score is more memorable, its stars are quite at home with singing and dancing, and the magic in its make-up, while not quite matching Mary Poppins in thrills and originality certainly holds the attention and offer lots of giggles and glee.

Based on two novels by Mary Norton, The Magic Bed-Knob [1945] and BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS [1957], is about the adventures of an apprentice witch and the three children she looks after during World War II. BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS [1957] was a project first envisioned by Walt Disney when he first purchased the rights to The Magic Bed-Knob the year it was published. It would not become a film until five years after Disney's death.

Dame Angela Lansbury plays Miss Eglantine Price, a witch apprentice during World War II who has ambitions of helping England defeat the Nazis.  Much to her dismay she is forced to take in three orphans from London who is Charlie [Ian Weighill], Paul [Roy Snart] and Carrie [Cindy O'Callaghan]. That night, however, they spy her attempting to ride her first broom, side-saddle and ""Technically,"" say the instructions, ""a witch is always a lady."" Miss Eglantine Price does a couple of barrel rolls, then a nose dive, and crashes, heap like, into a  hedge, whereupon the children decide to blackmail Miss Eglantine Price into serving them sausages and fries and into giving them pocket money as well. But soon the orphaned children immediately come to love and cherish Miss Eglantine Price for being a nice kind apprentice witch dedicated to helping Winston Churchill save England from the Nazi invasion.

Though her first spells create more laughs than magic, Miss Eglantine Price and the children soon find themselves swept away on board the fantastic flying bed. The four of them take off in search of the Professor Emelius Browne who runs the witch apprentice Correspondence school that Miss Eglantine Price is enrolled in.  What they find is a conman, Professor Emelius Browne, the head of the Correspondence College of Witchcraft, who is played by David Tomlinson and Miss Eglantine Price fears all hope is lost.  However, when they find the other half of a magical spell book in London, they fly off on an adventure, courtesy of a bed knob.

The loveliest part of the film and the section that can renew one's appreciation of the special gifts of the Disney people is the live-action-plus-cartoon sequence in Naboombu featuring, among other things, a tumultuous soccer game with David Tomlinson as referee, the rules are more a matter of royal decree, and a scuffling, baffling, riotously fun game ensues between all manner cartoon animals, that includes elephants, lions, bears, hogs, rhinos and cheetahs. We also get a wonderful an underwater ballet sequence in which Dame Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson dance in slow-motion surrounded by cartoon fish. It recalls the best of Disney, going all the way back to the first Silly Symphonies cartoons. This is essential viewing, not only for nostalgia buffs but also for a whole new generation yet to be introduced to Miss Eglantine Prices magic.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment presents this film with a brilliant aspect ratio of 1.66:1 and is offered to us in stunning 1080p resolution encoded image. Its a beautiful presentation of this classic film with sharpness excellent and colour wonderfully rich with realistic and appealing skin tones. If contrast occasionally gets extreme in trying to portray fogbound England, its not really detrimental to the final look of the film, and black levels blacks are deep and inky, with only a hint of crush in a few of the very darkest scenes, and fine detail being quite apparent. Lines are still intact and there appears to signs of jaggiest or compression artefacts. Even the look is VERY well replicated and rich. With this Walt Disney classic is presented in its original aspect ratio of 1.66:1,  you get presented with a very slim black bar left and right of your TV screen. It may not be a 5 star restoration, but they left it alone which is a good thing and let the natural look of the film shine through, for the most part, I am very pleased with the results.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment equally presents us with a really wonderful 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound mix that does justice to the delightful Oscar-nominated song scores, even if the ambient sound effects don't get the wide spread or resonance through the soundstage that a modern musical film like ENCHANTED would command. Dialogue and song lyrics have been expertly recorded and have been placed in the centre channel has some nice wallop to it, and certainly adds some nice density to the film. Ambient details are replicated nice, especially in the hustle and bustle of street market where they go to find the other half of the spell book. Overall a very pleasing audio track indeed.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Music and Magic: The Sherman Brothers [1971] [480i] [1:33:1] [20:41] For those of you who are in the know may be confused by this bonus feature in which Richard M. Sherman, Robert B. Sherman, restorer Scott McQueen, star Dame Angela Lansbury, Robert Stevenson (archive footage) and David Tomlinson (archive footage) extol the virtues of the newly reconstructed version of the film mentioned in the special feature. But the documentary on the 1971 BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS Walt Disney film which they discuss the making of the film, the origins of the songs, including  portions of two that were dropped in pre-production, the pre-release, and the 1996 reinstatement of those cut scenes. But what is mentioned is some the actual deleted songs that had to be deleted from the film and they were A Step In The Right Direction; Nobodys Problem sung by Dame Angela Lansbury. We also get to hear several Original Demo Recordings, plus best of all the Portobello Road Ballet that was originally over 10 minutes long, but in the actual film, was cut down to 4 minutes. Director and Screenplay: Les Perkins. Producers: Clare Baren, Ivan Hall, Jeff Kurtti and Michael Pellerin.

Special Feature: Deleted and Extended Songs [1971] [1080p] [1.66:1] [23:54] Here we are presented with five song sequences either cut wholly or in part are presented here: A Step In The Right Direction [3:09]; With a Flair [4:18]; Eglantine [3:42]; Portobello Road [10:50] and Nobodys Problems [1:23]. But what is nice about this special is that the first song you view is that the studio found production photographs and reconstructed the finished song, plus you hear the original music track. You can either watch each one individual or Play All.

Special Feature: Deleted and Extended Scenes [1971] [1080p] [1.66:1] [10:06] Here we get presented eight individual sequences, which includes Captain Greer; Ulterior Motives; The First Supper; Letter from Professor Browne; Extortion; Travelling Spell; Substitutiary Locomotion and Matchmaker. You can either watch each one individual or Play All.

Special Feature: David Tomlinson Recording Session [1971] [480i] [1:33:1] [1:10] Here we get to view a short rare snippet of David Tomlinson at a recording session for the film BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS, which happened in April 1970. This 70-second clip shows David Tomlinson as he croons the last few bars of Portobello Road to a pre-recorded orchestra playback, with the guidance of arranger/conductor Irwin Kostal. For some strange reason, the last five seconds goes all silent.

Special Feature: Disney Song Selection [1971] [1080p] [1.66:1] [20:40] Here we are presented with the films six song sequences, which consist of The Old Home Guard; The Age Of Not Believing; Eglantine; Portobello Road;  The Beautiful Briny and Substitutiary Locomotion. Here they may be watched individually or Play All and you can also sing along with the song lyrics provided with subtitles.

Special Feature: The Wizard of Special Effects [2015] [1080p] [1:78:1] [8:06] Hosted by Disney Channel actress Jennifer Stone and looks at the differences between special effects done in the era of BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS and todays The Wizards of Waverly Place by interviewing Disney effects historian Les Perkins, visual effects historian Greg Kimble and visual effects supervisor John  Allison. They inform us about the visual effects for the film BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS where Ub Eert Iwerks who worked for Walt Disney, perfected the Sodium Vapor Screen Process, (occasionally referred to as yellowscreen) and is a photochemical film technique for combining actors and background footage with the cartoon characters. We also get to compare this to more modern Green Screen visual effects techniques and all in all it is really good and fascinating information here, but the special feature usually feels more like a promo for Jennifer Stones Disney Channel series, who to my mind is a totally ghastly and obnoxious precocious child actress and one I am so glad I was not able to view Jennifer Stone on the Disney Channel every week.

Theatrical Trailers [480i] [1:33:1] [9:00] Here we get to view four Theatrical Trailers to round of this supplemental package and they are: Bedknobs and Broomsticks [480i] [1.33:1] [3:40]; Bedknobs and Broomsticks [480i] [1.33:1] [1:30]; Bedknobs and Broomsticks [480i] [1.33:1] [2:19] and Bedknobs and Broomsticks [480i] [1.33:1] [1:36]. Once again you can either view them separately or Play All.

BONUS: This Exclusive Limited Edition SteelBook Blu-ray UK Release  is absolutely stunning, because the SteelBook has a beautifully embossed front and you have inside some nice coloured images, so is well worth purchasing this alone, instead of the ordinary Blu-ray Cover.

Finally, fans of the Walt Disney BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS are going to be well pleased with this Exclusive Limited Edition SteelBook Blu-ray UK Release. It is so nice to go back and see one of Walt Disneys live action films get the brilliant Blu-ray treatment, even if the extended cut isn't included for those who would have wished to have been included in this Blu-ray disc. David Tomlinson is as always very cheery as he even is and the whole experience just brings one back to ones childhood viewings of this classic Walt Disney film, but an even better bonus is seeing the wonderful Dame Angela Lansbury working her magic spell throughout the film. Now we can only hope that Walt Disney decides to delve into their deep pockets and pull out some more of those old live action classics. With a very nice stunning audio and video experience, and I cannot see why you shouldnt make this a priority purchase, unless you really want to wait for the extended cut version. Like Dame Angela Lansbury, the film has aged well and retains all of its joyous magic experience. Highly Recommended!

Such a great story line for the imaginative!
Lots of tricks and witchy spells in a light hearted fun delivery.

Angela Lansbury plays a student witch who suddenly finds herself saddled with three children who are refugees from the London Blitz.  Once they learn that she's a witch, one of the boys tries to blackmail her, only to wind up turned into a rabbit.  However, she's after the final spell that will teach her how to animate inanimate objects.  This leads her and the kids on a merry chase to London and then a mythical island ruled by a lion who isn't the brightest bulb in the chandelier.  However, (and here I'm gonna be a bit of a spoiler) she finally gets the spell and, to her delight, it works like a charm and helps her kick a bunch of invading Nazis right in the Panzers.

While this movie does have the drawback of existing in the shadow of the more successful ""Mary Poppins,"" (some of the songs used in this movie were rejected from the ""Mary Poppins"" script), it's still an enjoyable family film on its own.  The one drawback is that the Portobello Road musical number goes on a little too long.  I've been told that the original theatrical release cut the scene down considerably, but it was restored for the DVD release.

327940,1,6301390725,"This is a review of the of the special edition Blu Ray.

This has been one of my favorite Disney Classics. I have the 35th anniversary edition DVD which is a restored version of the film. Around 25 minutes of footage was put back in-and it is wonderful. So imagine my supreme disappointment When I found out(After I ordered it from the Disney Movie Club as part of the enrollment package)that it is the original version of 117 minutes-which I saw on the Disney Channel years ago.

To add insult to injury--they put on the special features that is on the 35th anniversary edition which Angelia Lansburry, the Sherman Brothers & others discussing the restoration of the film. One may wonder after seeing this version ""What restoration??"" These features DO NOT BELONG in this release. This is an insult to fans of this wonderful film.

They could have put on both versions on this release. But no, they had to downgrade the blu ray so they can rip people off in the future with a 50th anniversary edition in 2021.

I gave this 2 stars-1 star for decent sound and 1 for picture(Though I've seen better from Disney). Overall a grave disappointment.

Memo to Disney: Rectify this NOW! Put out the restored version and offer a replacement disc for those who bought this substandard blu ray.

UPDATE: It saddens me to inform readers that I deducted 1 star from this review. I just watched the DVD that has the extended version. I find that the Quality of the picture & sound isn't any better on the blu ray. Now I wished I would have selected another movie when I joined DMC-too late now.

327958,5,6301390725,"Here's the thing. As a child we owned this in VHS. It was the 117 minute version you see here. But in 2001 the 30th Anniversary DVD was released with all the deleted scenes and songs added back in. What a treat! To see the movie as it could have/should have been! For years my dad and I basked in the ""uncut"" edition. Then when it was announced that this was to be released on bluray, I stupidly got rid of my old DVD without first checking that this bluray was the expanded edition. IT IS NOT THE EXPANDED FILM. It is the theatrical version. I can't believe Disney didn't at least offer both versions on this edition! My bluray came as a Christmas present, but I'm getting rid of it at the first chance and getting a used copy of the 2001 30th Anniversary DVD. If like me, you had become accustomed to that edition, do not waste your money on this. Honestly, the picture quality isn't even that magnificent compared with the old DVD. This is the last time I trust Disney to get my bluray right without doing research!

Also, as regards to the film, I'm obviously quite fond of it! It's a classic. And to anyone foolish enough to call it a ""Mary Poppins rip off"": this was based on a book of the same title and was not created as a story by Disney to try to recreate Mary Poppins. True that they both feature a strong, independent female lead and the integration of live action and animation, but the stories (each based on books of the same titles) stand on their own individually. Plus, Angela Lansbury fights the Nazis in this movie! Truly lovely.",1451260800,,1550,4.344827586206897

328029,1,6301390725,"If you're in the market for a DVD of Bedknobs and Broomsticks, DO NOT buy the ""Enchanted Musical Edition."" It is not the movie you remember from your youth. The only way to get the original version on disc is to buy the Blu-ray. You'll notice that the Blu-ray has a run time of 117 (like the original). Whereas the enchanted edition on DVD has a run time of 140 mins. What's wrong with the extra footage? It's ghastly. The voice-overs are sloppy, and (quite frankly) the extra music was cut from the original for a good reason.",1444608000,,527,4.387755102040816

328774,5,6301390725,"Bedknobs and Broomsticks has been chopped to bits and put back together on several occasions.  The closest to the original running time is anything at 139 minutes or more.  Less, means you've got the hacked version released to theaters eons ago.

Since it's Disney, this means an unfair amount of tampering was done to the Mary Norton's books they based their movie on (The Magic Bed Knob and Bonfires and Broomsticks).  In Disney's version, the story takes place in 1940 during the Blitz when children were evacuated from London and placed in scattered villages far afield, supposedly out of harm's way.  Three such children are forced upon Eglantine Price (Angela Lansbury).  She doesn't want them and they don't want to be there.  The oldest boy tries to blackmail Miss Price and soon finds himself a rabbit.  Miss Price is an apprentice witch working from cockeyed spells mismanaged by a con artist (David Tomlinson).  She's patriotic, wanting to learn the spell for Substituiary Locomotion to aid in the war effort.  Trying to gain that spell takes them on not a few adventures.

Bedknobs and Broomsticks won an Oscar for its visual effects.  It was also nominated for best costume design, art direction, song (The Age of Not Believing), and best original score.

While not on the same level as the oft compared Mary Poppins, Bedknobs is quite remarkable in its own right.  The acting is superb, especially Angela Lansbury.  (Poor Roddy McDowall is wasted though, in a minor role as a clergyman who covets Miss Price's home.)  The animated sequence is a gem all on its own.

Such fond memories are associated with this film.",1417996800,,1629,4.886861313868613

My only beef is the lack of the restored 'Roadshow' edition released on DVD. Few of the extra scenes are really important, but there are some important bits that clarify the movie, such as Carrie's confession to Eglantine near the beginning and good, fun songs.

Yes, all this is included in the deleted scenes section of the disc, but why didn't they include both versions? It's a shame. If you look closely at Prof. Brown's introductory scene, one man in the crowd walks away covered in cake. In the deleted scenes, this makes sense.

328978,4,6301390725,"This isn't a review about the plot of Bedknobs and Broomsticks or anything of that sort. What this review tells the consumer are the enhancements made and the various special features and their quality.

Movie Quality: We will start with the movie, which is basically a remastered theatrical release (the version that people would have seen on VHS). So unlike the original DVD release, this version does NOT come with the extended scenes and songs, which is a pity. The good news is that you can access these in the special features anyway. So if you are upgrading (or downgrading as I see it) to the blu-ray ""special edition"", then you will not entirely miss out on what the original DVD version had. But my point is that you will atleast gain the theatrical release, which I don't know about anyone else... but I still appreciate.

Special Features: The special features are more or less similar to the DVD release, but I think I prefer the DVD version more simply because I thought that execution of these features was alot smoother. By this, I mean that I have the playstation 4 and it handles movies in a rather peculiar way, so it could be my playstation 4 and my 720p television. But for all intents and purposes, these are still the same sort of special features that you had loved before.

In Addition: You will have the DVD, Blu-Ray and digital versions of the movie and possibly the special features. Any computer with a DVD drive will be able to run the DVD version and any computer with a Blu-Ray players will be able to play both the Blu-Ray AND DVD versions. If you want a movie to watch with your whole family, you will find no better movie to entertain then Bedknobs and Broomsticks. But I have to say that I prefered the original DVD release over this varient.",1410134400,,1778,4.55

Later on, it was reconstructed and put out with much of the edited parts reinserted, and ran two hours and 18 minutes (138 minutes).  This new 2014 Blu Ray version makes no reference to the previous reconstructed version, and the time is listed as 117 minutes.  My question: is this the original theatrical version, or the 25th anniversary reconstructed version.  If they had gone to the trouble of putting it back together again why are they giving us the older version?  After all, they've proved that this is not a case like Humpty Dumpty where they COULDN'T put it back together again.",1409529600,2,726,4.722222222222222

This re-released classic was well restored and the music sounded amazing. I also appreciated that there were different versions of the songs (and some that were not in the original) that you now can enjoy.

329041,3,6301390725,"For some inexplicable reason, Disney has chosen to omit the fully restored version of Bedknobs and Broomsticks from this Blu-ray release, opting instead for the inferior 117 min version. Scenes containing important plot information and character motivation, along with several wonderful musical numbers, have all been clumsily excised from the film. To rub salt in the wound, a featurette produced to celebrate the restored edition IS INCLUDED as a special feature on the blu-ray disc!

A shame, as the A/V presentation is the best I have seen and heard for what could have been a must-own Blu-ray release.

Why, Disney? Why?

EDIT:
Having now spent some time with this release, my stance on this blu-ray has softened considerably.

As a matter of fact, in the bonus material there is a documentary that discusses the cuts that were made years ago to this film and how now it comes together in the full version.

329091,1,6301390725,"UPDATE
To resolve confusion being caused by other reviewers:  The feature on the Blu-ray disc runs one hour and fifty-seven minutes.
(Another reviewer appears to have incorrectly interpreted 1:57 as 157 minutes.  It is actually 117 minutes.)
I assure everyone this is the shorter, original theatrical version, without the additional scenes that were included on previous DVD editions.

ALSO - The special features on the Blu-ray disc include a featurette entitled ""Music Magic:  The Sherman Brothers"".  This featurette is about all the scenes that were cut.  The entire purpose of this featurette is to promote the restoration of these scenes back into the film and discuss the challenges encountered in the restoration process.  Angela Lansbury and others speak at length about how lovely it is to be able to see the film again as originally intended.  The people who worked on this project would have had to be idiots not to notice the disparity between the version of the movie promoted in the bonus materials (if anybody had actually watched them) and the actual version of the movie on the disc.  Having worked for Disney Home Entertainment myself, this is not entirely surprising.

In my review earlier today, I wrote:
I am stunned at the botched job Disney has done with the Blu-ray release of this magical film.  When it was released on DVD a few years ago, it included the restoration of addition musical sequences that had been cut for the original theatrical release.  The running time was 139 minutes.  Even the earlier laserdisc edition contained the 139 minute version of the film.  I was looking very forward to upgrading to Blu-ray, expecting the film would look spectacular on Blu-ray.  Sadly, Disney made the poor decision of releasing only the original 117 minute version of the feature on Blu-ray.  It is over 20 minutes shorter than the version previously released on DVD and laserdisc.  Much of the content that had been incorporated into the feature for the previous editions is included on the Blu-ray as Special Features, but not incorporated into the feature.  Surely Disney has the creative and technical resources (as well as the marketing sense) to have included both versions of the feature on the Blu-ray disc.  As it stands, I feel the Blu-ray is a major disappointment and a downgrade from the DVD, due to the failure to include the extended version of the film.  What a disappointment!",1407801600,117,2419,4.970149253731344
329092,1,6301390725,"As an admirer of this film, I feel I need to say that Disney never really made an effort to even suggest that this was ONLY the 117 minute theatrical cut of the film.  The theatrical cut is NOT the whole story, and if you are a fan of this wonderful film, skip this and buy the 30th Anniversary DVD. That release contains the restored 139 minute cut PLUS the audio of a further musical number whose footage is lost forever.  Yes, a Blu Ray release can only enhance the beauty of this film, but it is shameful that Disney, who spent hours of time, effort, and millions of dollars to save this film from oblivion, only to release a truncated version to Blu Ray.  The restored musical numbers,  referred to in the list of Bonus Features as ""...Five Enchanting Deleted and Extended songs...&...Eight Magical and Deleted Scenes..."" should comprise the missing 22 minutes that are inserted into the film properly on the DVD, but not on the Blu Ray.  For the South Pacific Blu Ray, Fox presented the General Release Version and a Restored (with footage of a lesser quality-but presented nonetheless) recreation of the Roadshow Version, each on a separate Blu Ray Disc in one set.

The movie must have been cut during not before the run at RCMH.  Maybe they showed the longer version during lower audience capacity periods (like after the holidays).  It was the highlight of the movie for me!  The ""Spoon Full of Sugar"" of the movie.  So months later I watch the movie again in a local Brooklyn theatre and the number is cut.  I was devastated!  Given Nyquil and put to bed.  I didn't know they could do this to movies.  If it were a person, it was like having a leg chopped off! So many years later after the movie has been butchered beyond recognition, they come up with an uncut version on Laser disc and later DVD.  The number is still missing and a number I have never seen shows up in pristine condition (Nobody's Problems for Me).  How did they not lose that?  It wasn't even on the record! I could not ever imagine anyone at Disney could be that stupid to lose an entire major scene (this is the 70's not the 20's)!

329219,5,6301390725,"If you're interested in this title this is definitely the version to get.  It includes the restored version of the film which approximates the original English version, where the film was released first.  It's something in the order of 25 minutes longer!  Plus there's a nice behind the scenes video about the restoration, plus a recreation in stills and music of a still missing song.

It's a shame the picture for this song seems permanently lost because it introduces Lansbury's character.  I suggest you watch the making of video first.  Then, as you watch the movie you can stop at the appropriate place and watch the missing song.  I think it makes a lot of difference about how a viewer feels about Lansbury's character.

BTW, there are many different aspect ratios listed for this movie, 1.33 and 1.75.  But this copy is in 1.66 (European widescreen).

329248,5,6301390725,"We viewed this with our grandchildren, aged 7-12,  over my husband's objections, as he had thought it would be too tame for children who had seen even the first Harry Potter movie. He was pleasantly surprised when they enjoyed it more than any other movie they have seen, and, though it was made in 1971, the special effects are good enough that they wanted to know how some things had been done. They said it was the funniest movie they had ever seen, and it is one of the few really good movies from bygone days to have a strong female lead, played by the amazingly talented Angela Lansbury, with outstanding supporting performance by the child actors and David Tomlinson (Mr. Banks from Mary Poppins), so it stands the test of time.

329256,3,6301390725,"BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS was cut from it's intended length to accommodate the stage show that was to precede it for it's opening engagement at New York's Radio City Music Hall. It went into release in that short version, leaving fans to wonder for years why there were songs on the soundtrack album that weren't in the movie.  Ace restorationist  Scott McQueen led the efforts to find the missing elements and in 1996 Disney debuted a restored version at the Motion Picture Academy with available cast present, and key original props on display.  The new version was not perfect, it has some awful dubbing for lost dialogue and the most important cut song was still missing, but the other songs we had missed for years were back in place and most welcome, along with some scenes that flesh out the plot and characters.

That was 18 years ago, and that has been the version released on laserdisc and DVD for all these years.  Now that it's being released on HD Download, streaming and finally on BluRay, one would expect that same version in a better transfer.

The high price for the digital download would suggest this is the longer restored version, but nooo... the HiDef digital download from Amazon is only the short cut version.

Sadly, infuriatinlgly, Disney has again given BluRay buyers the short end of the broomstick.  The BluRay has only the short version, and the material restored 18 years ago is now chopped up into segmented supplements.  The cut material is just as HiDef as the feature, so obviously a new transfer was done of the complete version, which means of course both versions could have been included (as with BEAUTY AND THE BEAST) but someone at Disney has decided to shortchange the fans, as they did with MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL. For that reason, I am again refusing to reward them with my money.

The movie itself is delightful, a longtime favorite, but I'm not going to pay more money for a shorter feature than we've had for 18 years.  My order for the digital version was cancelled and the BluRay has been returned for a refund.  I'll hold out for the more complete version or a package that includes both the complete and cut versions.",1395792000,6,2168,4.7063492063492065

329311,4,6301390725,This movie has the same director and some of the same music writing team that worked on those ear-wigs that are in the 'Mary Poppins' but with Nazi's thrown in the mix. Angela Landsbury plays an apprentice witch taking mail-order classes from David Tomlinson (Mr. Banks from 'Mary Poppins') and wants to help out Britain repel the Nazi's in case they land on British soil. Add in some children to hang out with a magical woman while they wander through a cartoon-world at times. This movie doesn't have the staying power of 'Mary Poppins' and is a bit more jumbled since the original running time was closer to 3hrs but still a very fun movie.,1393113600,,643,4.6

I could see my DVDs through the giant hole in the side of the box. All three cases were damaged badly even to the point of being torn through the plastic. One of the discs became warped due to the damage it sustained on the trip (this one). Oh all three were still watchable, and my daughter fell in love with them. And I wasn't about to make my 4 year old have to wait until they come back before being able to watch them again. Not to mention the fact that there's no guarantee that the new ones I exchanged the for would arrive in any better condition.

As for the movie itself, I've read a review that says the sound on this can get out of sync a bit.  I haven't had a chance to watch this version yet.  I remember the story being delightful, and a very imaginative adventure.  I would say that anyone who's looking for a little whimsy would be happy with this movie.

329568,4,6301390725,"As a kid I loved this movie, and my seven and nine year old sons enjoyed it with me this time, despite being a little dated visually, it is fun.  The story is simple enough to follow, but has WWII references that we had to explain.  It brushes the concepts of a scam, bravery in the face of fearful unknown, confidence, honesty, patriotism, and optimism mixed with mid-20th Century Disney magic and live actors interacting with Cartoons.

It's not a ""Classic"". I wouldn't put it in the category of Mary Poppins, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Peter Pan, or the Sound of Music, probably more on par with Roger Rabbit or The Mask.",1374019200,,622,4.535714285714286

329586,5,6301390725,"As lifelong fan of Disney art I've held good memories of this film, since the first time our family watched it at the drive-in theater. (A long time ago.)  The animation was brilliant and the armor was gleaming.  The Nazis are routed, and our apprentice witch (Angela Lansbury) gets to be a hero even as she has a little difficulty defying gravity on that broom of hers.

It's great to see so many of the Disney classics available through Amazon Digital Services.  I'm still impressed with the genius of Disney marketing, after the major Hollywood film studios had to abandon their flamboyant song and dance musical theatrics, along comes Disney, puts the musicians back to work, and creates utterly fanciful animations to accompany their stories.  And Americans found something new the whole family could enjoy.

Bedknobs and Broomsticks was nearly if not the first motion picture I remember from childhood.  That's probably my first introduction to soccer as well.  It still makes me laugh out loud.  And even though my play back equipment is superior, it can't out do that first impression.  It's nothing like Hogwart's, grant you.  But I think it's fair to compare the expansion on an idea which fits into Bedknobs and Broomsticks, and Sword in the Stone, Darby O'Gill and the Little People, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.  The human spirit, from the oldest to the very youngest, just below the surface is the most magical thing.",1371340800,3,1435,4.884297520661157

329591,2,6301390725,"I guess I am in the minority on this movie, but I found it rather dull.  It had an interesting story line, but got bogged down with boring songs and overly long dance routines.  Probably would have made a good 90 minute movie.

Improbabilities in the relationships also hurt the story.  Despite being forced to take care of the 3 orphans much to her chagrin, Miss Price does an about face and wants to keep them after their short experiences together.  Miss Price goes to London to track down Professor Browne, who swindled her, yet in the matter of a day or so, there appears to be a romantic interest developing with no real chemistry visible.  It seemed a bit contrived.

My wife and I both feel asleep half way through the movie.  We resumed watching it on a second nite.  My 9 year old daughter thought it was so-so.

Visual effects were great considering it was the pre-CGI era.",1369353600,,884,4.46875

329744,5,6301390725,"And as a 46 year-old baby, I wanted (nay... DEMANDED) three things:

Fleece Pajamas; a bowl of soup (OK, mac and cheese, but I didn't want to sound like a pig) the size of my HEAD; and THIS MOVIE.

One of my favorites from childhood (I saw it first run when it premiered, right around the corner from where I now live, at the fabled Radio City Music Hall) I didn't think twice before searching for it and clicking ""Heck Yeah!"" on the RENT IN HD FOR 48 HOURS button, and kicking back to enjoy.

It did not let me down, and is EVERYTHING it was back then.

This movie is just... magic. And what's more, it reminds you of what it's like to be young and hopeful and certain the world is full of mystery and amazement. It only takes a few minutes to suck you in, so when the inimitable Angela Lansbury (starring here as a wanna-be mail order apprentice witch living in the outskirts of London at the onset of WWII) sings to one of her young charges that he's ""At the Age of Disbelieving"", you can't help but shake your head in agreement and slight pity as you side with her, hoping he'll come around and like you, realize what amazing adventures the world holds in store for you.

The extra 20 minutes excised from the original theatrical release (it was contractual: Radio City would run premieres with a full-out stage show, and for time reasons films had to fit strict time constraints or they'd just shut the projector or yank the film from the marquee) have been restored here. And considering I was in the fleece pajamas and full of mac and cheese, I didn't miss the stage show one bit, either.

If your kids don't love this movie, you're raising them wrong, and shame on you.

If you don't love this too, you were never a child and were dropped here from an icy, heartless planet, and you need to get over all the burdens of the world and allow yourself to fall in love with it.

I promise you will.

...But then I watched it and was so horribly disappointed by the movie's mutilation that I couldn't even finish watching it and haven't watched it since (a couple years).

This is one of my childhood favorites. Why don't they get that when you grow up watching something you don't want a ""new and improved"" version of it because the original will always be the best?!

329880,3,6301390725,"Well, this is one I know I never saw before. It's a combination of live action and animation, a technique Disney pioneered with ""Mary Poppins"" in 1964. This movie is not as effective as that one, but it's good fun.

Miss Price (Angela Lansbury) lives in a remote village, and is asked (no, ordered, actually) to take in three London orphans during the World War II bombing raids on London. Carrie is the oldest and a practical girl, then Charlie is the middle child and a skeptic, and Paul is the youngest. The magical bedknob is given to him.

Miss Price is an apprentice witch who has been taking correspondence lessons from an old fraud in London, Emelius Browne, but he closes the school before she gets the promised last lesson. Since she considers it of vital importance to her secret war work, she and the children take the enchanted bed to London to find Professor Browne. He's not much like any of them imagined him to be.

The magic in the story is surprisingly authentic in this regard: it all depends on the capabilities of the witch, not on the incantations. Browne had been a total fake, but Miss Price was able to work the spells (not always quite the way she wanted) because she had a talent of her own.

The best part is when they go to the Island of Naboombu, which is all done with cartoons. The country is run by animals, who talk and wear clothes and act rather human, but who don't like humans. The King (a lion, of course) drafts Browne to be referee in a soccer match that has got to be the craziest one ever played. Quidditch has got nothing on these guys! The reason they were there, and also why they went to Portabello Road in search of half an old book, takes too long to explain. Let's just say a good bit of it was an excuse for some considerable music and dancing. I grew impatient with the humans on Portabello Road, but the fish in the lagoon at Namboombu were fun.

It's a very silly movie, with some things in common with Mary Poppins, but it is fun. I'd share it with children or grandchildren if I had any, but possibly not without considerable explanation.",1336608000,,2095,4.403100775193798

I never questioned why there were songs on the soundtrack which didn't appear in the film because ""thematically"" the songs ""fit.""

I was primed to like this release.

What never even entered my mind was that they would undertake to redub the dialogue for the extended scenes for actors who have since passed away.  Now Disney, who is zealous about the replacement voices for their animated characters, spent little time, effort or money on matching the voices of the live action actors in this film.  They are HORRIBLE.  It's almost as if they asked the receptionist to put on her best accent and read the line.  Mrs. Hobday is the worst.  I find it hard to believe that even the slightest search for a vocal match wouldn't have yielded something better.  In fact, picking a name out of the phone book would have yielded better results.  They have taken the performances of great character actors and made them look buffoonish with alien voices supplied by accent and acting-challenged individuals.

This movie doesn't have the modern technology to create the atmosphere. What it does have is talent and storyline that keep it a pleasure to watch.

I see that for the young children of today have a harder time with the movies split between the animated characters and the actors. But as the story plays out they get lost in the colors and music.

For me I saw this when I was young, and shared it with my own children. That was why I purchased 2 of the dvd's recently. One for each of my own children, to share one day with their own children.

Nothing can beat the talent that went into creating this movie can't be beat by today's technology. The song and dance scenes take you right along with the character development.

330018,3,6301390725,"In a lot of ways, ""Bedknobs"" is one of a pair of Disney  bookends with ""Mary Poppins"" - or perhaps it is Mary Poppins' not-so-well-known twin, even though the ""Bedknobs"" movie did wander even farther from Mary Norton's original book, than did Mary Poppins from P.L. Traver's telling. ""Bedknobs"" was released some five years later, incorporated animation and live-action, lively and rousing musical numbers by the Sherman brothers - who even teleported a musical sequence - the underwater fish dance-hall -  originally meant for Mary Poppins over to ""Bedknobs"", where it fitted in seamlessly.""Bedknobs"" - which is fondly remembered by my own daughter -  featured a charming spinster with an affinity for magical adventures, three adorable and spunky children, a light touch of romance in the person of Professor Emilius Brown, played by David Tomlinson, who played the banker father in ""Mary Poppins."" The plot - such as there is - is not quite as episodic, being that Miss Eglantine Price desires to complete her training as a witch, so that she can work a spell to defend England from German invasion. That is the thread which strings together hers and the children's magical voyage on a flying brass bed, through London's Portobello Road street market (and a wonderful dance sequence), through a magical underwater realm (the fish dance hall sequence)  and the island above it, where a slightly mad king of the animals presides over a knock-down and drag-out football game. The concluding episode - where Miss Price's spell animates a whole museum full of armor to defend Britain's shores from an invading German commando party is a creepily effective live-action sequence, but not without some comic pratfalls.

Extras on ""Bedknobs"" are sketchy, in comparison to other recent Disney releases; a reconstruction of a song, ""A Step in the Right Direction"" which was edited out, and for which only the sound track and still pictures remain, the almost obligatory feature about the music with Disney's in-house composers, the Sherman Brothers, and an original recording session with David Tomlinson. The one bally-hooed bonus feature is an unbearably twee and cutsey sequence hosted by the star of a current Disney show, on special effects - which is as uninformative as it is embarrassing to watch; nothing about how the movie was developed, or adapted, no interviews with any of the stars, or reminiscences about shooting it. Frankly, the bonus features don't add much to the movie itself, which is impeccably restored, and with all the original footage included.",1269043200,,2563,5.136690647482014
330019,5,6301390725,"""Bedknobs and broomsticks"" is a children's movie featuring Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson.

The main character, Miss Price, is an apprentice witch in Britain during World War Two. Price searches for a magical spell she believes could help her country fight the Nazis. After various adventures, Price and her companions find themselves on the mysterious island of Naboombu, where the animals can talk and behave almost like humans, apparently after being enchanted by the vanished magician Astoroth.

Miss Price realizes that the spell she's been looking for is engraved on a pentagram worn as a medallion by the lion king of the island. After even more crazy adventures, the travelling party returns home to Britain, where the Nazis have staged a landing. The spell of Astoroth is supposed to bring inanimate objects to life, and Price promptly tries it on the medieval armour at her castle. Will the spell work? Or is Albion doomed to suffer the perfidy of the Third Reich...?

Well, how do *you* think the movie ends?

I've only seen ""Bedknobs and broomsticks"" once. And yet, I grew up with the movie.

How is that possible?

The reason is simple. Two parts of the movie are animated. When I was a kid, the animated parts were released as separate cartoons, at least here in Sweden. Thus, you could buy the animated parts of ""Bedknobs and broomsticks"" without actually watching the rest.

One of the cartoons, known in Sweden as ""The Game of the Century"", features a soccer game between two teams of animals. The animals are of course animated, while the human referee is a real actor (Tomlinson), interacting with the cartoon characters. And yes, it's hilariously funny! My father used to bring a movie projector to our elementary school and show all the kids both ""The Game of the Century"" and a ""Speedy Gonzales"" cartoon. We almost laughed ourselves to tears. I mean, the animals cheat, big time. The poor human referee is constantly swept aside by crazy, stampeding beasts. Is it soccer or is it ultimate fighting, I wonder? In the end, the team made up of ""bad"" animals (including the lion king) actually wins the game, at which point the badly mauled referee calls it off. There, the cartoon ends, with a mysterious castle shown in the background...

When I saw the entire movie, I finally got the answer to a question that bothered me already as a kid: why did the bad guys win the game? It turns out that the cheating lion king eventually gets punished by the good humans arriving on his mysterious island. Well, he deserved it, if you ask me! ;-)

I'm not sure how modern kids would react to ""Bedknobs and broomsticks"" as a whole. As I remember it, the film is very old fashioned. Small wonder. It was produced in 1971. It contains both regular dialogue and a couple of songs, dutifully sung by the main characters. This musical aspect never appealed to me, not even as a child. I found it boring. In short, this is as far away as you can possibly get from ""Power Rangers"" or ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"". Perhaps this movie is better as a nostalgia trip for great grandparents?

However, I do remember that my best friend in elementary school thought the movie was cool, especially the fight against the Nazis. The movie is G-rated, but the youngest kids might find parts of it scary (the Nazis, the medieval knights, etc). It's a pity the soccer game isn't separately released anymore - it's excellent entertainment in its own right, and suitable for all ages.

I'm not sure how to rate ""Bedknobs and broomsticks"", but I'll give it five stars for the wonderful animals of Naboombu. Loyal fans, we have a referee!!!",1268524800,,3634,4.752380952380952

330061,3,6301390725,"Bedknobs and Broomsticks released in the U.S.in time for the Christams season of 1971 was an attempt by Disney to recapture the mega success of Mary Poppins seven years before. But B&B would miss that benchmark by a country mile,lacking its`stellar and timeless charm; mostly through the lacklustre appeal and performances of its stars.
The story takes place in August of 1940 in Britain,not too far into the famous Battle of Britain. Invasion by the Germans is uppermost on every Englishmans` mind and the civilian homeguard has been formed as a first line of ``defence``,with special attention to coastal areas. Towns and cities are being regularly bombed by the Luftwaffe and the Government institutes a program of evacuation for its` younger citizens. Many are shipped overseas while many others are shipped to the English countryside. This is where the movie comes in as three orphans arrive in the small coastal town of Dorset. The last to find homes,they are foisted on an unsuspecting local by the name of Miss E.Price(Angela Landsbury).
This seemingly reclusive individual,the youngsters soon find out,has a fascinating secret. She has been taking witchcraft by correspondance through the mail. One night as they are in the process of leaving their digs to return to London they witness a rather unsuccessful attempt by Miss Price to take her maiden flight on a broomstick. The children decide to stay thinking the best way to improve their situation is to conduct some inventive blackmail. For their silence they want the food improved and money. After some wrangling both sides come to an amicable arrangement.
As it turns out Miss Price is missing the spell to Substitutiary Locomotion and needs to find the professor of her course in London. The kids and her hop aboard a brass rail bed and whoosh off to their destination. There they find one Prof. Browne(David Tomlinson) who is in reality a charlatan. His ``course`` was haphazardly put together for his ``pupils`` through the use of an old magic book. While the truth comes out Miss P is still adamant that she wants the other part of the book containing her spell. Through a long search the missing book comes,so to speak,to them. They are forcefully taken to a bookseller who has the part she needs. But it only refers to the words on a medallion,the Star of Astoroth and that is on the island of Naboombu around the neck of its`king,a lion.
Off they go and after refereeing a rather ``physical`` game of soccer,the Prof. relieves the king of his medallion. They return back home only to find the medallion has not made the transition from one world to the other. All the time the medallions`words have been in a book one of the children had been reading. At just this time a sub arrives just off shore and German soldiers take over the town. Through Miss Price`s Substitutiary Locomotion spell she is able to bring to life various and sundry pieces of old military armour and clothing. With her help in the air they are able to send the Germans fleeing the town and from England`s shores. The movie ends with Miss Price and Prof. Browne in love and the latter heading off to war.
What should have been a better movie turned out just the opposite. Landsbury is totally lacking the charm,appeal and I daresay talent of a Julie Andrews. David Tomlinson as the Professor seems like he is totally uninterested in the entire proceedings and sleepwalks his way through the film and it unfortunately comes across to the audience. Disney again thought that the Sherman Brothers would again create some musical magic to help the proceedngs but most of the numbers are really sub par material. There are some nice live/animation sequences here with the island of Naboombu but by the time they get there in the film the preceding time has been so mediocre that the same interest is not there that otherwise should have been. This film is really ``forced-cutesy`` and nothing the stars and the music is able to do can hide its` transparent facade for all to see.
This particular edition of B&B is the 36th anniversary edition,not the original theatrical version. The original movie came in under two hours but Disney pulled every bit of extra usable footage they had and reconstructed the film into a 138 minute juggernaut. The original film was too long and this version makes it that much more interminably long. This DVD releases` saving grace is the quality of the restoration. They have remastered the material here excellently and the film has never looked so good. The extras include a rare snippet of recording session footage with David Tomlinson being conducted by Irwin Kostal singing the Portobello Road number,the trailer,a look at the special effects,the Sherman Brothers and a reconstruction of the only major portion of film they couldn`t reinsert;a Landsbury number called ``A Step in the Right Direction``.As an aside,while you watch some of the scenes closely,especially some of the reinserted footage with Tomlinson,you will hear a definite voice change. There was some judicious overdubbing done to compensate for bad sound or a total lack thereof!
In conclusion while this film may have a limited appeal to children and even less for adults,time has not changed my oppinion of it at all. It was a mediocre film then and it still remains so today. The film was originally touted as a return to a Mary Poppinesque form(which explains its box office returns) but it was,in execution,far from Mary as things could get. The stars have little appeal in this film and  Tomlinson especially looks like he wanted to be somewhere else during the entire time. The music is lacklustre and not memorable at all. Another protion of the film touted in adverstising of the day was the live/animation sequences which again are lacking the punch and appeal of other Disney efforts. While the remastering is excellent here this newly extended 36th anniversary edition to about 138 minutes adds just less ecstacy and more agony!",1263081600,4,5987,4.910167818361303
330062,3,6301390725,"Quick, what movie features Britain in turmoil, three young children growing up under the tutelage of a sorceress, invocations of ancient demons and wizards, curse spells, and a modern school of magic that's not what it appears to be? Nope, it's not Harry Potter...it's Bedknobs and Broomsticks!

It's the beginning of World War II and Miss Price (Angela Lansbury, looking suitably spinsterish) has been saddled with three British war orphans: Charlie (Ian Weighill), Carrie (Cindy O'Callaghan) and Paul Rawlins (Roy Snart). Although she prefers to keep to herself, Price has no choice but to take them under her wing, at least until a more proper home can be found for them.  As it turns out, Miss Price is a witch, a witch who hopes to help the British war effort if only she can master the final level of her training and thereby learn the spell ""substitutiary locomotion.""

The three orphans eventually stumble upon her secret.  In an unlikely series of deals and skullduggery, Price bargains with the orphans to keep her secret in exchange for some magic, a bed knob that transforms any bed into a dimension-traveling device. Soon after, Price discovers that her tutoring via post from the mysterious Professor Emelius Browne (David Tomlinson), headmaster of the College of Witchcraft, has come to an abrupt end.  Using the bed knob, Price and the three children track down Browne, who is in fact a con man that doesn't know much about magic at all.

Thus begins a quest to find the elusive substitutiary spell, first via double-dealings with a bookseller who has the other half of a mysterious spellbook, and then to an animated world of talking animals in pursuit of an amulet with the magic words inscribed upon it.  Along the way, the motley band will face down the King of the Beasts, a razor-wielding thug, and of machinegun-toting Nazis.

Bedknobs and Broomsticks shows its age, both in its narrative speed and its approach to mature themes.  The musical numbers often meander, with the characters speaking their lines and dance routines that are far too aggressive for the two older protagonists.  There are a few misogynistic references (met with a frown by Miss Price) and...well, it's all very British, as it should be. The movie also isn't afraid to threaten the children with real harm, be it from a charging lion or a Nazi wielding a machinegun. Bad people in this movie are really bad, and there's a refreshing honesty about the whole thing.

By the time film gets around to its climax, young children will likely be bored.  But what a glorious climax it is, complete with unrealistically numerous legions of animated suits of armor arrayed against the Nazis, who are there to ""teach Britain a lesson.""  Although at times jingoistic, Bedknobs aims high and rarely sugarcoats the harsh realities of war.

This is as much a war film as it is a flight of fantasy, and in that regard Bedknobs and Broomsticks has some important lessons to teach young children. And in that regard, Miss Price and friends could teach Harry Potter a thing or two.",1258502400,2,3059,4.857692307692307

However it is Disney and they just strip out what they think works, and at the time that this was beginning to start Walt had passed away...., however this is still charming for the child in all of us. Angela Lansbury is a gem in this and truly a great reason to own this movie. I myself had seen Angela in Sweeney Todd when it reopen at the time the New Wang Theater once know as the metropolitan Music Box theater...., She was a wonderful performer and a delight to what on stage, and I am grateful that she was in the wonderful Blithe Spirit.

330070,4,6301390725,"""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" is one of my favorite Disney films. Yes, I know it's not ""Mary Poppins,"" but as Leonard Maltin wrote in The Disney Films,"" it's not fair to make comparisons -- though it's inevitable considering the creative people involved: songs by the Sherman brothers conducted by Irwin Kostal; screenplay by Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi and direction by Robert Stevenson.

Walt Disney was somewhat involved with Bedknobs, as he had bought the rights to the books by Mary Norton (""The Borrowers""), upon which the film was based as a backup, in case the prickly P. L. Travers blew up negotiations for her ""Poppins"" books. The song, ""The Beautiful Briny"" was even written for a proposed ""Poppins"" sequence that never made it to final script.

This large-scale extravaganza certainly deserves more respect and attention than is usually afforded it. What ""Bedknobs"" has going for it is a sharper story direction than Poppins. Even though there are some detours along the way, such as the Portobello Street Dance, everything serves the central focus of Miss Price's use of magic to stave off Nazi invaders. Of course, that storyline itself, an invention of the screenwriters and not in the books, can be considered off-putting by some, including Angela Lansbury, who in the outstanding Sherman brothers documentary feature, The Boys, expresses embarrassment of sorts that the comedic battle at the end trivializes World War II, especially after discovering Robert Sherman's physical and mental suffering as a result of the horrors of Nazi atrocities.

Lansbury has rarely expressed a distinct enthusiasm for ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" except on rare occasions such as when the film was restored as much as possible to its intended length (it was edited severely both in 1971 and 1979). Reportedly, she clashed with director Stevenson over the approach to Miss Price's character (apparently she did not find him to be an ""actor's director""). Her house had burned down at the time and she was having family issues. Plus, her dream of achieving the same kind of musical comedy success in the movies as she did on Broadway as Mame did not happen with this film, especially since her song and dance number was cut so Radio City Music Hall would have more showings per day.

The Disney studio was also in a state of flux when ""Bedknobs"" was produced and Walt's leadership and creative decision making shows most in ""big"" movies like this and ""Pete's Dragon."" But all things considered, ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" is still an excellent, entertaining family film with fine songs and a great cast (whom we get to see more of thanks to the restored footage).

For some reason, the new ""Enchanted Musical Edition"" DVD seems to have less special material than the 30th Anniversary Edition that preceded it. A new ""making of"" feature starring ""Wizards of Waverly Place's"" Jennifer Stone actually goes into less detail about the special effects than the one on the recent ""Pete's Dragon"" DVD release. There is no commentary and no new musical material on the ""Bedknobs"" DVD, even though it's called an ""Enchanted Musical Edition."" (There were alternate versions of songs and demos that might have been nice.) Plus, in the ""Step in the Right Direction"" feature, the prologue refers to the laserdisc version from which it came.

If you don't already have ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks,"" it's nice that this edition is available and reissues like this keep great films in the public eye. But if you have the earlier edition, hang onto it.",1253577600,4,3524,5.0256849315068495

330101,4,6301390725,"In 1971, the Disney musical ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" was a film that captivated audiences with its special effects, music and storyline.  The film was nominated for five Academy Awards and won an award for ""Best Effects, Special Visual Effects"".

Directed by Robert Stevens (""Mary Poppins"", ""The Love Bug"" and ""Herbie Rides Again""), Stevens teamed up with award winning composers, the Sherman Brothers  - Richard and Robert  (who took home two Academy Awards for ""Mary Poppins""),  screenwriter Bill Walsh (""Mary Poppins"", ""Herbie Rides Again"") and Don DaGradi (""Mary Poppins"" and ""The Love Bug"").

The film would feature major talents such as Angela Lansbury (""Murder, She Wrote"", ""The Manchurian Candidate"", ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"", ""Death on the Nile"" and ""Gaslight""), David Tomlinson (""The Love Bug"", ""Mary Poppins""), Roddy Mcdowall (""Fright Night"", ""Class of 1984', ""Cleopatra""), Cindy O'Callaghan (""EastEnders"", ""Triangle"", ""The Bill""), Ian Weighill and Roy Snart.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Bedknobs and Broomsticks: Enchanted Musical Edition"" is now fully restored and remastered, the film is presented in Widescreen (1:66:1) and definitely improves upon the 2001 30th Anniversary release. The film looks much clearer and more vibrant but with that being said, for those who were wondering if dust and scratches are now gone from this 2009 version, unfortunately, the dust and scratches are quite evident.  Grain is evident but it's important to note that I am a reviewer that supports grain over DNR (digital noise reduction).

I would imagine that the film print for ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" is in satisfactory shape.  I would hope that any major restoration would probably come during the time the film receives its High Definition Blu-ray transfer as Disney has done with a lot of their classic animated releases (note:  None of the classic live-action Disney films have been released on Blu-ray at this time) but it would be interesting to see if this is the best cleanup and remastering that can be done from the original print.

As for audio, audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound (with also a French language track).  The film is primarily a dialogue and music-based film and utilizes the front and center channel of your home theater system.  I chose to listen to the film with my receiver setting on stereo on each channel.  But dialogue and music is quite clear and if there were any use of surround, I believe that most of it comes during the action sequences close to the end of the film.  But overall, the film is dialogue and music driven and both come out nice and clear through the front channels.

Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" is a classic Disney film that I grew up with.  Although, when it comes to Disney classic musicals, ""Mary Poppins"" is much more memorable in terms of music, ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" captured my attention because of the special effects, the storyline and how it was able to incorporate so much.  May it have a little romance, a magical storyline but also manages to incorporate a bit of war film with some action during the film's final half.  And for me, that final half hour and watching that as a child was quite remarkable.

And what is more enjoyable for me this time around is that I had the opportunity to watch this film with my six-year-old.  I can remember being eight years old when the film was re-released in theaters but to watch this film with my son was actually a great experience and I would assume that other parents who grew up with this film are doing the same.  And of course, for that new generation of Disney fans, the tie-in with this film and Disney's current popular supernatural TV series ""Wizards of Waverly Place"" on the DVD is another incentive for parents to purchase this latest release.

""Bedknobs and Broomsticks: Enchanted Musical Edition"" contains only one version of this movie and it is the extended version (not the shorter cut featured in the theater), so for those who were hoping for both, maybe in the future for the Blu-ray release.

For those who own the 30th Anniversary edition on DVD (2001) and are wondering if they should double dip on this latest release and if it is worth it?  The additional bonus footage may be worth  it to some viewers but duration-wise, it's not a lot.  Also, I would imagine that if a 40th Anniversary edition was released on Blu-ray, we may see it in 2011.

But the film is indeed a classic and for those who grew up with this film and have never purchased it on DVD before may definitely want to give ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks: Enchanted Musical Edition"" a chance!",1252972800,2,5961,4.962701612903226
330102,1,6301390725,"This review is about the DVD itself. I love this movie and is one of my all time favorites. When it was announced that a new edition was coming, I was very excited because I thougt they will improve the film. I own the 30th anniversary edition and while is not a terrible DVD is also not perfect. My first dissapointment was to know that again it was a single-disc edition. Then, I knew that the new feauterette that looked very exciting (Wizards of Special Effects) was only a way to promote Wizards of Waverly Place. Also no new restoration was added and they even cut a featurette that appeared in the previous DVD. What a shame that Disney could not put out a descent package for this wonderful film, so my recommendation is that if you already own the 30th Ann. Ed., stick with it because this new edition is not woth buying. Let's hope that maybe Disney will deliver us a strong 2-disc set in 2011 when the movie will commemorate its 40th Anniversary.",1252368000,19,957,4.443181818181818
330103,4,6301390725,"""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" (1971) was a favorite of mine when I first saw it. The idea of being able to transport yourself anywhere by turning the knob at the foot of a bed was extremely appealing! Although many watching this film might think it is very similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mary-Poppins-45th-Anniversary-Special-Edition/dp/B001JRB16U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mary Poppins (45th Anniversary Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;it was in development before ""Poppins"" was ever released. An intially lackluster treatment caused Walt to put it on the shelf and proceed with ""Poppins"" instead. After Walt's passing, the Disney team dusted it off and put together the film that you see now. A very charming story set during World War II, it still stands up today. Eglantine Price (Angela Lansbury) is a single woman studying to be a witch. She receives her lessons through mail from a conman, Professor Emelius Browne (David Tomlinson). At the same time, she becomes saddled with 3 young war orphans who throw a wrench in her ordered life. Through a lucky accident, Browne inadvertently sends Price a magical text which is missing the second half. Seeking Browne out, she and the children go on a magical adventure to discover the complete magical spells located in the 2nd book which can help England during the war.

There have been a number of DVD releases for the Disney Classic ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks""; this particular one seems to be aimed at the young teen market. The movie itself is the same restored version from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bedknobs-and-Broomsticks-30th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B00004R9A4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bedknobs and Broomsticks (30th Anniversary Edition)</a>. There are a few differences between the sets: this Enchanted Musical Edition contains a featurette hosted by Jennifer Stone from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wizards-of-Waverly-Place-Wizard-School/dp/B0018CWEU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wizards of Waverly Place: Wizard School</a>&nbsp;(8:07) which describes how animation and live action were combined when ""Bedknobs"" was made and how it is done digitally with a green screen effect today. Stone is very enthusiastic and the tone of this background featurette is clearly aimed at a more youthful demographic. Both DVD sets have the featurette, ""Music Magic - The Sherman Brothers"" which details the music in the movie. It is a little sad to hear the brothers discuss how after Walt died, many at the studio didn't know what to do and found it hard to believe things could continue on. From this feeling came the song ""The Age of Not Believing."" Unfortunately for this new edition, the featurette has been trimmed; on the 30th edition, it delves a little deeper into the restoration of the missing footage that was cut after the initial release of the film. Whether this would be interesting or not to today's youth is debatable. The version also has a Dylan & Cole Sprouse promo ""Blu-Ray is Suite"" (4:44) which shows many of the benefits to owning a blu-ray vs. regular DVD. Again, definite appeal to the youth who follow the Disney Channel's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Suite-Life-of-Zack-and-Cody-Lip-Synchin-in-the-Rain/dp/B0015XWUB8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Suite Life of Zack and Cody: Lip Synchin' in the Rain</a>&nbsp;Missing from the 30th release are a few Donald Duck & Mickey Mouse cartoons.

Additional bonus features on this set:

-""A Step in the Right Direction"" Reconstruction (3:48): By using stills (since the footage is still lost), Disney attempts to recreate the missing Angela Lansbury musical number. Charming number, but not a huge loss as far as the impact of the film is concerned.

-""David Tomlinson ""Portobello Road"" recording session (1:10): See actor Tomlinson recording the vocal tracks for this musical number.

-Theatrical Trailers: 4 trailers of varying length, from 1:33 to 3:42

Overall, a solid release. If you are more into ""old"" Disney you might enjoy the previous edition better with the vintage cartoons and expanded behind-the-scenes Sherman featurette. Kids of today will probably prefer this edition which has a little more zest thanks to the Disney Channel stars of today. You can't go wrong with either edition though as the movie itself is the same, looking and sounding spectacular with the majority of the deleted footage reinstated (making it approximately 139 minutes).

Specs: Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound / Widescreen (1.66:1 - Enhanced for 16x9 TVs) / French Language Track / French & Spanish subtitles",1252108800,6,4717,5.897510980966325
330104,3,6301390725,"""Bed Knobs and Broomsticks"" is a Disney filler that was between their heyday and the modern day socially acceptable cartoons. It looks like they peppered this film with their bevy of out of work actors and some flat cartoons also tossing in some obscure dancers.

The basic story is an overlap of the few simple stories. The main thread is of an apprentice witch (Angela Lansbury) wanting to learn a locomotion spell that should turn the war (World War II England) into a rout. Overlapping this is that she must take in displaced kids from the war-torn city. On top of this she becomes enamored of a street peddler (David Tomlinson) pretending to be a wizard's institution. They confront a nefarious bookseller (Sam Jaffee). Sam does a great job at being quasi-evil; you may remember him from ""Ben-Hur"" and ""Shangri-La"".

After all the which seems to be hours of obscure dancing and songs that kids would never get in 1 million years and grownups would find boring. The film finally gets about 10 minutes worth of action in the end. The action is slapstick but fun.

Although this movie seems to borrow from all the aforementioned, it was actually made in 1971 and has since become a Disney classic acceptable for all ages. It is Directed by Robert Stevenson and stars Angela Lansbury, David Tomlinson, and Roddy McDowall who plays a catholic priest.  The interaction between Lansbury and Roddy is fascinating in that subtly explores the complex relationship between religious and humanistic philosophies.

This wonderful musical will keep your children engaged especially the creative special effects and scenes featuring the animals from the Island of Naboo.  I really enjoyed how the ghost army, no doubt borrowed from Tolkien's lord of the rings, overcomes the Nazis without shedding one single drop of blood.

The movie begins innocently enough with  a woman played by Lansbury who is secretly studying for her correspondence degree in magic.  However, her plans are complicated when by royal edict she is forced to house three children who have been left homeless by the war. When her final magic lesson is suddenly canceled, Lansbury-with children in tow- sets out on a journey with the aid of a magical bed to solve the riddle plaguing her life and keeping her from accomplishing her self-assigned top secret mission.

The movie is responsible for bring notoriety to the phrase TREGUNA MEKOIDES TRECORUM SATIS DEE making it since one of the most famous spells in the world.  Parents can rest assured that Disney was careful not to include real magical spells in the movie especially those kinds that raise the dead.  The gibberish spells used in the film are harmless and Parents need not worry about the children using them to transform people into bunny rabbits or conjure grandpa up from the local cemetery. However, to take the mystery out this whole ordeal, I have prepared a translation.

The first word TREGUNA is actually two words,  TRE and GUNA.  TRE is a prefix, which can combine with the letter S to create the number 3. The suffix GUNA translates (you) GO! The ""you"" is implied. The prefix ""ME"" in MEKOIDES--translated as an accusative as opposed to an ablative--can be understood in a context such as ""the old black magic has ME in its spell."" As an ablative ""ME"" would translate - ""me / you'll do fine with ME, baby."" The suffix KOIDES can translate ""you will see"" or ""you will be seeing."" The third word TRECORUM returns us back to the prefix ""TRE"" which as we spoke can combine with ""S"" to mean three, which for the purposes of our translation here would make sense since the numbers three and thirteen have a long magical history.  We come now to the suffix in the word CORUM ,which when spelled correctly gives us
""QUORUM"" :In the neutral-plural-genitive, the word QUORUM neatly translates into the phrase ""the army, half OF WHICH there were not a few""  meaning a significant force.  SATIS translates ""enough,"" "" sufficient / sufficiently."" DEE is somewhat problematic. In Latin DE is a preposition meaning ""down from,"" ""from,""  ""concerning,"" ""about.""  As a preposition, it connects a noun to another element in a sentence. However, DE may also be understood as an ablative-the Latin case of adverbial relation, which implies the notion ""away from,""  the source or place of an action.

Now if we combine these meanings creatively we have a gibberish spell that makes sense for the movie.  TREGUNA: ""Three armies arise! You go!"" MEKOIDES: ""And be at rest for you will do fine with ME for that old black magic has ME it is spell. And once again you will see! Yes you will be seeing with mortal eyes once more."" TRECORUM: ""Oh Three great armies,  half of which where no so few"" SATIS: "" yet sufficient enough, I summon you"". DE: ""concerning war.""

The phrase is innocent enough and without the magic of adventure, our lives would be boring dull propositions and our imaginations null of the creative forces that gave us the legends we still embrace to this day. However, a warning to cat-lovers.  This movie adds a huge exclamation point to the stereotypical black cat.  I have never in my life seen a mangier domesticated cat than I did in this film.  I asked my cat Fanny, what she thought, she said, ""Cats are clean animals ...even magical black cats.""",1206144000,,4427,4.838196286472148

A very few of the extended scenes were useful or interesting, but for the most part redundant and disappointing. They slowed the pacing and diluted the storyline and character development. The editing itself seemed poorly done as well, changing the order of some scenes. All very unneccesary.

Most distressing of all, the sound on most of the added scenes was very poor, lips out of sync, and some of the dialogue appeared to have been dubbed in (badly) by some other, unknown actors! Perhaps this was a result of unusable original recordings, but it was extremely jarring and irksome. Even worse, some of the lines from the original release (often ones that flowed into a ""new"" scene) were also altered. This is COMPLETELY unacceptable. (Nearly as bad as another old classic, Darby O'Gill and the Little People; the DVD version of that one that I saw appeared to have had ALL of the leprechaun king's lines dubbed over, poorly!)

I wouldn't object to having this version as long as the REAL original was also included on the disc! Why can't they let the classics BE?!? I would MUCH rather have a worn old VHS (though I must admit that *visually* this edition was nicely restored) than be constantly distracted by terrible sound quality and bad editing.",1189468800,94,1449,4.674509803921569

For me the movie was slow, more like a stage performance than a movie.  The character development didn't seem to click well with all of the kids and the songs didn't bring you into the movie as well as some of the other Disney movies.

330281,4,6301390725,"This movie is one of those family charmers that has something for everyone.  There is an exciting animated portion for the children.  There is a love story for the ladies.  And there is a battle with World War II Germans for guys of all ages.  Tying all these different aspects together is a wonderful concept; Angela Lansbury is a mail-order witch!

During World War II, parents sent their children from London to the country because London was being bombed continuously.  Three children, Carrie, Paul and Charlie Rawlins (performed by Cindy O'Callaghan, Roy Snart and Ian Weighill, respectively), are placed with Eglantine Price (Lansbury).  We quickly learn that Miss Price is completely uninterested in caring for any children as they may upset her mysterious plans.  The children, and we, soon learn that Miss Price is a witch in training, training received by mail!

Because Miss Price is actually a very nice, if somewhat eccentric, lady, she works a compromise with the children, allowing them to live with her in her large home.  We also quickly learn that the mail order school is closing, and Miss Price was looking for an important lesson.  The children and Miss Price are off to find the headmaster of the school, Mr. Emelius Browne (played by David Tomlinson, who also performed in ""Tom Jones,"" ""Mary Poppins,"" and ""The Love Bug"").  Their mode of travel is a bed that Miss Price has modified using a spell.

Mr. Browne is astounded that his spells actually worked.  However, Mr. Browne is also sorry but he is unable to provide the important spell that Miss Price is seeking; a spell that could save England from Hitler!  Soon the children, Miss Price and a disbelieving Mr. Browne are off to Portobello Road to find the book containing the spell, instead running into the Bookman (played by Sam Jaffe, who was Gunga Din in the 1939 movie ""Gunga Din,"" and was in other great movies such as ""Ben-Hur"" and ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"").  After escaping the Bookman, the children and adults head off to a mystical island and encounter a group of animated talking critters.  Returning from the island, the three children and two adults are prepared to rest from searching for the important spell when they discover a German submarine has landed soldiers that are planning to create mischief in the English countryside.  The ending of this movie is a charmer that will intrigue even the most jaded of movie fans, and provide laughs for everyone.

This movie is pure escapist fantasy that begins with a very real life event, much like other similar stories such as ""Alice in Wonderland.""  I think Angela Lansbury makes this movie believable.  She slips into her role very comfortably, making you believe that she is a somewhat bumbling witch who barely controls her own spells.  She is admittedly a novice at being a witch, but a very believable novice.  This movie centers on her and her acting ability.  Once you accept Miss Price is an apprentice witch, a traveling bed, which is accompanied by dated special effects), animated talking animals, and armor moving by itself are easy to accept.  Even easier to accept are the laughs that go along with the story.

This movie is from the era when Disney Studios had a fool-proof formula for delivering good family movies.  This family movie is one of the best, and will be a treasure in every family's movie library.",1143244800,5,3376,4.826086956521739

330285,4,6301390725,"""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" is a delightful kid's movie for children aged 4 and older. David Tomlinson (of Mary Poppins fame) and Angela Lansbury are well-cast as proprietor of a [bogus-or so he thinks] mail order college of witchcraft, and his surprisingly adept student, respectively. By modern standards, the movie is a bit over-long; my children are accustomed to 75-90 min films and ""B&B"" is over two hrs in length. Also, very young children will need to be provided with some historical perspective. Even so, you will not go wrong with this movie.",1142294400,2,552,5.010869565217392
330286,5,6301390725,"Disney's Bedknobs and Broomsticks is probably one of the greatest films to ever come out of the studio.  It is often compared  to Mary Poppins and criticized for their similiarities, but I however feel that Bedknobs and Broomsticks is an improvement over Mary Poppins, even when Mary Poppins had little to improve.  The main reason for Bedknobs and Broomsticks' criticism is due to having been made in the period after Walt Disney's death, in which all of their films were criticized, even when they were superior to many Walt Disney era films such as the weak 101 Dalmatians (1961), The Sword in the Stone (1963) or The Jungle Book (1967).  Bedknobs and Broomsticks is yet another Disney '70s jewel in the lights of The Rescuers (1977) or Pete's Dragon (1977).

World War II is haunting England and children are being evacuated from the city of London into the safer countryside.  All children have found a nice home with a stranger family, except for the last three, Carey, Charles and Paul Rawlings who are then sent with Miss Eglantine Price into her large home.  The children aren't happy about being with Miss Price at first, they wish to go back to London, even though they have practically nowhere to go there.  This all changes when they discover Miss Price's secret, she is in fact a witch, an apprentice witch studying through correspondence and taught by Professor Emilius Browne, who is in fact nothing but a fake who takes his spells out of an old book.  However, Mr. Browne is a nice person and he is amazed to find that his senseless words work for Miss Price and they soon start working together.  With the aid of Mr. Browne's Traveling Spell, Miss Prince, Mr. Browne and the three children are able to travel around England by means of a bed and its magic bedknob to search for only one thing, the missing spell of Substitutiary Locomotion, a spell fit for bringing the help needed to end the terrible war.

As corny and out of place as the plot may seem, Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a rather deep and serious film.  Comparing it to Mary Poppins is silly, for Mary Poppins was a light-hearted comedy with no real plot, where Bedknobs and Broomsticks features a fantastic plot and clever dialogue.  Another similarity may include two new live-action/animation scenes, ""The Beautiful Briny"", an underwater animated musical festival and a wild soccer match with King Leonidas. The acting is fabulous, Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson play Miss Eglantine Price and Emilius Browne.  Special effects in this film are top-notch and help to fully capture some scenes, the flying bed parts are some of my favorites.  The music and songs are gorgeous!  The Sherman brothers once again made a memorable and excellent soundtrack, songs include ""The Old Home Guard"", the Academy Award Nominated ""The Age of Not Believing"", ""Portobello Road"", ""The Beautiful Briny"", ""Substitutiary Locomotion"" and the newly added ""With a Flair"" and ""Nobody's Problem's for Me"".  Indeed, a lot of new scenes and previously cut segments were re-added to the movie, and the entire film has been remastered for better picture and audio performance.

Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a wonderful film and I'll recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Mary Poppins or Pete's Dragon or to anyone who wants a new and magical way to travel back in history to the era of War World II.  This one is a classic!! 10/10.",1142208000,,3385,4.835355285961872
330287,5,6301390725,"For a Disney film 'Bedknobs And Broomsticks' differs in many ways from the typical Disney fair.

1:)The setting of this movie is (as another reviewer said) is somewhat dark. The film is set around a mail order 'apprentice witch' who believes she can single handedly end WW2 and outfox Nazi Germany. The sets include:dirty London streets,shady book sellers and includes imagry of locals painting sign posts.

2:)This movie doesn't have a particularly happy ending,a Disney trademark. Ms. Price's (Angela Lansbury) home is destroyed and she loses her powers. Even as the little refugee boy Paul still

has her enchanted bedknob.

3:)This is one of many Pre-Roger Rabbit attempts at blending live action and animation and (for it's day) did an excellent job at blending the two.

4:)This movie was clearly scripted for older children or adults.

More of a family picture then a childrens one. Some of the themes will probably appeal to adults.

5:)This movie is often referred to as a 70's version of 'Mary Poppins'.That's true to some extent but it doesn't have that films rosey sentiments and happy ending.

  I think 'Bedknobs And Broomsticks' will probably appeal to non Disney fans (especially young ones) because it isn't 100% typical of the company's output.",1134604800,4,1262,5.08252427184466
330298,4,6301390725,"In 1971, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, a film many call a Mary Poppins rip-off, premiered at Radio City Music Hall, but in a version in which nearly half an hour of footage, including full songs, was removed. For its 25th Anniversary in 1996, Disney re-inserted all of the deleted footage except for one musical number in which the picture was lost. The Academy Of Motion Picture Arts And Sciences screened this in 1996, but it didn't get a theatrical release, and for years, the only way Americans could get it was either by the 1997 laserdisc release, an import of a European video, or by catching it on occasion on the Disney Channel.

Finally, in 2001, for the film's 30th Anniversary, Disney released a DVD with this extended version of the film. Restored and remastered, the film now has a clearer plot, extended musical numbers, and songs previously deleted. The brilliant ""Portobello Road"" number is now restored to its original running time, as well as Miss Price's response verses, titled ""Don't Let Me Down"" during Mr. Browne's song ""Eglantine,"" and the previously entirely deleted songs ""With A Flair"" and ""Nobody's Problems"" are restored to the film.

The DVD is a mixed bag. The transfer is quite nice, but Lowry Digital, who did the recent Mary Poppins, Bambi, and Cinderella DVD restorations, could punch it up a little, as on occasion, I saw a bit of grain, and the occasional film artifact, especially during the closing credits and Walt Disney Pictures logo. However, this film has still never looked better on home video, so it's fine with me.

The extras could have been better. An actual making-of on the film would have been nice, including footage used in the Music Magic featurette. While that featurette does give some nice insight on the restoration, there's nothing behind-the-scenes about it except for the creation of the music score. Nothing about the effects, actors, nothing. But it's worth a look for info on the film's 1996 restoration. A larger gallery would have been nice. I do like the inclusion of the two cartoons. And of course, I'm happy to see that they have included theatrical trailers.

The best supplement, however, is the deleted song A Step In The Right Direction. That song was the catalyst that jump started this restoration project to begin with, so there's a bit of irony here in the fact that they couldn't find the footage of the song. So the supplement on the DVD, which is ported over from the 1997 laserdisc and was shown after the movie when the Disney Channel aired the restored version, is reconstructed using still photos of the scene and the original soundtrack. Hopefully one day, the footage will be found and they will be able to reinstate the number into the film, or at least they'll decide to include the photo reconstruction a la the restored version of A Star Is Born with Judy Garland.

Some have complained that there isn't an option to watch the original, shorter version due to its length and/or the poor dubbing of the voices in deleted scenes. (For much of the non-musical deleted footage, original dialogue soundtracks could not be found, so many of the deleted scenes had to be re-dubbed.) While I prefer the restored version despite the dubbing flaws, I think it would be wise of Disney to release both versions on DVD. Next year is the 35th Anniversary - maybe Disney will make a 2-disc DVD featuring both editions, with bonuses spread out on each disc, to appease all fans. Or better yet, a 3-Disc Collector's Edition, with discs 1 and 2 containing both cuts of the film and disc 3 with all the supplements. While neither edition is likely, the 2-Disc is a more likely option.

In conclusion, I can heartily recommend this DVD. The film has been lovingly restored and remastered, featuring almost all of the footage left on the cutting room floor in 1971, and features a nice handful of bonuses.",1129420800,176,3874,4.783258594917788

It is not nearly to the caliber of Mary Poppins, to which it is often compared.  The humor and setting are a lot darker, set as it is during World War II, and there is an under-current of anti-clericalism and of mass violence that is unsettling for a children's film.

Others may find the animated sequence to be a high note.  I thought it was long and tedious.

What was better than remembered was the Portobello Road dance sequence, which I thought was truly ahead of its time.  There is break-dancing, and even the beginnings of a moon walk dance move.  It wouldn't surprise me if this is where Michael Jackson picked up the idea for his Billy Jean dance moves.

I would definitely not recommend this for 4 year old girls.  I think it skews a little older and is probably more appealing for boys than girls.",1128297600,,936,4.333333333333333

330306,1,6301390725,"I was nine years old when this film premiered, and it fired my high-strung creativity.  I found it engaging, enchanting, and creative -- downright magical, and I saw it about four times.  Soon afterward, I got a copy of Mary Norton's novel, expecting it to be the same story as this Disney film.  It wasn't -- it was a significantly better and more interesting story, with a nice bittersweet ending.  ""Imagine that -- a book that's better than a movie!""  [OK, so I wasn't the most intelligent child in history.]  So I kept the book and forgot about the film.

When this film was re-released in this DVD format, I thought I'd give it a viewing for old time's sake, fully bearing in mind that the plot is almost completely different than the Norton book.  Well, I was tremendously disappointed.  For all its colors and flying effects and animation and tricked-out uninhabited marching suits of armor and the sublime Angela Lansbury, this is a really mediocre film.  Yes, the claims of it being an unofficial ""sequel"" to ""Mary Poppins"" are easy to make and can almost be substantiated, but the creative team did a most lackluster job.  The flying is sloppy, the animation of the undersea/island sequence lacks the usual Disney cleverness, the songs by the usually top-notch Sherman Brothers sound like they were written while Richard & Robin were recovering from simultaneous root canals, and the child actors are unusually bland [even for British actors].

But the ""Portobello Road"" musical number struck me as being the worst production number in film history -- worse even than the 1973 musical version of ""Lost Horizon,"" a notorious turkey.  It seems like the ""Portobello Road"" sequence was devised simply to have a large song & dance number, like the chimney sweep number in ""Mary Poppins"" or, more likely, the ""Who Will Buy?"" production number in ""Oliver.""  But the Disney studio evidently wanted to save some money on this film, for this is one of the skimpiest numbers I've ever seen:  A forgettable tune, uninventive choreography, an appallingly small number of dancers, and a set that is so small and cheap that it looks like it was inserted from a bad dinner theatre production [and THIS actor has been trapped in his share of bad dinner theatre productions].

I adored Disney films when I was growing up, but many of them have proved a disappointment to view again [I wish I'd never viewed ""Swiss Family Robinson"" as an adult].  The Disney studio was always able to make films that both enchanted children AND were good enough storytelling for adults, but sometimes they weren't up to their own standards.  *sigh*

In spite of all my grousing, I  DO  recommend this film for children under 15 -- it may help fire their imaginations in this age of increasingly bland pop culture.  But their parents will likely end up merely enduring the thing [though it IS interesting to see Miss Lansbury display her singing and dancing skills on film -- would that SHE was in ""Mame"" a few years later instead of Lucille Ball].  But if your kids like this film, go out and get them a copy of the Mary Norton book -- it's a better story, more plausible, teaches better lessons about life, and has a much more satisfying ending [albeit a bittersweet one].",1119484800,12,3247,4.758928571428571
330319,5,6301390725,"I was 7 years old when this film came out in the theater, just the perfect age for it, and I remember dragging my poor parents to see it several times (my father was bored to tears, I remember that clearly).

I recently ran into this DVD at the public library, and today I watched it again for the first time in over 33 years.  Fortunately, it has lost little of its magic.  The songs are just as catchy as ever, and the ""Briny Ballroom"" scene is worth the price of admission alone.  The song ""Age of Not Believing"" is excellent, even better than the much-maligned ""Cheer Up Charlie"" in ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" (another of my childhood favorites).

Even as dated as the special effects are, the flying bed scenes still look magical (particularly the first one).  There aren't enough of them though... you got a flying bed, you should use it!  Anyway, I've got a warm feeling after seeing this movie again, and the songs just keep replaying themselves in my head.  The only problem I have with Disney's re-release is the extended (waaaaaaayyyyyy toooooo extended) ""Portabello Road"" scene.  This was just unnecessary, and would have put me to sleep as a kid.

It's been noted that this film is overshadowed by ""Mary Poppins.""  Well, any film would be.  Despite some weaknesses of this particular release, I can't recommend it enough -- particularly if you saw it as a kid.  Let your kids experience it too.",1110153600,8,1420,4.632

I think it surpasses most of the rubbish that is out there today (ie: SHREK) which is written to entertain on the lowest level instead of uplifting and broadening ones mind.  Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a classic! My children love it and so do I.,1097625600,3,351,4.287878787878788
330324,4,6301390725,"Made during the Disney wilderness years following Walt's death, Bedknobs is a re-tread of the hugely successful Mary Poppins. However, if you're going to re-tread a film, it might as well be a classic! Check off the ingredients: - initially cold matronly female lead who the children and audience quickly warms to, capable and charming child leads, a perky male side-kick, an animated/live action interlude that has nothing to do with the plot, a Sherman brothers score, an episodic structure, a general magical story-book quality to the film etc.
Angela Lansbury gives her most likable screen characterisation (apart from perhaps Jessica Fletcher!) and shows to those not familiar with her Broadway career that she can sing and dance. David Tomlinson brushes off the stuffy ghost of Poppins' George Banks and plays a buffoon with great relish. The children are all well cast and shine in slightly cliched and under-written roles. Special mention must go to Roddy McDowell for a lovely cameo as a scheming cleric and to British-favourite Bruce Forsyth as a flick-knife toting 'spiv'.
The animated sequence involving the 'Beautiful Briney' is wonderful and, once the characters reach dry land, the soccer game with the animals is as 'Looney Tunes' as Disney would probably dare be! The rest of the film is slightly slow in places but has some excellent set-pieces, in particular the Portabello Road musical interlude, the clothing being 'magic-ed' to life and the final 'Armour vs. Nazis' showdown. The special effects are very good for the age, especially the animated object scenes. The score, by the Shermans, isn't a patch on their Mary Poppins but includes some real gems including the afore-mentioned 'Beautiful Briney' and 'Portabello Road' as well as the catchy 'Substituciary Locomotion'.
This edition includes around fifteen minutes of previously cut scenes and lines of dialogue that have been re-inserted into the main body of the film. Unfortunatly, the audio from these clips has been lost, and so the lines had to be re-recorded with varying degrees of success. Lansbury and McDowell have supplied their own voices but Tomlinson's, the children's and Tessy O'Shea's have been 'impersonated' quite poorly, meaning that those with relatively keen ears can tell when a newly inserted scene is playing. The audio for the songs survived, meaning that 'Eglantine' and 'Portabello Road' have been extended, although some of the film quality in the latter also draws attention to the cut scenes. These quibbles do not, however, spoil the film and the re-inserted scenes at least clarify McDowell's character's intensions towards Miss Price. Prior to this edition, we were not aware that he was wanting to marry her for her 'nice, sturdy house' - which is why he is jumping up and down on her porch when she answers the door to him!
Overall, this is a film that plays well to all ages (I loved it as a child and now sit and watch it often with my son). It's unfortunate that it will forever live in Mary Poppins' substantial shadow (along with the weaker Pete's Dragon), but at least it lives as one of the better Disney films made in those wilderness years prior to The Little Mermaid'.

This newly restored version runs 2 hours, 19 mins.  Shorter prints can run 98 mins or 117 mins.
I enjoy Walt Disney films and shows on television and had grown to like the tv show The Wonderful World of Disney.  I had not been to Disneyland yet, but had seen pictures and images on television.  Bedknobs and Broomsticks was probably the first Walt Disney motion picture I saw at a drive-in.  I had never seen a magical film like this.  To be honest, I wasn't too taken by Lansbury then, but I was too young. (I like her now!).  I was probably thinking of a different actress on another bewitching show.  But I enjoyed the special effects and the flying brass bed.  The knights with invisible people inside stuck in my mind.  They had an exhibit at the drive-in snack bar where the knights suit of armor was displayed.  I was too young to figure it all out about the special effects, but what was nice is that the Walt Disney Company could make magical films and give me nice dreams.  I have learned to respect all that is Disney.  Now I am 41 and have an almost grown daughter.  I just saw the restored version of Bedknobs and Broomsticks.  I found the film to still be a delight.  Like Angela Lansbury!  Still like Walt Disney films.  Still like the fantasy of it all. And have been to Disneyland many times.  Wouldn't we all like to have a bedknob that could do that.  That poor scruffy black cat.
  Also in the cast is Roddy McDowall (Walt Disney's That Darn Cat!) and David Tomlinson (Mary Poppins).
  The 30th Anniversary edition is the restored version with nearly 23 minutes of footage found and added into the film.  This time the film is more fun, enjoyable and easier to understand.
  At the end of the film is a featurette with Angela Lansbury and the Sherman Brothers.

They both loved it, so much so that they chose to watch all or pieces of it over and over again rather than watching other movies we had on hand.  It manages beautifully to entertain both the older one, a Harry Potter fan who finds many cartoons too ""babyish,"" and the younger one, who is frequently scared of live-action movies and finds even Mary Poppins, for example, too dark.  (The bird lady disturbs him, and I can't convince him Mary's leaving at the end isn't a tragedy.  I wouldn't even attempt to show him Chitty Chitty Bang Bang!)

330332,4,6301390725,"I remembered this from several years ago, when I decided to purchase the DVD. I always loved it(especially Miss Price. To me she was a strong character, and it's probably due to the fact that she was portrayed by the exquisite Angela Lansbury...no one can top her.) It gave me chills when I was little!
 The songs are catchy, and everytime I watch it(which, is usually every other day), I walk around singing ""Substitutiary Locomotion"" ""Beautiful Briny Sea"" and ""Eglantine!"" The tunes spread to everyone in the house!
 It's hard to say what my favorite part of this DVD is, but I really do enjoy the ""Music Magic"" documentary with the Sherman brothers (as well as comments from the glorious Ms. Lansbury). It had been so long since the last time I watched it, I didn't really notice what was new and what was there before. Being a music lover of sorts, I also immensely enjoyed what footage they found of Angela Lansbury's song, ""A Step in the Right Direction!""
 The ONLY thing that took my rating down, was the dubbed voices. It would've been okay if it had been one of two lines, but, at one point...there was almost a whole scene with a totally fake, dubbed ""David Tomlinson"" voice, which sounds nothing like him--and he's not the only one that been dubbed. Oh, no...Charles, the 11-going-on-12-year old boy...at one point sounded like a four year old!
 However, it IS a splendid movie to watch, and it's easily enjoyable!",1055462400,2,1425,4.688

I didn't even realize new footage had been added until I started watching it, and I began seeing all these strange new scenes.
I tend to agree with other reviewers about the full-length edition kind of dragging the movie out. There should be an option to see it either in full, or as it was cut. That would have taken a minimal amount of effort, as they did for Independence Day.
The worst part I thought was the shoddy attempt to dub the audio in the newly restored scenes. Not only were the characters mouthing (syncing) something different than what you heard, but the new voices weren't even close to the originals! I don't expect perfection, but they could have found more accurate dubbing voices if they really tried. It was quite distracting, but those are my only complaints, which calls for the absence of one star in my rating. The rest of the movie is a treasure to watch. I like the 2 new songs that they originally left out.
Not everyone may like the movie as I do, as it wasn't that popular to begin with. If you are hesitant or unsure, I would recommend renting it first before you consider adding it to your collection.",1055116800,4,1295,4.4

The movie is about an apprentice witch and three children, who she is assinged to take care of duting the NAZI bombing of London. There are many good musical and dance numbers. The Portabello Road number is outstanding. There is an outstanding underwater animated sequence. Of course the soccer game is a complete riot. The scene at the end where Angela Landsbury animates the Armour in the musuem and leads them in an attack against the invading Germans is also very funny.

From the same people who brought us ""Marry Poppins"" comes ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"". Angela Lansbury is no Julie Andrews, but she brings a heart warming performance to the movie. You have to give her credit for being able to act so seriously when she is riding around London on a flying bed. The whole story of a flying bed and magic sounds insane, but Im glad Walt gave the approval to go ahead with the movie. It actually works, don't ask me how =)
  In this DVD, Disney has gone allout and included 2 great cartoon shorts with Donald Duck and Mickey. You also get some behind the scenes footage and info on the movie and if that wasn't enough Disney has thrown all sorts of cut footage back into the movie. While I admit that some of the extra footage makes the movie drag, it also makes you love the movie more because you can appreciate what they were trying to do. So, if you can look past one of the worst acted german armies ever, your gonna find one heck of a treasure. Every Disney DVD should be this high quality! Dont let your kids grow up without seeing this...
FILM HIGHLIGHTS
My favorite part of the movie has to be on the island of Naboombu. The soccer game between the good and bad animals on the Island is so creative, funny and entertaining! I love it!
Filmed in the 1970's, you have to love the trippy ""Willy Wonka"" type speacial effects as the bed is flying through London. Its really a nice piece of nostalgia.

They did a decent job of translating this movie to DVD.  However, the reason I'm giving it two stars is because of the movie's horrible voice-overs.  Apparently some of the audio has been lost over the years; consequently Disney needed to add in voice acting in places where the dialogue is missing.  (it starts appearing about midway through)  So what's wrong with voice-overs?  Nothing if they are done right.  However, Disney spent a whole five minutes on these.  They are absolutely *horrid*!  They do not sync up with the actors lips and in 90% of the shots they don't even sound like the original voice.  The least they could have done was try to make the voices sync with the lip movements.  So do I recommend this DVD?  Personally, I would say no.  Disney needs to stay away from redoing old movies.  However, if you can stand horrible voice-overs through the second half of the movie then by all means buy it!  It's still a great movie despite what they've done to it!

330347,4,6301390725,"Bedknobs and Broomsticks is the charming tale of Eglintine Price(Angela Lansbury), an apprentice witch who is determined to use her cosmic powers to bring World War II to a successful conclusion.  In her efforts she is aided by three London refugee children and a con artist, Professor Emilius Brown (David Tomlinson).  The original film was envisioned as a grand musical along the same lines as Mary Poppins.  But the New York Christmas premiere at Radio City proved to be a problem, since the theater's Christmas Show preceeding the film meant that the length of the film itself had to be chopped to conform to time restrictions.  This conflict of interest lead to three songs and some extemporanious footage being left on the cutting room floor.  I am pleased to say that, three decades later, nearly everything that was taken out has been put back in, with a new digital transfer that positively sparkles and stereophonic sound that will make your heart sing.  Only Angela Lansbury's ""Step in the Right Direction"" musical solo seems to have been lost for all time.  But the newly restored ""Portibello Road"" dance sequence and Lansbury's ""Nobody's Problem For Me"" are revelations, rounding out story and content in ways that only now can we truly appreciate for their genius and scope.  Disney's efforts have dug up a fair bit of background information, wonderfully included as supplimentary material, fascinating and delightful.

330349,3,6301390725,"Seven years following the highly successful 1964 film ""Mary Poppins"", Walt Disney Pictures attempted to capitalize again on its highly successful formula by releasing the 1971 film entitled ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"".  Starring Angela Lansury in the title role of Eglantine Price (very similar to Julie Andrews' role as Mary Poppins), the plot of the film places the care of three young children (instead of two as in ""Mary Poppins"") in her very capable, but inexperienced hands during Germany's bombings of London of World War II.  Like Mary Poppins, Eglantine is very magical, being an apprentice witch who is learning witchcraft secretly via a correspondence course as part of her desire to assist England's war effort.  Unlike Mary Poppins (who focuses her efforts on taking care of children in dysfunctional families), Eglantine has no previous experience taking care of children, nor was it one of her goals in life.  However, the continuous bombings of London during World War II forced the British authorities to evacuate the children to, essentially, foster homes well outside of London where they would be much safer.
The three children thrust upon Eglantine to take of are from the same family: Charlie Rawlins (Ian Weighill), Paul Rawlins (Roy Snart) and Carrie Rawlins (Cindy O'Callaghan). Charlie, the oldest, has the attitude ""I don't want to do anything"", and becomes quite annoying sometimes.  Paul and Carrie are much friendlier.  Upon moving in with Eglantine, the trio quickly discovers that she is a witch, but that her spells normally don't last very long.  Unfortunately, the correspondence school goes out of business just before Eglantine is to receive the most important spell.  Determined to get the spell, Eglantine decides that she must find the school's headmaster, Emelius Browne (David Tomlinson, who played George Banks in ""Mary Poppins"").  Having no standard transportation capable of going to London, Eglantine casts a ""travelling spell"" upon a bedknob in Paul's possession, turning his bed into an equivalent ""flying carpet"".  Using the magical bed, the four are transported to Emelius Browne in London. Sadly, Emelius doesn't have the final spell, so the five go to great lengths to find it, including traveling to an animated world which is reminiscent to the walk through the chalk painting in ""Mary Poppins"".
The first quarter of ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" is quite good, as is the final quarter of the film.  Unfortunately, the middle half of the film drags considerably as the five search for the crucial spell.  Small children will likely be captivated by the myriad songs, dance and animation through the middle half, but there is little substance to maintain the interest of adults and its scenes contribute little towards the plot.  The special effects used in the final quarter of the film won ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" the Oscar for Best Visual Effects.  The film also received Oscar nominations for Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, Best Original Musical Score and Best Song.  Angela Lansbury received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Musical/Comedy.
The songs include:
* ""The Old Home Guard"" (4/5, male studio chorus).
* ""A Step In The Right Direction"" (5/5, Angela Lansbury). Sung by Eglantine to the children.
* ""The Age of Not Believing"" (5/5, Angela Lansbury). The song that received an Oscar nomination for Best Song.
* ""With a Flair"" (4.5/5, David Tomlinson). A funny song for a street vendor.
* ""Eglantine"" (4/5, David Tomlinson & Angela Lansbury). A love song by Emelius towards Eglantine.
* ""Portobello Road"" (2.5/5, primarily David Tomlinson). A visit to Portobello Road in search of an ancient book turns into a lengthy, repetitive and exhausting song contributing nothing to the plot.
* ""Portobello Street Dance"" (2/5, street dance). A superfluous continuation of the previous song for dancers of various nationalities under British rule.  (Imagine an Energizer Bunny commercial lasting for 10 minutes nonstop.)
* ""The Beautiful Briny"" (3/5, David Tomlinson & Angela Lansbury). A forgettable song sung in an animated underwater environment.
* ""Substitutiary Locomotion"" (5/5, Angela Lansbury, David Tomlinson, Ian Weighill, Cindy O'Callaghan, and Roy Snart). Eglantine's crucial spell used by her to lead a magical army of empty armored knights into battle against a ficticious Nazi invasion on the British coastline.
* ""Nobody's Problems"" (3.5/5, Angela Lansbury).  Restored to the film in 1996.
* ""Finale (Reprise of 'The Old Home Guard')"" (4/5, male studio chorus).
Comparing the cut film with the restored 139-minute film, I believe the previously cut material should have been made optional on the DVD for viewing as none of the restored scenes actually contribute to the plot. Further, some of the restored scenes are in very poor quality as compared to the rest of the film.
""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" is still an entertaining film for both children and adults alike, but the unnecessary plot deviations dominating much of the film force me to rate this restored version with only 3 stars out of 5.  Rather than attempting to repeat the success of ""Mary Poppins"" by using a similar formula, the writers of ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" could have done more by exploring Eglantine's magical abilities and the lives of the children prior to moving in with Eglantine.  If you have small children, I would highly recommend purchasing a copy of the film; but if you don't have any small children, you may be happier renting a copy.",1045094400,2,5515,5.204288939051919
330350,5,6301390725,"'Bedknobs and Broomsticks' is a 1971 Disney classic that showcases the brilliant talent of Walt Disney's legendary animators, even four of Walt Disney's Nine Old Men, some of his most trusted associates. It is a live-action/animation feature, and is not some happy-go-lucky Disney glitzy pop like today's Disney animation.
This film is directed by Robert Stevenson and produced by Bill Walsh, the same creative team that brought Mary Poppins to the screen in 1964. Many things are the same about the picture; such as the children in the picture. The con-man was played brilliantly by David Tomlinson, who also was the father in Mary Poppins. Yet, one thing was different, it was clearly missing the creative endeavor of Walt Disney.
Based on the novels by Mary Norton, 'Bedknobs and Broomsticks' is about a spinster named Eglantine Price, who lives in 1940 war-torn England, and is secretly a mail-order amateur witch. She is forced to take in three children because of the London bombings, and these kids are named Carrie, Charles and Paul. After a rocky start, the children find out Eglantine's secret about being a witch, and they become friends. Yet, Eglantine has to find a way to keep their mouths shut, since she does not want anyone to know she's a witch. So, the four of them seal a pact. Miss Price enchants a magic bedknob to keep the pact. In return the children will keep her secret.
The bedknob, when put on the bed upstairs where it was taken from, will take them anywhere they want to be taken. Yet, their plans are changed when Eglantine learns that her teacher, Emelius Brown, has closed down the witch college, without mailing her the most important spell ever, Substitutiary Locomotion, which makes ""inanimate objects take on a live force of their own"" and Eglantine believes she can defeat the Germans with the spell.
So Miss Price, Charlie, Carrie and Paul go to London, and there they meet Emelius Brown, who is obviously a terrible magician. Emelius claims that he lost the book in which the spell was, and they go to Portobello Road, a sort of farmer's market that sells fake second-hand items. Here Eglantine and company learn that Astoroth, a sorcerer, wore a necklace that had the magic words on it. They also learn that Astoroth kept animals in cages to make them more human-like. The animals rebelled and killed Astoroth, and stole the necklace. The necklace is on a neck of a lion on The Island of Naboombu.
The animation starts here, when Eglantine, Emelius, and the children attend an underwater ballet, and also play a soccer game with the villianous lion on the Island of Naboombu, in which they manage to steal the necklace.
Returning back home, the Locomotion spell flops, and Emelius leaves that night back to London to enter the war. That night, the Nazi Germans attack. After the Nazi's imprison Eglantine and the kids, Emelius returns secretly (by turning himself into a rabbit) and helps Eglantine and company get out.
Working together, they use the Locomotion spell to mobolize an army of armor and defeat the Nazi Germans. Eventually, Emelius stays with Eglantine, Carrie, Charlie and Paul, but joines up with the army anyway.
The bonus feautres are really great. The film is restored to its original length (after being cut numerous times before) and is remastered and restored fabulously. There is a Mickey and a Donald Duck short, and also a featurette on the making of the film, among other extras.
I highly reccomend that you get this excellent film, and it deserves much more than 5 stars! It's a great film, your whole family will love it!",1042156800,,3590,4.839024390243902
330351,5,6301390725,"Directed by Robert Stevenson, Bedknobs And Broomsticks was a concious effort on the part of Disney to acheive the same blockbuster success it had acheived with the timeless, Mary Poppins. Whilst not quite hitting the heights of success Mary Poppins had endured, Bedknobs and Broomsticks is still superb all round and holds many delightful adventures that is closely as spectacular as Mary Poppins. Angela Lansbury puts in a fantastic performance as amateur witch, Eglantine Price whilst Julie Andrews co-star in Mary Poppins, David Tomlinson turns up in a variation of his character in Poppins playing the stuffy Professor Emelius Browne who quickly befriends Eglantine and the three evacuee children she is looking after. The special effects are still vastly impressive and are enhanced even more greatly by a successful transistion to the DVD format. Whats easily the biggest highlight of the film is the spectacular mix of live-action and animation. The soccer-ball match, with its striking eye-catching mixture of real people with a host of animated animals is done to absolute perfection and the whole combination gels brilliantly together making for as equally enchanting viewing as Poppins, which this film has always been compared to. Some of the songs are a litle monotonous but the film holds so many merits that it becomes easy to overlook that minor flaw. The ending is another spectacular affair with the invasion of the Nazi's and the following battle features some impeccable, well-crafted effects. Like all good classic childrens films, Bedknobs and Broomsticks holds a happy ending and on the whole the film is superb throughout. Plenty of fun adventures and amusing moments and the live action-animated sequences is masterfully done. A classic tale, loosley based on the novels by Mary Norton. Beyond that is an interesting series of features that alone makes this DVD worth purchasing. One of Walt Disney's most enthralling classics!",1038009600,,1952,5.3
330352,5,6301390725,"BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSICKS was made in the early 70's and is one of those Disney films that speaks to the little kid in us all. Directed by veteran Disney director Robert Stevenson (Mary Pippins, The Love Bug, The Darn Cat ) and starring the incomparable Angela Landsbury (Murder She Wrote, Mame - on Broadway, The Last Unicorn 2004) as Miss Elglentine Price the apprentice witch of the Professor Emiliace Brown School Of Witchcraft - played none other by veteran Disney character performer/actor David Tomlinson (Tom Jones, The Love Bug, Made In Heaven). There is even a great performance in a small role as a priest by Roddy McDowell (Planet Of The Apes, Cleopatra, Fright Night)
The story is set in the early days of the German attack on the European border. Towns were broken down, families were separated and displaced and many people had to go to war and leave their children behind. One set of  these children were orphaned with Miss Price. Accidentally discovering her secret  they convince her to go on her quest to find the one last spell that will save England from attack.
There is magic, music and lot of special effects that make this movie colorful and enticing to watch. Back in the days when most special effects were real and done ""in cameras"" - meaning on the set - this film has a lot to be proud of.
The songs are fantastic and this FULLY RESTORED DVD is the best it has to offer. Included the full versions of songs like Portabello Road and reinserted songs like No One To Come Home To has made this version a treasure to own. Other fantastic numbers like Substitutiary Locomotion and Under The Briny Sea are fantastic and hitting home for kids is the Academy Award Nominated song Your At The Age Of Not Believing.
Originally rushed out and thought to be too long - this version contains the full - over two hours - theatrical release as it was originally intended. The DVD extras include a documentary  retrospective with co-host Angela Landsbury on the Sherman Brothers (Mary Poppins,  ) themselves and a look at some of the actual recording sessions with David Tomlinson. Also a reconstructed seen of a song that was recorded by Angela but all the actual film footage was lost so it could not make it into its restoration version. Lots of extra features too including two shorts. You'll love this DVD if you are a Disney fan ! Lot's of Fun!...",1035676800,51,2365,4.637231503579952
330353,5,6301390725,"BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS is one of Disney's most beloved live-action musical masterpieces.  It has received a full restoration for its 30th Anniversary edition, which marks the film's long-awaited DVD debut.
Eglantine Price (Angela Lansbury) unwittingly takes in three young orphans when the bombs of Hitler begin to fall on the city of London.  Being an apprentice witch, privacy is important to Ms Price, but soon their help becomes useful when she has to journey to London in search of one Professor Browne (David Tomlinson - MARY POPPINS).  Joining forces, they decide to track down a mysterious magical spell which they hope will bring an end to the war.
The Sherman brothers' sparkling tunes include the Oscar-nominated ""Age of Not Believing"", ""Portobello Road"", ""Beautiful Briny"" and ""Flourish and a Flair"".
In a situation which is not unlike the fates of THE HAPPIEST MILLIONAIRE and THE SLIPPER AND THE ROSE (both also written by the Sherman brothers), BEDKNOBS was trimmed from its 134-minute running time to the lesser length of 117 minutes; which meant the deletion of several songs and some important scenes, crucial to the plot.  They have been thankfully restored into this new release, which has a dynamic 5.1 sound mix and a crystal-clear picture.
The DVD also includes animated shorts, deleted song - ""A Step in the Right Direction"", picture/poster/still gallery and an interview with the Sherman brothers.",1029888000,5,1424,5.205240174672489
330354,3,6301390725,"""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" is a lot better than I remembered it being, though it is still far from perfect. I saw this as a child during its initial release in Radio City Music Hall. I didn't like it then because I thought it made fun of the Nazis (my dad was in World War II, so I always was taught the seriousness of the Nazi threat). Later, there used to be something called ""Disney Summer Film Festival"" where you had the opportunity to see many older Disney cartoons and movies (very important in a time before VCRs!), but the downside was everything I ever wanted to see was always accompanied by ""BandB"" as a double feature. We had to be certain to make sure we saw the preferred film first, so that if we wanted to  see it again, we only had to sit through ""BandB"" once. THAT's how much I and my brothers disliked this movie as children.
Only a few years back, I took it upon myself to rent ""BandB"" with my own money, to see if I still felt as strongly. Well, the passage of time does wonders, sometimes.
BEST PARTS: Hands down, its best special effects Oscar was well earned. Witch Angela Lansbury casts a spell to animate all the armor in an old weapons museum to combat the invading Nazi forces. Frankly, it is quite creepy to see the faceless helmets turn to regard their foes. The other part that especially pleases my now-adult tastes are the opening titles, which are done in the style of the Bayeux Tapestry. This is because the movie concerns itself with another threatened invasion of England, this time by the Nazis. At the end of the sequence, the image of a woman on a broomstick is worked in, to give a foretaste of Angela Lansbury's role.
WORST PARTS: ""Mary Poppins"" did an excellent job with two reluctant children. Now we have three--totally unnecessary. Also, these children are somewhat charmless. The movie is overly long at times. It had best not be compared to ""Mary Poppins"" because it will lose in every category, but most children's films would anyway.
Otherwise, ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" is not as awful as it struck me years ago. Should do the trick for you.",1022630400,2,2095,4.527704485488127

The film's basic story is about a witch taking a correspondence course in witch craft, but when the course is canceled, she searches for ""the professor"" in hopes of obtaining the remaining piece of a spell that she needs.
The best part of the movie is the Soccer game, where animated creatures are mixed in with live action. Many of the songs are great to, and also mix animation in with the live actors at times. Like the number that took place on the bottom of the sea, where the actors mingle with fish and other sea creatures.

330375,3,6301390725,"""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" is quite the piece of nostalgia for me, and this DVD is a pretty good package to explore that nostalgia with. Unfortunately, like all movies one loved as a child, this one just doesn't hold up as well.
And part of that problem may be that this is he complete version, oddly enough. I had never seen the full version of this film until now, and the result is a very long, almost taxing viewing experience -- not to mention some really poor tries at restoration here and there. Some dialogue has been re-dubbed by completely different actors and without a lot of care given to the lip-synching; scenes with the dubbing are maddening to watch.
That being said, the picture quality is mostly spectacular, and the documentary with the Sherman Bros. (who, surprisingly, are still alive and well) is informative and intriguing.
What remains is a very entertaining children's movie that, much to my dismay, would probably not be enjoyed by today's kids, especially at its new, 140-minute running time. Sure, it's great that the film is finally presented complete, but maybe they were right to make some cuts the first time around.
That being said, it's still a very charming film, mostly thanks to the songs (""Portobello Road"" being the highlight) and David Tomlinson's wonderful screen presence.",996192000,7,1315,4.927927927927928
