8071084,5,B0002E3HCM,"It works for two reasons - (1) The technique follows the laws of motion, both according to physics and physiology,
and (2) the limiting drills enable/force the subconscious mind to teach you. It's nearly too good to be true; I say nearly because
you must muster the courage and patience to do the drills until they work - and they will, ten to twenty times faster than the traditional
methods, when the traditional methods work at all. Absolutely amazing!
