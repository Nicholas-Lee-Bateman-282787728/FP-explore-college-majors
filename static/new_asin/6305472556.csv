I only want to give a piece of advice. Amazon is my favorite site. It is amazing how they track the customers in order to present new offers that each individual might like. But in this case, Amazon puts something that is confusing. In the ""Customers who bought this DVD also bought"" section they put Genesis-The Way We Walk Concert, some Pink Floyd's DVDs and other references of progressive rock. Amazon may mixed the info about what customers bought or the site gives such poor information about this DVD that make Genesis band fans buy something they do not want.",1071187200,6,713,4.368421052631579

It does sum up all the basic geography based on plate tectonics and I learned some very interesting human history as well (I never did understand what happened to the Minoan culture).
This movie certainly could have had better narration or better music, but it is still a great movie. It is entertaining, educational and has some simply wonderful shots of mountains, volcanos (above and below water), islands, etc.  If you have a curious child of any age in your home, get this video.  My daughter loves it and so do I!!",1056672000,7,644,4.5344827586206895
