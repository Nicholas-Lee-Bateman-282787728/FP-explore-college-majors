3966750,4,B002QC86FQ,"This movie is an awesome example of what happens to someone who falls deep into their mental illness. This movie certainly isn't for entertainment, it's educational, but yet eye-opening.",1397520000,,186,5.448275862068965
3966751,4,B002QC86FQ,"As a mental health student I really enjoyed this movie because it shows how Bi-Polar clients can become when Manic, Depressive, Stop taking their meds, etc. It was very interesting to see Sam blame Ben at the end for his illness. Wish there was some follow up as to what happened to both Sam and Ben, both were interesting to observe.",1394668800,,334,4.491803278688525
3966752,3,B002QC86FQ,Very candid and truthful documentary. Both pros and cons of trying to be a caregiver to someone who won't get any better it seems. But there is light at the end of the tunnel. A bipolar person can have a life if he is constantly monitored and gets help.,1393372800,,253,4.183673469387755
3966753,5,B002QC86FQ,"It was superlative, riveting, informative, and heartbreaking.  i recommend it to people who are interested in learning more about bi-polar.",1391990400,,139,5.95
3966754,4,B002QC86FQ,"A realistic story about the challenge of bipolar illness and it's ramifications on those in the affected circle of people. The relationship of subject with the documentarian is fascinating as it shifts and squirms.

Especially valuable is the 43min interview with Kay Redfield Jamison who, with the authority of both professor of psych and bipolar person herself, has some really important things to share - about what BD is, dangers, the emotional impact, surviving and staying well. An excellent educational piece, especially as it is presented in titled segments. Five stars for that!",1391212800,,587,5.311827956989247
3966755,4,B002QC86FQ,"Displayed the roller coaster relationship of loving someone afflicted with mental illness. Appropriately titled, for we sometimes have to share their ""prison"" to begin to understand what they must go through in life.",1390003200,,216,5.575757575757576
3966756,3,B002QC86FQ,"What mental illness does first hand from an unsuspecting victim.{the filmmaker} He had no plans on making this kind of a film. The change in Sam was overwhelming... Handsome, intelligent, funloving to uncaring, sad, lack of self . He gained alot of weight, lost his friends and had zip for control. Scary for all involved. It was sad to hear how low he became during the end on speaker phone. The threats to Ben and confused mind wow. then he would answer the phone ""whats up dude"" right after a menacing call to Ben. Its like dude you are whats up. I praise Ben for being there for him at times but the relationship should never had continued especially professionally. Ben tried to make lemonade with badly damaged lemons. His documentary that led them to meet got messed up, so this one came unfortunately. He is a great speaker, and great with the camera but the film was not as one would have expected{the description sounded amazing} Well i hope both parties are well. It was disapointing ending it like that, no update after film was edited.oh well! I called it interesting because of the raw unknown direction they were about to endure.",1382227200,2,1144,4.640394088669951
3966757,3,B002QC86FQ,"An interesting view into a life dominated by bipolar disorder was a bit scary for me, as it hits close to home. This was about a videographer who filmed 5 years of bipolar- the good parts, the bad parts, the sad parts. It was a decent film that left me wanting to know what happened after the camera turned off the last time.",1376352000,,325,4.174603174603175
3966758,3,B002QC86FQ,"I have read several books on Bipolar, and wondered what it would be like to see it in action in a movie.  This movie gave me a better idiea of Bipolar and the hell one goes through, hover, I would like to see a Bipolar movie in a story form.",1375747200,,241,3.82
3966759,4,B002QC86FQ,"I liked his description of living in a room with bipolar and the fact that the bipolar monster can grow bigger until you are a little tiny defeated person curled up in the corner or you can accept the fact that you have to share the space in this room with the bipolar monster and then get up and stand up to it and do the best you can.

I thought this was a good film worth watching.  There was real honesty and sincere interest in its approach.  One of the biggest disappointments one with Bipolar has to bear is to have so few people in their life be willing to take the time and make the effort to educate themselves about it so they can be more understanding and of greater help to the sufferer. I wish there were more who would.  Being bipolar is often a lonely world to live in.

Thank you for making this film.  People with this disorder deserve a voice.  We have already been robbed of so much in life, including our true potential. This mental illness is not who we are.  It is not a reflection of our character. And we deserve extra credit for clinging to this life even when it causes us unrelenting pain. Those who choose to let go should not be castigated for being cowardly.  The pain simply becomes too much.",1375228800,7,1224,4.241379310344827
8377646,1,B002QC86FQ,Unsealed package with disc that had correct graphic but different movie,1518134400,,71,5.545454545454546
8377647,5,B002QC86FQ,Awesome movie & true story! I could relate because I'm bipolar too,1462838400,,66,4.583333333333333
8377648,5,B002QC86FQ,"Where to begin - I am in a state of depression right now - typing from my pillow and it is difficult to write as fluid as my normal or as this film exhibits, my manic state. I am 44 and this film has helped me again - I watched it a few years ago (probably in same state of mind as I am in now). The film has helped and I can not even imagine how difficult the film must have been for Sam and Ben to create. In mania, the non stop talk of the film for Sam, the excitement and POSSIBILITIES would be like a drug, but in the lows (even allowing the film or even his clips of himself in the car or at home), the film is EXTRAORDINARY. That is a glimpse into this illness which is rarely witnessed by outsiders, only the by the ones that love us. It can be only viewed by those that stick around and believe me, that is very difficult indeed, even for those that must love us (moms, siblings, friends before onset, etc.) And the abuse they endure riding the highs and lows is only seen through the lens of TIME. We hide very well in the short term, the monster only emerges with the charts, through time, if it can be chronicled. It was chronicled here in this film. You see, the abuse which is spit forth in rage are lies, the anger is at the enemy in our heads, the frustration at knowing something is wrong by the looks on the faces we love. Buy this film - it is a rare and treasured find indeed.",1432771200,,1396,3.9892857142857143
8377649,5,B002QC86FQ,"As a sibling and daughter of someone who suffers from manic depression, this was eye opening. Ben does not seem to filter and edit out the bullshit that comes with this disease. The love and compassion he shows for his friend thought the filming of the movie are inspiring to know it wasn't just for a movie. It was to give hope to those who suffer from this disease. To comfort those family members and give them hope as well. I would like to see an update on Sam - somewhere. He truly is an amazing man.",1427500800,,505,4.216494845360825
8377650,5,B002QC86FQ,"If you, or someone you know has Bipolar, this is a great viewpoint from both sides. It's a horrible illness that I wish upon nobody.",1418688000,,132,4.32
8377651,5,B002QC86FQ,A deeply powerful film about Bipolar Affective Disorder. This is one of those rare films that will forever impact the way you look at those afflicted by this serious mental health condition. Highly recommended as an educational tool.,1413849600,,233,5.157894736842105
8377652,5,B002QC86FQ,"Absolutely heart wrenching, eye opening and inspiring. I have a friend whose daughter is in the midst of this struggle..",1403222400,,120,5.05
8377653,5,B002QC86FQ,"This film is so important. It was well done, in that it captured what really happens. Thank you for the compassion of the filmmaker to stick with something that needs to be talked about. There are so many vets coming home and dealing with PTSD, that may have had this underlying disease, until the tragedy that causes the monster to come out of its hiding place. We force people that have this disease to choose, either depressive and safe, or manic and unpredictable. It made me wonder how many kids that are going on these rampages with guns are actually BP/MD/S? It was also encouraging to see a doctor with the disease.",1401062400,,623,4.571428571428571
8377654,5,B002QC86FQ,"I just finished viewing this and am glad I stumbled across It. It was an informative, engaging, and moving story.",1400630400,,113,4.7
8377655,4,B002QC86FQ,"After watching this I really hope Sam is okay out there wherever he is. I feel that this film really did a fantastic job at allowing me to have a bigger glimpse on what it must be like to live with bipolar. Thanks for putting it all out there, the good, the bad, and the ugly. One technical/visual nitpick: What's up with the video interlacing? It was really distracting.",1397520000,,371,4.391304347826087
