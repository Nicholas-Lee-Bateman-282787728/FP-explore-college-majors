8359128,1,B000N3SU7O,"$25 for a transferred copy of a dreadful looking VHS Copy?  Really?  It's not transferred from a pristine VHS copy, mind you.  If this movie was so rare and no copies were available how about finding a VHS copy that doesn't roll at the beginning? 5 seconds into the picture I knew this was duped from a VHS!

I won't even get into the full screen aspect ratio which also looks terrible and would have prevented me from watching a cleaner looking copy.

But the price? $5.99 in a bargain bin?  At least I could get my hopes up before popping it into my machine.  But $25????  I have bootleg VHS tv shows that look better than this!  Amazon should immediately pull this from sale, or at least put a disclaimer about it's quality.

Fortunately for me I was able to rent this from the nationally known mail rental company (not sure if I'm allowed to say their name) and so I just wasted a rental slot, not a cool $25 bucks!

But this is not even worth renting.  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY.",1298160000,3,994,4.28494623655914

8359131,1,B000N3SU7O,"Anything with Ornella Muti is worth seeing provided you can see it. This DVD is derived from a VHS tape evidenced by creases and dropouts but mainly by a blurred image throughout. Also the top, bottom and sides of the screen have been trimmed off so that the opening credits barely fit on the screen and people are often missing the tops of their heads. They should have gone back to the film original. For enthusiasts only.",1188691200,,424,4.51948051948052
