4514091,4,B0050FXDDQ,"By all accounts this appears to be a wonderful reissue and collector's edition.  However, one ""little"" problem remains.  And it will remain forever.  A clue to this problem is found in a comment from the product description:

""Presented here in a magnificent 70th anniversary digital transfer with revitalized digital audio from the highest quality surviving elements ...""

What that means is the original negative of ""Citizen Kane"" was destroyed years ago.  Lost forever by an RKO executive's mistake to slate the negative for silver reclamation, the ""highest quality surviving elements"" are basically cannibalized intermediate negatives of fair to poor quality.  I know, because I was given the job of assembling the best possible negative to strike new prints from for the 50th anniversary theatrical release.  In the 20 years since, there is a remote possibility that better elements have been found.  However, I seriously doubt any cleaner elements were discovered since RKO provided me with every positive master and intermediate negative they could find in their library.

I did the best job I could given the circumstances and I was able to deliver a decent negative to strike new prints from.  Still, one segment of the negative proved impossible to fix.  Near the end of one reel, permanent emulsion scratches appear for several seconds.  They are thick and white and impossible to miss.  At the time, there was no replacement footage available.

I am eagerly awaiting the release of this new edition to check and see if others were able to fix what I could not and to see if some how, some way, better ""quality"" elements were found in the interim.  When I have a chance to screen this edition I will report back on what I see.

However, know this:  No new print or DVD will ever be struck from the original negative.",1306800000,124,1827,4.934426229508197

Orson Wells was one of the most amazing people of the 20th century. He was outrageous and over the top, but when he was able to focus his prodigious talent, the result was astounding. Too bad that Hollywood was not ready for him and that he chose to attack someone who had the power and spite to destroy him. Kane's brief speech as a political candidate sounds like something said by politicians today! The consolidation of media by wealthy individuals and their use of it for personal gain and skewed politics has happened again in the USA. Citizen Kane should be a warning against these abuses but we just don't pay attention. Wells had flaws that were equal to his talents, but his artistic legacy endures.",1450137600,,865,4.623376623376624

4514108,5,B0050FXDDQ,"If the stories are to be believed, Orson Welles created CITIZEN KANE as an act of vengeance for a sleight he received from W.R. Hearst during a dinner party at the tycoon's enormous California estate. Welles supposedly included ""Rosebud"" in his semi-bio of Hearst to embarrass the man. This mysterious word was the publisher's nickname for an intimate body part belonging to his mistress, Marion Davies. (BTW... watch closely in the film's early snow scene for a revealing ""Rosebud"" hint, when young Kane hits a visitor with his beloved sled and we see the famous flower insignia on it.)

Is this picture, as so many claim, THE GREATEST ever made? Since all art is subjective, can there ever be a single BEST motion picture, painting, statue or song? Whether or not ""Kane"" is numero uno, two things are certain:
1.) CITIZEN KANE is *classic* film making in every sense imaginable.
2.) Its high regard and place in cinematic history are assured, perhaps for all time.

4514126,4,B0050FXDDQ,"The problem with Citizen Kane is the much ballyhooed hype surrounding it.  Like Salinger's Catcher In The Rye, which has become more of a legendary pulse for craziness and conspiracy and a fountain for people who want to feel ""literary"" for having read it, instead of what it really is, which is really just a  middle-of-the-road teenage-angst book, Kane is just a movie.  Heralded as one of, if not THE, greatest movies ever made, Citizen Kane is one of those movies (like Casablanca, The Grape Of Wrath, Gone With The Wind, etc...) that has transcended its original purpose.  It is a movie. It was made to entertain.  It was surely a malevolent lob at William Randolph Hearst to be sure.  It was surely a diatribe to the perils of power and money and conquest.  But in the end.  When all is said and done.  Like Salinger's diabolical outing. It is what it is.  Having said all that, I, like everyone, should view Citizen Kane not for what it's supposed to be, what it had been deemed by others to be, but for what it is.  A great movie by Orsen Welles.  A product of its time.  A classic.  But like Casablanca (or even The Maltese Falcon) it's a good story and a fun watch.  Fedoras and cigarettes and scotch. Great acting.  Hidden themes (perhaps?).  A time when Hollywood relied on plot and actors and not so much CGI and vulgarity to survive.  A simpler time that made movie-making an art form.

Charles Foster Kane (Welles) is a hugely rich newspaper publisher living alone in Xanadu (his Florida estate-see Hearst Castle for reference) with a No Trespassing sign on the front gates.  On his deathbed he clutches a snowglobe and utters the single word ""Rosebud"" before dying. The snowglobe slips from his dead hand and smashes on the floor.  Kane's death quickly becomes international news. Newsreel reporter Jerry Thompson (William Alland) becomes intrigued and decides he must find out all he can about Kane and decipher the truth behind Kane's final word ""Rosebud"".  The reporter begins to interview Kane's friends and business associates, unraveling the great man's past, rising from poverty when property that his mother owns turns out to hold the world's third largest gold mine, sent East to be properly educated, taking his trust fund at 25 and jumping into yellow journalism, then successfully taking control of the New York Inquirer, heading into politics, marrying the daughter of The President.  The search for ""Rosebud"" continues throughout.

As we all know (at least those of us untold millions who have seen the film) is that ""Rosebud"" turns out to be the name inscribed on Kane's childhood sled, and represents (allegorically, of course) a time in the man's life when he was actually, truly, uncompromisingly happy.  Yes.  A man who had fame and riches and power,  a man who had everything money could conceivably buy, was merely a man who longed for his impoverished childhood days in Colorado where a sled was the height of his happiness.  Get the point?

Citizen Kane is definitely a great movie.  Is it deserving of the accolades and God-like status it has received since it was released in 1941?  That is entirely up to the watcher.  Some people might say that It's A Wonderful Life is the greatest movie ever made.  Some might think that The Wizard Of Oz should have that title.  Or Casablanca.  Or The Seven-Year Itch.  Or The Asphalt Jungle for that matter.  That is the point I'm trying my best (successfully?  you decide) to make is that every movie affects a person differently.  Don't be fooled by the hooflaw.  Citizen Kane is not my favorite movie.  Not by a long-shot.  But it is a great movie.  I like it for Orsen Welles and Joseph Cotton and Dorothy Comingore's performances.  I like it for the sheer audacity and the infuriation that William Randolph Hearst threw down in public.  Think of it.  Attacking (as Hearst saw it) one of the most powerful men in the world, certainly THE most powerful man in the U.S. newspaper industry at the time, on film for everyone to see.  Welles certainly had spunk.  In the end, what we got didn't exactly change the world as we know it (certainly there were some repercussions following Kane's release) but gave us all a well-crafted, entertaining film.  Take it at that.  Enjoy it for its fine moments.  Certainly worth the watch.  Oh.  Yeah.  ""Rosebud""...

Dig it!",1411689600,,4343,4.749329758713137

4514128,5,B0050FXDDQ,"For a full description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some thoughts on this 1941 classic...

Citizen Kane (1941) is a groundbreaking and innovative film starring Orson Welles, Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorehead, Dorothy Comingore, George Coulouris, and Ray Collins.  This movie was innovative in several ways, mainly the camerawork (unique camera angles) and lighting techniques.  For its time, these were innovations.  They have been copied since by many directors.  This movie has been a perennial favorite to show to film students in college.  The main idea is to show students how to use various camera angles and lightning to maximum effect.  How is the acting in this movie?  It's pretty good, but it is nowhere near the best I've ever seen.  The strongest aspects of this movie are the camera and lighting techniques.  The musical score by Bernard Herrmann is very good.  Not his best work ever (that would come in the 1950s and 1960s), but very solid.

Citizen Kane was ranked as the greatest movie of all time for 50 years (1962-2012), before it finally got knocked out of first place last year by Vertigo (1958).  If I had only two choices to consider for the greatest movie of all time between Citizen Kane and Vertigo, I would choose Vertigo, though I'm not sure if Vertigo is the greatest ever, but it's definitely better than Citizen Kane.  Citizen Kane is very wordy, heavy on dialogue.  Vertigo is more visual storytelling, which I prefer.

Overall, Citizen Kane has my respect and is worth a look for every movie fan, young and old and everybody in between.",1408233600,4,1584,4.850746268656716

4514131,5,B0050FXDDQ,"Citizen Kane (1941) is definitely deserving of the high praise it consistently receives year after year. A movie depicting a man's unhappiness (despite incredible wealth), it manages to deliver the prevailing message that it's the simple things that can bring happiness to a person. In Kane's case, a sled with ""Rosebud"" written on it, and the happiness that this sled brought him during his childhood means more than anything else Kane ever did in his life. The Xanadu estate of Kane is massive, and even a bit mysterious and haunting;  Orson Welles' vision of Kane's world leaves nothing in the bag. Welles uses unique camera angles to perfection, as well as lighting. Welles was an untried, untested Hollywood figure when he was given complete creative control over this film. Of course, the battle to stop this film from being released ensued, and almost resulted in no film. Citizen Kane is an acquired taste; you probably won't love it right away, as it's a bit more intellectual than other movies from that time period. However, after two or three viewings, this movie resonates on the many fronts that the critics have highlighted. The second disc is filled with extras, and provides a good look into the struggles on getting this film to the big screen. Overall, this is an excellent product that's perfect for entertaining those who love the film, and wouldn't mind seeing it again, as well as those who are curious about its legacy.",1404691200,2,1443,4.889795918367347

Re-releases in the 1950s and later exposure on television made CITIZEN KANE a cult favorite, and the American Film Institute has twice named it the best film of all time, in 1998 and 2007.

Several of Welles' Mercury Theater players went on to become major stars, including Joseph Cotten, Ray Collins (who played Lieutenant Arthur Tragg in TV's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Perry-Mason/dp/B000F48D0U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Perry Mason</a>), Agnes Moorehead (who baby boomers remember as Endora in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bewitched/dp/B0009B16TO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bewitched</a>), and Ruth Warrick, who starred in the ABC soap ALL MY CHILDREN for over four decades.

Disc 1 features the original film in excellent quality, with several bonus features, including newsreel footage of the 1941 premiere, interviews with Ruth Warrick and editor Robert Wise, who went on to direct such films as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/West-Side-Story-Full-Screen-Edition/dp/B0000AM6IY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">West Side Story (Full Screen Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sound-of-Music-Three-Disc-45th-Anniversary-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo-in-Blu-ray-Packaging/dp/B003VS0CX8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sound of Music (Three-Disc 45th Anniversary Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging)</a>, storyboards, still photos (with commentary by Roger Ebert), the original theatrical trailer, audio commentaries by Ebert and Peter Bogdanovich, subtitles in English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish, and audio in English, Portuguese, and Spanish.

Disc 2 is a fine PBS AMERICAN EXPERIENCE documentary from 1996, THE BATTLE FOR CITIZEN KANE, which examines the parallels between the lives of Welles and Hearst.

Disc 3 is an excellent 1999 HBO/WGBH biopic titled RKO 281, named after RKO's production code for the film, loosely based on the PBS documentary, which features many contemporary Hollywood stars, including Liev Schreiber (as Welles), James Cromwell, Melanie Griffith, John Malkovich, Roy Scheider, and Liam Cunningham.  CAVEAT:  Because it is an HBO film, there is a lot of strong profanity throughout, so unlike the original movie, it is not kid-friendly.

The package also includes a 48-page hardcover book with photos and a brief history of the film, and a portfolio containing replicas of movie posters, studio documents, and the souvenir program that was sold to moviegoers in 1941.

This Collector's Edition is worth having on either DVD or Blu-ray, but if you are on a tight budget, the film is also available in several less expensive standalone editions.",1357516800,10,6336,7.550744248985115

4514144,5,B0050FXDDQ,"If you consider yourself a film buff, and have not seen Citizen Kane, you might want to reconsider.  Citizen Kane is considered by most critics the greatest movie ever made.  I can tell you that it is one of the best I have seen.  This film is not great only because of technical innovations, it has amazing storytelling as well.  Some people will tell you that this film is pretentious and boring but thats because those people have the attention spans of a puppy smoking crack.  Citizen Kane tells the story of newspaper publisher Charles Foster Kane, who dies at the beginning of the film immediately after whispering the word ""rosebud"".  A news reporter spends the duration of the movie trying to figure out what rosebud means.  It is said that Citizen Kane is based on the life of William Randolph Hearst, who owned a newspaper empire that spread across the U.S.  Hearst did everything in his power to halt this release in its tracks but it goes without saying that he failed.  I encourage any film goer to watch this masterpiece of film, it is undeniably, a milestone and this edition of the film is the best.  The quality is amazing, as well as the set.  Orson Welles was a genius.",1340755200,2,1188,4.556603773584905
4514145,5,B0050FXDDQ,"I initially hesitated to buy this deluxe set and considered instead buying the smaller one that just has the ""Battle Over Citizen Kane"" documentary on it.  I love this brilliant film, but I prefer ""Casablanca"" (sorry folks) and I just wasn't sure I wanted this big of a set.  In the end, I decided to just go ahead and buy big.  I am so grateful that I did.  In addition to the film itself, which is beautifully crisp and clean, the set came with an impressive set of extras.  The little hardcover book inside talks about the production of the film and the difficulties it had getting off the ground in the face of W.R Hearst's objections.  A set of vintage movie posters for the film printed on card stock, and a reproduction of the pamphlet that accompanied the film's premiere round out the printed extras and are fun to look at.  The actual special features about the film aren't going to seem like much to those of us who spent long evenings wading through the special features on the ""Lord of the Rings"" extended edition DVDs.  They include a few interviews, production stills (one of which is partially narrated by Roger Ebert) and the theatrical trailer.  The real gem of the set are the two additional features, ""The Battle Over Citizen Kane"", a 1998 documentary about the film, and ""RKO 281"", an HBO movie from 1999 about the making of Citizen Kane.  Both of these features shed light on the film and leave the viewer knowing more about the film than they ever intended to know.  This set is a great buy that literally has everything about the movie in one handy, attractive package.  The packaging is high quality, and the puzzle-piece pattern on the box is a clever nod to the film itself.  You won't regret this great buy.",1327708800,26,1735,4.540192926045016

4514147,3,B0050FXDDQ,"CITIZEN KANE  is, as everyone knows, one of the great films of cinema. Every serious fan of the movie should own a copy. The film will always be great. The transfer is a good one, the extras on this disc are good too. But the 2 extra discs are pretty dull. The documentary about the making of CITIZEN KANE  is moderately interesting but the film that accompanies it, a kind of ""Film-of-the-documentary"", is a real switch-off. I lasted about 15 minutes. It was so slow. Also the casting was pretty much off the mark. So, as ever the film remains a treasure but don't be fooled by this bundle, it's only the main feature that matters. (There are some ""collectibles"" enclosed as well but they didn't seem that collectible to me).",1326240000,,726,4.534351145038168
4514148,5,B0050FXDDQ,"The story of ""Citizen Kane"" and its making is too well known to require recounting here.

  Suffice it to say that this 70th Anniversary Edition is basically a marketing package - and a good one at that.

  The feature film itself was remastered some time ago and is eminently viewable.

  There are two booklets, one of them professing to be a ""souvenir program"", which really reeks of 1940s Hollywood hype and is fun for the three minutes it takes to browse closely.

  The second is a mini-history of the production of ""Citizen Kane"", including a few storyboard panels. Again, a nice little touch.

  Along with the feature is a very well done TV program about ""The Battle Over Citizen Kane"", which tells the story of how Hollywood tried to suppress what is considered the greatest Hollywood film of all time in order to avoid angering William Randolph Hearst, a press baron of the time. A second dramatization ""RKO 281"", RKO Studio's working title for the project, is also included.

  Overall, for the collector with an interest in ""Citizen Kane"" and Orson Welles, this is a nice commemorative set to have.

4514149,5,B0050FXDDQ,"It is amusing to read some of the other reviews for the Citizen Kane 70th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition.  The way some people nitpick about trivialities! Who cares if the original negative is gone, and this one isn't dipped in platinum?  Not me. The awesome Citizen Kane is extremely well done in every way. The genius of Orson Welles is evident in every frame, nook and cranny of this extraordinary film.
It is,simply, a stunner of exhorbitant proportion. CK is a treat for the senses, it sort of lulls one into an asctetic experience of what real film making is, and, sadly, will never be again. This boxed set is magnificent. I will not extrapolate on the contents, as other reviewers have repeated ad nauseum. Suffice to say that, for roughly thirty bucks you get a marvelous package. The other two discs are very interesting nostalgia as to the behind the scenes scuffle regarding W.R. Hearst and Marian Davies (shhh that's where ""rosebud"" had its origins. It supposedly was a pet name given by Hearst to describe part of Davies' anatomy that he was extremely fond of). Needless to say, CK fans will adore this boxed set. I did not find any fault with the packaging, unlike some other reviewers here, and, again, to nitpick through this legendary film is to dilute its impact on future first time viewers.

8451153,4,B0050FXDDQ,"Citizen Kane, 1941 film

The film opens on a silent and dark night. An old man dies peacefully in bed, alone. It shows the vast riches of this extremely wealthy man - his monument. Charles Foster Kane was the greatest newspaper tycoon of his day. His wealth derived from a gold mine in Colorado, obtained almost by chance. His newspapers were loved by many, and hated by many. The news reels give his history. He was on track to be elected governor, but a sex scandal caused a loss. He retired to Xanadu, his lavish estate, then died as all must. The journalists will try to investigate his life to figure out his dying words (as if that could be relevant to anybody). This film continues as a search to uncover a mystery that may be unexplainable.

Charles Foster Kane was taken from his parents at an early age because of a contract his mother signed (her investment advisor). Kane received the best education money can buy, but this is omitted. Kane's pleasure is his newspaper, he is a crusader for the masses against the Robber Barons (to deprive a third party of this cause). But in time he is forced to sell control of his 'Inquirer' to a bank. The scenes show how editorial policy is remade. [Note the gas lights, an open flame.] Kane hires away the newspaper men from a competitor to create the greatest circulation in New York, the financial capital. Kane marries the niece of a President (money talks?). Jed Leland tells his memories of Kane. The scenes show Charles' changes in his marriage (he is more arrogant and powerful). Kane runs for governor, a liberal who is the friend of the working man and decent people. [But will the ruling class support this upstart?]

Poor Charlie doesn't realize that private investigators were shadowing him, and his private life ends his hope for a public life. [Most big city politicians were taking payoffs to support the local corporations.] Nothing is more scandalous than a reformer with hidden faults; a politician who is known to love drink and women won't be defeated for this. Susan's singing career soon ends. Perhaps they aimed too high, musical comedies rather than grand opera? Some very dramatic scenes follow and reveal more of the personalities of Charles and Susan. Poor Susan can't stand the strain and pressure. Can a publisher really create a star? Can a millionaire provide a starring role for his girlfriend today? Does great wealth and power lead to corruption and insanity? Was Kane's search for love the result of an unhappy childhood? Charlie's vandalism of his wife's bedroom suggests a sick mind. There is an inventory of Kane's property. What is it worth? Kane saved everything (like many of his generation). At the end we see a child's sled and its name.

This film may have been novel in its day, but now seems dated. It seems like it came from a radio play. It is not really historical or satirical. There were plenty of other targets available, but this film barely recognizes the events that existed during Kane's lifetime (post Civil War to World War II). A fictionalized account closer to reality might have been better.

Since he died alone, how did anyone learn his last word?",1465171200,,3162,4.721014492753623
