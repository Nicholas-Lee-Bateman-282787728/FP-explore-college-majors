208481,3,6300137171,"I saw this movie years ago on HBO, and didn't quite understand it. It centers around two wind-up toy mice.  A mouse and his child.  The father mouse speaks in a monotone voice that may possibly drive you up a wall. Anyway, they end up on a journey to become independent and self winding.  During their travels they run into Manny the Rat, who uses toys especially wind-ups, to do his dirty work. A very interseting, and funny part is Manny the Rat crashing the theatrical production and starts to recite some heavy vocabulary until getting hit in the head with a tomato.  Will Manny get his?  Will the mice conquer?  Some interseting things to look at in this film:  Forgiving, A fathers wisdom, love, and little life lessons that we all can pick up on.  Pretty good animation too.  Youngsters may not sit through it all, but it's a good film to have in your collection.",1016841600,16,870,4.490445859872612
208482,5,6300137171,"My sister managed to nab a copy of it off eBay for me for my birthday.  We had it when we were kids, and I just remembered that it was very strange, and sad... I was surprised that my parents let us watch that kind of thing.  I think it left an indelible mark upon me.  At any rate, it is perhaps even more relevant to me today... I think watching this cartoon with the context of 25 years behind me was a profound experience.  I recommend a bottle of wine and abstaining from food as well.  Seriously good stuff.",1015632000,9,513,4.09

7802872,2,6300137171,"I'm surprised that I seem to be the only one who never liked this film.  I saw it first as a child, when it ran in theaters.  My dad took me to see it, and as we left I made some comment that it was weird and not very good, and he agreed with me.  (The scene where the wind-up donkey gets disassembled at the dump horrified me and stuck with me all those years.)

Then a few years ago I watched it again, and my opinion hasn't changed.  Weird, dark, creepy, disturbing....I suppose it has its place and I don't mean to put down fans of this film, but I doubt it'll ever be one of my favorites.  As others have said, it's probably best for adults rather than young kids.",1378944000,,669,4.03030303030303
7802873,5,6300137171,"This is one of many forgotten animated movies I loved when I was a kid. It came on once on HBO, my mom was lucky enough to record it for me and I couldn't help but shed tears on almost all through the movie. Through the joyful scenes and its dark ones The Mouse and His Child is a perfect movie cult classic. But it bugs me on why isn't this wonderful movie on DVD? A lot of ohter ones I know are well most of them are on DVD already and not seeing this one on a DVD of it's own breaks my heart. I wish to own it again since I lost the tape and I don't have a VSH player anymore. So whoever company it's under please! Be smart put this on a DVD it will sell like hot cakes.",1357948800,,673,3.7132867132867133
7802874,5,6300137171,"A father and a son. A pair of windup toy mice. Permanently joined at the hands, when you wind up a key in the father's back, he dances around and swings his son by the arms joyfully, as a real parent might. But life is not so joyous for the titular mouse and his child. After coming into existence in McMacken's Toys the two (especially the son) question their reason for being alive. The other toys tell them it is to do what they're ""wound to do"" to entertain the humans.

The mouse child disagrees. He wants to stay in the toy store and be a family with the other toys. Specifically, he wants a windup pink elephant for his mother and a tin seal for his sister and live together in a dollhouse. This small hope is seemingly dashed when the pair fall off their shelf (despite a valiant attempt by a jack-in-the-box to grab them). The fall breaks the father's legs and so Mrs. McMacken throws them out. At the junkyard, a kindly homeless man repairs the father's legs.

Now able to walk again, the toy mice can't really go anywhere. Even when unwound, they're alive and can talk and move to some extent, but they cannot walk unless kept wound up. So it is that the pair find themselves enslaved by a vicious gang of junkyard rats led by the urbane and snobbish Manny. Manny has dozens of imprisoned windup toys working for him and is quite the sadistic slave driver; whenever a toy can't work anymore Manny has it dismantled for parts. Manny keeps the toys wound up... in exchange for their devotion and servitude.

Fortunately for our father and son duo, Manny sends them to assist his idiotic henchman, Ralphie, in stealing some ""treacle brittle"" (imported peanut brittle) from the Meadow Hoard & Trust bank. Ralphie gets himself eaten by the bank's security system, a hungry badger, leaving the unattended father and son to escape. If only they were wound up! Here the pair meet a friendly fortune-telling frog who used to work for Manny, and, the first true kind soul they've met since leaving the toy store, the frog offers to help them.

Each wants something different, yet linked. The son is still on about wanting the elephant as his mother and the seal as his sister, and for them all to live happily ever after in the dollhouse, whilst the father wants him and his son to be ""self-winding,"" i.e. not depend on others to keep them going anymore. The frog can solve both problems it seems. He knows of a tin seal in the vicinity, and if they find her they can conceivably also find the elephant, and as for the father's request, there is also a brilliant (if scatterbrained) muskrat inventor who might be able to make the mice ""self-winding."" The trio set off on their journey. But happily ever after is not something that is going to be easily obtained, because back at the junkyard, Manny has just learned of Ralphie's death and the mice's escape. Determined that a pair of stupid windup toys aren't going to make him look like a fool, Manny hops into his remote-control sports car and heads off after them...

The Mouse and His Child is based on the novel of the same name by Russell Hoban and is one of the most emotionally fulfilling and touching animated films I've seen outside of Don Bluth's early work. The decidedly dark film has a distinctly Secret of NIMH feel to it in places, and also like some of Bluth's work, it has several scenes that are pretty disturbing. Standouts include the demonstration Manny gives on a windup donkey who says he can't work anymore, and what he does to the father and son when he finally catches up to them. I won't spoil anything except to say don't worry, everything turns out all right in the end. But I cried and cringed all the same. Your mileage may vary, though, depending on how you feel about abuse towards cute toy mice.

The voice acting is superb. Alan Barzman as the father and Marcy Swenson as the son are so naive and cute that I'm convinced whoever doesn't instantly love them has a heart made of stone. Andy Devine as the frog radiates friendly paternal warmth, while Peter Ustinov as Manny positively oozes vile sadism in every line. At least, early on. As the movie goes on, main villain Manny actually gets some character development, and one other thing about the film that impressed me was the message it seems intent on sending kids about how to treat people who have hurt you in the past.

But I'll spoil no more. This is another ""Dangit it it's not on DVD?!"" movies, however I highly recommend seeing it if you can, as well as reading Russell Hoban's novel it was based on, which can be found for reasonable prices on eBay all the time.",1341619200,,4612,4.509569377990431
7802875,5,6300137171,"This is a fantastic film.  The animation is great and the voice acting is top notch.  The story is good but this is really, really not the kind of film to show kids.  There's some disturbing scenes here and there, and an especially brutal beating scene that still makes me cringe.

Fantastic picture but just not for little kids.",1321660800,,329,4.52542372881356

7802877,5,6300137171,"How to rate ""A Mouse and His Child""? I first became aware of this film in the late 1970s, and actually took a female date to it. Imagine, taking a date to an animated film!  It didn't pan out date-wise, but the film was and is astounding ... philosophically astute, almost heart-breaking, keen in its analysis of search and redemption, familial, paternal, and more. It's a commentary on unfettered capitalism, individualism, friendship, internecine (and inter-species) warfare and prejudice. And friendship.

Plot:  A ""mouse"" (father) and ""child"" (son) are the two parts of a single small wind-up toy, which must be wound up by means of a key in the father's back. After having been unboxed, they discover themselves in a toy shop where they befriend a toy elephant and toy seal. (""Papa, where are we? What are we?"" asks the child mouse. ""I don't know son,"" is all the father can offer, heart-breakingly.)  After falling from a counter and becoming broken, they are thrown in the trash. (""Papa, is this the world?"" ""I hope not."")

Outside, they become enslaved by Manny the Rat, who runs a casino in the city dump and uses broken wind-up toys as his slave labor force. With the aid of a psychic frog (Andy Devine's voiceover, one of his great final performances), the mice escape and meet various animal characters on a quest of becoming free and independent ""self-winding"" toys. They rediscover the elephant and seal, who are somewhat broken down (hey, who isn't?), and manage to form a family and destroy the rat empire.

(Son) Papa, I'm scared. (Papa) I am too, son.

(Son) Papa, I'm afraid, I want to go home, what's going to happen to us? (Papa) Well, something good as easily as something ill. Well, anything can happen.""  Uh huh.

OK, that's the plot.  But watch this movie, and engage with the underlying meaning, the musical score, the characters and the poetry. The action scenes are frightening: Ferrets war on mice and badgers. Rats enslave mice and toy elephants. Friendly ravens -- who wish they were thespians -- come to the rescue.  Beavers, monomaniacal about beavering, are saviors when least expected. Theater folk give heart, trains arrive in the nick of time, and rats -- yes, nasty rats -- are the villains, but wouldn't you expect it?! But they live in a huge bird house high above a railroad line, jiving and dancing to jazz!

Manny the Rat, voiced by the great Peter Ustinov, is one of the great film villains of all time, and Mouse and Child (think about this .. father and son, in the ultimate protection gamut against evil) struggle against their limitations (they're windup toys, after all), and smallness. But (oops, plot alert ahead) they gain their freedom, and regain their friends.

Make no mistake, this is a dark film.  Animals are killed, living (yes) toys are dismembered, Fascist animals force weaker kin to slave at meaningless labor, swarming armies overwhelm weaker foes, and murder them. One could say this is a profound metaphoric film of the human condition. OK ... I will say it. This is a profound metaphoric film about the human condition. I would recommend you buy this VHS cassette, and immediately convert it to DVD to preserve this classic for the ages.  And then convert it again into the next generation of storage media for the enjoyment -- and cogitation -- of future generations.",1214870400,3,3336,4.8178633975481615
7802878,5,6300137171,"I haven't seen this movie in ages but I never forgot it and neither has my daughter who was about 8 y/o at the time.  And ever so often we still talk about it.  She's now 26 and recently graduated from college.

  It sparked many interesting discusions but of the things I loved besides the storyline was the music.  I remember what I believed to be the main theme sung by a child. That and a few other instrumental tunes stuck with me over the years because of their beauty.

  This would be one movie that I would have to get if it ever came out on dvd.",1138233600,14,555,4.064814814814815
7802879,4,6300137171,"The Mouse (voiced by Alan Barzman) and his Child (voiced by Marcy Swenson) are mechanical toys who embark on a moving and dramatic quest to become self-winding. It all starts when The Mouse and his Child are thrown into a rubbish heap and are found and then bound in slavery by the evil Emmanuel Wolfington `Manny' Rat III (voiced by Peter Ustinov). The desire to become key-free drives The Mouse to overcome his captor, and propels he and his Child on a series of strange adventures where they meet a frog, a parrot, and a seal. Based upon the novel by Russell Hoban.

Wonderful for adults and their children.
