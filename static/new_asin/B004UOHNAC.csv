4469871,4,B004UOHNAC,"How can you rate these great classics. You either enjoy Burt Lancaster movies or you don't.  These are a few of the best -- especially The Flame and the Arrow where he does his own ""acrobatics"". This one is one I watch over many times (months apart).",1320364800,2,250,4.319148936170213

4469873,5,B004UOHNAC,"I bought this set because of Executive Action. I have never placed a lot of faith in conspiracy theorists discussions of the JFK assassination, but having seen this movie when it was first released instilled a small seed of doubt in the Warren Commission report. The rationale of the conspirators, the training methods employed, and the superb acting make this a must see film. The other three films, especially Seven Days In May with Kirk Douglas and Ava Gardner, are the polish that gives this diamond of a set it's 5 star rating (it would have been 6 star if that was an option).",1317513600,41,582,4.605769230769231

4469876,4,B004UOHNAC,"Nothing to add content-wise to calvinnme's review ('Executive Action' and 'Flame and the Arrow' earn three stars each, 'Seven Days in May' and 'Local Hero' four-plus), but Amazon's specs are wrong.  The set actually includes four single-sided picture discs and not two flippers as indicated-- good news for those of us who disdain the latter format.",1313539200,77,349,5.232142857142857
4469877,4,B004UOHNAC,"... the first time being the ill-fated Burt Lancaster Signature collection back in 2007 in which the films were just not that interesting. Lancaster was never really a studio player so his films are spread all over - his best work was primarily at United Artists though. Flame and the Arrow and Executive Action were in the old Signature collection - now out of print. Executive Action is interesting, Flame and the Arrow - not so much. Local Hero and Seven Days in May are excellent films that were on DVD but are now long out of print. Perhaps the original Burt Lancaster Signature Collection would have done much better if these two films had been included. It's just a shame that if you want Seven Days in May or Local Hero you may have to double dip Flame and the Arrow and Executive Action.

As for ""Twilight's Last Gleaming"", originally promised by WB to be in the Burt Lancaster Signature Collection, it is now scheduled to be released by Olive Films instead. I guess this excellent film didn't even rate the Warner Archives, which is an odd turnabout for WB.",1310688000,18,1067,4.5863874345549736

4469890,3,B004UOHNAC,Executive Action was an interesting theory about the assassination of Kennedy. Oliver Stone must have seen this movie. Seven Days in May was also good depicting what could happen should we have a military coup in this country. The Flame and the Arrow was a good swashbuckling type of movie in the tradition of Errol Flynn.

4469920,5,B004UOHNAC,"Great deal! ""Seven Days in May"" is hard to find at a bargain price. Great performances all around! Somewhat dated, the commentary by Frankenheimer brings the perspective of the time back and is worth it alone. ""Local Hero"" is really schmaltz but enjoyable with Peter Riegert and Lancaster giving excellent performances. ""The Flame and the Arrow"" is a old fashioned swashbuckler that could have starred Errol Flynn. ""Executive Action"" is the only one I had little interest in. The JFK assassination conspiracy business became just that, a business with more books on the bookstore shelves (when we had bookstores) than Disney had. It's basically become political schlock. Dalton Trumbo, one of the Hollywood ten (who just might have had a bone to pick with the right wing) and who wrote ""Shahra"" and ""Spartacus"", might have been better off writing a screenplay about a UFO invasion. ""Hangar 18: The Revenge!"" might have been a better subject (LOL)!

I highly recommend this set!",1422576000,,977,5.068322981366459
4469921,5,B004UOHNAC,"Great deal, four films at a nice price. I bought it because of the two political films, Seven Days in May and Executive Action. John Frankenheimer followed up The Manchurian Candidate with Seven Days in May and they are both great films. Seven Days in May showcases Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas in a plot to overthrow the government and establish a military dictatorship. Executive Action speculates on the conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy. Of the two, Seven Days in May is the superior film, a better story, better acting and better direction. Yet, Executive Action drew me in when I first saw it in 1973; perhaps it is the cast of Burt Lancaster, Robert Ryan, and Will Geer.  In the end, it is all speculation and Executive Action is only a movie, and a minor movie at that. None of its major arguments were ever proven to be true. The film is worth watching for raising questions about an assassination never fully explained. And, I always like Robert Ryan, a very much underappreciated actor.",1422403200,2,1010,4.771428571428571

4469953,5,B004UOHNAC,"Yes, it's all there including ECOMCON and ""Site Y."" This is quite a collection. It includes the stellar but somewhat obscure Seven Days in May directed by Frankenheimer. Frankenheimer directed Seven Days in May on the heels of his highly lauded political/military/psychological thriller, The Manchurian Candidate. If you never thought a coup in the US was possible, well, Frankenheimer should have had you at thinking at least twice about it. While The Manchurian Candidate (not in this collection) explored secret psychological brainwashing, political intrigue, treason, and assasination methods to achieve that end, Seven Days in May explores direct military takeover motivated by political adversarial disagreements by the military and a large percentage of the public with the administration. Not a word in the script, set object, or visual scene is wasted. Not a gesture, vocal inflection, or detail of body languange is accidental. Rod Serling wrote the screen play and script, with music by Jerry Goldsmith, and drection by John Frankenheimer. The cast is a who's who of stars and supporting character actors/actresses, the mixture of which with the outstanding script and direction is the reason why Seven Days in May gets 100% on Rotten Tomatoes.

No equivocation here. Senator Prentice to (USMC) Colonel Casey: ""But you make me think that the fruit salad on your chest is for neutrality, evasiveness, and fence-straddling."" Colonel Casey to Senator Prentice: ""On the contrary, Senator, they're standard awards for cocktail courage and dinner-table heroism. I thought you'd invented them."" Even in the midst of equivocation, there isn't any.

All The rest of the films show Burt Lancaster in good roles and show off his range over time in a variety of roles. Every one is a gem in its own right. The genres vary substantially so they may not all be any one persons favorites. Nevertheless, if you ever wanted a brief collection showing Burt Lancaster at his best, these are certainly four of the best.

True to form, TMC (Turner Classic Movies) treats each one well in the transfers. The packagng is a nice standard DVD case with four DVDs, one for each film. No flippers here. They share one stacked spindle but the center of each disk is thicker than the surface, so with simple reasonable care, they will not harm each other.",1397865600,8,2337,5.112565445026178
4469954,4,B004UOHNAC,"I got it because I happen to like Burt Lancaster's acting.  Also, I liked it because I think Executive Action is one helluva film on the JFK assassination.

4469961,3,B004UOHNAC,"Burt is a costar in Local Hero which is the best of the bunch and is even better with time compression. Local Hero can handle time compression up to 33%. Local Hero is the reason I bought the set. The Flame and the Arrow was better than I expected for an old adventure. Executive Action is rated as a Bomb by Maltin and I did not watch it. Seven Days in May is the second best film in the set but only with time compression. The maximum time compression Seven Days can handle is 20%.

The other titles were Local Hero (1983), Executive Action (1973), and The Flame and the Arrow (1950). Seven Days in May was the most thought provoking. The other 3 were B movies at best.

It is a fun and happy film.movie no. 2 The Flame and The Arrow a swashbucling adventure set in northern Italy while occupied by Germany in the middle ages. Not the finest movie of it's type but more than entertaining. This ofcourse brings us to Executive Action, one of the early films in the long list of films talking of the JFK assination. Found the story fun and entertaining with interesting plot points,only real problem is I do not buy into the hole conspiracy thing. A good yarn with a good cast and great preformances also interesting special features. Seven Days In May by far the best film in the colection and is worth the price of the entire set. A screan play written by Rod Serling about a planed military take over of the government by rouge military officers members of the joint chiefs of staff in fact(Lancaster as chairman of the joint chiefs). Have always liked Lancaster beter as a villian and he does not disapoint. Kirk Douglas is a marine corps officer who must stop him while keeping the whole plot secret. a truely great suspence thriller.

4470002,3,B004UOHNAC,those of us old enough to appreciate the work of Burt Lancaster and his contemporaries are sure to have hearing problems-normal as we age.

4470003,5,B004UOHNAC,I would recommend this Burt Lancaster movie pack as it is a fabulous collection of Burt Lancaster movies.  I saw The Flame and the Arrow when I was 12 years old and to see it again is just wonderful.  It has not lost any of the action and thrill I have experience as a boy.  For years the action sequence of the circus act and the dancing boy has stayed with me and I have recalled it every now and then. This maybe pure nostalgia but it is really a very good wholesome action movie.,1337904000,12,483,4.063157894736842
4470004,4,B004UOHNAC,"I mainly bought this for Seven Days in May which I have enjoyed as one of the best political thrillers of all time. The Flame and the Arrow is always good for a fun escape. I really hadn't heard of the other two but I found Local Hero to be a good show although Lancaster was not the central character. I suppose the movie needed a recognizable name for a draw but Burt's character was fun and he did it well. (What else would you expect?) The rest of the story was good entertainment. I confess, I haven't watched Executive Action, yet, but I'm sure it will be good some night when I want to see something I haven't seen before. A good group, especially for the price.

Burt Lancaster comes from a special time in moviemaking when there were more intelligent stories told and more emotional content than in the '30s and early '40s. The Flame and the Arrow was from the time when everything worked out in the end and the hero got the girl and all that. The war, though, I think, had opened the public's eyes to more serious things. The '50s and early '60s became a period where people and situations were portrayed in a more realistic and lifelike fashion. Actors like Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas did good and bad guys so that you loved or hated them. The bad guys didn't die in the end, either, but maybe went on to damage someone else one day. This was different. Burt and Kirk were special actors in a special time. The public was different then, too. They were simpler and a serious movie could hit your emotions pretty hard. I watch the older movies as much to think about the audience that was viewing them than for the movie, itself. When younger people view these classics today, they don't frame what they are seeing within the context of the time in which the movies were released and the movies may not interest them. It's a history lesson, though, if you can.

But, don't get me started...",1337212800,4,1905,4.409090909090909
4470005,5,B004UOHNAC,"Burt Lancaster has always been one of my favorite actors. Extremely versitile and in many cases, as with the Flame and the Arrow, did his own stunts.

4470006,3,B004UOHNAC,"I was really excited about getting this collection because of Burt Lancaster's superior acting. I especially was excited about Seven Days in May that also added the great acting of Kirk Douglas. The Flame and the Arrow is also a classic Burt Lancaster and a good film.
However, the net result is (2) two good movies and (2) bad movies. Executive action doesn't have that much of Burt Lancaster in it. The film drags. However it is slightly better than the stinker ""Local Hero"" which doesn't have much Burt at all and is a real sleeper and just plain boring.  The purchase was worth it for the (2) two good films alone.  I am dat6ing myself but it is like you bought two(2)  top 45 record hits, but when you turn them over you get two(2) stinkers.

8441953,5,B004UOHNAC,"Great intro to Burt Lancaster, one of the best film actors ever. These four films span over 30 years and are incredible.

The Sword and the Flame - 1950 - color - special features include trailer, trailer for another early 50s Lancaster flick, non Looney Tunes  WB cartoon, George McDoakes short.  This is a swashbuckler with Virginia Mayo. Like Robin Hood, classic adventure.

Seven Days in May - 1964 - Black & White - Trailer, commentary by director. This is the best film in this set! Lancaster as a military general hellbent on taking the government over from the president played by Fredric March. Kurt Douglas & Ava Gardner also star.

Executive Decision - 1973 - Color - Good film in which Burt and others hire multiple shooters to off President Kennedy. Includes trailer gallery of several Lancaster films as well as two vintage promos of the making of the film.

Local Hero - 1983 - Color - This isn't as good as the previous films. Atlantic City should've been chosen for a late career highlight. This film features Lancaster as a ditzy old guy in charge of a company that sends a guy to northern Scotland to find out about the company's impact on the environment. It's an important film in many ways, but also kind of boring for today's audience. Lancaster is not the main star as he is in the other pictures.
