2798858,2,B000OPOAOS,"I think the actors were ok, but the director and the final cut was horrible, very boring, no pace, just a waste of time to watch.. had to abandon it ..",1478390400,,151,3.903225806451613
2798859,1,B000OPOAOS,"Very bad. It seems as though this movie was produced on someone's social security checks or low-balance credit cards. The actors must have been paid in food stamps! Extremely low-res video or 16 mms garbage. I watch 2-3 Amazon movies a day and this was the WORST I have ever seen. It was free, yes, but I'll never get my wasted time back.",1476403200,2,338,4.380952380952381
2798860,5,B000OPOAOS,"If To Kill a Killer had been made with a big budget but with the same actors in their roles, it probably would have been some sort of hit.

The premise is pretty simple: Salomon Caramona and Lyndsey Jimenez are a hit-man and his wife who have to flee Mexico to Chicago when Caramona doesn't finish a hit.

Unknown to him, the man that hired Caramona for the original hit, tracks him down in Chicago and is willing to forgive the original hit if the former assassin will find a serial killer that tortured and murdered his daughter.

Uneven at times, the suspense still keeps you enthralled to what is going to happen next. Many twists and turns keep the film from being another boring snuff film.

And Jimenez, wow, in her debut role is outstanding as the cold, callous and even more dangerous wife Annabel.

She could be a star in the making.

For low budget film making, this one was pretty masterful.",1473897600,,903,4.475609756097561
2798861,2,B000OPOAOS,"I found the dialog in this movie often hard to understand - the sound seemed unevenly recorded. I also had trouble following parts of the plot - i.e. how various characters related to each other, and what they wanted. I was unclear why the bad guy was intent on killing the good guys and bystanders. I will not recommend this flick",1186358400,,331,4.442622950819672

8186159,4,B000OPOAOS,"This movie was filmed in Spanish and English and after watching both versions I must say that the he Spanish version is better. I believe this is because one, the actors' first language is Spanish and two, the director and writer's first language is also Spanish, so the translation and sincerity of the characters doesn't come through in the English version. Both versions are available on the DVD release, but a of this review only the English version is available on Amazon Digital.",1513555200,,485,4.855421686746988

8186161,2,B000OPOAOS,"Premise wise, it's actually not bad...  however the complete lack of ANYTHING about the ""unstoppable"" serial killer and relatively slow pace of the movie butcher this one...  beyond that, production quality is awful...

this really could have been a great flick, but it was done so poorly...  it's lucky I even give it 2 stars...",1496016000,,329,4.927272727272728
8186162,2,B000OPOAOS,"At first I thought it might have a bit of a Robert Rodriguez undertone but sadly, it did not.  Low production quality.  I made it about 20 minutes into it and gave up in order to watch some striped paint dry.",1490659200,,208,4.048780487804878
