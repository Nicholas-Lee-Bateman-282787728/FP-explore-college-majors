2961574,4,B000W668R6,"Have been a avid Rocky fan since I was a kid. My first Rocky film was Rocky 3 with Mr. T so of course I still list that as the best ( but i think the first is really the best, but of course sentimental values)

The music is great for all, but I think Stallone is really pushing it with the last installment. Though it still ends it well and makes Rocky seem as though almost human and real.

This is a great series. The only draw back as stated by many other people who have reviewed this is the lack of extras by MGM.

All the MGM series are pretty good, but no extras.",1202169600,,570,3.896551724137931

2961576,5,B000W668R6,"While I was never thrilled with Rocky IV and V, this collection is still a must have for any Rocky fan.  Rocky I-III could stand alone as a solid trilogy capped off by the outstanding final chapter in Rocky Balboa. The themes in these films are timeless. The movies are well written and well acted.  The boxing choreography, while not necessarily ""realistic"", captures the spirit of the sport, which is of course the point of movies like these.  Inspiring entertainment!",1200096000,,470,4.85
2961577,5,B000W668R6,"This collection was worth the wait. I hadn't seen Rocky VI yet and I only owned 1 & 2 on VHS from years ago. The packaging is simple,but sweet. There is no mystery behind Rocky...you know exactly what your getting. People are upset as if they expected more. All the DVD's are in DTS 5.1 and look and sound great. Rocky 6 was suprisingly good. In order of best to worst Rocky movies: 1,2,4,3,6,5.

To be honest, who actually watches all that extra commentary and interview stuff anyway? I just want the movies!

A great package at a great price.",1199577600,,544,4.43
2961578,5,B000W668R6,"Sylvester Stallone made movie-history with ""Rocky"": as actor, writer and director. Now the box ""Rocky - The complete saga"" is available...a box with six great movies. Each of these six movies deserves five stars. The box deserves five stars. And I give five stars.

Yes, there have been other Rocky-boxes. The last box with Rocky I-V was great and deserved five stars. Now ""Rocky Balboa"" was added, to complete the series. ""Rocky Balboa"" deserves five stars, as maybe the best movie of the series. Yes, the new box was made to make more money... but the movies in the box are great movies all the same....

Five stars for ""Rocky the complete Saga"". And thaqnk you to Sylvester Stallone for this great work, great entertainment!

2961579,2,B000W668R6,"I guess it was bound to happen with the release of Rocky Balboa at the end of '06, but that doesn't mean it's any less disappointing. I actually looked forward to a final, definitive DVD set of the films. But after buying the first two sets (the original ""red box"" set with the 25th Anniversary Rocky DVD, and the more recent ""remastered"" box set with the newer transfers), I don't think I want to jump on this again. Considering that the only extras are TRAILERS for TWO of the films (the first one and Rocky V), this is an enormous disappointment - especially considering that there was a very well done Rocky Special Edition released last year, along with a reasonably well done Rocky Balboa disc from earlier this year.

There has to be some stuff out there that they could put on discs for ALL of these films. The script for Rocky IV, for instance, was much different than what you got in the final film - even if stuff was not filmed, couldn't they give us the scripts for these films in text form as a DVD-ROM feature? There have to be at least a few deleted scenes out there for some of these films as well - someone already mentioned the original Rocky V cut, and some of the material there was pretty fascinating. Come on! Commentaries, trailers, ANYTHING. This bare-bones release is really kind of pathetic.

I guess maybe they're saving a loaded box set for an HD format (likely just Blu-Ray in this case unless an HD DVD studio has international distribution rights over the Rocky films). And then we get to pay for it again.

Avoid this one.",1194220800,35,1555,4.46830985915493
2961580,1,B000W668R6,"At least they could have put the two disc special editions in here, instead of the one disc.  This reeks of laziness.  They will probably put together another box set in a few years with more bonus features, so hold off on buying this.",1192665600,23,235,4.318181818181818
2961581,2,B000W668R6,"The stars which are used to rate this product are for the technical specs of the product itself, not a rating on the merits of the films.  I am a huge Rocky fan, so the films would get five stars, no matter how they were packaged.  Ok, now that I've cleared that up:

From The Digital Bits news today: ""In other release news, MGM has just set a Rocky: The Complete Saga DVD box set for release on 12/4 (SRP $59.98). The set will include Rocky, Rocky II, Rocky III, Rocky IV, Rocky V and yes... the recent Rocky Balboa. Unfortunately, according to the studio's press release, the only extras on the set are a pair of trailers (one for Rocky and one for Rocky V). Yo, Adrian! Where's the beef?""  If that is true--and it probably is since The Digital Bits is the most reliable site for DVD news--why bother releasing this set?

Here's the DVD history of Rocky:  MGM originally released individual standard DVDs of the Rocky movies many years ago as the DVD format became more popular.  The DVDs were, to put it charitably, poorly produced.  Subsequently, MGM released a Rocky I-V box set back in 2001 to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of Rocky.  Although the packaging was nice, there wasn't much improvement to the DVDs themselves as far as audio and video transfers; the most significant detail of the set was the addition of interviews and other special features to the first Rocky disc.  A few years later, the set was re-released with different packaging, with some improved audio and video transfers on some of the movies (Rocky V was notably left untouched).  And last year, to coincide with the release of Rocky Balboa, the set was re-released again, this time with the cheap, thin DVD cases now being used in tv season DVD packages as the only difference from the previous release.  Inexplicably, rather than being included in the re-re-released box set, the first Rocky movie was also separately re-released on DVD in a 2 disc 30th Anniversary special edition (Well, I guess greed would explain it...).  So, if you bought any of the box sets, you still had to purchase the 30th Anniversary edition of Rocky to be a true completist.

With Rocky Balboa having been available on DVD for over six months, MGM has now chosen to release the complete set of films in a new box set.  But what a missed opportunity this represents to include special features which have been omitted from previous releases.  I do not know if there are cut scenes from Rocky IV in the MGM vaults, but I know for a fact that there is massive material for Rocky V, as a bootleg ""uncut"" version of the film has been circulating online for years.  Also, why not finally upgrade the video transfer of Rocky V?  Perhaps the most egregious omission will be special features for Rocky Balboa.  Listening to Stallone's commentary on the DVD, he repeatedly refers to a ""director's cut"" which he would like to release at some point.  This would have been the perfect time.",1192492800,91,2943,4.623076923076923

For me, I like them all even Rocky V.  My least favorite is Rocky III.  I always like Mr. T.  Rocky III is just not that good.  I will give Rocky III 2 stars.  The rest are all 5 stars for me.  Rocky I to IV have the same story.  Underdog works his way up and beat the odd against him.  Rocky V and Rocky Balboa switches the tone.  The last 2 movies are less fighting but more heart touching.

All 5 movies are picture perfect except for Rocky V.  One or 2 of the scenes have the screen shaking up and down like something is wrong with the video transfer.

2961607,5,B000W668R6,"Rocky films need no presentation and/or explanation. Stallone's inspirational character is well known and long time admired by millions of fans.

The first installment, which shot Sylvester Stallone to stardom in 1976, is the best in my opinion. Sly, as inexperienced as he was back then as writer and actor, did an amazing job - the film is compelling, entertaining and moving. Great character and relationship development. Rocky and Adrian's romance is very, very special and their first love scene - pure and tender, is simply unforgettable.

If you love Rocky as much as I do, you will like the next installments, even Rocky 5, which Stallone himself awarded with rating of a grand total Zero! I think, he is being too harsh!

I am writing this because of Amazon's bad practice to publish all customer reviews on a product, without specifying to which edition they relate. My review concerns ""Rocky: The Complete Saga"", precisely the collection with the most meaningless cover ever! Beats me why they've chosen such unappealing photoof Rocky Balboa's back, but apart of that, the collection is great. The transfers are of excellent quality, with crisp picture and sound, and you have all films in one little box!

For housing 7 discs, I was impressed with how well the packing kept everything safe and protected without being bulky. Other editions with these many blu-rays tend to be more like a large box set so this saves space and holds an impressive amount of content.

The transfers for all of these films are definitely the best we have seen thus far. I am sure with the evolution of 4K HD there will be a supreme edition on the horizon. But in all honestly, this collection and the transfer quality is nothing to sneeze at.",1479081600,2,705,4.5

He couldn't believe I had never seen it, but now I've seen them a few times and can even quote it! Great films, very inspirational.

As for the actual product, decent packaging There is one case that holds all of the discs and a little plastic box that holds the case with the picture of Rocky on the front. I have it on my movie shelf and love when people notice it. Very good price for the full set.

I've had issues with a couple of the discs not being read by my PS3. I just eject them and reinsert them a couple times and then it plays. This doesn't always happen and it's not with all of the discs, just 2 of them. They all have great picture quality in my opinion, and the noise during the first Rocky isn't loud enough to distract me. I hardly noticed it.

Of course, the rest of the cast Talia Shire, Burgess Meredith and Burt Young complete the family.  Also, Carl Weathers and his entourage add life to the film too.  It is a great set, handsomely packaged and the viewing is a pleasure.  It brought back memories of the first time I saw Rocky and brings the viewer to the conclusion with the same verve it had from the beginning.  Great set to have a marathon over a weekend as the fight scenes are very realistic and it would be too much to watch all at once.  I am glad Stallone wrapped up the saga as so many are not and to the satisfaction of most fans.  Great acting, great script and a great movie experience.  Not all the discs have the verve like Rocky I, II, III but it is worth the watch.up to the conclusion of the saga.  A great marathon viewing on a Saturday afternoon, and maybe Sunday and Monday, too.",1469750400,5,968,4.274725274725275

2961760,5,B000W668R6,"All of the movies are classics, so there's really no need to comment on the story, but I'll cover the video/audio quality as well as what comes in the package. Aside from the blurays and the character cards,  there's a code that comes with them for a short featurette on the making of Creed (another phenomenal movie), but that's it. The code expires at the end of this year, and it doesn't offer any way to download it, so there's not much value to it, but I suppose it was a nice bonus.

The character cards are all very high quality, printed on glossy paper and could make for a very interesting framed picture for a man-cave-esque sort of room, if one was so inclined. Admittedly I've done nothing with mine, but considering that there's really no other way to get them, it's nice to know that I have them if I ever want to do something like that.

The video/audio quality on the blu-rays themselves are good, certainly better than their original copies, but it mostly seems like they just scaled up the picture and left the audio uncompressed. The color accuracy is a bit better than I would expect on a DVD copy, but it's not anything to write home about. The exception to this is Rocky Balboa, which was filmed digitally on high quality cameras where the first five were filmed on somewhat lower quality film (at least the first few, but all of them are somewhat grainy).

I was disappointed to discover that not only do none of the movies come with a digital copy, in fact none of them work with Vudu's Disc to Digital software either. I was hoping for at least Rocky to work due to being Ultraviolet licensed, but none of them worked at all.",1464566400,,1650,4.435643564356436

2961767,1,B000W668R6,"MGM are releasing ROCKY again to celebrate the films 40th Anniversary
but there are no new special features at all, just different artwork that's all
MGM are just recycling previous content that was released on previous blu-ray releases
6 films on 6 Discs on Disc trays in a thick clamshell case covered with big slip cover box that says 40th Anniversary on it
Disc 1 is of course Rocky with all the
retrospective featurettes, behind the scenes footage, Audio commentaries, Trailers, TV spots etc on 1 Disc
which is the same version as the 2014 blu-ray anyway which i have already
Disc 2 is Rocky II, Disc 3 is Rocky 3, Disc 4 is Rocky 4, Disc 5 is R5 & Disc 6 is Rocky Balboa
which has all the making of featurettes from the 2007-2008 blu-ray
the extras for the 5 sequels are the usual Theatrical trailers for each film
no new Audio commentaries or new interview with Sylvester stallone
MGM are just recycling content, just changing the artwork that's all
so if you have all 6 films on blu-ray anyway, don't waste your money buying this new 40th reissue
cause there's nothing new & exciting
all 6 films are available to buy in individual cases anyway, so you'll only be buying the new artwork if you buy this new reissue

2961887,4,B000W668R6,"I ordered this Blu-ray box from Amazon, on sale for about $20. That's a GREAT deal. You get all 6 Rocky films on Blu-ray, housed in a single plastic book casing. I previously had all the these films on DVD, so I compared the quality of them.

The first film has been given a fantastic remastering to Blu-ray. The Blu-ray also includes about 2 hours of bonus featurettes, interviews with cast and crew. 5/5 rating

Films 2 through 5 got a ""bare bones"" upgrade. The Blu-rays look and sound better than the DVD's but there's still room for a better remastering. They do not look as good as the first film, and the difference is noticeable. These films do not have ANY bonus features. The menu shows 3 options only: play film, scene selection, and set up. 3/5 rating for these films.

A note about the sound is important. By default, the films will play in HD Surround Sound. If you have a full surround sound set up, it will probably be very good. Without a surround sound set up, you will only hear whatever sound was mixed to the centre channel. That's fine for dialogue but when the songs are playing, you mainly hear the lead vocal and bass guitar and little else... very weird mix. Change the setting to the second option, Dolby Surround Sound, and you will hear everything more naturally again... that's the same audio mix used on the DVD's but sounding better on Blu-ray. The only Stereo mixes are for foreign languages.

The 6th and most recent film, Rocky Balboa, looks and sounds great because it was recently made. That disc also has several bonus features. The film itself is not as good as some of the others. 4/5 rating

My wife and I watched this set one movie per night. I came to see that the first film is really a stand alone film classic. If that was the only one made, it would still be regarded as an important film. The rest of the films are what made the franchise more commercial, fun, ""cheesy"", etc. They are highly entertaining and fun, effective for stirring up emotions/reactions, but they rely on stereotypes and flat characters that rarely have the depth of the first film. Stallone did a great job of giving key scenes to each of the supporting characters, and the decisions to kill off characters makes sense to development plots in Rocky's fictional life.

Overall, an excellent collection that will replace my DVD's (and take up far less shelf space too). If you're a Rocky fan, I definitely recommend this Blu-ray set. I also encourage you to go see the latest film, ""Creed"".",1452729600,13,2508,4.562222222222222

My only knock would be that they included Rocky 5. Pretty horrible movie, but on a series note they had to include it. Rocky Balboa at least lets the series end on a high note (I know Creed just came out, with fantastic reviews I might add!).

In one purchase I was able to get all that I needed to introduce my son to the Rocky Balboa I grew up with - and needless to say, he absolutely loved it and is now a Rocky fan himself! Purchasing these Blu-Ray discs on their own would have been a very expensive buy, so finding it bundled like this with an added BONUS disc was a true bargain indeed! Everything was shipped out very quickly and in very good new condition - - AND qualified for the FREE shipping! YAY! While reading other reviews, I was expecting there to be a little problem with filming quality, even a little grainieness. But that was not an issue.

A wonderful purchase!",1433462400,,677,4.373015873015873

2962000,5,B000W668R6,"I bought this collection on Bluray DVD for $20. (Very reasonable!) It contained the five Rocky movies and the movie Rocky Balboa. So, it allows you to watch the cinematic lifespan of the Rocky character. (I feel like the stories peak at the fourth movie, where Rocky goes to the U.S.S.R. to fight Drago.) This series is a compelling, inspiring, well-done and well-acted saga. Even if you are not a boxing fan, the stories within this saga will connect with you as characters wrestle with their dreams, goals, fear and find love and heartbreak along the way. Iconic and worth watching with your family!",1433289600,2,601,4.788461538461538

2962008,5,B000W668R6,"I'm a huge fan of the Rocky saga, especially I-III, but at this price I could not pass up on owning the entire set (yes, even if Rock V had to be part of it!!  That movie sure does get raked through the coals man!) and thinking about a 2 day long marathon warmed my nostalgic soul.
I assume anyone that is going to purchase this has seen them all so no need to do an in depth review of each movie.  The product showed up on time and factory wrapped as promised.  The extras alone would have been worth the $20.00 price tag (some of them were silly or a waste of time,but the documentary was very enjoyable)  The quality of Rocky was surprising good.  I have only watched all of Rocky and watche Rocky II but nothing in those first leads me to believe this is nothing short of a 5 star purchase",1431561600,3,793,4.090322580645161

Real nice buy for sure at my time for sure and they are  I think some great movies with a lot of good memories at the time I remember them when they first came out ESP the  first one I was younger like Rocky was going to gym 2 to 3 times a day I was in my PRIME.  Some people said I sometime sounded like Rocky LOL and did a Spot on Rocky impression yelling of YO ADRAIN at the end of the movie and did the raw eggs drinking too. Good memories by far. I am 61 now and out of shape I have not seen a gym in like O man 8 years but very Happy with this purchase from AMAZON.  It made me smile and fill young again :)",1425513600,3,922,3.7216494845360826

From that point on we've seen Rocky to Rocky 5 about 10 times from the first to the last. I then remembered that there was a Rocky 6 but no one had it to stream. He was so heartbroken to not have completely watch the entire series. Then I stumbled upon this and saw Rocky 6 was included. I made the decision to give this to him for Christmas. Christmas morning comes and he opens this and screams and jumps up and down. Then he stops and says, ""Wait, is Rocky 6 in here?"" I just smiled and he ripped it open and took the movie out and put it on right away. We've seen that one movie a lot! I am glad he's happy and the series is great from this set. Picture is really clear and the extra content is great. He actually started watching the commentaries hahahaha. Now he wants a Rocky themed birthday party! Idea would help if you guys have any.

I watch and enjoy these films solely for the entertainment value derived from them.  I'm typically not a Stallone fan, but enjoy the Rocky character.  There is some lingering monotony in the films, but the variation of opponents adds greatly to the stories.

Especially when compared to the footage in the making of extras.  They did a great job remastering it.  The audio was pretty good too.  However, I did notice a few spots where the audio quality would drastically change and it got me thinking that the masters must have somehow been damaged or something to that effect.

2962169,5,B000W668R6,"Rocky: The Complete Saga consists of six films - Rocky,Rocky II,Rocky III,Rocky IV,Rocky V and Rocky Balboa - that tells the story of a small-time boxer Rocky Balboa,a character portrayed by Sylvester Stallone,that has become part of the American culture and an icon that represents hope and optimism as well as the sport of boxing.

Rocky I tells the story of how Rocky proved himself to be not a worthless when he goes the distance against heavyweight champion,Apollo Creed after suffering from several defeats both inside the ring and experiences in life like getting rejected by Adrian and being mocked by his trainer,Mickey.

Rocky II tells the story of how Rocky managed to become a heavyweight world champion by beating Apollo Creed.

Rocky III,it tells the story of how Rocky rose above from defeat after reclaiming his heavyweight title against Clubber Lang.

Rocky IV tells the story of how Rocky avenged for the death of his friend - Apollo Creed - against Russian boxer Ivan Drago and made Americans proud during the time of the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. With Rocky V,we see Rocky become a boxing trainer for Tommy Gunn after retiring from the sport and returns to the Philadelphia neighborhood where he belongs after losing his fortune to a crooked accountant.

Rocky Balboa or Rocky VI gives a fitting conclusion for the series as we get to see Rocky Balboa climb inside the ring against heavyweight champion Maxon ""The Line"" Dixon to give another meaning in his life during his advanced years after losing his wife Adrian to death and the feeling of loneliness dominate his life.

Rocky films are more than just movies for Americans as most of them have become big parts of their life and their culture. The first(Rocky I) and the last film (Rocky Balboa) provided hope and optimism during the time when Americans were experiencing hardship and difficulties due to the tough economic situation that the country was experiencing during its time of release. The other films may not be a classic compared to the films I have just mentioned in the previous sentence but they still gave us excitement and entertainment as we get to relate to Rocky Balboa when he started a family (Rocky II), rose above from defeat (Rocky III), made us proud being Americans during the Cold War (Rocky IV) and become a mentor to others (Rocky V).

Overall,it was one saga that would always remain with us for many years to come. Definitely,a must-own for a Rocky Balboa fan.",1414540800,,2489,4.828638497652582

The first Rocky movie was released in 1976 as in the YEAR 1976.  There was no Blu-Ray or even DVD back then, so you aren't always going to get crisp Blu-Ray pictures from a source that was not originally made to play on Blu-Ray compared to movies that were filmed to be on Blu-Ray from the start.  That being said,  the picture being transferred to Blu-Ray looks excellent.  I play the movies on a Panasonic Blu-Ray player, on a Toshiba player and as well on PS3 and PS4 game consoles.  The picture quality is great on all players.
 There are all kinds of extra features, commentaries, etc included.  Originally priced at $60, you can find this great collection of all 6 Rocky movies on Blu-Ray for around $35 or less which is even a better deal.",1410739200,3,883,4.515723270440252

2962218,5,B000W668R6,"Rocky: The Complete Saga consists of six films - Rocky,Rocky II,Rocky III,Rocky IV,Rocky V and Rocky Balboa - that tells the story of a small-time boxer Rocky Balboa,a character portrayed by Sylvester Stallone,that has become part of the American culture and an icon that represents hope and optimism as well as the sport of boxing.

Rocky I tells the story of how Rocky proved himself to be not a worthless when he goes the distance against heavyweight champion,Apollo Creed after suffering from several defeats both inside the ring and experiences in life like getting rejected by Adrian and being mocked by his trainer,Mickey.

Rocky II tells the story of how Rocky managed to become a heavyweight world champion by beating Apollo Creed. As for Rocky III,it tells the story of how Rocky rose above from defeat after reclaiming his heavyweight title against Clubber Lang. Meanwhile,Rocky IV tells the story of how Rocky avenged for the death of his friend - Apollo Creed - against Russian boxer Ivan Drago and made Americans proud during the time of the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. With Rocky V,we see Rocky become a boxing trainer for Tommy Gunn after retiring from the sport and returns to the Philadelphia neighborhood where he belongs after losing his fortune to a crooked accountant.

Rocky Balboa or Rocky VI gives a fitting conclusion for the series as we get to see Rocky Balboa climb inside the ring against heavyweight champion Maxon ""The Line"" Dixon to give another meaning in his life during his advanced years after losing his wife Adrian to death and the feeling of loneliness dominate his life.

Rocky films are more than just movies for Americans as most of them have become big parts of their life and their culture. The first(Rocky I) and the last film (Rocky Balboa) provided hope and optimism during the time when Americans were experiencing hardship and difficulties due to the tough economic situation that the country was experiencing during its time of release. The other films may not be a classic compared to the films I have just mentioned in the previous sentence but they still gave us excitement and entertainment as we get to relate to Rocky Balboa when he started a family (Rocky II), rose above from defeat (Rocky III), made us proud being Americans during the Cold War (Rocky IV) and become a mentor to others (Rocky V). Overall,it was one saga that would always remain with us for many years to come.",1408147200,,2457,4.828978622327791

to conclude: i highly recommend this box set to all Rocky fans",1400198400,2,913,4.3391812865497075

2962293,4,B000W668R6,"First of all, for the money (about $23 at the time), this is a great value.  As others have pointed out, only the original 'Rocky' has been fully re-mastered.  I knew that going in, and didn't expect all of the movies to have that HD look.

I loved the packaging.  I was totally impressed that they got all six movies neatly packed into a single-disc-size case.  By comparison, the Man of Steel Blu-ray has three discs, and two of them are simply stacked on top of each other on a single spindle.  In this collection, each disc has its own spindle/tray.  Nice!

I wish there were more Special Features.  It seems like I've seen a documentary or two over the years that didn't appear here.  Would have been nice to feel like I had the definitive collection of behind the scenes info.  Still, I bought this set to pretty much just watch the movies...mostly Rocky IV.  So, I'm not complaining much.",1400198400,3,895,4.490683229813665

People love an underdog, and Rocky always is one, even when he's the champ.

My issue with this is the lack of bitrate in the video. These movies are old, dirty and grain filled and require quite alot of bitrate to preserve that. However, sadly, the video loses alot of that due to the low bitrate. It seems like to save on costs they wanted these to fit on 25GB bluray discs instead of 50GB ones. Such a shame.

Rocky 1. Some of the dark scenes are clearly better than the old version of the bluray. But I wouldn't say the entire scenes are super sharp like some old movies like Sound of Music, Ben Hur, Cleopatra and so on. They still look old and have a lot of grains.

From Rocky 2-5. They have the same problem. Some of the parts looked better but not worth saying they look super sharp HD bluray.
I know they did best but I am still dissapointed.

Rocky Balboa. I am dissapointed not because of the visual. The visual is perfect. The sound is not DTS HD or Dolby TRUE HD. That's why it is dissapointed.

Above all, If there was a chance that I could watch all the six discs and buy the set, I still would have bought it.

I also was let down when I found out that the first rocky was the only one that got a new transfer. BUT I can tell you this, there is a world of difference in this new transfer vs the previous bluray releases. This new transfer us great!!!! The previous undisputed set, everyone including me, was griping about all the gritty film grain. If you like grain, stick with that set. This new one though, its beautiful!!!! No drop out and its so nice and smooth. There is no detail loss and the sound us great also. Aside from the new transfer, the new packaging is nice also. Its much thinner than the other set and there is some new bonus material. The box is pretty sweet, and I also like the new menus. I've only checked out the first one so far so I can't say anything about the other ones. I would imagine they are the same as the previous ones. Bottom line...... If you a Ricky fan, grab this! I got mine for $35 and that's nothing to complain about.new transfers on the other movies will come later on, but till the.... I'm VERY happy with the first ones new transfer. By the way, those of you who keep demanding more xrta content on thebfirstbfilm, its not gonna happen . if you recall on some of the previous releases, the director informs us that all the unused stuff and extras were lost in a fire!! So, stop complaining about extra content for the first film. I DO want more content for the rest of them though!!",1392076800,5,1589,4.247524752475248
2962340,4,B000W668R6,"The Rocky franchise is one of my personal favorites. Very few characters have resonated with audiences the way Rocky has. This collection includes all six Rocky films, from the original ""Rocky"" (1976) to the latest installment ""Rocky Balboa"" (2006). The first film in particular is one of the all-time great movies, it has stood the test of time and remains a wonderful achievement in filmmaking. The sequels vary in quality, but they are all bound together by the heart of the title character as well as entertaining boxing matches.

For those who already own the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocky-The-Undisputed-Collection/dp/B002M9WW30/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rocky: The Undisputed Collection</a>&nbsp;(which seems to be going out of print), the question is should you purchase this set?

The main reason to upgrade would be an improved image quality on the first film. If you own the Undisputed Collection, you'd probably agree that the picture quality is good but there was a lot of room for improvement. The Heavyweight Collection features a new transfer, and the result is a much better viewing experience.

Some have brought up the much lamented 7th disc of bonus features that was included in the Undisputed Collection, but is not included in this Heavyweight Collection. However, it's not as bad as it looks... almost all of the bonus material on that disc have been included on Disc 1 of this new set (so it's on the same disc as the first ""Rocky"" film). I am not sure why this change was made, but my guess is there have been improvements in storage capacity since the first blu-ray set was released, and thus there is more room on the movie disc to fit the special features.

In fact, there is one new feature included in this set: ""8mm Home Movies of Rocky"".

So if you already own the Undisputed Collection and have no problem with the video quality, then upgrading to this set probably isn't essential.

2962349,2,B000W668R6,"Does Sylvester Stallone have anything to do with these releases?

'Rocky' is such an endearing movie franchise, but the way MGM handles the home distribution is despicable.  The franchise's value is reportedly into the billions - treat it as such. There only needed to be one box set Blu-ray release, 'The Undisputed Collection', and that was done wrong. This new 'Heavyweight' set is just a rip-off repeat of it, minus some of the bonus features. Why would anyone buy it?

Here's what's wrong with both of these Blu-ray sets (before we get into the actual movies themselves):

Let's start with the 'Heavyweight' set's packaging:  That's not even the ROCKY font!  The cover and spine of the set should be solid black with 'ROCKY' in the original font in gold-yellow, Rocky's colors. Add Stallone's signature on there somewhere and it's good to go.  You'd never see 'Star Wars' or 'Jaws' repackaged with the name any other way than the original LOGO.  Because that's what it is, a logo.  Rocky has one too. Use it.

MGM, do you know who you're catering to?  No box set of any film series is complete without sticking to the fonts and styles of the original theatrical posters and promos. Your '007' sets don't stray like this Rocky set does. It's hardcore fans like me who would shell out the money for these sets anyway.  Do you really think any non-Rocky fan is going to pay $40 when you can get all of them individually in the bargain bin at Wal-Mart - some with double features?  You can get the 'Rocky Balboa' DVD for $5 at Best Buy. Why are the Rocky fans getting the shaft like this?

Why is only the original 'Rocky' getting any remastering treatment?  This was the main issue people had with the 'Undisputed' Blu-ray set. These movies were far from flops; the Rocky series is one of the most successful movie franchises of all time. Rocky II - V all deserve the same respect.

On the original DVD release box set from 2000, each disc contained the theatrical trailer for the movie.  Nowhere to be found on the 'Undisputed' set.  PUT THEM BACK!  Along with any TV spots. The Rocky movies were big hits that still command a huge following both here and internationally.  Let's see some of the press that surrounded their original theatrical releases.

THE FILMS

ROCKY - I want to see the original ending that was cut.  That picture of Rocky & Adrian holding hands inside the 'K' on the poster is from them walking in the back after the fight.  If the footage no longer exists, I'd like to hear Talia Shire or someone explain it.  Were other scenes cut?  If so, what were they about?  (See my reasoning, if you really need it, when we get to 'Rocky Balboa'.)

ROCKY II - Well done sequel that carried the story on in the same vain as the original and all the actors turned in great performances. There had to be more than one trailer for this. It was 1979 and the studio was pushing the sequel to their huge hit from 3 years ago. Any cut scenes? Let's hear about them. How about some insight on Stallone taking on the role of director? Was John Alvidsen approached? I always wondered who conjured up the idea of a sequel in the first place. Was it the studio or was is Stallone?

ROCKY III - Ditto.  Took the story forward and on to the next level. It was junk food for us fans, sweetened with 3 fights (including the wrestling match). Plus, the addition of 'Eye Of The Tiger' to the soundtrack. I was 8 when this came out and remember the line around the theater and all the hype with the song - good times!  However, clocking in shorter than its prequels at a little over 1.5 hours, there must have been cut scenes. What were they? Why were they cut?  Also, there's a 'making-of' special out there on YouTube, showing behind the scenes footage including practicing with Hulk Hogan for the Thunderlips match along with Stallone and Mr. T rehearsing their bouts.  Come on with it!  Let Hulk Hogan talk about the conflict he had with Vince McMahon, Sr., who gave him the ultimatum: Either work for me at the WWF or go do the Rocky movie.  Hogan chose the latter and we all know what happened to pro wrestling after 1982 and Hogan's exposure from the film.

ROCKY IV - *Sigh*. The biggest money maker in the series, but talk about getting way off track story wise. Not to mention adding 6 magical years to the story line (that was one long friendly match with Apollo Creed at the end of III !).  Even shorter than 'Rocky III', there must have been cut scenes. The trailer has an interesting blip of the boxing board members sitting around a conference table refusing to have the match between Rocky & Ivan Drago due to Apollo Creed's death. Didn't make the final cut. Please show this. Explain.  And also, how about the change up in the soundtrack? Let's talk about it.

ROCKY V - We all know the negative stigma surrounding this one. However, the swerve of Rocky & co. going from riches back to rags was a well-needed shot in the arm for the story. If you're a Rocky fan like me, you also know full well about and have seen the 'directors cut' floating around YouTube these past couple of years (with Bill Conti's original score, not MC Hammer's music). The cut dialogue in the scene with Rocky and his lawyers about his finances is so well-needed. Rocky and Adrian lay into Paulie about the financial mess he caused. This was - unrealistically - barely addressed in the final cut. This, along with the rest of the project and cut scenes (Little Marie?), needs to be discussed between director John Alvidsen and Stallone in a sit down like the one William Friedkin and William Peter Blatty have on 'The Exorcist' discs.

ROCKY BALBOA - It's been said, and I'll say it again: Stallone did so right by all us fans with this one, the final chapter.  Well-written, well-preformed and with the atmosphere of the original it hit all the right points.  But, how about a director's cut?  The deleted scenes are so awesome and would only enhance the story - especially the Paulie/girlfriend bit and when Rocky runs into wheelchair-bound Andy in the bar.  What's also a plus in this story is that when it comes to the computer fight, you hear detractors of Rocky for the first time in the series. One of the commentators calls Rocky 'overrated'. It would have been interesting to hear just a tinge of that in Rocky II and then Rocky IV after Rocky's 3 years at the top.

What's the big deal?  The big deal is that Rocky is an American folk hero. These are supposed to be 'ultimate sets', 'Undisputed'.  Well, the Rocky fans are disputing. Despite Chuck Wepner' s legit issues with Stallone and how he was handled, on screen Rocky the character hits home for a lot people. The whole 'going the distance' thing can be applied everywhere in life. It resonates with people, touches nerves (positively). And, the Rocky of 2006 pushing age 60 spoke just as well.

What other film has produced a character and story as inspirational like this?  Nothing since 1976, that's for sure. If so, name it. No movie character gets discussed the way Rocky does. Because people can relate.

THE EXTRA'S

What other movies have such a stirring and motivating original score and soundtrack? Only John Williams' 'Jaws', 'Star Wars' and 'Indiana Jones' scores come close to getting you pumped up like the music in the Rocky films. How about a segment devoted to Bill Conti and his work, along with Vince DiCola and his synthesizer score for Rocky IV? How about an interview with the band members of Survivor? Even MC Hammer & co. - how (and why?) did they get tapped for the 'Rocky V' soundtrack?

Go to Philly: What other movie character still has their statue and permanent sneaker prints anywhere outside of Hollywood?  Rocky could have been from LA or New York. But, Stallone based him out of blue-collar Philadelphia. It's a large city, but it's also a town like any other town in 'flyover country', not a whole lot of glamour. Track down the owner of the building at 1818 E Tusculum St. in Philly, along with others in the area who were there for all the filming, etc. Give the city its props with a segment devoted to it. Along with the city's rich history, the whole Rocky thing is part of the charm for tourists.

The sport: Focus a segment on boxing. Include Chuck Wepner's ESPN documentary, let's be fair. Interview other boxers as well; get their insight and opinions on the Rocky movies. Stallone was inducted into the boxing hall of fame a few years ago, include it. I've trained at Freddie Roach's Wild Card gym in Los Angeles. The walls are covered with posters and pictures, all boxing-related (lots of Manny Pacquiao, of course). But on the way out, look up above the door and you'll see the only picture in the whole place that's under plexi glass protection: It's a black and white shot from the 'Rocky IV' fight with Stallone's autograph on it. You simply can't deny the films' place in the world of boxing.

Some of these things I'm calling out have been addressed on the various releases.  How about getting them all into one place finally, on one set?  Otherwise, it's just obvious greed on the studios' part.

FINAL THOUGHTS

Mr. Stallone, you hit the nail on the head in 1976 with Rocky. One of a kind, the likes of which we haven't seen since. Unlike Rambo, Rocky Balboa is your baby. You created him. I understand people have a hard time separating you from him. But, the series' treatment deserves so much better and we would think you'd prefer to see it better handled as well. Do us a favor: Pick up the phone, call someone over at MGM and straighten this crap out.

Instead of churning out repetitive sets (in poor packaging), ROCKY and its fans deserve a better Blu-ray box set.",1391126400,34,9684,4.544354838709677

2962358,5,B000W668R6,"Rocky haters never get over Five; oh the misfortune of having had a brilliant run. To not like Rocky is to engage in snobbery. Raging Bull is brilliant, but does it speak to you? Have you felt like Jake Lamotta? To take them on one by one, ROCKY, the first, is a sublimely nuanced piece of low-budget 70s art in the manner of DOG DAY AFTERNOON. Do not be fooled by its optimism; if self-loathing matters, then love matters; that film shows the transformation of a group of under-dogs (Rocky, Adrian, Paulie, and Mickey) when granted the unrealistic shot at the impossible. If you want realism, watch Ray Robinson beat Carmen Basillio in the Garden. Rocky is art. It is also a working class microcosm of Philadelphia enduring economic decline in the 70s; it's about rootlessness, broken families and the desire for more. ROCKY II finally reveals what happens to most mediocre to great fighters when they achieve fame. The money goes fast, and relationships take a hit. ROCKY III should be respected as the 'turning of the page' that it is; if you like the Rolling Stones for adapting to disco, why can you not accept Rocky as a Reaganesque 80's hero, grown fat from shame (metaphorically); wealthy and under-trained; it is filled with camp. And Carl Weathers finally takes center stage. ROCKY IV, minus an embarrassing robot, is like II without the charm, but it is loaded with Bi-polar world Perestroika-era fun. ""The Russian is cut; he's not a machine!"" ROCKY V -- well, everyone stumbles, and in stumbling, in failure, there is greatness; imagine Bruce Lee movies or Hammer Horror films without ridiculous sequels. And ROCKY BALBOA has moments of such subtlety, such grace, it charms like a Sam Beckett play as men, Paulie and Rocky, wander the depleted Philly of their youths, living in the past and granted one last shot at a future. Rocky's speech to his son, along with Duke's ""Hurting Bombs"" speech are SCREENWRITING ART. There I said it. Bill Simmons would say it. And there is good news, my friends, Ryan Coogler has received the greenlight for APOLLO CREED, the story of Apollo's grandson, played by THE WIRE and FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHT's Michael P. Jordan, with Stallone in a small supporting role. Coogler is an artist. The series has found its footing.  If you have ever wrestled, ever competed, there is some small part of you that will love this, even when it is a colorful phantamagoria of absurd fun, and especially when it is suffused with hard truths.",1389657600,8,2465,4.772833723653396

After watching 1 a week for the past 6 weeks I can tell you that I thoroughly enjoyed the trip back down memory lane.  Whether he's fighting Apollo Creed, Clubber Lang, Ivan Drago, or Tommy Gunn Rocky will take you on an underdog's journey to glory!

If you haven't seen the movies before, they're 70's & 80's movies, so that should give you an idea of what to expect.  They are all written by Sly Stone himself so if you enjoy his career but haven't seen these movies, give them a chance.

""Rocky IV"" still to this day is one of my all time favorite movies, I don't listen to the critics who try to point out its flaws, I just watch it and enjoy every minute of it.  While 5 gets its harshest reviews, I do understand why it was made.

If you liked these movies growing up like I did, you have to get this so you can relive the great stories over and over again.",1382313600,,748,3.8562091503267975

Wanting something different well this is it. Plenty of things happening that you have to watch it all the time not missing out on anything. Story is about a boxer that has other issues with family and friends, now that is all as not to spoil a great movie. I rated this an A grade plus for the fantastic action and twist and turns that keeps the entertainment going, so what are  you waiting for, go collect your popcorn put your feet up and relax for a surprising night of great classics.

Up here and all over the internet i've seen people give this set bad reviews for it's picture quality so I was expecting the worse.

2962482,4,B000W668R6,"If you are looking at this you know this is a classic series of movies. I am here to attempt to review the quality if the blu-ray transfer for each movie. I want a potential buyer to know what they are getting when it comes to a the video quality presented in this set

Case:

The design here is compact and neat. There is an oversized blu ray keep case that holds all 7 discs. The discs are in back to back holders.

Image Quality

Rocky :
This is definitely the best quality we have ever gotten. There is a question as to weather or not this is the best possible transfer we could get, but it is very difficult to judge something on conjecture. Anyway, the aspect ratio is 1.85:1 with a 1080p/mpeg2 transfer. This is the same remastering as the 2006 blu ray and we may not get a better version for a long time.

While watching the movie it looks very good, but there is significant noise on the screen at pints which can be distracting. This definitely comes from the movie being an older print but it is far less noticing e when looking the outdoor scenes.

Rocky II

 The transfer here is AVC-encode. The image is far nicer than you have ever gotten before but thee is still some noise from the original content. I do not know why but the final fight scene seems to pop more than the rest of the movie. The scenes becomes a tad sharper somehow.

Rocky III

This transfer is beautiful. It doesn't blow the first two away but it is definitely a nicer clearer print. This movie does showcase what Blu Ray can do for you. There is so much detail in faces and on skin that it really helps you want to watch this version. Dark scenes have some shadowing issues but this is still a very nice transfer.

Rocky IV

Again we have a 1080p/AVC encode and boy does it look special. This movie in blu-ray is a treat. Faces look incredible, everything shines and colors look absolutely fantastic. This asks you to take notice. There is very little static from the source through the movie but the contrast is incredible. The black areas are as black as they are going to get. This movie showcases what you are missing out by just watching the movie on DVD.

Rocky V

I removed a star in my review because they included this film. Kidding! Five is not the most popular Rocky movie out there, though to tell you the truth I don't hate it. Alright and now I'm back. AVC-encoded yet again but somehow we have a step back in quality.

The picture is a bit darker than previous movies but there is a lot less noise present.

Rocky Balboa

Thus is the same transfer as the 2007 film blu ray release. This is the best of all of the discs but I guess that is to be expected when a few decades pass. Finally a Rocky movie with no noise and no artifacts.

Special features

Just two extras I found to be notable that increased my enjoyment of this product

Feeling strong now game. This is Very similar to
DVD scene-it and it is actually fun to mess around with

In The Ring- making of documentary. This is a fantastic three part making of that is 75 minutes long. Part one is all about what it was like to film the movie in 28 days while parts 2 and 3 focus on the loves and motivations of the actors other than Sylvester Stalone.

So finally if you like these movies and you are interested I hope you can use this as a quite for you to judge if you want to see this movie. There are many conflicting reports relating to weather or not the quality on these blu-rays are what you are expecting so I hope I have been able to clear things up a bit to allow you to make your own decision.

The picture is gorgeous and I would definitely purchase it again in a heartbeat!",1376956800,2,358,4.358208955223881

2962494,2,B000W668R6,"Rocky is about an average guy with a big dream. He has to out-box Apollo Creed for the heavyweight championship. The chemistry and performances in this franchise are excellent. Rocky fans will be happy to find all 6 Rocky movies from the original to Rocky Balboa are included here in this 7-disc Blu-ray collection (2009). The series never got much love in the way of extras (many previous DVD sets had no extras). This set includes a 7th Bonus Disc (Rocky Anthology) with recycled extras from the Rocky 2-Disc Collector's Edition DVD, Rocky Balboa BD and one new HD game (Feeling Strong Now!) which is fun for a time. Overall the product isn't as comprehensive as fans would prefer. It seems somewhat slapdash as if Rocky I-V barely exist (the sequels are mostly ignored). Only Rocky Balboa gets special treatment with extras on its disc, the only audio commentary and deleted scenes. Forget about the frequently mentioned Rocky IV and V trimmed scenes and director's cut of Rocky V. We are missing a truly comprehensive documentary on the franchise (76 minutes describing 6 films doesn't cut it anymore when Blade Runner got a 3-hour deluxe documentary for a single film). There is a total of roughly 4.5 hours of total bonus supplements (3.5 hours from Rocky 2-disc DVD & 1 hour from Rocky Balboa BD) which is good but not great. 6 films deserve at least 6 hours in extras, new documentaries and/or a remastering for such a great franchise. So this collection is the light version of the box set and certainly not deluxe. This set delivers mostly ""single film treatment"" which is so common to box sets. The first five films in The Planet of the Apes franchise got better treatment.

Disc 7: Rocky Anthology Bonus Disc: Feeling Strong Now! Game, Rocky Featurettes: Three Rounds with Legendary Trainer Lou Duva, Interview with a Legend - Bert Sugar: Author/Commentator and Historian, The Opponents, In the Ring: Three-Part Making-Of Documentary, Steadicam: Then and Now with Garrett Brown, Make Up! The Art and Form with Michael Westmore, Staccato: A Composer's Notebook with Bill Conti, The Ring of Truth, Behind the Scenes with John Avildsen, Tribute to Burgess Meredith, Tribute to James Crabe, Video Commentary with Sylvester Stallone, Sylvester Stallone on Dinah! (1976), Stallone Meets Rocky, Trailers.

Hang onto your Rocky (Two-Disc Collector's Edition DVD) for the audio commentaries. Consider purchasing this collection as the value pack ($6/film) if you don't own them all. Rocky II-V don't have many extras in their stand-alone releases and nothing much is added here. If you enjoy two or more of the films it is worth it. I would rate the films 5 stars and this collection 2 stars because it could have been so much better and isn't a major upgrade from the DVD collection. Many franchises get poor treatment but prior Rocky releases felt like the movie was slapped onto disc and shipped out. Rocky was loved by millions, inspired thousands and deserves heartfelt remastering. IGN ranked this release at #18 in Top 25 Worst Blu-Ray releases (notably Robocop Trilogy, The Terminator and Predator: Ultimate Hunter Edition also make the list). The video and audio quality aren't up to snuff. If you already own the Rocky film collection then this doesn't add much. Although you do get a few extras on Disc 7 it seems cynical to include so little bonus content (not all of the DVD extras were ported over either). The problem is that not all of the films seem to be in true HD (the transfers are the best Rocky has looked but still don't look great when compared to other Blu-Rays). Rocky fans deserve better treatment.",1376784000,7,3629,4.8896103896103895
2962495,4,B000W668R6,"I can't say I really notice that much difference between this bluray set and the DVD set I already owned. It is nice however to have Rocky Balboa included in the bluray set. The packaging is nice, and I really prefer to have bluray as hey are smaller and easier to keep. Price was great also.",1376352000,,292,4.232142857142857
2962496,5,B000W668R6,"Each movie comes on its own disc. Great quality and product if you enjoy the rocky films.
strongly recommend the purchase.",1376179200,,122,4.857142857142857
2962497,4,B000W668R6,Video quality was great. All the movies were excellent except Rocky 5 which I did not have the heart to even attempt to watch.,1376179200,,126,4.291666666666667
2962498,5,B000W668R6,"This is a great item to have. This film series is a great story of an ordinairy guy who suddenly finds himself on a path to drasticlly improve his life. Along the way he pushes through several physical and emotional barriers between his goals and his friends/family. The ride, while bumpy at times, is very satisfying and rewarding for the watcher. The really good thing is that each movie has Rocky tackle a different obsticle for different reasons.

Moving away from the movies, the set itself is pretty impressive. The movies do have slight quality issues but, it's very easy to brush it aside and forget the problem, except for the first film. In the first movie there are scenes where one character appears blurry and has shadow all around him/her but all other characters look bright and clear. While I haven't seen every extra, the ones I have seen add a lot for the movies and it is great hearing Stallone explain what he did with the character he acted/created/changed.

Not every movie is 5 stars but, the set makes up for the majority of bad marks I would give some of the movies. Very recommend.",1376092800,,1107,4.614213197969543
2962499,5,B000W668R6,"This iconic franchise is a must have for any fan. Looks better, sounds better but it feels the same. The same as when I first saw them. Awesome!",1376006400,,144,4.178571428571429
2962500,5,B000W668R6,"I hadn't seen most of these movies in years and am really enjoying watching them all. They are well done and entertaining. All the characters fit the parts so well and there's a lot of feeling to these movies. I've always been a Stallone fan but watching these as an adult gives me even more respect for him.

The collection came nicely packaged and I've not had any problems with the discs so far (we are on IV). The image quality isn't up to standard with your normal Blu-Ray and it's even grainy at times but I don't think it was shot with the best cameras, at least the earlier ones. It's rather nostalgic actually.

If you remember liking one or two of these movies, get this set. My husband and I have been having random Rocky nights since we got this and it's been fun. Well worth the very reasonable cost.",1375833600,,813,4.342105263157895

2962504,5,B000W668R6,"The first and last movies are the best, but they are all great. It is especially gratifying to see how many movies Stallone made, given that the first one was panned by the critics. Each movie has very touching moments and end with the fight. When you watch one each evening, like my husband and I did, it is interesting to see how Stallone ages, yet still in great shape.",1375228800,2,372,4.328571428571428

2962516,3,B000W668R6,"Rocky 1, 2, 3 are not Blue Ray.  Well, each may have 5 min. of crystal clear Blue Ray, but 95% of these films are VHS transfers with all of the grainy annoying scenes.

Rocky 4, a newer film, has about 20% HD, and the rest is grain, grain, grain.

Rocky 5 is more HD -- and not Blue Ray -- but the grainy transfers remain.

Rocky Balboa, the most recent release, should have been 100% Blue Ray but is maybe 75% HD and not Blue Ray.

So, if you are expecting Blue Ray on this box set, forget it.

I returned them, but was unable to get an exchange because Amazon was out of stock. In order to repurchase I would have to pay $20 more than I originally do. Reasonably pissed off, I contacted Amazon through a chat. I must say they handled the situation gracefully. I was told that the conversation would be saved and when the dvds became available again through Amazon, I could repurchase them at the price I originally purchased them at, I would just need to purchase through an online chat. As far as I know, the dvds are now fixed. I received my boxed set, checked all of them and they work great. My only criticism is that how would other customers, who had the same problem as me, know that the situation could be easily resolved through an online chat. Also, if you know that customers are having issues with broken dvds, stop selling them! This is why I am giving this only 2 stars. This whole situation could have been avoided if they stopped knowingly selling a defective product.",1361577600,2,1156,4.5893719806763285

That said I'm very happy that I own this boxed set and that it's Blu Ray instead of regular DVD.  The bonus features are nice as well, I watched most of them.

The only thing I wish they could have done better is regarding the quality of the recordings - I was hoping that they worked some digital magic and increased the quality resolutions, etc - but they're not all that much better than a regular DVD in the long run.  I know they weren't filmed with HD cameras in the first place, but I've seen some great re-digitizing in the past and was hoping for the same here.

But my rating of 3 stars is strictly on this bluray transfer which i personally think is an insult to such a great franchise. The quality on these movies are terrible for being what it is, as far as the franchise on its own i give it 5 stars! Definitely worth the upgrade to bluray if your looking for slightly better quality but if you have just regular dvd's the difference is not overwhelming. Also the menu's in these movie are the cheapest ive seen for being bluray transfer's except number 6 (R.Balboa) which on every level was better including menu and special feature's and quality!!!",1358726400,,764,4.464285714285714

2962639,4,B000W668R6,"I'll admit. I never really thought that I'd ever invest in the Rocky series. I think I only saw Rocky IV in the theatre, and I thought that their entry of the home robot maid was just stupid as hell, so I dismissed the thought of ever looking into any of the other Rocky films.

But, Stallone is Rocky, just as he is Rambo.  So, since I always seem to scan various Blu-Ray releases of classic films here on Amazon, I saw the complete box set of all the Rocky films for just a penny less than twenty bucks, I mindlessly clicked ""yes"" to order it on the spot. Afterwards, I contacted a few of my friends and family to ask them if having all the Rocky films on Blu-Ray was a value at about twenty bucks. Everybody said Yes! And, then they all said that they would jump on the deal too.

But, the next day, everybody called or text me and said that this Rocky box set on Blu-ray was selling for 44 dollars on Amazon. Not $19.99. As I checked on Amazon, it was true. The price suddenly jumped to 44 dollars, the very next day.

I now have to show everybody my invoice to prove that I only got billed for $19.99 for my box set.  If Amazon waited just one more day before they raised the price to 44 dollars, I'm sure that they would have sold another three box sets that day.

So, lucky me, huh?",1358035200,,1289,4.095238095238095

I've seen worse transfers out there so I can't complain too much considering how old some of the movies are. Not to mention, even at $40 you are still getting 6 fantastic movies on Blu-ray which is a steal if you think about it.

What better time to revisit the Rocky saga? I purchased the new Blu Ray edition of the Rocky series to replace my sub par Rocky DVD box set and I can say with certainty, that it is well worth the upgrade especially at the low price of $19.99 for all 6 films and an exclusive bonus disc with over 3 hours of excellent material.

The films are a mixed bag, but all our entertaining and can inspire the underdog in you to get up off the couch and do something new to improve yourself and help those around you.

The original Rocky is the best of the bunch and is still a film that is poignant and inspirational. Great casting helps this film tremendously with character perfect performances by Stallone as the fighting underdog, Meredith's colorful crotchety manger, Shire the shy object of Rocky's affection, Young as the lovable but hurtful loser, Weathers as the smooth talkin' fighting champ and Spinell as the likable gangster.

The film hits all the right notes with a memorable score and does so much with its' meager budget, none of the other films have ever quite got it like the original. The Blu Ray transfer is very nice retaining grain but looking pretty sharp. It is the best this film has ever sounded or looked.

Rocky II is a solid film showing the aftermath of the first fight and Creed wanting redemption for Rocky going the distance in the first fight. It shows Rocky squandering the money he made for the first fight and also shows him if he wants to make something of himself, he must fight, because it is after all, what he does best! The Blu Ray transfer once again is a big upgrade with a sharp picture, grain is present, but I don't want to look at wax figures and the sound is a big upgrade as well.

Rocky III is my personal favorite of the sequels as it is filled with so many colorful characters. Rocky fights Hulk Hogan (Thunder Lips) in a charity match and meets his arch nemesis in Clubber Lang (played to perfection by Mr. T) Clubber is a brute much like Rocky in the original film, but without Rocky's heart. It is most unfortunate that they Kill off Mickey in this film, but it's a necessary plot point to allow Rocky to lose his first fight with Lang. Of course, it all comes out good in the end. The Blu Ray transfer is on point like the first two films with a much improved picture and sound.

Rocky IV is my least favorite of the sequels, it's not a bad film, but the soundtrack is dated, the Russians are presented like cardboard evil robots and the film is very short with a long training montage and of course the recap in the beginning of the film like each sequel before it. Being short is not a bad thing and the fight with Drago who makes an interesting opponent is one of the best in the series. It also opens the door for Rocky V  as the Russian robot and other brutal beatings by Creed and Lang leave the Rock with brain damage. Once again the Blu Ray transfer is a big improvement in picture and sound.

Rocky V....I know a lot of people didn't care for this one, but I know I always joked that they ought to make a Rocky film wear he is diagnosed with brain damage. I mean really this guy used his head as a punching bag in all of the fights in these films and no one could actually take that kind of abuse.

Rocky V introduces Tommy Gunn a young kid with a lot of power and determination, but once again none of Rocky's heart.

After Rocky loses his fortune after a blunder by Paulie giving the Balboa's lawyer power of attorney, the Rock ends up right back where he started.  On the street of Philly with the Gym that Mickey left him. Adrian gets her old job back at the pet shop. Rocky is informed after a medical examination that he can no longer box because of the severe beating he has taken over the years.

Enter Tommy Gunn, who wants Rocky to train him if he see any potential. Rocky is reluctant at first, but can't resist a chance of being part of the sport again. The usual stuff happens with Rocky bringing the inexperienced boxer to his own, but the public thinks it's all Rocky's doing and they give the youngster no respect or credit.

The Duke who is basically Don King is trying to lure Rocky back into the ring for personal gain and Adrian is dead set against it. So The Duke lures Gunn to the seedy side of the sport with a title shot, something Rocky doesn't want to give him until he feels he is ready.

The film ends in another battle for Rocky this time in the streets of Philadelphia master against student and well we all know ""The Rock"" is gonna win. The Blu Ray transfer is the biggest upgrade so far with a huge improvement in picture and sound over the DVD of this film.

Now we come to the finale, Rocky Balboa which I find to be the best of the sequels even though I enjoy Rocky III a little more, this film is a fitting end to the saga and captures much of the heart of the original. The Blu Ray Transfer is excellent both in picture and sound and the grand finale fight is well done. This disc has some interesting extras and is the only film to have extras on the film disc.

The bonus disc however is over 3 hours long with plenty to get excited about making of documentary and pretty cool game and much more.

Final thought, if you love the Rocky films, then this is the way to go, it has all you should ever need to revisit these films and being on sale for $19.99 it is a no brainer. I have read others reviews about the bad transfers, but I watched this on my 150 inch HD screen and I didn't notice any of the distractions that others claimed to have seen. Maybe they fixed the issues(?) as some of the reviews with complaints are old.

2962662,5,B000W668R6,"What can you say about a complete collection of Rocky films?  Add the fact they are on Blu-Ray?  Come on.

The quality of the Blu-Ray images is the best I've seen from movies which were shot on film and transferred to digital media.  When these movies were originally shot, the filmmakers never imagined people watching them on high definition, large screen televisions.  These films (Rocky I-IV) were filmed to be watched on movie screens.  A movie screen won't show things like film grain which is inherent in the film itself, but when you transfer that film to digital high def media, all the flaws become very obvious.  I guess you just have to look past it or avoid films shot in the 20th century which have very bright and very dark parts where the grain is most obvious.

The films themselves are well-reviewed and I'd venture to guess almost everyone who would consider buying this has seen most of them already so I'll only rate them as I like them.  Believe it or not, I like Rocky III best of all only because Mr. T is incredibly awesome and completely terrifying in his movie debut (I also liked him later in the underrated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/D-C-Cab/dp/B0006IIPJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">D.C. Cab</a>&nbsp;which, as of this writing, is not yet on Blu-Ray).  It turned out to be the beginning of a very colorful career for him.  My second favorite is Rocky II because of the opposite ending from Rocky I, which is my third favorite.  I put Rocky Balboa as fourth on the list only because it completely beat my expectations and turned out to be a good film.  Rocky IV is a fun but ridiculous and predictable piece of fluff (when the Russians start rooting for Rocky the film enters sci-fi realm).  I really didn't like Rocky V much at all, but it's nice to have it in the set.  I don't know, I guess maybe Stallone was just in a bad phase then; just trying to make something work to keep cashing in on Rocky.

I like Stallone.  I think he's an American original whose body of work is incredibly inconsistent but contains enough classics (a few are in this set) to vault him into legendary status.  I'm glad he's climbed back into the spotlight with the surprisingly enjoyable&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Expendables/dp/B008Y6WPXC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""The Expendables""</a>&nbsp;franchise.

Now, a lot of people complained of a grainy or blurred picture. I guess it is a little grainy if you look close for it but it's an old movie, you know? You're not gonna get a picture like say a movie that came out a year ago or something. I've seen the first 3 & I don't really see what the big deal was about all the complaints.

2962705,5,B000W668R6,"Although the Rocky series has been maligned for some of the later installments (mostly notably IV & V), but the first three films are as good as film trilogies get.  The original Rocky was a huge underdog hit, garnering the 1976 Oscar for best picture and catapulting unknown Sylvester Stallone into a star.  While he would descend into cartoonish performances later in his career, he is superb as the ham & egger boxer Rocky Balboa who overcomes all odds and goes the distance with the champ, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) losing on a split decision.  Rocky II & III find Rocky winning then losing the championship and fighting to regain glory and the title.  Rocky IV & V are both low marks in the series, especially V which is borderline ridiculous.  Rocky Balboa is a nice way to close out the series (unless Mr. Stallone decides to revive the series) with some fine acting, but a fairly unbelievable scenario of Rocky at the almost 60 years old fights the current champ and again goes the distance losing on a split decision.  The pictures on the blu ray editions are really good, adding a crispness and vibrancy to the older films.",1347408000,,1136,4.655

Sometimes in Rocky II you lose the french speaking for a written translation at the bottom of the screen.  After 10 or 15 seconds or so, it come back to normal(french speaking).

And, if you've seen them, you know that it would be impossible to review all five of them in one single review and do them justice.  And I'm going to assume that if you are looking to buy this set, you either love the movies, or they were part of your childhood memories and you don't need me to tell you about the movies themselves...  Instead, I'm just reviewing the quality of the transfers, the sound, and the extras, and I'm going to keep it short and sweet:

The movies have never looked better.  I remember seeing them in the movie theater as a kid.  Grainy, dust and scratches on the film.  You know, the way movies were before the digital projectors we are all used to now.  No, these aren't as crisp and bright as movies today, but they preserve the graininess of the original film.

The sound is great.

The extras are interesting.

Definitely worth the price to have the entire Rocky saga on your shelf in such pristine condition.",1344556800,5,1029,4.420212765957447

The Rocky story is just beautiful. I love the emotion, the action, the pain, the triumph, and the love. I think these movies are a must to watch because they will inspire you to be a better man and a better American. I always get a little watery eyed when I hear The Measure of Man and I think of all the final scenes when Rocky has won his fight and Adrian is in his arms and the American flag is draped around him and his face is so bruised. It just gets me right there. I think it's the triumph over pain and fear that is the most beautiful, there's no feeling like it in the world. I love the scenes with the stairs too. The patriotism and pureness of the films is very obvious. The other element that I love in these movies is the relationship between Rocky and Adrian. I love how he pulls her out and loves her for all she is. I love how he says ""You're never getting rid of me."" I think we need more positive marital messages in today's entertainment like this. I was heartbroken in the final movie when Adrian is dead. It makes the series very powerful but I miss her character very much. I can't help but feel the pain that Rocky does. My prayers go out for Sylvester now with the death of his son. Seeing young Sage in the movie must be so difficult for him. His real life loss must be horrible. But Sylvester is a great guy and I know that he believes and lives by his movies. He will overcome the loss. Yo Adrian, I did it!!!!!!!!",1344384000,5,1611,4.069182389937107
2962710,5,B000W668R6,"This review will be short and to the point.

The first movie is Rocky, an undisputed classic. Nuff said.
The second movie (Rocky 2) is also very good, not a classic... but still very good.
The third movies (Rocky 3... detecting a pattern here) has Mr. T in it. You'll like or hate the movie based on your opinion of him. I thought he handled the part very well.
The fourth movie (Rocky... you get what I'm saying)... Russians. Just Russians. A good message trying to be broadcast. It falls short in the hands of Rocky though.
Wait... THERE WAS A FIFTH MOVIE?!?!?
The sixth movie (Rocky Balboa) is a look back at the first five basically. I found it to be full of heart and a fitting send off for a beloved character.

The transfers from film to Blu Ray are awesome and the Special Features on disc 7 are really informative. If you love Rocky, it's a fitting set all around. :D",1343001600,,876,4.335365853658536

The video quality of the first five Rocky movies is not very good.  Some of the worst grain I have seen on Blu-Ray.  The 6th movie, Rocky Balboa, had better video quality (not great, but good), but instead of having DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio like the first 5 movies, it only had Dobly Digital 5.1.

ROCKY: THE UNDISPUTED COLLECTION on Blu-ray... Just a bad joke.

When I buy a Blu-ray, of an old or new movie, I expect to see Blu-ray video quality... Restored, Remasterized, or maybe a well donde / good video transfer... But this is not the case.

I know, they are an old movies, but I have older movies than this one with much better look.

The video quality on this movies are so much grainy... Worst than an old dvd... There are not restored, there are not remasterized... Rocky, the undisputed collection is about how to make an awful work, just to sell and play with memories.

I don`t return this item because I don`t live on USA, and return cost is higher than the product`s itself.

If you enjoyed the Rocky movies bad enough to want to own the complete set than look no further than this box set. Okay we could probably all do without the Rocky 5 movie which I felt was the one sadly pathetic movie in the series. I do like 1-4 and 6 a.k.a. Rocky Balboa was kind of a cool modern twist even though in reality I think the old Italian Stallion would've been turned into Italian Sausage fighting such a younger current champ. Had they messed up anything of my memories of the Rocky movies I'd say so but they didn't and I'm very happy I never previously purchased any Rocky movies until now.

Upon viewing Rocky II, the disc seemed to be corrupted. During the beginning of round 2 of the final fight between Rocky and Apollo, the disc stops and the movie becomes distorted where the movie stopped. I cleaned the disc and the player, but it stops at the same spot at approximately an hour and 45 minutes in to the movie. There is no scratch on the disc.

Regarding the movies themselves, I'd seen clips here and there of Rocky growing up, but I've never seen all of them in their entirety. These films were excellent. The characters were so rich and textured. Their interactions were so real, so complex and dynamic while grounded and sincere. Adrian is adorable in the first movie.

There are some long reviews that I gone through here - many are good writeups. But at the end of the day, I pretty much decided on two simple factors: 1) Overall it will be better than before with newest movie getting the maximum resolution, and earlier film get best restored content, and 2) I'm a huge Rocky fan and I will collect it in latest format.

2962755,5,B000W668R6,"The odds were equally stacked against Sylvester Stallone as they were against his creation, the fictional southpaw boxer Rocky Balboa - a million to one shot. Languishing in obscurity as an extra in small films, Stallone managed to sell his script, about a Philadelphia club fighter who gets a shot at the World Heavyweight Championship, and an American cinematic icon was born. Spanning six films, the Rocky series stands as one of the most lucrative franchises in Hollywood history and has truly penetrated the cultural lexicon.

In Rocky, washed-up Philly boxer Rocky Balboa is granted the chance of a lifetime. Hand-picked by boxing champ Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) as his next opponent, Rocky Balboa (Stallone) must find the physical strength under the tutelage of scrappy trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) and the courage to go the distance and prove that he's ""not just another bum from the streets."" But even if he doesn't win, at least he will find love and self respect in the arms of Adrian (Talia Shire). Rocky won the 1978 Oscar for Best Picture, made the name ""Adrian"" an annoyance to anyone bearing the name, and inspired countless people to run up staircases and throw their fists in the air triumphantly.

In Rocky II, The Italian Stallion tries to start a family and a new life away from the boxing ring. Despite partial blindness in his right eye sustained from his first bout with Creed and a wife clinging to life, Rocky is lured back to the ring for a rematch that will literally come down to the last second.

Rocky III takes the series in a slightly more surrealistic directon. Rocky's partial blindness is never addressed again for the rest of the franchise, and Rocky's opponents become more like caricatures, in the form of flamboyant wrestler Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan) and grimacing, mohawked brawler Clubber Lang (Mr. T). Life as the world champion has made Rocky complacent after a string of easy fights. But after being soundly beaten by Lang, Rocky finds an unlikely ally in former foe Apollo Creed, who trains Balboa in his own style so he may regain the ""eye of the tiger"" and reclaim the championship from Lang.

Rocky IV veers directly into the realm of 80's anti-Communist propaganda absurdity and MTV slickness, as Rocky finds himself taking on roided-up Russian superfighter Ivan Drago, who possesses a 1800 PSI punch - harder than actual gunshots! Synth-accompanied training montages abound as Rocky mourns Apollo's death at Drago's hands and heads up to snowy Siberia in order to prepare for the fiercest fight of his life.

In the aftermath of Rocky IV, Rocky finds himself brain-damaged and inexplicably broke in Rocky V. Seems that Rocky's brother-in-law, Paulie (Burt Young), signed away power of attorney over the Balboa fortune to some shady lawyer who loses all the money. Forced into retirement by his scrambled noggin, a much more punch-drunk Rocky sells off his remaining belongings and moves his family back into his old Philadelphia neighborhood. Rocky reopens Mickey's boxing gym and takes a young fighter, Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison) under his wing. Tommy quickly rises up the boxing ranks, but betrays Rocky by signing with Don King-esque promoter George Washington Duke (Richard Gant) in order to get a title shot. Gunn wins the title easily, but fears forever living in Rocky's shadow. He calls out Balboa, culminating in a bizarre fist fight between teacher and student on the cold Philly streets. Rocky emerges the victor, yet somehow avoids being arrested while Gunn gets taken away by the cops. Stallone's desire to return the character to its roots after the increasingly cartoonish direction the series was taking is understandable, but having Rocky lose the fortune he fought so hard for and earned over the course of four films is just depressing, let alone the ""shady lawyer"" angle seemed highly contrived. Rocky V remains the most confusing, misconceived installment in the franchise, and left a bad taste in everyone's mouths, including Stallone's.

Stallone sought to make up for Rocky V with Rocky Balboa, which finds an aged Rocky (Stallone himself was 60) the owner of a a Philly restaurant where he indulges its patrons with stories of his glory days in the ring. Looks like the Italian Stallion has found an opponent even he can't defeat - time (though his brain damage is forgotten, much like his partial blindness). Adrian has since died of ""woman's cancer"" and Rocky Jr. (Milo Ventimiglia) is now an emotionally distant businessman. After a simulated boxing match on ESPN finds Rocky the victor over current heavyweight champ, the absurdly named Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (Antonio Tarver), Dixon challenges the long-retired Balboa to an exhibition match. Balboa, longing for one more throwdown, accepts the invitation and sets out to prove that the last thing to age is your heart. Though Rocky Balboa (the film) prescribes to the Rocky formula established from the very beginning and the prospect of a sextagenarian - with or without brain damage - being allowed to take on anyone in a sanctioned boxing match is more than a tad outlandish, this final installment (which Stallone assures us is the FINAL one) feels the most genuine since the original, as Stallone imbues his most iconic character with his own frustration with growing old and that lingering desire to make good on past regrets (like Rocky V) while he still can. With Rocky Balboa, the story finally feels whole.

But someone took the time to really enhance the appearance of all six of these movies. The special features are very interesting, ranging from trailers, to documentaries, to even games. As far as the films themselves, of course they're great. Rocky 1,2, and 6 are really well made and are surprisingly grounded in a great story.  3 and 4, while cheesy, are always just fun to watch.  No comment on 5. Even Stallone gave it a 0.  But 5 out of 6 ain't too bad. It's well worth the money just to hear Clubber Lang's prediction for the fight: Paaaaiiinn!",1286323200,5,650,4.4

2962760,4,B000W668R6,"By now everybody knows the inspirational underdog story of Rocky Balboa.  You'd have to have a heart made of stone not to feel for the wonderful character played perfectly by Sylvester Stallone.  And while the overall quality of these six films may vary, the heart and character does not.

This blu ray release is very good but with a few caveats.  First off, the original needs (and deserves) a restoration along with a more beefy extras package.  Some extras from the DVD didn't make it (inexcusable really), while Rocky 2-5 deserve a little more love too.  I wouldn't expect full restorations, but surely an audio commentary for each isn't too much to ask.

2962761,4,B000W668R6,"Received this box set around 9/15/2010.
This review is broken into 5 categories: Packaging, Plot, Disc Quality, Movie Quality, Extra Features

Packaging: 4/5
Box art looks like it's from Rocky Balboa, no frills, WYSIWYG.

Plot: N/A
I won't go into it because I'm assuming you've seen any number of these titles if you are interested in the box set. But overall it's a story of overcoming obstacles and believing in yourself. All family friendly except Rocky 5 has some slight language, but nothing to extreme.

Disc Quality: 3/5
Rocky and Rocky Balboa have professional looking menus and the disc themselves look different than the other four movies. 2,3,4,5 all look like standard blu ray discs with just the name of the movie on them and a still frame for a menu. Don't expect any commentary.

Movie Quality: 4/5
If you've seen older movies put on blu ray with minimal restore then you get the idea with these. Rocky 1 looks the worse, some clipping and sometimes grainy, didn't notice too much blur on 120Hz. Rocky 2 is a little better, not as grainy. Rocky 3 looks like most 80s blu ray movies I've seen (Rambo, Commando, etc.) with some blur. Rocky 4 is exceptional, looks clear, great color and great sound and no blur. Rocky 5 is also clear and the sound is clear as well but you don't know much of a difference, if any, between this movie and 4. Rocky Balboa has some weird lighting but overall obviously it's the best looking one in the bunch.

Extra Features: 2/5
Some nice Sly training videos for Balboa and some making of's but nothing like a reunion episode or documentary looking back with Sly or anything. Pretty much just thrown into the box set.

Overall, I give this a 4/5 simply because it's Rocky and it's the top of the line right now. If you have it on DVD and is it worth it to rebuy it? My opinion would be no because nothing on these discs looks better than up converting a DVD. That being said, it is the latest and greatest format to have Rocky on and if you see Amazon selling it for a good deal pick it up, especially if you don't own any Rocky collection.",1285200000,15,2085,4.473684210526316

I grew up on these Rocky movies and actually my favorite movie is Rocky III with all the characters still alive and kicking!  They did begin dying off at this point though!  Rocky V is my least favorite, it was too much of a downer for me I guess!  Stallone actually wanted to kill off his character when he wrote this one but the studio wouldn't let him!  Good thing though or else there wouldn't have been Rocky Balboa and we wouldn't have learned that Adrian had died leaving just Rocky, his son and Paulie of the originals!

Rocky Balboa looked awesome!!! The Transfer was really solid especially when he was in the ring with Mason Dixon. Finally, the packaging fox gives you is really crappy.

I have the DVD boxed set as well as the cable HD broadcast, and now I have the Bluray box set.  Let me start by saying I haven't watched all the movies in the BD set, just the first one.  It is by far the worse picture quality of any versions I currently have.  Even the aspect ratio isn't the same as the theatrical release.  Seeing that the first movie is by far the best, and an academy award winning movie- I would have expected it to have gotten the royal treatment and to look the best.  Even if the rest in the set look great, this is a major disappointment, at least to me.

I know some have said in their review that the PQ wasn't that bad so I don't know, maybe there were bad discs released but I doubt it.  Mine have so much grain and noise I took the disc to another player to make sure something hadn't gone wrong with my bedroom BD player.  It was just as bad.  Actually it looked worse.  In the bedroom I have a 32"" HDTV and downstairs I have a 55"" HDTV and a 106"" projector system.  The bigger you go the worse it looks because all that awfulness gets blown up bigger.  I'd never watch this on my projector yet this is one of my favorite movies and exactly the type of content I use the projector for.

I know this sounds pretty negative but the picture quality really is that bad, at least for my set.  I know the price was great, but if you are expecting Bluray picture quality you will be very disappointed.  This is a bad value at half the price...",1267574400,20,1588,4.022364217252396

The movies themselves look terrific (but could look a bit better not to mention use some Stallone commentary on each film outside of 1&6 which is why this gets 4 stars and not 5) and probably won't look better. Sound is solid and the special features are alright (nice retrospective on the villains tho but where is Mr. T?) so outside of what I listed its a pretty good set.

As for the films lets break it down.

Rocky - The first and a film that continues to be the legend. The little engine that could movie. Amazing film a total classic.

Rocky 2 - Worthy sequel to a classic film. Its still small and intimate as you go through Rocky's struggle. Props for showing Rocky learning to read.

Rocky 3 - So you enjoyed being at the top of the world what happens when you aren't and lose your manager/trainer? Awesome villain, awesome training sequences and still Carl Weathers is the truth as Apollo "" Man when we fought you had that eye of the tiger that edge and we got to get it back! "". Whats stunning is to watch Rocky change his fighting style from hard hitting Southpaw tomato can to right handed speedster.

Rocky 4 - Watched this nostaligic, cinematic gem recently and it still holds up as a goofy, heartfelt cartoon. The film is so damn entertaining and when the "" Theres no easy way out "" montage ends if it doesn't get you a little misty nothing will. Nothing beats the training montages in the Rocky films (man I can't believe those situps Rocky was doing off the second tier in the barn) but here the cinematography in Russia is breathtakingly beautiful.

Plus it's just plain fun to watch... no plot to follow, just kick ass montages and geektastic lines.

It was like in 1-3 they were trying to make great movies, make them respectable and realistic... then when they got to 4 it was like ""aw screw it, let's just make a God damn music video, that's all these films have become any way."" They didn't try to make the movie anything but what it really was, and that's why 4 is so great.

Rocky 5 - The worst Rocky film hands down and a total turd. Its dumb its boring and its ultimately pointless. Stallone originally wrote that Rocky died at the end of brain damage. The studio says no which leads to Rocky Balboa.

Rocky Balboa aka Rocky 6 - A return to form but still not a pox on the first 4 films. Antonio Tarver is not scary, interesting or a good actor on camera thats pretty much a three strikes and you're out. Luckily Stallone knows how to make a film and stage a fight. Its worthy and good but its not very entertaining, fun or rewatchable. Watch Rocky 1, 2, 3 or 4 to experience the real Rocky.

So great blu ray set that almost is 5 stars. Why no commentaries for 2, 3, 4 or 5 Sylvester?",1264982400,3,2808,4.291115311909262
2962786,4,B000W668R6,"Finally, the Rocky set has made it to blu ray.  I have been a fan of Sylvester Stallone since I was a kid.(I am now 39.) I already have the complete Rambo collection on blu ray and it is great to finally have the Rockys.
  The quallity of each movies are much better than the previous dvds.  The sound is superb. I have a 76 inch flatscreen tv and surround sound and I'll tell you the quallity of the blu rays make me feel like I'm watching all of them in the theater again. Awesome! If you have a blu ray player, buy these. Much better than dvd.
  If I was to complain about any one thing it would be this- Where are the Director's cut of each one? That is why it is getting 4 stars out of 5. The movies themselves and the blu rays are 5 stars.

  Thank you Amazon for very fast delivery. 5 stars",1264204800,58,797,3.9622641509433962

everybody knows the story and it is funny when you see the movie 200 times and you don't get bored and throw it to the garbage.
the great thing about the movies are the challenge of face our own demons to conquer all we want to conquer.

I got a really great deal too, and highly recommend to people who haven't seen rocky, for anyone wanting to upgrade to blu-ray. Blu-ray experience knocks it out of the ring, TKO! Best visual experience you can ever have.",1263513600,4,480,4.593023255813954
2962790,1,B000W668R6,"With all the whining about preorder pricing in the reviews, there isn't enough attention being paid to the fact that this is one of the worst blu ray transfers to date. Obviously Rocky isn't going to fare well compared to UP! or Transformers, but it looks bad compared to the blu ray versions of most older movies as well. In general, even if an older movie isn't going to blow you away, it can at least pull off a crisp, clean picture that looks noticeably better than an upscaled DVD. This is where the Rocky Blu Ray collection fails miserably.

In the early movies, probably 3/4 of the scenes are incredibly soft and look no better than an upscaled DVD. The other 1/4 of the scenes are up to the mediocre standard of the typical older movie and do look better than DVD. If the entire films were up to that mediocre standard I could give a good review, but sadly they aren't. My complaints aren't even about things like film grain, which is a perfectly acceptable stylistic choice. There's just a tremendous lack of detail and definition, and uneven picture quality throughout. One dark scene will look acceptable, then the next will be incredibly washed out with regions that are supposed to be black showing up as light gray. In Rocky 2 there are even odd white dot artifacts that are incredibly distracting and weren't in the DVD if I remember correctly.

The later films do look better...Rocky Balboa is obviously fine since it was an independent blu ray release. But most of the Rocky movies that are available exclusively in this set look absolutely atrocious. If you already have the DVD set, stick with that and just buy Rocky Balboa on Blu Ray.

fyi: I have a highly calibrated Pioneer Elite plasma and 120 blu rays. The only other ones I have that look close to this bad are Robocop and The Fugitive.",1263340800,36,1812,4.569230769230769

They represent a huge improvement in picture quality over the previous DVD releases.  I was wary about purchasing this set because of some of the negative reviews, but I'm glad that I did.  I recommend this set to any Rocky fan.  These films have never looked better.",1261699200,3,366,4.65625
2962792,4,B000W668R6,"Ok, I watched this set I borrowed from a friend and the picture isn't as bad as everyone says it is.  Somewhere someone said they felt like they were watching a VHS tape...give me a break!  While they obviously could have done a better job cleaning these up, they are for sure better than the DVD versions.  But it's still a decent transfer...I'm sure there they will eventually be completely remastered.

As for those of you complaining about the price droppings...have you noticed the significant drop overall in blu-ray pricing?  Now the blu-ray is becoming more mainstream, the prices are coming down!  If there are no advantages to pre-ordering, then don't get it!  Everyone has had a situation where they paid for something and later saw it cheaper and lost a few bucks.  Amazon is still cheaper than going out to Best Buy or Wal-mart and getting it.  Factor in that the majority of Amazon users don't have to pay tax and can have the items shipped to you for FREE, then that is even more in savings.  So again, if you don't like it, don't buy it!",1260316800,159,1053,4.553191489361702
2962793,5,B000W668R6,"These people complaining about the price being wrong or whatever dumb idiot nonsense they are rambling about has absolutely NOTHING to do with Rocky on Blu-Ray. They need to be removed ASAP. This is great i have always loved the rocky movies probably because of some of my own insecurities in my life and its the only underdog movie that i enjoy. I've never  been a fan of the comeback, we can do it, football, or Finding Forester, Rudy type movies, but Stallone has always managed to make you feel what he's going through in all off the movies, even if some of them are a little forced and something you've seen in the others. The quality is great, i mean its not like todays filmed in 1080p films like Transformers, or computer animated stuff like today. But who cares its just rocky:) The copies i had which i copied from DVDs from the local video store don't really stand the test of time, and this is an excellent way to preserve them for the future. This along with other classic films deserve to be restored to the best technology has to offer. Heres a list of the Rockys as i like them. And some others i can't wait to see on blu ray.

Rocky III-I was 1 when the first came out, so this is the first one i was exposed to with ""Pity the Fool"" Mr T. Man he should have gotten an oscar!! lol
Rocky I- Of course it started it all, i just never really saw it much when i was younger.
Rocky V- For some reason i really liked this one, because he went back old school, and actually DID street fighting, great scenes in the end, i had saw the others already but got really pumped with this one(odd i know).
Rocky IV- Good, low budget compared to the others, Russian, Dulph Lungdren was a bit enhh so so. Good songs in it though.
Rocky II- for some reason i couldn't get myself to highly enjoy this one till the end, to much of Rocky being down, and doing commercials, but very classic acting by the legendary Burgess Meredith(RIP).
Rocky Balboa- Kudos to Stallone who was more ripped at 61 in this movie than he's ever been in his life, was great but waiting nearly 17 years i thought was a bit of a mistake, still touching though, in that Rocky sort of fashion HA.

More titles to look forward to on blu ray

1. Jurassic Parks-GRRR Hurry up Steven
2. Indiana Jones-Again HURRY UP STEVEN!!
3. Aliens-Hurry up James Cameron, Ridley Scott, David Fincher and whoever made the other one.
4. War Of The Worlds-Should have been hear already.
5. The Abyss- Strange but i loved this one.
6. Star Wars-Coughs George(old ones i could care less about the new ones)
7. The Core- Most hated it, i dug it, corny but some cool effects.
8. Lord Of the Rings- I""M NOT SETTLING FOR THE THEATRICAL RELEASE IN DECEMBER!! I'll wait.
9. Yep i sure did forget..oops...Back to the Future Trilogy--Come on Robert Zemekis and Stephen!
10. Also i love the two Grudge movies, i have the first, second hasn't come out yet, steet clear of 3!
11. Also the Ring, even the second one isn't half bad.

Not gonna sit and rack my brain, but there are others, so back to Rocky, if your a fan, and you want these classics on Blu Ray with a great quality picture an sound, and lots of bonus features, pick it up.

BTW-Amazon people, go to your local wal mart unless you live in a cave and pick it up for just 54 bucks plus tax. I rarely order anything, and you should probably guess if it says 49.99 on here and its cheaper than wally world that its a mistake, be more careful next time.

2962794,3,B000W668R6,I used to order ALL of my titles from Amazon. Used to. I have been just picking them up at Walmart for the same price or even a little cheaper. Since Amazon likes to screw the customers that PRE ORDER what is the point? The last few months they sell their new titles a few dollars more to the PRE ORDER folks then drop the price a day later to new orders. Fool me once or twice... I guess I don't need to be a PRIME MEMBER anymore either!,1258070400,6,438,3.932584269662921

2962796,4,B000W668R6,"Just wanted to let everyone know i purchased Transformers 2 pre-release and it went down 6 dollars at release date. As you can imagine i was pretty ticked however Amazon DID in fact automatically refund the difference. It is a crappy practice though. Pre-orders should get it cheaper than release date price since you are handing over money for something you may not get for a few weeks.

As for my movie review i don't have one. Just wanted to let people know Amazon does refund the difference.",1257811200,2,495,4.625
2962797,1,B000W668R6,"I've read a remark by another Amazon customer (Regina A. Walter ""chingbong"") and I have to say I am in total agreement with her.

I am a prime member and have been for 2 years now.  I have pre-ordered many blu-ray titles months early (in some cases) and I am more than a little ticked off to find the same title cheaper the day of release or the day after.  What this is telling me is NOT to pre-order from Amazon because in doing so, you are guaranteed the HIGHEST price.  It is seemingly much better to pre-order elsewhere (shop around for the very best price) and then cancel if Amazon lowers the price on or after release day.  Even better would be to return EVERY blu-ray to Amazon where you have paid more for it and then re-order it at the lower price.

This may seem like a minor quibble, but if you buy a lot of movies this process of paying a higher price for the same item can be expensive and in this economy, why throw money away?

It used to be that Amazon would refund the difference within 30 days from purchase if the title went down in price.  Amazon stopped doing that last year.  At first I thought what's a couple of dollars to me ... but when you add up a couple dollars times 20/30/40 titles, that gets expensive.

So yes I ordered Rocky at $49.99 today.  A deal for me but not for others.  Fair?  IMO, NO.",1257724800,11,1329,4.18503937007874
2962798,1,B000W668R6,"Do NOT EVER EVER order early from Amazon.com.  You are foolish if you do.  In most cases, Amazon will lower the price just days following the release of the item.  Those who have previously ordered at a higher price are shafted.  This item is a perfect example.  They first listed it at $ 64.99 and then it lowered to $ 52.99.  Now it is $ 49.99.  All those people who ordered at the higher prices, do not get the lower price, even though they probably still have not yet received the item.  Most would agree that this is dishonest.  To put a stop to this, we should all agree that when this happens we return the items that Amazon overcharged us for.  Maybe then Amazon would stop these games.

I personally enjoyed 5 out of the 6 Rocky movies, for me that is enough of a percentage to get this boxset. Can you guess which one I don't like? Sorry, but i'm not going to surprise you here. I think Rocky 5 is the worst in the series, however I overlooked the fact that it came in this boxset as I really enjoy the other 5.

Rocky is a classic, undoubtedly. Rocky 2 was a good a sequel as one could hope for considering, i mean how do you follow up a classic. Rocky 3 was an enjoyable romp with a truly memorable bad guy. Rocky 4 is a guilty pleasure which has some enjoyable moments. Rocky 5, the least said about this one the better. Finally Rocky Balboa (number 6) is a great finish to the series, although Stallone does look quite old the acting and boxing is quite believable.

 All-in-all a good boxset with only 1 of the 6 movies a down point other wise it is worth owning. Not quite a 5 star because Rocky 5 is so poor and Rocky 4 is only a 3 out of 5 star movie.

It also works as a love story between two people who basically are misfits finding each other and falling in love. The only complaint I have about it is that it is too basic a story and the characters have been seen in movies like this before. The main thing that saves it is the fact that even though Rocky doesn't win the big fight at the end, he still comes off as a winner at the end.

Although I saw it on HBO, I wondered if the other two were going to be on as well.  So, I waited for years and years until 1996, when I saw the whole set up to Rocky V.  After purchasing the set, I set up a week to be officially known as Rocky Week and started with Rocky.  As I continued to watch them, I understood why it was known as best picture thirty years ago and the more that I watched, the better I like the story.  The second Rocky was even better then the first and then, came Rocky III.  However, Rocky IV was too brutal but, it did show that even boxing can be dangerous and it is even possible that someone could die during the match as Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) did.  Then, I finished Rocky Week with Rocky V.  For the next several years, I wondered if there will ever be another Rocky and then came Rocky Balboa.  The sixth and final movie of the saga.  I loved the end when the people of Philadelphia were climbing up the Rocky steps and imitating Rocky.  Maybe someday, I can do it too.  Rocky, I Love You!",1219881600,,1136,4.090497737556561

2962837,4,B000W668R6,"Being a relative newcomer to the Rocky movies, I felt like I needed to get this set so I could own all of the movies on DVD. More or less, I AM pleased with it. I already owned the Collector's Edition of Rocky I but considering that I didn't have the rest of this great Saga, why not?

There are no special features (unless trailers count and in my book, they don't) on Rockys 1-5. Rocky Balboa comes with a pretty decent amount of special material to dig into though. All of the films come in slim cases and the set box itself looks pretty nifty on your DVD shelf.

Finally, there are the movies themselves and, depending on one's point of view, vary in quality. In this reviewers personal opinion, Rockys 1-3 are fine movies in their own rights while 4-5 are the obvious sour spots and Balboa ends the Saga on a high emotional note.

Whether you are a fan of good boxing movies or Sylvester Stallone in general then this set WILL please you if you're not big on special features. But if you wanted one of the best film sagas ever made in a set packed full of special features all over the place...keep waiting for MGM to release a more proper collector's set in the future (hopefully).

I actually looked forward to a final, definitive DVD set of the films. But after buying the first two sets (the original ""red box"" set with the 25th Anniversary Rocky DVD, and the more recent ""remastered"" box set with the newer transfers), I don't think I want to jump on this again. Considering that the only extras are TRAILERS for TWO of the films (the first one and Rocky V), this is an enormous disappointment - especially considering that there was a very well done Rocky Special Edition released last year, along with a reasonably well done Rocky Balboa disc from earlier this year.

There has to be some stuff out there that they could put on discs for ALL of these films. The script for Rocky IV, for instance, was much different than what you got in the final film - even if stuff was not filmed, couldn't they give us the scripts for these films in text form as a DVD-ROM feature? There have to be at least a few deleted scenes out there for some of these films as well - someone already mentioned the original Rocky V cut, and some of the material there was pretty fascinating. Come on! Commentaries, trailers, ANYTHING. This bare-bones release is really kind of pathetic.

I guess maybe they're saving a loaded box set for an HD format (likely just Blu-Ray in this case unless an HD DVD studio has international distribution rights over the Rocky films). And then we get to pay for it again.

From The Digital Bits news today: ""In other release news, MGM has just set a Rocky: The Complete Saga DVD box set for release on 12/4 (SRP $59.98). The set will include Rocky, Rocky II, Rocky III, Rocky IV, Rocky V and yes... the recent Rocky Balboa. Unfortunately, according to the studio's press release, the only extras on the set are a pair of trailers (one for Rocky and one for Rocky V). Yo, Adrian! Where's the beef?""  If that is true--and it probably is since The Digital Bits is the most reliable site for DVD news--why bother releasing this set?

Here's the DVD history of Rocky:  MGM originally released individual standard DVDs of the Rocky movies many years ago as the DVD format became more popular.  The DVDs were, to put it charitably, poorly produced.  Subsequently, MGM released a Rocky I-V box set back in 2001 to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of Rocky.  Although the packaging was nice, there wasn't much improvement to the DVDs themselves as far as audio and video transfers; the most significant detail of the set was the addition of interviews and other special features to the first Rocky disc.  A few years later, the set was re-released with different packaging, with some improved audio and video transfers on some of the movies (Rocky V was notably left untouched).  And last year, to coincide with the release of Rocky Balboa, the set was re-released again, this time with the cheap, thin DVD cases now being used in tv season DVD packages as the only difference from the previous release.  Inexplicably, rather than being included in the re-re-released box set, the first Rocky movie was also separately re-released on DVD in a 2 disc 30th Anniversary special edition (Well, I guess greed would explain it...).  So, if you bought any of the box sets, you still had to purchase the 30th Anniversary edition of Rocky to be a true completist.

With Rocky Balboa having been available on DVD for over six months, MGM has now chosen to release the complete set of films in a new box set.  But what a missed opportunity this represents to include special features which have been omitted from previous releases.  I do not know if there are cut scenes from Rocky IV in the MGM vaults, but I know for a fact that there is massive material for Rocky V, as a bootleg ""uncut"" version of the film has been circulating online for years.  Also, why not finally upgrade the video transfer of Rocky V?  Perhaps the most egregious omission will be special features for Rocky Balboa.  Listening to Stallone's commentary on the DVD, he repeatedly refers to a ""director's cut"" which he would like to release at some point.  This would have been the perfect time.",1192492800,91,2943,4.623076923076923

The first installment, which shot Sylvester Stallone to stardom in 1976, is the best in my opinion. Sly, as inexperienced as he was back then as writer and actor, did an amazing job - the film is compelling, entertaining and moving. Great character and relationship development. Rocky and Adrian's romance is very, very special and their first love scene - pure and tender, is simply unforgettable.

If you love Rocky as much as I do, you will like the next installments, even Rocky 5, which Stallone himself awarded with rating of a grand total Zero! I think, he is being too harsh!

I'm going to try and find a single episode IV and, if it works, use it to replace the episode IV in this collection.  Hope I don't have to do the same thing for episodes V and VI.  The lesson here is to play the collection (especially episode IV) soon after you get it so you will be able to return it if necessary.

3196228,4,B000W668R6,"I bought this as a gift to my boyfriend because he's a huge fan of Rocky.
He couldn't believe I had never seen it, but now I've seen them a few times and can even quote it! Great films, very inspirational.

As for the actual product, decent packaging There is one case that holds all of the discs and a little plastic box that holds the case with the picture of Rocky on the front. I have it on my movie shelf and love when people notice it. Very good price for the full set.

I've had issues with a couple of the discs not being read by my PS3. I just eject them and reinsert them a couple times and then it plays. This doesn't always happen and it's not with all of the discs, just 2 of them. They all have great picture quality in my opinion, and the noise during the first Rocky isn't loud enough to distract me. I hardly noticed it.

All in all, I'm happy with my purchase and glad to have added this to my collection.",1470787200,4,923,4.032786885245901

I've never been a fan of this kind of movie.  I looked up the movies and all of them were pretty expensive in previous box sets. Then this Blu Ray only set got released and it was a wonderful low price. So I got it, and enjoyed the movies.

3196236,5,B000W668R6,"What a beautiful set to salute Rocky Balboa and to the actor Sylvester Stallone who brought it to life.  Of course, the rest of the cast Talia Shire, Burgess Meredith and Burt Young complete the family.  Also, Carl Weathers and his entourage add life to the film too.  It is a great set, handsomely packaged and the viewing is a pleasure.  It brought back memories of the first time I saw Rocky and brings the viewer to the conclusion with the same verve it had from the beginning.  Great set to have a marathon over a weekend as the fight scenes are very realistic and it would be too much to watch all at once.  I am glad Stallone wrapped up the saga as so many are not and to the satisfaction of most fans.  Great acting, great script and a great movie experience.  Not all the discs have the verve like Rocky I, II, III but it is worth the watch.up to the conclusion of the saga.  A great marathon viewing on a Saturday afternoon, and maybe Sunday and Monday, too.",1469750400,5,968,4.274725274725275

3196257,5,B000W668R6,"All of the movies are classics, so there's really no need to comment on the story, but I'll cover the video/audio quality as well as what comes in the package. Aside from the blurays and the character cards,  there's a code that comes with them for a short featurette on the making of Creed (another phenomenal movie), but that's it. The code expires at the end of this year, and it doesn't offer any way to download it, so there's not much value to it, but I suppose it was a nice bonus.

The character cards are all very high quality, printed on glossy paper and could make for a very interesting framed picture for a man-cave-esque sort of room, if one was so inclined. Admittedly I've done nothing with mine, but considering that there's really no other way to get them, it's nice to know that I have them if I ever want to do something like that.

The video/audio quality on the blu-rays themselves are good, certainly better than their original copies, but it mostly seems like they just scaled up the picture and left the audio uncompressed. The color accuracy is a bit better than I would expect on a DVD copy, but it's not anything to write home about. The exception to this is Rocky Balboa, which was filmed digitally on high quality cameras where the first five were filmed on somewhat lower quality film (at least the first few, but all of them are somewhat grainy).

I was disappointed to discover that not only do none of the movies come with a digital copy, in fact none of them work with Vudu's Disc to Digital software either. I was hoping for at least Rocky to work due to being Ultraviolet licensed, but none of them worked at all.",1464566400,,1650,4.435643564356436

3196264,1,B000W668R6,"MGM are releasing ROCKY again to celebrate the films 40th Anniversary
but there are no new special features at all, just different artwork that's all
MGM are just recycling previous content that was released on previous blu-ray releases
6 films on 6 Discs on Disc trays in a thick clamshell case covered with big slip cover box that says 40th Anniversary on it
Disc 1 is of course Rocky with all the
retrospective featurettes, behind the scenes footage, Audio commentaries, Trailers, TV spots etc on 1 Disc
which is the same version as the 2014 blu-ray anyway which i have already
Disc 2 is Rocky II, Disc 3 is Rocky 3, Disc 4 is Rocky 4, Disc 5 is R5 & Disc 6 is Rocky Balboa
which has all the making of featurettes from the 2007-2008 blu-ray
the extras for the 5 sequels are the usual Theatrical trailers for each film
no new Audio commentaries or new interview with Sylvester stallone
MGM are just recycling content, just changing the artwork that's all
so if you have all 6 films on blu-ray anyway, don't waste your money buying this new 40th reissue
cause there's nothing new & exciting
all 6 films are available to buy in individual cases anyway, so you'll only be buying the new artwork if you buy this new reissue

3196384,4,B000W668R6,"I ordered this Blu-ray box from Amazon, on sale for about $20. That's a GREAT deal. You get all 6 Rocky films on Blu-ray, housed in a single plastic book casing. I previously had all the these films on DVD, so I compared the quality of them.

The first film has been given a fantastic remastering to Blu-ray. The Blu-ray also includes about 2 hours of bonus featurettes, interviews with cast and crew. 5/5 rating

Films 2 through 5 got a ""bare bones"" upgrade. The Blu-rays look and sound better than the DVD's but there's still room for a better remastering. They do not look as good as the first film, and the difference is noticeable. These films do not have ANY bonus features. The menu shows 3 options only: play film, scene selection, and set up. 3/5 rating for these films.

A note about the sound is important. By default, the films will play in HD Surround Sound. If you have a full surround sound set up, it will probably be very good. Without a surround sound set up, you will only hear whatever sound was mixed to the centre channel. That's fine for dialogue but when the songs are playing, you mainly hear the lead vocal and bass guitar and little else... very weird mix. Change the setting to the second option, Dolby Surround Sound, and you will hear everything more naturally again... that's the same audio mix used on the DVD's but sounding better on Blu-ray. The only Stereo mixes are for foreign languages.

The 6th and most recent film, Rocky Balboa, looks and sounds great because it was recently made. That disc also has several bonus features. The film itself is not as good as some of the others. 4/5 rating

My wife and I watched this set one movie per night. I came to see that the first film is really a stand alone film classic. If that was the only one made, it would still be regarded as an important film. The rest of the films are what made the franchise more commercial, fun, ""cheesy"", etc. They are highly entertaining and fun, effective for stirring up emotions/reactions, but they rely on stereotypes and flat characters that rarely have the depth of the first film. Stallone did a great job of giving key scenes to each of the supporting characters, and the decisions to kill off characters makes sense to development plots in Rocky's fictional life.

Overall, an excellent collection that will replace my DVD's (and take up far less shelf space too). If you're a Rocky fan, I definitely recommend this Blu-ray set. I also encourage you to go see the latest film, ""Creed"".",1452729600,13,2508,4.562222222222222

Rocky Balboa at least lets the series end on a high note (I know Creed just came out, with fantastic reviews I might add!).

So, it allows you to watch the cinematic lifespan of the Rocky character. (I feel like the stories peak at the fourth movie, where Rocky goes to the U.S.S.R. to fight Drago.) This series is a compelling, inspiring, well-done and well-acted saga. Even if you are not a boxing fan, the stories within this saga will connect with you as characters wrestle with their dreams, goals, fear and find love and heartbreak along the way.

I assume anyone that is going to purchase this has seen them all so no need to do an in depth review of each movie.  The product showed up on time and factory wrapped as promised.

Real nice buy for sure at my time for sure and they are  I think some great movies with a lot of good memories at the time I remember them when they first came out ESP the  first one I was younger like Rocky was going to gym 2 to 3 times a day I was in my PRIME.  Some people said I sometime sounded like Rocky LOL and did a Spot on Rocky impression yelling of YO ADRAIN at the end of the movie and did the raw eggs drinking too. Good memories by far.

From that point on we've seen Rocky to Rocky 5 about 10 times from the first to the last. I then remembered that there was a Rocky 6 but no one had it to stream. He was so heartbroken to not have completely watch the entire series. Then I stumbled upon this and saw Rocky 6 was included. I made the decision to give this to him for Christmas. Christmas morning comes and he opens this and screams and jumps up and down. Then he stops and says, ""Wait, is Rocky 6 in here?"" I just smiled and he ripped it open and took the movie out and put it on right away. We've seen that one movie a lot! I am glad he's happy and the series is great from this set. Picture is really clear and the extra content is great. He actually started watching the commentaries hahahaha. Now he wants a Rocky themed birthday party! Idea would help if you guys have any.

3196665,5,B000W668R6,"A classic movie that stands up to the test of time.  I watched Rocky with my 8year olds and they were a little bummed about the ending of the first, but are looking forward to seeing the second.  The video quality is simply amazing.  Especially when compared to the footage in the making of extras.  They did a great job remastering it.  The audio was pretty good too.  However, I did notice a few spots where the audio quality would drastically change and it got me thinking that the masters must have somehow been damaged or something to that effect.  At any rate this package was a really good value and I'm looking forward to watching the rest of the films with my kids.",1415059200,,674,4.387096774193548
3196666,5,B000W668R6,"Rocky: The Complete Saga consists of six films - Rocky,Rocky II,Rocky III,Rocky IV,Rocky V and Rocky Balboa - that tells the story of a small-time boxer Rocky Balboa,a character portrayed by Sylvester Stallone,that has become part of the American culture and an icon that represents hope and optimism as well as the sport of boxing.

Rocky I tells the story of how Rocky proved himself to be not a worthless when he goes the distance against heavyweight champion,Apollo Creed after suffering from several defeats both inside the ring and experiences in life like getting rejected by Adrian and being mocked by his trainer,Mickey.

Rocky II tells the story of how Rocky managed to become a heavyweight world champion by beating Apollo Creed.

Rocky III,it tells the story of how Rocky rose above from defeat after reclaiming his heavyweight title against Clubber Lang.

Rocky IV tells the story of how Rocky avenged for the death of his friend - Apollo Creed - against Russian boxer Ivan Drago and made Americans proud during the time of the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. With Rocky V,we see Rocky become a boxing trainer for Tommy Gunn after retiring from the sport and returns to the Philadelphia neighborhood where he belongs after losing his fortune to a crooked accountant.

Rocky Balboa or Rocky VI gives a fitting conclusion for the series as we get to see Rocky Balboa climb inside the ring against heavyweight champion Maxon ""The Line"" Dixon to give another meaning in his life during his advanced years after losing his wife Adrian to death and the feeling of loneliness dominate his life.

Rocky films are more than just movies for Americans as most of them have become big parts of their life and their culture. The first(Rocky I) and the last film (Rocky Balboa) provided hope and optimism during the time when Americans were experiencing hardship and difficulties due to the tough economic situation that the country was experiencing during its time of release. The other films may not be a classic compared to the films I have just mentioned in the previous sentence but they still gave us excitement and entertainment as we get to relate to Rocky Balboa when he started a family (Rocky II), rose above from defeat (Rocky III), made us proud being Americans during the Cold War (Rocky IV) and become a mentor to others (Rocky V).

Overall,it was one saga that would always remain with us for many years to come. Definitely,a must-own for a Rocky Balboa fan.",1414540800,,2489,4.828638497652582

The first Rocky movie was released in 1976 as in the YEAR 1976.  There was no Blu-Ray or even DVD back then, so you aren't always going to get crisp Blu-Ray pictures from a source that was not originally made to play on Blu-Ray compared to movies that were filmed to be on Blu-Ray from the start.  That being said,  the picture being transferred to Blu-Ray looks excellent.  I play the movies on a Panasonic Blu-Ray player, on a Toshiba player and as well on PS3 and PS4 game consoles.  The picture quality is great on all players.
 There are all kinds of extra features, commentaries, etc included.  Originally priced at $60, you can find this great collection of all 6 Rocky movies on Blu-Ray for around $35 or less which is even a better deal.",1410739200,3,883,4.515723270440252

3196784,5,B000W668R6,"i read other reviews on this product that were bashing the video quality and i have to say that those people are overly critical. they don't seem to take into account when these were made, these films weren't originally made with HD cameras so of course they aren't going to look as good as movies these days even with technology that makes the film Bluray. yes in darker scenes you can see a grainy texture on the films but taking into consideration what i just addressed this is no reason to give these films less than 5 stars. i love this series and i just recently finished watching the last movie and i am very pleased with this purchase and i will continue to watch these movies throughout my life. another complaint i read was the price and i have to say that it's worth the price. fortunately i was able to snag these on sale for around $23.

to conclude: i highly recommend this box set to all Rocky fans",1400198400,2,913,4.3391812865497075

3196790,4,B000W668R6,"First of all, for the money (about $23 at the time), this is a great value.  As others have pointed out, only the original 'Rocky' has been fully re-mastered.  I knew that going in, and didn't expect all of the movies to have that HD look.

I loved the packaging.  I was totally impressed that they got all six movies neatly packed into a single-disc-size case.  By comparison, the Man of Steel Blu-ray has three discs, and two of them are simply stacked on top of each other on a single spindle.  In this collection, each disc has its own spindle/tray.  Nice!

I wish there were more Special Features.  It seems like I've seen a documentary or two over the years that didn't appear here.  Would have been nice to feel like I had the definitive collection of behind the scenes info.  Still, I bought this set to pretty much just watch the movies...mostly Rocky IV.  So, I'm not complaining much.",1400198400,3,895,4.490683229813665

They remind me of my childhood, of boisterous movie theaters shouting ""Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!"" This was a film series that also served as mini film events. People love an underdog, and Rocky always is one, even when he's the champ.
This collection includes concise packaging, about the size of a double-DVD package. Not a lot of extra features, but enough to bring back good memories.",1399939200,,480,4.658823529411765

3196801,3,B000W668R6,"The box set is nice and the audio is really preserved well.

My issue with this is the lack of bitrate in the video. These movies are old, dirty and grain filled and require quite alot of bitrate to preserve that. However, sadly, the video loses alot of that due to the low bitrate. It seems like to save on costs they wanted these to fit on 25GB bluray discs instead of 50GB ones. Such a shame.

Otherwise all the goodies are here, and in one easily accessable box set that fits on your shelf happily along with other movies.",1399680000,3,526,4.25

I bought it and all 6 played fine, although once or twice they did get weird when i first put them in. 4 and 5 i had to take out and put in, but after that both movies worked fine. the quality (in my opinion) is phenomenal, although i am not an expert.

I bat on this new set and the result was half success.

Rocky 1. Some of the dark scenes are clearly better than the old version of the bluray. But I wouldn't say the entire scenes are super sharp like some old movies like Sound of Music, Ben Hur, Cleopatra and so on. They still look old and have a lot of grains.

From Rocky 2-5. They have the same problem. Some of the parts looked better but not worth saying they look super sharp HD bluray.
I know they did best but I am still dissapointed.

Rocky Balboa. I am dissapointed not because of the visual. The visual is perfect. The sound is not DTS HD or Dolby TRUE HD. That's why it is dissapointed.

Above all, If there was a chance that I could watch all the six discs and buy the set, I still would have bought it.

It means it's still worth buying it.",1392768000,4,955,4.168478260869565

I also was let down when I found out that the first rocky was the only one that got a new transfer. BUT I can tell you this, there is a world of difference in this new transfer vs the previous bluray releases. This new transfer us great!!!! The previous undisputed set, everyone including me, was griping about all the gritty film grain. If you like grain, stick with that set. This new one though, its beautiful!!!! No drop out and its so nice and smooth. There is no detail loss and the sound us great also. Aside from the new transfer, the new packaging is nice also. Its much thinner than the other set and there is some new bonus material. The box is pretty sweet, and I also like the new menus. I've only checked out the first one so far so I can't say anything about the other ones. I would imagine they are the same as the previous ones. Bottom line...... If you a Ricky fan, grab this! I got mine for $35 and that's nothing to complain about.new transfers on the other movies will come later on, but till the.... I'm VERY happy with the first ones new transfer. By the way, those of you who keep demanding more xrta content on thebfirstbfilm, its not gonna happen . if you recall on some of the previous releases, the director informs us that all the unused stuff and extras were lost in a fire!! So, stop complaining about extra content for the first film. I DO want more content for the rest of them though!!",1392076800,5,1589,4.247524752475248
3196837,4,B000W668R6,"The Rocky franchise is one of my personal favorites. Very few characters have resonated with audiences the way Rocky has. This collection includes all six Rocky films, from the original ""Rocky"" (1976) to the latest installment ""Rocky Balboa"" (2006). The first film in particular is one of the all-time great movies, it has stood the test of time and remains a wonderful achievement in filmmaking. The sequels vary in quality, but they are all bound together by the heart of the title character as well as entertaining boxing matches.

For those who already own the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocky-The-Undisputed-Collection/dp/B002M9WW30/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rocky: The Undisputed Collection</a>&nbsp;(which seems to be going out of print), the question is should you purchase this set?

The main reason to upgrade would be an improved image quality on the first film. If you own the Undisputed Collection, you'd probably agree that the picture quality is good but there was a lot of room for improvement. The Heavyweight Collection features a new transfer, and the result is a much better viewing experience.

Some have brought up the much lamented 7th disc of bonus features that was included in the Undisputed Collection, but is not included in this Heavyweight Collection. However, it's not as bad as it looks... almost all of the bonus material on that disc have been included on Disc 1 of this new set (so it's on the same disc as the first ""Rocky"" film). I am not sure why this change was made, but my guess is there have been improvements in storage capacity since the first blu-ray set was released, and thus there is more room on the movie disc to fit the special features.

In fact, there is one new feature included in this set: ""8mm Home Movies of Rocky"".

So if you already own the Undisputed Collection and have no problem with the video quality, then upgrading to this set probably isn't essential.

3196846,2,B000W668R6,"Does Sylvester Stallone have anything to do with these releases?

'Rocky' is such an endearing movie franchise, but the way MGM handles the home distribution is despicable.  The franchise's value is reportedly into the billions - treat it as such. There only needed to be one box set Blu-ray release, 'The Undisputed Collection', and that was done wrong. This new 'Heavyweight' set is just a rip-off repeat of it, minus some of the bonus features. Why would anyone buy it?

Here's what's wrong with both of these Blu-ray sets (before we get into the actual movies themselves):

Let's start with the 'Heavyweight' set's packaging:  That's not even the ROCKY font!  The cover and spine of the set should be solid black with 'ROCKY' in the original font in gold-yellow, Rocky's colors. Add Stallone's signature on there somewhere and it's good to go.  You'd never see 'Star Wars' or 'Jaws' repackaged with the name any other way than the original LOGO.  Because that's what it is, a logo.  Rocky has one too. Use it.

MGM, do you know who you're catering to?  No box set of any film series is complete without sticking to the fonts and styles of the original theatrical posters and promos. Your '007' sets don't stray like this Rocky set does. It's hardcore fans like me who would shell out the money for these sets anyway.  Do you really think any non-Rocky fan is going to pay $40 when you can get all of them individually in the bargain bin at Wal-Mart - some with double features?  You can get the 'Rocky Balboa' DVD for $5 at Best Buy. Why are the Rocky fans getting the shaft like this?

Why is only the original 'Rocky' getting any remastering treatment?  This was the main issue people had with the 'Undisputed' Blu-ray set. These movies were far from flops; the Rocky series is one of the most successful movie franchises of all time. Rocky II - V all deserve the same respect.

On the original DVD release box set from 2000, each disc contained the theatrical trailer for the movie.  Nowhere to be found on the 'Undisputed' set.  PUT THEM BACK!  Along with any TV spots. The Rocky movies were big hits that still command a huge following both here and internationally.  Let's see some of the press that surrounded their original theatrical releases.

THE FILMS

ROCKY - I want to see the original ending that was cut.  That picture of Rocky & Adrian holding hands inside the 'K' on the poster is from them walking in the back after the fight.  If the footage no longer exists, I'd like to hear Talia Shire or someone explain it.  Were other scenes cut?  If so, what were they about?  (See my reasoning, if you really need it, when we get to 'Rocky Balboa'.)

ROCKY II - Well done sequel that carried the story on in the same vain as the original and all the actors turned in great performances. There had to be more than one trailer for this. It was 1979 and the studio was pushing the sequel to their huge hit from 3 years ago. Any cut scenes? Let's hear about them. How about some insight on Stallone taking on the role of director? Was John Alvidsen approached? I always wondered who conjured up the idea of a sequel in the first place. Was it the studio or was is Stallone?

ROCKY III - Ditto.  Took the story forward and on to the next level. It was junk food for us fans, sweetened with 3 fights (including the wrestling match). Plus, the addition of 'Eye Of The Tiger' to the soundtrack. I was 8 when this came out and remember the line around the theater and all the hype with the song - good times!  However, clocking in shorter than its prequels at a little over 1.5 hours, there must have been cut scenes. What were they? Why were they cut?  Also, there's a 'making-of' special out there on YouTube, showing behind the scenes footage including practicing with Hulk Hogan for the Thunderlips match along with Stallone and Mr. T rehearsing their bouts.  Come on with it!  Let Hulk Hogan talk about the conflict he had with Vince McMahon, Sr., who gave him the ultimatum: Either work for me at the WWF or go do the Rocky movie.  Hogan chose the latter and we all know what happened to pro wrestling after 1982 and Hogan's exposure from the film.

ROCKY IV - *Sigh*. The biggest money maker in the series, but talk about getting way off track story wise. Not to mention adding 6 magical years to the story line (that was one long friendly match with Apollo Creed at the end of III !).  Even shorter than 'Rocky III', there must have been cut scenes. The trailer has an interesting blip of the boxing board members sitting around a conference table refusing to have the match between Rocky & Ivan Drago due to Apollo Creed's death. Didn't make the final cut. Please show this. Explain.  And also, how about the change up in the soundtrack? Let's talk about it.

ROCKY V - We all know the negative stigma surrounding this one. However, the swerve of Rocky & co. going from riches back to rags was a well-needed shot in the arm for the story. If you're a Rocky fan like me, you also know full well about and have seen the 'directors cut' floating around YouTube these past couple of years (with Bill Conti's original score, not MC Hammer's music). The cut dialogue in the scene with Rocky and his lawyers about his finances is so well-needed. Rocky and Adrian lay into Paulie about the financial mess he caused. This was - unrealistically - barely addressed in the final cut. This, along with the rest of the project and cut scenes (Little Marie?), needs to be discussed between director John Alvidsen and Stallone in a sit down like the one William Friedkin and William Peter Blatty have on 'The Exorcist' discs.

ROCKY BALBOA - It's been said, and I'll say it again: Stallone did so right by all us fans with this one, the final chapter.  Well-written, well-preformed and with the atmosphere of the original it hit all the right points.  But, how about a director's cut?  The deleted scenes are so awesome and would only enhance the story - especially the Paulie/girlfriend bit and when Rocky runs into wheelchair-bound Andy in the bar.  What's also a plus in this story is that when it comes to the computer fight, you hear detractors of Rocky for the first time in the series. One of the commentators calls Rocky 'overrated'. It would have been interesting to hear just a tinge of that in Rocky II and then Rocky IV after Rocky's 3 years at the top.

What's the big deal?  The big deal is that Rocky is an American folk hero. These are supposed to be 'ultimate sets', 'Undisputed'.  Well, the Rocky fans are disputing. Despite Chuck Wepner' s legit issues with Stallone and how he was handled, on screen Rocky the character hits home for a lot people. The whole 'going the distance' thing can be applied everywhere in life. It resonates with people, touches nerves (positively). And, the Rocky of 2006 pushing age 60 spoke just as well.

What other film has produced a character and story as inspirational like this?  Nothing since 1976, that's for sure. If so, name it. No movie character gets discussed the way Rocky does. Because people can relate.

THE EXTRA'S

What other movies have such a stirring and motivating original score and soundtrack? Only John Williams' 'Jaws', 'Star Wars' and 'Indiana Jones' scores come close to getting you pumped up like the music in the Rocky films. How about a segment devoted to Bill Conti and his work, along with Vince DiCola and his synthesizer score for Rocky IV? How about an interview with the band members of Survivor? Even MC Hammer & co. - how (and why?) did they get tapped for the 'Rocky V' soundtrack?

Go to Philly: What other movie character still has their statue and permanent sneaker prints anywhere outside of Hollywood?  Rocky could have been from LA or New York. But, Stallone based him out of blue-collar Philadelphia. It's a large city, but it's also a town like any other town in 'flyover country', not a whole lot of glamour. Track down the owner of the building at 1818 E Tusculum St. in Philly, along with others in the area who were there for all the filming, etc. Give the city its props with a segment devoted to it. Along with the city's rich history, the whole Rocky thing is part of the charm for tourists.

The sport: Focus a segment on boxing. Include Chuck Wepner's ESPN documentary, let's be fair. Interview other boxers as well; get their insight and opinions on the Rocky movies. Stallone was inducted into the boxing hall of fame a few years ago, include it. I've trained at Freddie Roach's Wild Card gym in Los Angeles. The walls are covered with posters and pictures, all boxing-related (lots of Manny Pacquiao, of course). But on the way out, look up above the door and you'll see the only picture in the whole place that's under plexi glass protection: It's a black and white shot from the 'Rocky IV' fight with Stallone's autograph on it. You simply can't deny the films' place in the world of boxing.

Some of these things I'm calling out have been addressed on the various releases.  How about getting them all into one place finally, on one set?  Otherwise, it's just obvious greed on the studios' part.

FINAL THOUGHTS

Mr. Stallone, you hit the nail on the head in 1976 with Rocky. One of a kind, the likes of which we haven't seen since. Unlike Rambo, Rocky Balboa is your baby. You created him. I understand people have a hard time separating you from him. But, the series' treatment deserves so much better and we would think you'd prefer to see it better handled as well. Do us a favor: Pick up the phone, call someone over at MGM and straighten this crap out.

Instead of churning out repetitive sets (in poor packaging), ROCKY and its fans deserve a better Blu-ray box set.",1391126400,34,9684,4.544354838709677

Raging Bull is brilliant, but does it speak to you? Have you felt like Jake Lamotta? To take them on one by one, ROCKY, the first, is a sublimely nuanced piece of low-budget 70s art in the manner of DOG DAY AFTERNOON. Do not be fooled by its optimism; if self-loathing matters, then love matters; that film shows the transformation of a group of under-dogs (Rocky, Adrian, Paulie, and Mickey) when granted the unrealistic shot at the impossible. If you want realism, watch Ray Robinson beat Carmen Basillio in the Garden. Rocky is art. It is also a working class microcosm of Philadelphia enduring economic decline in the 70s; it's about rootlessness, broken families and the desire for more. ROCKY II finally reveals what happens to most mediocre to great fighters when they achieve fame. The money goes fast, and relationships take a hit. ROCKY III should be respected as the 'turning of the page' that it is; if you like the Rolling Stones for adapting to disco, why can you not accept Rocky as a Reaganesque 80's hero, grown fat from shame (metaphorically); wealthy and under-trained; it is filled with camp. And Carl Weathers finally takes center stage. ROCKY IV, minus an embarrassing robot, is like II without the charm, but it is loaded with Bi-polar world Perestroika-era fun. ""The Russian is cut; he's not a machine!"" ROCKY V -- well, everyone stumbles, and in stumbling, in failure, there is greatness; imagine Bruce Lee movies or Hammer Horror films without ridiculous sequels. And ROCKY BALBOA has moments of such subtlety, such grace, it charms like a Sam Beckett play as men, Paulie and Rocky, wander the depleted Philly of their youths, living in the past and granted one last shot at a future. Rocky's speech to his son, along with Duke's ""Hurting Bombs"" speech are SCREENWRITING ART. There I said it. Bill Simmons would say it. And there is good news, my friends, Ryan Coogler has received the greenlight for APOLLO CREED, the story of Apollo's grandson, played by THE WIRE and FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHT's Michael P. Jordan, with Stallone in a small supporting role. Coogler is an artist. The series has found its footing.

The transfer to BluRay is pretty solid compared to most transfers that I've seen, so the quality is worth it.  I had never seen Balboa and figured this set would be a perfect way to complete my Rocky viewing saga.

After watching 1 a week for the past 6 weeks I can tell you that I thoroughly enjoyed the trip back down memory lane.  Whether he's fighting Apollo Creed, Clubber Lang, Ivan Drago, or Tommy Gunn Rocky will take you on an underdog's journey to glory!

If you haven't seen the movies before, they're 70's & 80's movies, so that should give you an idea of what to expect.  They are all written by Sly Stone himself so if you enjoy his career but haven't seen these movies, give them a chance.

In the interest of full disclosure, I found this as a Deal of the Day for $20, on sale from around $60, so I jumped at it without delving too deeply into details. Still, although a disc of bonus materials is included, its nothing like I was expecting, given that the original Rocky was an Academy Award winner for Best Picture, as well as such a landmark achievement for Sylvester Stalone. Where's the commentary track? Where are the making -of documentaries? I don't regret my purchase. However, had I paid closer to full price, I might have done. In short, to say this is the Undisputed collection is a bit overblown. Had this movie collection treated even just the first two films with the attention to detail in the extras department which they deserve, this collection would have been a complete knockout.",1383177600,,904,4.6918238993710695

The story of a nice guy who knows how to throw punches but has a big heart with such loyalty to those close to him that he fought wars because of them, how can you not get behind a character like that.

""Rocky IV"" still to this day is one of my all time favorite movies, I don't listen to the critics who try to point out its flaws, I just watch it and enjoy every minute of it.  While 5 gets its harshest reviews, I do understand why it was made.

Wanting something different well this is it. Plenty of things happening that you have to watch it all the time not missing out on anything. Story is about a boxer that has other issues with family and friends, now that is all as not to spoil a great movie.

Up here and all over the internet i've seen people give this set bad reviews for it's picture quality so I was expecting the worse.

3196979,4,B000W668R6,"If you are looking at this you know this is a classic series of movies. I am here to attempt to review the quality if the blu-ray transfer for each movie. I want a potential buyer to know what they are getting when it comes to a the video quality presented in this set

Case:

The design here is compact and neat. There is an oversized blu ray keep case that holds all 7 discs. The discs are in back to back holders.

Image Quality

Rocky :
This is definitely the best quality we have ever gotten. There is a question as to weather or not this is the best possible transfer we could get, but it is very difficult to judge something on conjecture. Anyway, the aspect ratio is 1.85:1 with a 1080p/mpeg2 transfer. This is the same remastering as the 2006 blu ray and we may not get a better version for a long time.

While watching the movie it looks very good, but there is significant noise on the screen at pints which can be distracting. This definitely comes from the movie being an older print but it is far less noticing e when looking the outdoor scenes.

Rocky II

 The transfer here is AVC-encode. The image is far nicer than you have ever gotten before but thee is still some noise from the original content. I do not know why but the final fight scene seems to pop more than the rest of the movie. The scenes becomes a tad sharper somehow.

Rocky III

This transfer is beautiful. It doesn't blow the first two away but it is definitely a nicer clearer print. This movie does showcase what Blu Ray can do for you. There is so much detail in faces and on skin that it really helps you want to watch this version. Dark scenes have some shadowing issues but this is still a very nice transfer.

Rocky IV

Again we have a 1080p/AVC encode and boy does it look special. This movie in blu-ray is a treat. Faces look incredible, everything shines and colors look absolutely fantastic. This asks you to take notice. There is very little static from the source through the movie but the contrast is incredible. The black areas are as black as they are going to get. This movie showcases what you are missing out by just watching the movie on DVD.

Rocky V

I removed a star in my review because they included this film. Kidding! Five is not the most popular Rocky movie out there, though to tell you the truth I don't hate it. Alright and now I'm back. AVC-encoded yet again but somehow we have a step back in quality.

The picture is a bit darker than previous movies but there is a lot less noise present.

Rocky Balboa

Thus is the same transfer as the 2007 film blu ray release. This is the best of all of the discs but I guess that is to be expected when a few decades pass. Finally a Rocky movie with no noise and no artifacts.

Special features

Just two extras I found to be notable that increased my enjoyment of this product

Feeling strong now game. This is Very similar to
DVD scene-it and it is actually fun to mess around with

In The Ring- making of documentary. This is a fantastic three part making of that is 75 minutes long. Part one is all about what it was like to film the movie in 28 days while parts 2 and 3 focus on the loves and motivations of the actors other than Sylvester Stalone.

So finally if you like these movies and you are interested I hope you can use this as a quite for you to judge if you want to see this movie. There are many conflicting reports relating to weather or not the quality on these blu-rays are what you are expecting so I hope I have been able to clear things up a bit to allow you to make your own decision.

3196991,2,B000W668R6,"Rocky is about an average guy with a big dream. He has to out-box Apollo Creed for the heavyweight championship. The chemistry and performances in this franchise are excellent. Rocky fans will be happy to find all 6 Rocky movies from the original to Rocky Balboa are included here in this 7-disc Blu-ray collection (2009). The series never got much love in the way of extras (many previous DVD sets had no extras). This set includes a 7th Bonus Disc (Rocky Anthology) with recycled extras from the Rocky 2-Disc Collector's Edition DVD, Rocky Balboa BD and one new HD game (Feeling Strong Now!) which is fun for a time. Overall the product isn't as comprehensive as fans would prefer. It seems somewhat slapdash as if Rocky I-V barely exist (the sequels are mostly ignored). Only Rocky Balboa gets special treatment with extras on its disc, the only audio commentary and deleted scenes. Forget about the frequently mentioned Rocky IV and V trimmed scenes and director's cut of Rocky V. We are missing a truly comprehensive documentary on the franchise (76 minutes describing 6 films doesn't cut it anymore when Blade Runner got a 3-hour deluxe documentary for a single film). There is a total of roughly 4.5 hours of total bonus supplements (3.5 hours from Rocky 2-disc DVD & 1 hour from Rocky Balboa BD) which is good but not great. 6 films deserve at least 6 hours in extras, new documentaries and/or a remastering for such a great franchise. So this collection is the light version of the box set and certainly not deluxe. This set delivers mostly ""single film treatment"" which is so common to box sets. The first five films in The Planet of the Apes franchise got better treatment.

Disc 7: Rocky Anthology Bonus Disc: Feeling Strong Now! Game, Rocky Featurettes: Three Rounds with Legendary Trainer Lou Duva, Interview with a Legend - Bert Sugar: Author/Commentator and Historian, The Opponents, In the Ring: Three-Part Making-Of Documentary, Steadicam: Then and Now with Garrett Brown, Make Up! The Art and Form with Michael Westmore, Staccato: A Composer's Notebook with Bill Conti, The Ring of Truth, Behind the Scenes with John Avildsen, Tribute to Burgess Meredith, Tribute to James Crabe, Video Commentary with Sylvester Stallone, Sylvester Stallone on Dinah! (1976), Stallone Meets Rocky, Trailers.

Hang onto your Rocky (Two-Disc Collector's Edition DVD) for the audio commentaries. Consider purchasing this collection as the value pack ($6/film) if you don't own them all. Rocky II-V don't have many extras in their stand-alone releases and nothing much is added here. If you enjoy two or more of the films it is worth it. I would rate the films 5 stars and this collection 2 stars because it could have been so much better and isn't a major upgrade from the DVD collection. Many franchises get poor treatment but prior Rocky releases felt like the movie was slapped onto disc and shipped out. Rocky was loved by millions, inspired thousands and deserves heartfelt remastering. IGN ranked this release at #18 in Top 25 Worst Blu-Ray releases (notably Robocop Trilogy, The Terminator and Predator: Ultimate Hunter Edition also make the list). The video and audio quality aren't up to snuff. If you already own the Rocky film collection then this doesn't add much. Although you do get a few extras on Disc 7 it seems cynical to include so little bonus content (not all of the DVD extras were ported over either). The problem is that not all of the films seem to be in true HD (the transfers are the best Rocky has looked but still don't look great when compared to other Blu-Rays). Rocky fans deserve better treatment.",1376784000,7,3629,4.8896103896103895
3196992,4,B000W668R6,"I can't say I really notice that much difference between this bluray set and the DVD set I already owned. It is nice however to have Rocky Balboa included in the bluray set.

3196995,5,B000W668R6,"This is a great item to have. This film series is a great story of an ordinairy guy who suddenly finds himself on a path to drasticlly improve his life. Along the way he pushes through several physical and emotional barriers between his goals and his friends/family. The ride, while bumpy at times, is very satisfying and rewarding for the watcher. The really good thing is that each movie has Rocky tackle a different obsticle for different reasons.

Moving away from the movies, the set itself is pretty impressive. The movies do have slight quality issues but, it's very easy to brush it aside and forget the problem, except for the first film. In the first movie there are scenes where one character appears blurry and has shadow all around him/her but all other characters look bright and clear. While I haven't seen every extra, the ones I have seen add a lot for the movies and it is great hearing Stallone explain what he did with the character he acted/created/changed.

Not every movie is 5 stars but, the set makes up for the majority of bad marks I would give some of the movies. Very recommend.",1376092800,,1107,4.614213197969543

3196997,5,B000W668R6,"I hadn't seen most of these movies in years and am really enjoying watching them all. They are well done and entertaining. All the characters fit the parts so well and there's a lot of feeling to these movies. I've always been a Stallone fan but watching these as an adult gives me even more respect for him.

The collection came nicely packaged and I've not had any problems with the discs so far (we are on IV). The image quality isn't up to standard with your normal Blu-Ray and it's even grainy at times but I don't think it was shot with the best cameras, at least the earlier ones. It's rather nostalgic actually.

If you remember liking one or two of these movies, get this set. My husband and I have been having random Rocky nights since we got this and it's been fun. Well worth the very reasonable cost.",1375833600,,813,4.342105263157895

It is especially gratifying to see how many movies Stallone made, given that the first one was panned by the critics. Each movie has very touching moments and end with the fight. When you watch one each evening, like my husband and I did, it is interesting to see how Stallone ages, yet still in great shape.",1375228800,2,372,4.328571428571428

Rocky 4, a newer film, has about 20% HD, and the rest is grain, grain, grain.

Rocky 5 is more HD -- and not Blue Ray -- but the grainy transfers remain.

Rocky Balboa, the most recent release, should have been 100% Blue Ray but is maybe 75% HD and not Blue Ray.

So, if you are expecting Blue Ray on this box set, forget it.

Rocky 1-5 are perfect movies with lovable characters and villains, The final movie Rocky Balboa was just a perfect ending to the series by establishing Rocky's dominance.

I returned them, but was unable to get an exchange because Amazon was out of stock. In order to repurchase I would have to pay $20 more than I originally do. Reasonably pissed off, I contacted Amazon through a chat. I must say they handled the situation gracefully. I was told that the conversation would be saved and when the dvds became available again through Amazon, I could repurchase them at the price I originally purchased them at, I would just need to purchase through an online chat. As far as I know, the dvds are now fixed. I received my boxed set, checked all of them and they work great. My only criticism is that how would other customers, who had the same problem as me, know that the situation could be easily resolved through an online chat. Also, if you know that customers are having issues with broken dvds, stop selling them! This is why I am giving this only 2 stars.

That said I'm very happy that I own this boxed set and that it's Blu Ray instead of regular DVD.  The bonus features are nice as well, I watched most of them.

The only thing I wish they could have done better is regarding the quality of the recordings - I was hoping that they worked some digital magic and increased the quality resolutions, etc - but they're not all that much better than a regular DVD in the long run.  I know they weren't filmed with HD cameras in the first place, but I've seen some great re-digitizing in the past and was hoping for the same here.

The quality on these movies are terrible for being what it is, as far as the franchise on its own i give it 5 stars! Definitely worth the upgrade to bluray if your looking for slightly better quality but if you have just regular dvd's the difference is not overwhelming.

3197136,4,B000W668R6,"I'll admit. I never really thought that I'd ever invest in the Rocky series. I think I only saw Rocky IV in the theatre, and I thought that their entry of the home robot maid was just stupid as hell, so I dismissed the thought of ever looking into any of the other Rocky films.

But, Stallone is Rocky, just as he is Rambo.  So, since I always seem to scan various Blu-Ray releases of classic films here on Amazon, I saw the complete box set of all the Rocky films for just a penny less than twenty bucks, I mindlessly clicked ""yes"" to order it on the spot. Afterwards, I contacted a few of my friends and family to ask them if having all the Rocky films on Blu-Ray was a value at about twenty bucks. Everybody said Yes! And, then they all said that they would jump on the deal too.

But, the next day, everybody called or text me and said that this Rocky box set on Blu-ray was selling for 44 dollars on Amazon. Not $19.99. As I checked on Amazon, it was true. The price suddenly jumped to 44 dollars, the very next day.

I now have to show everybody my invoice to prove that I only got billed for $19.99 for my box set.  If Amazon waited just one more day before they raised the price to 44 dollars, I'm sure that they would have sold another three box sets that day.

3197151,5,B000W668R6,"Can you hear the sound of the trumpets? I can!  It's that time of year when everyone starts that new goal, gives up that bad habit and hopes that there lives will change for the better.

What better time to revisit the Rocky saga? I purchased the new Blu Ray edition of the Rocky series to replace my sub par Rocky DVD box set and I can say with certainty, that it is well worth the upgrade especially at the low price of $19.99 for all 6 films and an exclusive bonus disc with over 3 hours of excellent material.

The films are a mixed bag, but all our entertaining and can inspire the underdog in you to get up off the couch and do something new to improve yourself and help those around you.

The original Rocky is the best of the bunch and is still a film that is poignant and inspirational. Great casting helps this film tremendously with character perfect performances by Stallone as the fighting underdog, Meredith's colorful crotchety manger, Shire the shy object of Rocky's affection, Young as the lovable but hurtful loser, Weathers as the smooth talkin' fighting champ and Spinell as the likable gangster.

The film hits all the right notes with a memorable score and does so much with its' meager budget, none of the other films have ever quite got it like the original. The Blu Ray transfer is very nice retaining grain but looking pretty sharp. It is the best this film has ever sounded or looked.

Rocky II is a solid film showing the aftermath of the first fight and Creed wanting redemption for Rocky going the distance in the first fight. It shows Rocky squandering the money he made for the first fight and also shows him if he wants to make something of himself, he must fight, because it is after all, what he does best! The Blu Ray transfer once again is a big upgrade with a sharp picture, grain is present, but I don't want to look at wax figures and the sound is a big upgrade as well.

Rocky III is my personal favorite of the sequels as it is filled with so many colorful characters. Rocky fights Hulk Hogan (Thunder Lips) in a charity match and meets his arch nemesis in Clubber Lang (played to perfection by Mr. T) Clubber is a brute much like Rocky in the original film, but without Rocky's heart. It is most unfortunate that they Kill off Mickey in this film, but it's a necessary plot point to allow Rocky to lose his first fight with Lang. Of course, it all comes out good in the end. The Blu Ray transfer is on point like the first two films with a much improved picture and sound.

Rocky IV is my least favorite of the sequels, it's not a bad film, but the soundtrack is dated, the Russians are presented like cardboard evil robots and the film is very short with a long training montage and of course the recap in the beginning of the film like each sequel before it. Being short is not a bad thing and the fight with Drago who makes an interesting opponent is one of the best in the series. It also opens the door for Rocky V  as the Russian robot and other brutal beatings by Creed and Lang leave the Rock with brain damage. Once again the Blu Ray transfer is a big improvement in picture and sound.

Rocky V....I know a lot of people didn't care for this one, but I know I always joked that they ought to make a Rocky film wear he is diagnosed with brain damage. I mean really this guy used his head as a punching bag in all of the fights in these films and no one could actually take that kind of abuse.

Rocky V introduces Tommy Gunn a young kid with a lot of power and determination, but once again none of Rocky's heart.

After Rocky loses his fortune after a blunder by Paulie giving the Balboa's lawyer power of attorney, the Rock ends up right back where he started.  On the street of Philly with the Gym that Mickey left him. Adrian gets her old job back at the pet shop. Rocky is informed after a medical examination that he can no longer box because of the severe beating he has taken over the years.

Enter Tommy Gunn, who wants Rocky to train him if he see any potential. Rocky is reluctant at first, but can't resist a chance of being part of the sport again. The usual stuff happens with Rocky bringing the inexperienced boxer to his own, but the public thinks it's all Rocky's doing and they give the youngster no respect or credit.

The Duke who is basically Don King is trying to lure Rocky back into the ring for personal gain and Adrian is dead set against it. So The Duke lures Gunn to the seedy side of the sport with a title shot, something Rocky doesn't want to give him until he feels he is ready.

The film ends in another battle for Rocky this time in the streets of Philadelphia master against student and well we all know ""The Rock"" is gonna win. The Blu Ray transfer is the biggest upgrade so far with a huge improvement in picture and sound over the DVD of this film.

Now we come to the finale, Rocky Balboa which I find to be the best of the sequels even though I enjoy Rocky III a little more, this film is a fitting end to the saga and captures much of the heart of the original. The Blu Ray Transfer is excellent both in picture and sound and the grand finale fight is well done. This disc has some interesting extras and is the only film to have extras on the film disc.

The bonus disc however is over 3 hours long with plenty to get excited about making of documentary and pretty cool game and much more.

Final thought, if you love the Rocky films, then this is the way to go, it has all you should ever need to revisit these films and being on sale for $19.99 it is a no brainer. I have read others reviews about the bad transfers, but I watched this on my 150 inch HD screen and I didn't notice any of the distractions that others claimed to have seen. Maybe they fixed the issues(?) as some of the reviews with complaints are old.

Happy New Year everyone get the Rock on Blu Ray and get motivated!",1357603200,4,5879,4.250896057347671

3197159,5,B000W668R6,"What can you say about a complete collection of Rocky films?  Add the fact they are on Blu-Ray?  Come on.

The quality of the Blu-Ray images is the best I've seen from movies which were shot on film and transferred to digital media.  When these movies were originally shot, the filmmakers never imagined people watching them on high definition, large screen televisions.  These films (Rocky I-IV) were filmed to be watched on movie screens.  A movie screen won't show things like film grain which is inherent in the film itself, but when you transfer that film to digital high def media, all the flaws become very obvious.  I guess you just have to look past it or avoid films shot in the 20th century which have very bright and very dark parts where the grain is most obvious.

The films themselves are well-reviewed and I'd venture to guess almost everyone who would consider buying this has seen most of them already so I'll only rate them as I like them.  Believe it or not, I like Rocky III best of all only because Mr. T is incredibly awesome and completely terrifying in his movie debut (I also liked him later in the underrated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/D-C-Cab/dp/B0006IIPJO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">D.C. Cab</a>&nbsp;which, as of this writing, is not yet on Blu-Ray).  It turned out to be the beginning of a very colorful career for him.  My second favorite is Rocky II because of the opposite ending from Rocky I, which is my third favorite.  I put Rocky Balboa as fourth on the list only because it completely beat my expectations and turned out to be a good film.  Rocky IV is a fun but ridiculous and predictable piece of fluff (when the Russians start rooting for Rocky the film enters sci-fi realm).  I really didn't like Rocky V much at all, but it's nice to have it in the set.  I don't know, I guess maybe Stallone was just in a bad phase then; just trying to make something work to keep cashing in on Rocky.

I like Stallone.  I think he's an American original whose body of work is incredibly inconsistent but contains enough classics (a few are in this set) to vault him into legendary status.  I'm glad he's climbed back into the spotlight with the surprisingly enjoyable&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Expendables/dp/B008Y6WPXC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""The Expendables""</a>&nbsp;franchise.

Now, a lot of people complained of a grainy or blurred picture. I guess it is a little grainy if you look close for it but it's an old movie, you know? You're not gonna get a picture like say a movie that came out a year ago or something. I've seen the first 3 & I don't really see what the big deal was about all the complaints.

3197202,5,B000W668R6,"Although the Rocky series has been maligned for some of the later installments (mostly notably IV & V), but the first three films are as good as film trilogies get.  The original Rocky was a huge underdog hit, garnering the 1976 Oscar for best picture and catapulting unknown Sylvester Stallone into a star.  While he would descend into cartoonish performances later in his career, he is superb as the ham & egger boxer Rocky Balboa who overcomes all odds and goes the distance with the champ, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) losing on a split decision.  Rocky II & III find Rocky winning then losing the championship and fighting to regain glory and the title.  Rocky IV & V are both low marks in the series, especially V which is borderline ridiculous.  Rocky Balboa is a nice way to close out the series (unless Mr. Stallone decides to revive the series) with some fine acting, but a fairly unbelievable scenario of Rocky at the almost 60 years old fights the current champ and again goes the distance losing on a split decision.  The pictures on the blu ray editions are really good, adding a crispness and vibrancy to the older films.",1347408000,,1136,4.655

And I'm going to assume that if you are looking to buy this set, you either love the movies, or they were part of your childhood memories and you don't need me to tell you about the movies themselves...  Instead, I'm just reviewing the quality of the transfers, the sound, and the extras, and I'm going to keep it short and sweet:

The movies have never looked better.  I remember seeing them in the movie theater as a kid.  Grainy, dust and scratches on the film.  You know, the way movies were before the digital projectors we are all used to now.  No, these aren't as crisp and bright as movies today, but they preserve the graininess of the original film.

The sound is great.

The extras are interesting.

Definitely worth the price to have the entire Rocky saga on your shelf in such pristine condition.",1344556800,5,1029,4.420212765957447

The Rocky story is just beautiful. I love the emotion, the action, the pain, the triumph, and the love. I think these movies are a must to watch because they will inspire you to be a better man and a better American. I always get a little watery eyed when I hear The Measure of Man and I think of all the final scenes when Rocky has won his fight and Adrian is in his arms and the American flag is draped around him and his face is so bruised. It just gets me right there. I think it's the triumph over pain and fear that is the most beautiful, there's no feeling like it in the world. I love the scenes with the stairs too. The patriotism and pureness of the films is very obvious. The other element that I love in these movies is the relationship between Rocky and Adrian. I love how he pulls her out and loves her for all she is. I love how he says ""You're never getting rid of me."" I think we need more positive marital messages in today's entertainment like this. I was heartbroken in the final movie when Adrian is dead. It makes the series very powerful but I miss her character very much. I can't help but feel the pain that Rocky does. My prayers go out for Sylvester now with the death of his son. Seeing young Sage in the movie must be so difficult for him. His real life loss must be horrible. But Sylvester is a great guy and I know that he believes and lives by his movies. He will overcome the loss. Yo Adrian, I did it!!!!!!!!",1344384000,5,1611,4.069182389937107

The first movie is Rocky, an undisputed classic. Nuff said.
The second movie (Rocky 2) is also very good, not a classic... but still very good.
The third movies (Rocky 3... detecting a pattern here) has Mr. T in it. You'll like or hate the movie based on your opinion of him. I thought he handled the part very well.
The fourth movie (Rocky... you get what I'm saying)... Russians. Just Russians. A good message trying to be broadcast. It falls short in the hands of Rocky though.
Wait... THERE WAS A FIFTH MOVIE?!?!?
The sixth movie (Rocky Balboa) is a look back at the first five basically. I found it to be full of heart and a fitting send off for a beloved character.

The transfers from film to Blu Ray are awesome and the Special Features on disc 7 are really informative. If you love Rocky, it's a fitting set all around. :D",1343001600,,876,4.335365853658536

MGM never got the memo and thus when the movies were transferred to HD they suffered more grain than a Cambodian rice patty. While there is an extras disc alot of DVD extras didn't make the way over.

But this is as good as the immortal movies are going to look unless MGM takes time to clean up the originals and do a remaster for a future anniversary.

If you want rocky looking the best he ever has...wait. But if you need your Rocky Fix or want to teach you children how to step it up and never back down. Well no brainier buy this set.

Rocky deserved better than this. A remaster of Rocky I-IV and Balboa no Rocky V (NOBODY wants Rocky V) with commentaries for each film would be perfect but for now, if this is all we get I'm semi satisfied.",1339718400,,989,4.082474226804123

The video quality of the first five Rocky movies is not very good.  Some of the worst grain I have seen on Blu-Ray.  The 6th movie, Rocky Balboa, had better video quality (not great, but good), but instead of having DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio like the first 5 movies, it only had Dobly Digital 5.1.

ROCKY: THE UNDISPUTED COLLECTION on Blu-ray... Just a bad joke.

I know, they are an old movies, but I have older movies than this one with much better look.

The video quality on this movies are so much grainy... Worst than an old dvd... There are not restored, there are not remasterized... Rocky, the undisputed collection is about how to make an awful work, just to sell and play with memories.

I don`t return this item because I don`t live on USA, and return cost is higher than the product`s itself.

Okay we could probably all do without the Rocky 5 movie which I felt was the one sadly pathetic movie in the series. I do like 1-4 and 6 a.k.a. Rocky Balboa was kind of a cool modern twist even though in reality I think the old Italian Stallion would've been turned into Italian Sausage fighting such a younger current champ.

3197252,5,B000W668R6,"The odds were equally stacked against Sylvester Stallone as they were against his creation, the fictional southpaw boxer Rocky Balboa - a million to one shot. Languishing in obscurity as an extra in small films, Stallone managed to sell his script, about a Philadelphia club fighter who gets a shot at the World Heavyweight Championship, and an American cinematic icon was born. Spanning six films, the Rocky series stands as one of the most lucrative franchises in Hollywood history and has truly penetrated the cultural lexicon.

In Rocky, washed-up Philly boxer Rocky Balboa is granted the chance of a lifetime. Hand-picked by boxing champ Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) as his next opponent, Rocky Balboa (Stallone) must find the physical strength under the tutelage of scrappy trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) and the courage to go the distance and prove that he's ""not just another bum from the streets."" But even if he doesn't win, at least he will find love and self respect in the arms of Adrian (Talia Shire). Rocky won the 1978 Oscar for Best Picture, made the name ""Adrian"" an annoyance to anyone bearing the name, and inspired countless people to run up staircases and throw their fists in the air triumphantly.

In Rocky II, The Italian Stallion tries to start a family and a new life away from the boxing ring. Despite partial blindness in his right eye sustained from his first bout with Creed and a wife clinging to life, Rocky is lured back to the ring for a rematch that will literally come down to the last second.

Rocky III takes the series in a slightly more surrealistic directon. Rocky's partial blindness is never addressed again for the rest of the franchise, and Rocky's opponents become more like caricatures, in the form of flamboyant wrestler Thunderlips (Hulk Hogan) and grimacing, mohawked brawler Clubber Lang (Mr. T). Life as the world champion has made Rocky complacent after a string of easy fights. But after being soundly beaten by Lang, Rocky finds an unlikely ally in former foe Apollo Creed, who trains Balboa in his own style so he may regain the ""eye of the tiger"" and reclaim the championship from Lang.

Rocky IV veers directly into the realm of 80's anti-Communist propaganda absurdity and MTV slickness, as Rocky finds himself taking on roided-up Russian superfighter Ivan Drago, who possesses a 1800 PSI punch - harder than actual gunshots! Synth-accompanied training montages abound as Rocky mourns Apollo's death at Drago's hands and heads up to snowy Siberia in order to prepare for the fiercest fight of his life.

In the aftermath of Rocky IV, Rocky finds himself brain-damaged and inexplicably broke in Rocky V. Seems that Rocky's brother-in-law, Paulie (Burt Young), signed away power of attorney over the Balboa fortune to some shady lawyer who loses all the money. Forced into retirement by his scrambled noggin, a much more punch-drunk Rocky sells off his remaining belongings and moves his family back into his old Philadelphia neighborhood. Rocky reopens Mickey's boxing gym and takes a young fighter, Tommy Gunn (Tommy Morrison) under his wing. Tommy quickly rises up the boxing ranks, but betrays Rocky by signing with Don King-esque promoter George Washington Duke (Richard Gant) in order to get a title shot. Gunn wins the title easily, but fears forever living in Rocky's shadow. He calls out Balboa, culminating in a bizarre fist fight between teacher and student on the cold Philly streets. Rocky emerges the victor, yet somehow avoids being arrested while Gunn gets taken away by the cops. Stallone's desire to return the character to its roots after the increasingly cartoonish direction the series was taking is understandable, but having Rocky lose the fortune he fought so hard for and earned over the course of four films is just depressing, let alone the ""shady lawyer"" angle seemed highly contrived. Rocky V remains the most confusing, misconceived installment in the franchise, and left a bad taste in everyone's mouths, including Stallone's.

Stallone sought to make up for Rocky V with Rocky Balboa, which finds an aged Rocky (Stallone himself was 60) the owner of a a Philly restaurant where he indulges its patrons with stories of his glory days in the ring. Looks like the Italian Stallion has found an opponent even he can't defeat - time (though his brain damage is forgotten, much like his partial blindness). Adrian has since died of ""woman's cancer"" and Rocky Jr. (Milo Ventimiglia) is now an emotionally distant businessman. After a simulated boxing match on ESPN finds Rocky the victor over current heavyweight champ, the absurdly named Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (Antonio Tarver), Dixon challenges the long-retired Balboa to an exhibition match. Balboa, longing for one more throwdown, accepts the invitation and sets out to prove that the last thing to age is your heart. Though Rocky Balboa (the film) prescribes to the Rocky formula established from the very beginning and the prospect of a sextagenarian - with or without brain damage - being allowed to take on anyone in a sanctioned boxing match is more than a tad outlandish, this final installment (which Stallone assures us is the FINAL one) feels the most genuine since the original, as Stallone imbues his most iconic character with his own frustration with growing old and that lingering desire to make good on past regrets (like Rocky V) while he still can. With Rocky Balboa, the story finally feels whole.

You'd have to have a heart made of stone not to feel for the wonderful character played perfectly by Sylvester Stallone.  And while the overall quality of these six films may vary, the heart and character does not.

This blu ray release is very good but with a few caveats.  First off, the original needs (and deserves) a restoration along with a more beefy extras package.  Some extras from the DVD didn't make it (inexcusable really), while Rocky 2-5 deserve a little more love too.  I wouldn't expect full restorations, but surely an audio commentary for each isn't too much to ask.

3197258,4,B000W668R6,"Received this box set around 9/15/2010.
This review is broken into 5 categories: Packaging, Plot, Disc Quality, Movie Quality, Extra Features

Packaging: 4/5
Box art looks like it's from Rocky Balboa, no frills, WYSIWYG.

Plot: N/A
I won't go into it because I'm assuming you've seen any number of these titles if you are interested in the box set. But overall it's a story of overcoming obstacles and believing in yourself. All family friendly except Rocky 5 has some slight language, but nothing to extreme.

Disc Quality: 3/5
Rocky and Rocky Balboa have professional looking menus and the disc themselves look different than the other four movies. 2,3,4,5 all look like standard blu ray discs with just the name of the movie on them and a still frame for a menu. Don't expect any commentary.

Movie Quality: 4/5
If you've seen older movies put on blu ray with minimal restore then you get the idea with these. Rocky 1 looks the worse, some clipping and sometimes grainy, didn't notice too much blur on 120Hz. Rocky 2 is a little better, not as grainy. Rocky 3 looks like most 80s blu ray movies I've seen (Rambo, Commando, etc.) with some blur. Rocky 4 is exceptional, looks clear, great color and great sound and no blur. Rocky 5 is also clear and the sound is clear as well but you don't know much of a difference, if any, between this movie and 4. Rocky Balboa has some weird lighting but overall obviously it's the best looking one in the bunch.

Extra Features: 2/5
Some nice Sly training videos for Balboa and some making of's but nothing like a reunion episode or documentary looking back with Sly or anything. Pretty much just thrown into the box set.

Overall, I give this a 4/5 simply because it's Rocky and it's the top of the line right now. If you have it on DVD and is it worth it to rebuy it? My opinion would be no because nothing on these discs looks better than up converting a DVD. That being said, it is the latest and greatest format to have Rocky on and if you see Amazon selling it for a good deal pick it up, especially if you don't own any Rocky collection.",1285200000,15,2085,4.473684210526316

Rocky Balboa looked awesome!!! The Transfer was really solid especially when he was in the ring with Mason Dixon. Finally, the packaging fox gives you is really crappy.

I have the DVD boxed set as well as the cable HD broadcast, and now I have the Bluray box set.  Let me start by saying I haven't watched all the movies in the BD set, just the first one.  It is by far the worse picture quality of any versions I currently have.  Even the aspect ratio isn't the same as the theatrical release.  Seeing that the first movie is by far the best, and an academy award winning movie- I would have expected it to have gotten the royal treatment and to look the best.  Even if the rest in the set look great, this is a major disappointment, at least to me.

I know some have said in their review that the PQ wasn't that bad so I don't know, maybe there were bad discs released but I doubt it.  Mine have so much grain and noise I took the disc to another player to make sure something hadn't gone wrong with my bedroom BD player.  It was just as bad.  Actually it looked worse.  In the bedroom I have a 32"" HDTV and downstairs I have a 55"" HDTV and a 106"" projector system.  The bigger you go the worse it looks because all that awfulness gets blown up bigger.  I'd never watch this on my projector yet this is one of my favorite movies and exactly the type of content I use the projector for.

I know this sounds pretty negative but the picture quality really is that bad, at least for my set.  I know the price was great, but if you are expecting Bluray picture quality you will be very disappointed.  This is a bad value at half the price...",1267574400,20,1588,4.022364217252396

3197282,4,B000W668R6,"Alright well all 6 Rocky films in blu ray for 49.99$ (at this date 2/1/2010) is a great deal. The movies themselves look terrific (but could look a bit better not to mention use some Stallone commentary on each film outside of 1&6 which is why this gets 4 stars and not 5) and probably won't look better. Sound is solid and the special features are alright (nice retrospective on the villains tho but where is Mr. T?) so outside of what I listed its a pretty good set.

As for the films lets break it down.

Rocky - The first and a film that continues to be the legend. The little engine that could movie. Amazing film a total classic.

Rocky 2 - Worthy sequel to a classic film. Its still small and intimate as you go through Rocky's struggle. Props for showing Rocky learning to read.

Rocky 3 - So you enjoyed being at the top of the world what happens when you aren't and lose your manager/trainer? Awesome villain, awesome training sequences and still Carl Weathers is the truth as Apollo "" Man when we fought you had that eye of the tiger that edge and we got to get it back! "". Whats stunning is to watch Rocky change his fighting style from hard hitting Southpaw tomato can to right handed speedster.

Rocky 4 - Watched this nostaligic, cinematic gem recently and it still holds up as a goofy, heartfelt cartoon. The film is so damn entertaining and when the "" Theres no easy way out "" montage ends if it doesn't get you a little misty nothing will. Nothing beats the training montages in the Rocky films (man I can't believe those situps Rocky was doing off the second tier in the barn) but here the cinematography in Russia is breathtakingly beautiful.

Plus it's just plain fun to watch... no plot to follow, just kick ass montages and geektastic lines.

It was like in 1-3 they were trying to make great movies, make them respectable and realistic... then when they got to 4 it was like ""aw screw it, let's just make a God damn music video, that's all these films have become any way."" They didn't try to make the movie anything but what it really was, and that's why 4 is so great.

Rocky 5 - The worst Rocky film hands down and a total turd. Its dumb its boring and its ultimately pointless. Stallone originally wrote that Rocky died at the end of brain damage. The studio says no which leads to Rocky Balboa.

Rocky Balboa aka Rocky 6 - A return to form but still not a pox on the first 4 films. Antonio Tarver is not scary, interesting or a good actor on camera thats pretty much a three strikes and you're out. Luckily Stallone knows how to make a film and stage a fight. Its worthy and good but its not very entertaining, fun or rewatchable. Watch Rocky 1, 2, 3 or 4 to experience the real Rocky.

So great blu ray set that almost is 5 stars. Why no commentaries for 2, 3, 4 or 5 Sylvester?",1264982400,3,2808,4.291115311909262

  The quallity of each movies are much better than the previous dvds.  The sound is superb. I have a 76 inch flatscreen tv and surround sound and I'll tell you the quallity of the blu rays make me feel like I'm watching all of them in the theater again. Awesome! If you have a blu ray player, buy these. Much better than dvd.
  If I was to complain about any one thing it would be this- Where are the Director's cut of each one? That is why it is getting 4 stars out of 5. The movies themselves and the blu rays are 5 stars.

3197287,1,B000W668R6,"With all the whining about preorder pricing in the reviews, there isn't enough attention being paid to the fact that this is one of the worst blu ray transfers to date. Obviously Rocky isn't going to fare well compared to UP! or Transformers, but it looks bad compared to the blu ray versions of most older movies as well. In general, even if an older movie isn't going to blow you away, it can at least pull off a crisp, clean picture that looks noticeably better than an upscaled DVD. This is where the Rocky Blu Ray collection fails miserably.

In the early movies, probably 3/4 of the scenes are incredibly soft and look no better than an upscaled DVD. The other 1/4 of the scenes are up to the mediocre standard of the typical older movie and do look better than DVD. If the entire films were up to that mediocre standard I could give a good review, but sadly they aren't. My complaints aren't even about things like film grain, which is a perfectly acceptable stylistic choice. There's just a tremendous lack of detail and definition, and uneven picture quality throughout. One dark scene will look acceptable, then the next will be incredibly washed out with regions that are supposed to be black showing up as light gray. In Rocky 2 there are even odd white dot artifacts that are incredibly distracting and weren't in the DVD if I remember correctly.

The later films do look better...Rocky Balboa is obviously fine since it was an independent blu ray release. But most of the Rocky movies that are available exclusively in this set look absolutely atrocious. If you already have the DVD set, stick with that and just buy Rocky Balboa on Blu Ray.

fyi: I have a highly calibrated Pioneer Elite plasma and 120 blu rays. The only other ones I have that look close to this bad are Robocop and The Fugitive.",1263340800,36,1812,4.569230769230769

I recommend this set to any Rocky fan.  These films have never looked better.",1261699200,3,366,4.65625

While they obviously could have done a better job cleaning these up, they are for sure better than the DVD versions.  But it's still a decent transfer...I'm sure there they will eventually be completely remastered.

As for those of you complaining about the price droppings...have you noticed the significant drop overall in blu-ray pricing?  Now the blu-ray is becoming more mainstream, the prices are coming down!  If there are no advantages to pre-ordering, then don't get it!  Everyone has had a situation where they paid for something and later saw it cheaper and lost a few bucks.  Amazon is still cheaper than going out to Best Buy or Wal-mart and getting it.  Factor in that the majority of Amazon users don't have to pay tax and can have the items shipped to you for FREE, then that is even more in savings.

3197290,5,B000W668R6,"These people complaining about the price being wrong or whatever dumb idiot nonsense they are rambling about has absolutely NOTHING to do with Rocky on Blu-Ray. They need to be removed ASAP. This is great i have always loved the rocky movies probably because of some of my own insecurities in my life and its the only underdog movie that i enjoy. I've never  been a fan of the comeback, we can do it, football, or Finding Forester, Rudy type movies, but Stallone has always managed to make you feel what he's going through in all off the movies, even if some of them are a little forced and something you've seen in the others. The quality is great, i mean its not like todays filmed in 1080p films like Transformers, or computer animated stuff like today. But who cares its just rocky:) The copies i had which i copied from DVDs from the local video store don't really stand the test of time, and this is an excellent way to preserve them for the future. This along with other classic films deserve to be restored to the best technology has to offer. Heres a list of the Rockys as i like them. And some others i can't wait to see on blu ray.

Rocky III-I was 1 when the first came out, so this is the first one i was exposed to with ""Pity the Fool"" Mr T. Man he should have gotten an oscar!! lol
Rocky I- Of course it started it all, i just never really saw it much when i was younger.
Rocky V- For some reason i really liked this one, because he went back old school, and actually DID street fighting, great scenes in the end, i had saw the others already but got really pumped with this one(odd i know).
Rocky IV- Good, low budget compared to the others, Russian, Dulph Lungdren was a bit enhh so so. Good songs in it though.
Rocky II- for some reason i couldn't get myself to highly enjoy this one till the end, to much of Rocky being down, and doing commercials, but very classic acting by the legendary Burgess Meredith(RIP).
Rocky Balboa- Kudos to Stallone who was more ripped at 61 in this movie than he's ever been in his life, was great but waiting nearly 17 years i thought was a bit of a mistake, still touching though, in that Rocky sort of fashion HA.

More titles to look forward to on blu ray

1. Jurassic Parks-GRRR Hurry up Steven
2. Indiana Jones-Again HURRY UP STEVEN!!
3. Aliens-Hurry up James Cameron, Ridley Scott, David Fincher and whoever made the other one.
4. War Of The Worlds-Should have been hear already.
5. The Abyss- Strange but i loved this one.
6. Star Wars-Coughs George(old ones i could care less about the new ones)
7. The Core- Most hated it, i dug it, corny but some cool effects.
8. Lord Of the Rings- I""M NOT SETTLING FOR THE THEATRICAL RELEASE IN DECEMBER!! I'll wait.
9. Yep i sure did forget..oops...Back to the Future Trilogy--Come on Robert Zemekis and Stephen!
10. Also i love the two Grudge movies, i have the first, second hasn't come out yet, steet clear of 3!
11. Also the Ring, even the second one isn't half bad.

Not gonna sit and rack my brain, but there are others, so back to Rocky, if your a fan, and you want these classics on Blu Ray with a great quality picture an sound, and lots of bonus features, pick it up.

BTW-Amazon people, go to your local wal mart unless you live in a cave and pick it up for just 54 bucks plus tax. I rarely order anything, and you should probably guess if it says 49.99 on here and its cheaper than wally world that its a mistake, be more careful next time.

3197294,1,B000W668R6,"I've read a remark by another Amazon customer (Regina A. Walter ""chingbong"") and I have to say I am in total agreement with her.

I am a prime member and have been for 2 years now.  I have pre-ordered many blu-ray titles months early (in some cases) and I am more than a little ticked off to find the same title cheaper the day of release or the day after.  What this is telling me is NOT to pre-order from Amazon because in doing so, you are guaranteed the HIGHEST price.  It is seemingly much better to pre-order elsewhere (shop around for the very best price) and then cancel if Amazon lowers the price on or after release day.  Even better would be to return EVERY blu-ray to Amazon where you have paid more for it and then re-order it at the lower price.

This may seem like a minor quibble, but if you buy a lot of movies this process of paying a higher price for the same item can be expensive and in this economy, why throw money away?

It used to be that Amazon would refund the difference within 30 days from purchase if the title went down in price.  Amazon stopped doing that last year.  At first I thought what's a couple of dollars to me ... but when you add up a couple dollars times 20/30/40 titles, that gets expensive.

So yes I ordered Rocky at $49.99 today.  A deal for me but not for others.  Fair?  IMO, NO.",1257724800,11,1329,4.18503937007874

All those people who ordered at the higher prices, do not get the lower price, even though they probably still have not yet received the item.  Most would agree that this is dishonest.

It's amazing how an unknown actor Sylvester Stallone (back in 1976)wrote and insisted on playing the role of Rocky and it made him a global Icon. Rocky is a movie that should be watched by every single person who is willing to fight to have a little peice of dignity in their life. A true underdog story that motivates and inspires. I can't wait to watch all 6 movies over and over and over..... ON BLU RAY.

3197307,4,B000W668R6,"This boxset comes with all 6 of the Rocky movies, I recently bought this boxset at a slightly reduced price.
I personally enjoyed 5 out of the 6 Rocky movies, for me that is enough of a percentage to get this boxset. Can you guess which one I don't like? Sorry, but i'm not going to surprise you here. I think Rocky 5 is the worst in the series, however I overlooked the fact that it came in this boxset as I really enjoy the other 5.

Rocky is a classic, undoubtedly. Rocky 2 was a good a sequel as one could hope for considering, i mean how do you follow up a classic. Rocky 3 was an enjoyable romp with a truly memorable bad guy. Rocky 4 is a guilty pleasure which has some enjoyable moments. Rocky 5, the least said about this one the better. Finally Rocky Balboa (number 6) is a great finish to the series, although Stallone does look quite old the acting and boxing is quite believable.

 All-in-all a good boxset with only 1 of the 6 movies a down point other wise it is worth owning. Not quite a 5 star because Rocky 5 is so poor and Rocky 4 is only a 3 out of 5 star movie.

-First off, all of the movies are anamorphic for 16X9 T.V. sets, in case anyone was concerned of the picture format like I was.
-Second, the extras on the dvds for the first 5 films are an original movie trailer for each, and some additional bonus material on ""Rocky Balboa"".

3197323,4,B000W668R6,"This is good movie, but it is not the greatest sports film of all time. It works because it is a basic story about a guy who has been a loser all his life getting the opportunity of a lifetime to finally make something of himself. It also works as a love story between two people who basically are misfits finding each other and falling in love. The only complaint I have about it is that it is too basic a story and the characters have been seen in movies like this before. The main thing that saves it is the fact that even though Rocky doesn't win the big fight at the end, he still comes off as a winner at the end. However, the main thing that ruins this film's reputation are the endless sequels that came after it.

Although I saw it on HBO, I wondered if the other two were going to be on as well.  So, I waited for years and years until 1996, when I saw the whole set up to Rocky V.  After purchasing the set, I set up a week to be officially known as Rocky Week and started with Rocky.  As I continued to watch them, I understood why it was known as best picture thirty years ago and the more that I watched, the better I like the story.  The second Rocky was even better then the first and then, came Rocky III.  However, Rocky IV was too brutal but, it did show that even boxing can be dangerous and it is even possible that someone could die during the match as Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) did.  Then, I finished Rocky Week with Rocky V.  For the next several years, I wondered if there will ever be another Rocky and then came Rocky Balboa.  The sixth and final movie of the saga.  I loved the end when the people of Philadelphia were climbing up the Rocky steps and imitating Rocky.  Maybe someday, I can do it too.  Rocky, I Love You!",1219881600,,1136,4.090497737556561

Rocky is a story about a broke boxer just livin life as happy as can be. Then hes givin a shot at the title against the world heavyweight and he becomes a legend.

3197334,4,B000W668R6,"Being a relative newcomer to the Rocky movies, I felt like I needed to get this set so I could own all of the movies on DVD. More or less, I AM pleased with it. I already owned the Collector's Edition of Rocky I but considering that I didn't have the rest of this great Saga, why not?

There are no special features (unless trailers count and in my book, they don't) on Rockys 1-5. Rocky Balboa comes with a pretty decent amount of special material to dig into though. All of the films come in slim cases and the set box itself looks pretty nifty on your DVD shelf.

Finally, there are the movies themselves and, depending on one's point of view, vary in quality. In this reviewers personal opinion, Rockys 1-3 are fine movies in their own rights while 4-5 are the obvious sour spots and Balboa ends the Saga on a high emotional note.

Whether you are a fan of good boxing movies or Sylvester Stallone in general then this set WILL please you if you're not big on special features. But if you wanted one of the best film sagas ever made in a set packed full of special features all over the place...keep waiting for MGM to release a more proper collector's set in the future (hopefully).
