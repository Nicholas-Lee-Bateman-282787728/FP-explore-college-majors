This series achieves that goal and is highly entertaining and a high quality read,
THe timeline across the first 5 books is very well handled, the fight of the human spirit to survive is always shininh through. Just loved these book and I would think the race to play juliette on screen will be fierce because she is Kartnis squared",1472342400,,479,4.393258426966292

I noticed this DVD was offered by a massage table company and I threw it into my basket as an after-thought when I checked out with my table. I figured as I embark on massage, protective maintenance for my hands would be a good idea. I felt a little crazy - a whole DVD just for my hands?

Well, I was in for a shock. After the very first session, my hands felt unbelievably supple. It actually was like having 20 year old hands again! They felt just as they felt in the days when I was a violinist. I can hardly wait for my husband to try this out. He suffers from carpal tunnel/computer keyboard syndrome and I think this may really help him, too. Now, I think a whole DVD just for my hands is the LEAST I can do for them.

The guy who figured out these stretches/exercises really knows his stuff. I guess his life was/is his hands and out of necessity he had to figure out how to keep them in top form. This DVD is well worth it. It's nothing short of brilliant.",1280448000,2,1066,4.165048543689321
