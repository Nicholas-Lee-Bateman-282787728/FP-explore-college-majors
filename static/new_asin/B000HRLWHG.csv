8598994,5,B000HRLWHG,"In viewing the DVD, it's clear that Peter Browne has mastery of his instrument. If you're trying to learn the Irish B/C Button Accordion, this is a good one to have in your library. Not a lot of verbal explanation, but plenty of examples of how to play it.

I've taken a couple of drill-type exercises from it, so far, and as I get time, I'm sure it'll reward the effort.

If you're trying to learn the flute or fiddle, not a lot here, but if it's accordion of the 2-row B/C variety, it's a winner.",1381190400,3,498,4.177083333333333
