7982420,5,B00008G1QN,"This is a wonderful movie, directed by the band's helmsman, Barry Andrews.  It's a visual meditation on City, any city, the soul of City.  Featuring tracks from the companion album, 'Sacred City,' it tells the story of a man and a boy who find themselves in London, and it follows their separate experiences until they meet one another by chance.  The movie is framed by a woman who narrates her thoughts and spiritual conclusions regarding City, making the movie an almost religious experience.  It is an absolute wonder to experience, for it's more experience than just viewing a movie.  The movie is incredibly rare so, if you have the chance and the money to obtain 'Sacred City,' definitely take it!",1368230400,,704,4.833333333333333
