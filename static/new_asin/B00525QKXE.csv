8453540,2,B00525QKXE,"This should have been decent, given the following factors: [1] Vampires, [2] Vegas, [3] Tony Todd, [4] Jim Wynorski. The plot wasn't awful (at least not in the beginning), but the same can't be said for most everything else. What went wrong?

For starters, Vampire in Vegas (VV) seems to have been filmed in L.A. rather than Vegas. It costs money to shoot a scene on Vegas casino property, and money is not something director Jim Wynorski was given much of here, so don't expect to see anything you may be familiar with in Vegas (except during the opening credits). Wynorski is accustomed to wrapping movies on a low budget, but in this case he was probably given a C budget, only enough to pay for ~2 actors with any name recognition whatsoever (GiGi Erneta, Tony Todd); the remainder was probably mostly spent on locations.

So what is VV about? Basically, Todd's character Sylvian craves power; since he is relegated to operating at night (or behind tinted glass), he seeks a means of not being limited by daylight. Sylvian believes that if he can overcome this major obstacle, he will rise to a position of great power in politics and help vampires take over the world instead of being cursed to live in the shadows. So nothing less than the fate of the human race is at stake [pardon the pun]!! Sounds great, but it goes nowhere other than a vampire strip club (where the strippers apparently don't strip).

The last movie I remember seeing Tony Todd in was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-From-Earth/dp/B002XJDV16/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man From Earth</a>; he was perfect for that role, which clearly demonstrated his fitness as an actor. His problem in VV is over-acting; perhaps egged on by Wynorski, hamming it up doesn't befit Todd. The first 5 minutes of VV is a monologue by Todd, and actually it seemed like a promising film was being set up. How quickly things can fall apart...
The other actors aren't worth mentioning. Most of the actresses had breast implants (probably the norm for C actors) and wore cleavage-happy getups, but don't expect nudity in VV, even during a sex scene in the first 15 minutes (unless you consider an actor's back [above the waist] to be nudity). This is a departure from Wynorski's earlier vamp flick&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vampirella/dp/B000092T4D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vampirella</a>), in which gratuitous boob scenes were thrown in just for the hell of it.
Anyway, you have to wonder if Tony Todd didn't just surrender at some point and decide to act like Count von Count (from Sesame Street) when he realized just how bad this was turning out to be. In the history of film, there are precious few African-American vampires as central characters, so it's kind of a shame that he was stuck in a stinker. Who knows, though: maybe Todd just wanted to goof around and have some fun for his paycheck.

If you enjoy laughing at C movies, then maybe consider this; otherwise, avoid unless you are either a Jim Wynorski devotee or a diehard Tony Todd fan.",1443139200,,3111,5.094117647058823
