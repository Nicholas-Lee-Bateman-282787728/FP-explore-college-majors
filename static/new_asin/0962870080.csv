172315,5,0962870080,"I saw the world premiere of HAPT at Defcon this summer. I had been anticipating seeing HAPT for months, after we met Ashley in 2007 while filming. I have to say, after all the anticipation, we were not let down. This film gets up close and personal with the hacker community, and opens your eyes to the fact that, hackers-- are just like everyone else, except they take things an extra step and want to know how things work and are scary. From music, to computers, to network security, to lockpicking -- Ashley Schwartau does an excellent job of taking the mystery out of the guys with black clothes and funny hairdo's and puts a personality behind them, helping you realize that-- as the movie is titled -- Hackers ARE people too...

I highly recommend this film especially if you have a gf, wife,  or sig other that just doesn't understand why you are up all night on your computer ;) (Oh, and love the 1337 price!)",1219968000,,917,4.485029940119761
172316,5,0962870080,"Hackers Are People Too took a delightful peek into the hacker community.  I particularly enjoyed the comfortable aspect of the documentary; it was as if the camera wasn't even there, like I had just been plopped in the middle of a Defcon.  By letting the hackers tell the story really strengthens the goal of the movie and each of the interviewees brought something to the table, whether it was comic relief, cynical remarks, enlightenment, or a heartwarming tales of connecting with people or developing a sense of belonging.  This is a community I knew little about and after watching this film, I do want to hug a hacker, I want to know a hacker, but I especially want to thank a hacker for breaking things, improving things, being curious, asking questions, and solving problems, and allowing me to safely use the internet.  And I want to thank Ashley Schwartau for making this film and sharing this community she loves with the rest of us!-",1219363200,10,945,4.7439024390243905
172317,5,0962870080,"As Rodney Dangerfield says, they just don't get no respect! But now Schwartau's latest film,  Hackers are People Too is about to change all that.  Schwartau has exposed this group of geeks for what they are, hilarious, sincere, and faster than a speeding bullet to kink the cables of black hats everywhere. So, mothers, when your little darling says he or she wants to grow up to be a Hacker, after seeing Schwartau's film, you'll want to celebrate!",1219276800,5,449,4.743589743589744
172318,5,0962870080,"I saw this film at an early screening and it was fantastic! This film is an awesome introduction to a dynamic community  that does not get the positive attention it deserves; but never fear, all of my preconceived notions about what a ""hacker"" is have been completely eradicated by this great documentary! Completely entertaining, sincere, and thought provoking. I'd recommend it to anyone.",1218931200,3,390,5.190476190476191
172319,5,0962870080,"Great Movie, Entertaining, Educational, Funny, Good People. Yes, I'm talking about hackers.  Check it out it's a great flick..",1218931200,2,126,5.631578947368421
172320,5,0962870080,"It has been a long time since a ""real"" hacker documentary has come out, but I don't know if any of them has portrayed the hacker community as truthful and respectful as this one. Hackers Are People Too, gives an inside look at a couple of the best hacker conferences on the west coast. This documentary has interviews with ""heavy hitters"" of the community but also with some of the more unknowns. Ashley (the director) got rave reviews at the screening, a standing ovation was given by over 500 hackers. This movie discusses *exactly* what I would want to portray of our community. An emotional, humorous, and informative ride, this movie will hopefully contribute significantly to changing the current ""bad hacker"" stigma.",1218931200,5,723,4.934426229508197
172321,5,0962870080,"I just watched HAPT.  I always thought hackers were those bad guys sitting in their mothers basements trying to get to my credit card information.  After seeing this film, I realize they are just like us.",1218931200,2,204,4.638888888888889
172322,5,0962870080,"I really enjoyed watching this movie.
The content is very truthful and accurate.
I saw the screening at DefCon and it was fantastic!",1218931200,,132,4.782608695652174

172324,5,0962870080,"Hackers are people too. A great title for a great film, that looks at the real lives of Hackers. I look forward to seeing more from this studio!",1226966400,,144,4.178571428571429
172325,5,0962870080,"Want a better idea of what is really behind the 'hacker' title? Well, you need to watch this documentary! It is well worth the $$$!!!! Very informative, creative, and enjoyable!! YES, hackers are people too!!!",1226620800,,209,5.0
172326,5,0962870080,This documentary blew me away. I was so impressed that it kept me riveted since I was so unfamiliar with the subject matter. And thats what a good film is supposed to do: grab your attention and keep your attention. The fact that I walked away informed with a new base of knowledge only made the experience that much more beneficial. Ashley is a filmmaker worth keeping your eye on. I expect great things from her in the future.,1225324800,,428,4.430379746835443
172327,5,0962870080,"A thoroughly enjoyable short film, that does a great deal to flesh out the 2-dimensional hacker stereotype.  The documentary provides the audience with an insight into a community and culture that may otherwise be inaccessible to them, and presents a playful, intellectual and artistic spirit that the average luddite might not think to attribute to these 'computer nerds'.",1225238400,,373,5.431034482758621
172328,5,0962870080,"Humorous, yet thought provoking. It gives you a whole new perspective on the world of hackers.",1225238400,,94,4.9375
172329,5,0962870080,"""H4ck3rs are people too"" gives a fresh voice to the too often maligned sub-culture of hacking. Ms. Schwartau does an amazing job of allowing the subjects of her film to speak for themselves, giving us an insightful, honest look into their relatively unexplored world. A world that would do us all well to better accept, for its ground-breaking contributions to the on-line world that so many of us have come to rely so heavily upon, whether or not we are able to comprehend them or their methods.

As we learn in this frank and often funny documentary, hackers are NOT out to steal your identity or your bank account. Anything but simple, but simply inquisitive, the hackers we meet spend the majority of their free time exploring how to make, break and remake systems and equipment, enabling them to work more securely and efficiently, there-by making all of our computing experiences safer and more enjoyable.

Watch the documentary. Hear the other side of the argument before you decide for yourself. But decide for yourself. Don't base your beliefs solely on reports from a fearful, biased government and media that have made snap judgments on yet another fringe group, without really doing their homework first. Hear what the hackers have to say for themselves.

Have you hugged a h4ck3r today?",1225152000,2,1299,4.922374429223744
172330,5,0962870080,"The is a fresh, funny and insightful view into the mindset of hackers. It does not attempt to sensationalize hacking or make it seem like it is anything that it is not, in fact this film is not even about the technology and not really about the culture, but a look at the people themselves that happen to be drawn together by a common love of tinkering and refusing to accept things as how they are or seem to be, rather asking what if in every aspect of their lives. I highly recommend this film to anyone that think they know who or what a hacker is.",1225152000,,552,4.168224299065421
172331,5,0962870080,"I saw this documentary first at (where else) a hacker convention. While some movies out there (Hackers back from 1995) project hackers as mostly malicious, performing illegal actions, and very limited to computer hacking, Hackers Are People Too does a terrific job of actually showing that there hackers are very nice, law-abiding, and vary in subjects overall. This documentary is mostly done with hackers themselves doing all of the talking - what it really does mean to be a hacker, what it means to have the intense curiosity that they all have and their drive, and humanize their image. The world owes hackers ideas like SSL encryption when you do a buy an item online, encryption of your bank information, etc. There are some bad eggs out there, but hackers ARE people too.",1225152000,2,779,4.864661654135339
172332,5,0962870080,Great movie! I was pleased to see that Ashley did such a awesome job showing the world that hackers really are people like you and me. Not only does she make great films but she's also a really cool person to talk to!,1222214400,2,217,4.069767441860465
7793665,1,0962870080,Boring. Much better movies out there on this topic.,1456444800,,51,4.777777777777778

7793667,5,0962870080,Worth taking a look. Provocative and informative into the minds of these particular individuals who are living int the in-inbetween.,1435017600,,132,5.65
7793668,4,0962870080,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this.  I was pleasantly surprised by this because I liked the way they defined Hacker.  I like the mix of interviews.  My only complaint is it was too short.  I wish they would have expanded on some of the ideas -- like the way every thing has changed, some of the great ideas that have come from the Cons, and the role of women.

Overall, I found it interesting and positive.",1409270400,,410,4.205128205128205
7793669,5,0962870080,"A previous review discussed the notion of stereotypes and how, what a surprise, not all hackers fit this stereotype.

Try telling that to every media outlet and politician out there. ""Hacking"" can be anything, but rarely is the definition rigorous, or even accurate.

This movie does a really nice job giving an insight into the culture, and it really is a good representation overall. Yes, the hacking community is not some monolithic group, but it is often portrayed as such, and this movie shows the fallacy of that type of thinking.

It's not a nail-biting, CGI-driven romp through fictional cyberspace. It's not some group of guys secretly hiding out in a basement, lit by green-screens, hacking into the FBI. It shows how the community as a whole just really isn't that different from anyone else, perhaps aside from being more innately curious than average.

It will make you smile. It may make you laugh. If you're in the ""hacker"" community, you'll nod a lot and say ""yup"", then wave to your friends on screen. If you're not, perhaps it will have you second guess this evil, basement-dwelling antisocial monster that is often portrayed. I have seen it a few times, and every time I find another reason to be impressed by Ms. Schwartau's work in capturing the REAL culture.",1374105600,,1280,4.831050228310502
7793670,1,0962870080,"The movie ""Hackers"" with Angelina Jolie and Johnnie Lee Miller is oine of my favorites.  However, this documentary on hacking was boring and out of date by the time it came out of the editing room.",1363996800,,197,4.472222222222222
7793671,5,0962870080,I watch this movie every once and a while and it reminds me why I love this industry. I can't wait for the Defcon movie to come out.,1358380800,,132,3.75
7793672,5,0962870080,"While it only runs a bit under 45 minutes it is a fascinating and accessible look at modern hacker culture. It's nice to see an open and honest look at what hacker culture is today. Also a chance to see dozens of DefCon attendees trying to answer the question ""What is a hacker?""

More accessible and light-hearted than Freedom Downtime, less technical than Revolution OS and more true than any Hollywood studio release. One of the few films that truly deserves the appellation ""hacker documentary"".",1298851200,,499,4.870588235294117
7793673,3,0962870080,"An interesting film...just not much in the way of hard facts.

This short film explains that not all hackers are criminals.  Who would've thought?  Apart from that there's not a whole of information.  Stereotypes are just that.  Rarely does a stereotype define an entire group of people.  Hackers are no different.  This film addresses those assumptions...no more, no less.",1266796800,3,373,5.220338983050848
7793674,4,0962870080,"OK the ""bad hacker"" stigma has been thoroughly brought to light in this film. Lacking is: What are hackers up to today? Something inspirational folks! Examples:Port of the Debian Operating System to the NetBSD kernel; Janus Project PC can scan 300 WiFi networks at once; Ben Heckendorn's Xbox 360 laptop; Datamancer's Steampunk Laptop;  Build Your Own FreeBSD-powered Motorcycle ; hacking perl music;Hacking Philosophy or Philosophy for Media Arts & Sciences.
Much more could have been said.",1247616000,,491,5.4605263157894735
