A little bit too much time spent in the USA gathering up friends and getting on the way. Film would have been perhaps better started closer to arriving in Russia. Russia was a bit of a misnomer too because quite a bit of the film was in former USSER states, not Russia itself. A good amateur effort and credit to those who took the time to put it together.",1262822400,,447,4.090909090909091

Barry and Corinne certainly have a knack of selecting the most historic and beautiful places to show us. This superbly presented DVD opened my eyes as to how interesting, yet sacred this country is. I am truly inspired and can't wait to get the China Part-2 DVD so that I am fully informed before planning my trip of a lifetime!",1250294400,,439,4.641025641025641
