942037,5,6304961693,"Yes, Rod Steiger won for his blistering portrayal of Chief Gillespie, but the award for Best Actor should have been shared with Sidney Poitier.  Both men are superb as they ""play off"" each other in this intriguing  social commentary.
Also, Warren Oates is memorable as a dim-witted  deputy.  He was one character actor who excelled in every role given  him.

942038,5,6304961693,"This movie is marvelously entertaining. It delivers on all levels-- plot, action, performances of the actors and most importantly, the complexity of a region that has fascinated America for years--- the deep south.  Like  the land that it depicts, the story lies within the characters of this  movie. The story is stereotypical to some, but for those who have spent  time in the south, these characters remind everyone of the truth of life in  Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama, etc.  There are more characters per square  mile in the backlands of the South than anywhere else that I have  experienced. This movie captures these characters with an expertise matched  by very few films.  I would have to say that this is one of my all time  favorites, and for repeated watchability, it is way up there. It is a great  movie to own, since it will get watched instead of just collecting dust.",948758400,3,887,4.801324503311259

If you want a true insight  into the South of the 60's, this is the video for you.
Steiger and  Poitier chew up the scenery, each in his own formitable way.
While the  film isn't comedy, it's certainly entertaining and always leaves me wanting  more.  The follow-up films are a disappointment to me.  ""Heat"" is  Poitier at his zenith.",918777600,9,599,4.5046728971962615

Rod Steiger is great as a man with prejudice but a man who comes to respect Virgil by watching him work, and not back down for anyone. It is a great movie.",1517270400,,598,4.348214285714286

942184,3,6304961693,"Review of In the Heat of the Night
Hot Toasty Rag, November 14, 2017

In one of Sidney Poitiers most famous films, he plays a police detective drawn into a murder investigation in the deep South. Everyone in the small Mississippi town is pretty racist, including the local police chief Rod Steiger. They constantly belittle Sidney and call him boy until he cant take it anymore. They call me Mister Tibbs! is his famous line, one so iconic that the sequel to the film was given that title.

While Sidney wasn't nominated for an Oscar that year, ignored for both this film and Guess Whos Coming to Dinner, Rod Steiger won for Best Actor. It was a make-up Oscar for his loss of 1965s The Pawnbroker to Lee Marvin in Cat Ballou.

While In the Heat of the Night isn't a bad movie or performance by any stretch of the imagination, its not the type to get honored for an Academy Awardthen again, neither was Cat Ballou. But, if you're a fan of either Rod or Sidney, youll want to rent this one and add it to the list of famous classics youve seen.",1510617600,,1041,4.355670103092783
942185,5,6304961693,Perhaps one of the best films of all time.,1509840000,,42,3.7777777777777777
942226,5,6304961693,"A spellbinding movie that illuminates while also entertaining.  This was a bold piece of filmmaking back in the day and unfortunately, the subject matter remains relevant.  Thankfully, this murder mystery set in the Deep South is not a downbeat story.  Prejudice provides the mere backdrop, but dignity and power is provided by Sidney Poitier in one of his most career defining roles.  Rod Steiger won an Academy Award for a role that others could have turned into caricature, but this actor transformed into greatness.  The Blu-ray transfer is superior with the now digital soundtrack greatly improved, lending even greater appreciation for Quincy Jones outstanding score.  Norman Jewison filmed Sterling Silliphants adaptation with style, verve and compassion.  This production peerlessly balances a procedural, a civics lesson and a character drama that grips you from the first scene until the last.",1509062400,,903,5.453237410071942
942227,5,6304961693,"RELEASED IN 1967 and directed by Norman Jewison, In the Heat of the Night chronicles events in the town of Sparta, Mississippi, in the mid-60s when a rich entrepreneur (whos going to open a new factory in the area) is murdered and the white redneck police force led by Chief Gillespie (Rod Steiger) enlists the aid of a prim & proper expert detective from Philadelphia, Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier), who just so happens to be black.

This is basically a fish-out-of-water movie with Tibbs having to adjust to the prejudiced social dynamics of a small town in the Deep South just after The Civil Rights Act was passed in 1964 and the Voting Rights Act in 1965. The effect of those laws was only beginning to be understood, particularly the latter one. Sparta had a new voting block and blacks might even be the majority in that county. Regardless, they now had a voice in the democratic process.

Times were a changin and people like Gillespie and the mayor (William Schallert) needed to keep this in mind if they wanted to keep their jobs. Unfortunately, the uncultured deputies weren't necessarily up on this, which explains why, after the mogul is found murdered, Deputy Wood (Warren Oates) rashly zeroes-in on a black stranger in town. Of course they're all shocked to discover Tibbs identity.

Not used to murders of this magnitude, Gillespie humbly realizes that he might need Tibbs expertise for his own welfare (i.e. to keep his job). A begrudging relationship develops where Tibbs slowly comes to respect Gillespie for his openness to change, insights and blunt honesty. The closing scene is actually heartwarming.

There are, unfortunately, a couple of Yeah, right moments, like Tibbs amazing knowledge of fern root. Im sure that bit o knowledge came in handy in Philadelphia!

THE FILM RUNS 109 minutes and was shot in Sparta, Freeburg, Belleville and Chester, Illinois; Dyersburg, Tennessee; and (studio) Hollywood, California. WRITERS: Stirling Silliphant based on John Balls novel. ADDITIONAL CAST: Lee Grant plays the moguls wife while Quentin Dean appears as a sultry teen.

942283,5,6304961693,"I loved this classic movie when I saw it upon its original release, and I still find it captivating on a third viewing.  The plot is a convoluted and very satisfying murder mystery, with the killer revealed at the last moment.  The subtext of a black Philadelphia detective, Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier), stuck in a Southern town temporarily, falling under the supervision of racist Police Chief Gillespie (Rod Steiger) in a town of ""white trash,"" is even more fascinating.  Tibbs faces insults, intimidation, incarceration, discrimination and attempted murder as he courageously and intelligently solves the murder in spite of all the wrong hunches and misguided arrests by Gillespie, which are actually quite funny.  Rod Steiger's acting range is fantastic as he shows ignorance, hatred, vulnerability, courage, and at the end, perhaps even friendship.  Incidentally, here is a true story: from 11/69 to 02/70 I was stationed at Keesler Air Force Base, near Biloxi, Mississippi.  I noticed signs above the restrooms at the front of the Biloxi bus station saying ""White Men"" and ""White Women"" with another sign pointing to the side of the building saying ""Other""--and this was over 5 years after passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act!",1499817600,,1235,5.180904522613066

The murder mystery whodunit was not as fascinating to me as the interaction between Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger. Both actors were superb.

It was absolutely fascinating to me, as a way to illuminate the reasons behind the strife that was causing riots in nearby Chicago and as a portrait of a region in which I had close family.

Mr. Tibbs (Poitier), a New York Detective, is waiting for a train connection late at night.  A Sheriff's deputy picks him up as a suspect in a murder, only to embarrass his boss (Rod Steiger in one of his best performances) when they learn about what he does for a living and how much more he is paid than they are.  Almost as a matter of pride, Tibbs decides to stick around and ask some questions, which the locals most definitely do not want.  Slowly, he gains the respect of the Sheriff, who opens up to him and actually learns about himself in the process.

It is moving and quite profound, even socially relevant.  Recommended warmly.",1473984000,,931,4.409356725146199

So many people mention Newman and Redford in ""Butch Cassidy..."" but that smart ass hip patter plays better as comedy light humor (Abbot and Costello) whereas this movie duo had you rooting for Poitier and wanting to shut Steiger up.  Two of the better journeyman American actors-- I was 18 when this movie was first run in the theaters and I have never forgotten it the way it keep me glued to the seat.

I think anyone will enjoy it, if they can understand and deal with the racial tension.  It is an excellent movie. and in my opinion well written and acted out.  One of my favorite scenes was when Sidney Poiter's character was slapped and he slapped the older white man in the nursery , right back (it was partlythe rhythem of the slaps that made me laugh), and it so shocked the man that he almost cried at idea that ""this black man' had slapped him back.  As I said, I did laugh because I find something funny in every movie, it helps to release the seriousness of movies, sometimes.

A black man passing through a southern white town via train in the 60's and asked to help solve a murder case......priceless!

The scene where the rich white man slaps Mr. Tibbs and Mr. Tibbs slaps the white man back is the highlight of this movie for me.

Sidney Poitier is an extremely talented and FINE Black man, who has great screen presence.

I watch movies to be drawn into the movie itself; this movie does that for me.

Watching the developing relationship between 2 men from ""opposing worlds"" was fascinating to me.  The movie required your attention to see underlying agendas, secrets, people's evolution into more aware human beings.

Sidney Poitier's Detective Virgil Tibbs and Rod Steiger's Sheriff Gillespie seem like men joined together by fate in a setting where they are only exist to get a job done, to see right done over wrong. These two men are inexorably tied by some greater notion that color does not really matter, yet they were inexorably different cast into this world by their cultural differences. That is what makes this film so great. Norman Jewison is a brilliant director. He first and foremost knows how to tackle a story thematically and at the same time entertain you. He is a master storyteller where every element of a film is somehow integrated into an all encompassing single tale touching all our senses in the process. As for Sidney Poitier, this is his film .

The scene where Endicott slaps Poitier and gets it back with vigor still surprises me, even though I've seen it a half dozen times... and Poitier having a drink at Steiger's house is worth the price of admission.

944118,5,6304961693,"Almost forty years has passed and this is still one of the very, very few American movies worth watching. Although the some small parts of the dialog have aged badly (who thought it was a good idea to have Virgil Tibbs use phrases like ""dig it"" and ""I can bring this cat down""?) the movie still has the power to shock and captivate. It's the small details that are so well done, and the shots held long past the point any modern director or editor would dare in our contemporary world of jump-cuts and eight-second attention spans. The contrast between the educated and intelligent black man and the whites who are all at least thirty IQ points adrift of average would seem over-done were it not for the fact that there are still places like Sparta all over the deep South.

The only odd thing about the Amazon Instant Video version is that it has - for reasons that elude me entirely - Italian sub-titles that pop up every time the camera lingers on a door or a building. We then see the Italian version of ""Police Chief"" or ""Billy's Diner"" etc. Aside from this quirk, it's a great watch-again or for the younger person a first-time experience not to be missed. If Hollywood could make movies like this on a regular basis then American films would actually be worth watching. As it is, CGI long ago supplanted acting, scripts, or any other aspect that would make the tedious outpourings of today's Tinseltown even remotely worth the time it takes to crawl through their tedious stale frames. So if you love movies, take the time to watch this instead. It's truly wonderful.",1404432000,,1574,4.581560283687943

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: ""They call me Mister Tibbs!"" stands as one of cinema's most memorable and passionately delivered lines, but the power emanating from that strongly stated retort stems not just from a disrespected character's indignation over racial bigotry, but also from the nerve those words struck in people all across the country and how they reflected monumental social changes. Blacks rarely confronted Southern whites during the 1960s, but the Civil Rights Movement began breaking down barriers, and 'In the Heat of the Night,' a searing indictment of prejudice disguised as a murder mystery, sought to prove achieving common ground is possible, and racial harmony might not be such a far-fetched idea after all. Norman Jewison's film signalled a changing tide in U.S. race relations, as African-Americans began to forcefully assert themselves and stand up to domineering whites. To quote a film that wouldn't be made for another nine years, blacks were mad as hell, and they weren't going to take it anymore.

Thankfully, we've come a long way since 1967, so the visceral impact of 'In the Heat of the Night' has significantly diminished over time. More of a period piece than a finger-on-the-pulse-of-the-public drama, this engrossing, and meticulously constructed production still strikes a chord, because race remains a hot-button issue. Though the film isn't nearly as shocking as it surely must have seemed back in 1967, its core elements remain affecting, and ironically, from our removed vantage point, some of the behaviour depicted seems more disturbing today than it did 35 years ago, merely because it's hard to believe people really acted in such a reprehensible manner.

In 1967 it was not only unusual to have a non-white actor in a leading role; it was nearly unheard of. In The Heat of the Night's gamble paid off, though, when the film brought home Academy Award for Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Film Editing and Best Screenplay. The story of a big-city black detective stumbling into a murder case in a sleepy Southern town brought together an unusually rich collection of talent. Rod Steiger was a graduate of New York's Actors Studio and one of the earliest students of Method acting, while Sidney Poitier had broken ground with roles that no African-American actor had taken on before. The chemistry between the two onscreen was sharp and complex, while still confined to the framework of a mystery/police procedural.

Shot in the small towns of Dyersburg, Tennessee and Freeburg, Belleville, and Sparta, Illinois, In The Heat of the Night had the perfect atmosphere of a stifling rural town in the South, the type of place where every newcomer is eyed with suspicion. Quincy Jones' roots type music, and innovative score, mingled elements of country blues, bluegrass and rock to evoke the languid tension of the town perfectly.

Perhaps because of its topicality or maybe in spite of it, 'In the Heat of the Night' won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1967. The steamy drama shines a spotlight on issues the film industry seemed reluctant to tackle, and it's easy to see why. Tensions ran so high during that turbulent period, the film's star, Sidney Poitier, probably the most renowned African-American in the U.S. after Martin Luther King, Jr., refused to shoot the picture on location in Mississippi, for no other reason than it was too dangerous. (Illinois was used instead, although Sidney Poitier did finally agree to shoot briefly in Tennessee, so a crucial cotton-picking scene could be authentically filmed.) Almost from the get-go, Stirling Silliphant's Oscar-winning screenplay depicts that uneasy atmosphere in the fictional community of Sparta, Mississippi, where blacks are constantly under suspicion and dutifully live their lives as second-class citizens unwilling to stand up for themselves because they fear their white superiors will unfairly target and retaliate against them.

Virgil Tibbs [Sidney Poitier] knows this world well. Though he's a proud, successful, intelligent, and self-assured man, he's aware of the rules and keeps his head down. But after a local businessman is found dead in the street, an overzealous police officer [Warren Oates] discovers Tibbs patiently waiting for a train at the local depot, and, without any evidence other than the colour of his skin, fingers him for the crime. When he's brought before the town sheriff, Police Chief Bill Gillespie [Rod Steiger], a blustery, gum-chewing bigot who runs his force with an iron hand, Virgil Tibbs reveals to everyone's surprise that he's a northerner and get this he is a Philadelphia police detective who was just innocently changing trains at the Sparta railway station in Illinois.

After his identity is confirmed, Virgil Tibbs, who's also conveniently a homicide expert, is commanded by his Pennsylvania bosses to remain in Sparta and assist in solving the whodunit, much to Police Chief Bill Gillespie's chagrin. Working with a loud-mouthed, hot-headed, and unapologetically bigoted police chief is distasteful to Vigil Tibbs, and Police Chief Bill Gillespie can barely stomach taking directives from a black ""boy"" whom he knows is smarter, more polished, and more skilled than he. Yet this odd couple forms a tenuous partnership fraught with periodic head-butting, and as they become more intimately involved, each earns the other's grudging respect.

The success of 'In the Heat of the Night' hinges not on the cohesiveness of the murder mystery plot (which I found too preciously constructed and mechanically executed), but on the incendiary chemistry between Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger, who often spar like two heavyweight fighters, circling each other in the ring, then pouncing when one lets down his guard. They make quite a pair, but surprisingly their finest scene together isn't a heated exchange, but rather an intimate, low-key discussion about loneliness, family, and dedication to a thankless job. Rod Steiger won a Best Actor Oscar for his riveting, no-holds-barred portrayal; while he's always fun to watch, too often histrionics overshadow his performance. Poitier is more restrained, though at times it seems as if the mantle of ""America's foremost black actor"" weighs him down and lends his work an affected quality that detracts from its believability.

Virgil Tibbs posed several problems to the locals, not only as an outsider and a black man; his knowledge of police work and forensics threatened to embarrass the local police and make them look like backwoods hicks. It would have been easy to make Police Chief Bill Gillespie's character a stereotypical, loudmouthed Southern bigot, but screenwriter Sterling Silliphant imbued him with much more depth than that. By the same turn, Tibbs is shown to be a flawed man as well, with his own pride and cleverness often getting in his way. As the film unfolds, Police Chief Bill Gillespie and Virgil Tibbs slowly come to the realisation that they have more in common than they'd like to admit, and even begin to develop a grudging respect for each other. Thus, a movie that could easily have become obvious and heavy-handed is instead a subtle, character-driven gem.

'In the Heat of the Night' most likely won the Best Picture Oscar for what it says, rather than how it says it. Films like 'The Graduate' and 'Bonnie and Clyde' may possess more artistry, but the rhetoric pales in comparison. For once, substance trumped style, and though this fine film may not pack the punch it surely did in the 1960s, it's still a meaningful and a very important film.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The nicely restored picture distinguishes this 1080p encoded image quality transfer from Fox that maintains the film's original grain structure yet sports enhanced contrast and clarity. A distinct film-like appearance makes viewing a pleasure (though some scenes look more textured than others), and only a few errant dots and blotches sully the largely pristine source material. Much of 'In the Heat of the Night' was shot on location in Illinois (Sidney Poitier was understandably reticent to cross the Mason-Dixon Line), and exteriors exude a surprising richness and depth, thanks to the keen eye of cinematographer Haskell Wexler ['One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'], who experimented with zoom lenses and handheld cameras to achieve a natural, immersive look. Many scenes transpire at night, and lush black levels enhance them, yet crush is rarely an issue, even during the darkest moments. Whites are crisp and stable, and flesh tones are spot-on. (Haskell Wexler was the first cameraman to realise black actors require different lighting to appropriately capture their skin tone and complexion.) Background elements vary from fuzzy to clear, but close-ups are razor sharp, allowing us to see the glistening sweat, hair follicles, and skin blemishes on the characters' faces. And while there's not a lot of intense colour on display, the hues remain true and natural-looking throughout. No banding, mosquito noise, or other imperfections distract us from the action, and no digital doctoring seems to have been applied. Though this is far from the finest catalogue transfer I've seen, 'In the Heat of the Night' looks better than it ever has on home video, and that should please both fans and new Blu-ray enthusiasts alike.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  'In the Heat of the Night' took home the Academy Award for Best Sound, and this 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track honours that distinction with a clear, clean presentation that's free of any hiss, pops, and crackles. Surround activity is understandably slim and limited mostly to Quincy Jones' powerful and, at times, dissonant score. The jazzy music possesses excellent fidelity and tonal depth, and easily fills the room. (The title song, performed with plenty of soul by Ray Charles, and the sounds are particularly full and robust.) Stereo separation across the front channels somewhat widens the soundscape, with directional bleeds adding a realistic touch to several sequences. Accents, such as footsteps in the brush and car wheels crunching on loose gravel, are crisp and distinct, and ambient nuances like crickets achieve a fine degree of presence. Dialogue, thanks to Sidney Poitier's excellent diction, is always clear and easy to comprehend, despite some challenging accents, and the mix as a whole flaunts a tight, well-integrated feel that keeps us focused on the on-screen action. For a film from the mid-1960s, the audio is nicely balanced and just active enough to prick up our ears from time to time.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Norman Jewison, Lee Grant, Rod Steiger and Cinematographer Haskell Wexler: An especially strong commentary from director Norman Jewison and cinematographer Haskell Wexler - with occasional recorded interjections from actors Rod Steiger and Lee Grant is a noteworthy addition to the disc. All the remarks are interesting and substantive, from the extensive discussions regarding the film's photography and lighting to the dialogues about the movie's racial themes, and all the participants express themselves in an articulate and engaging manner. We learn the film's limited budget stemmed from studio uncertainty regarding the project's commercial viability due to its racially charged subject matter; that tension existed on the set between Rod Steiger and Sidney Poitier; and that Norman Jewison worried the film would be viewed as too self-righteous, so he focused intently on the plot's whodunit aspect. Norman Jewison relates his fondness for shooting on location and ""making it up as [he] goes along,"" while Wexler notes the movie was one of the first to substantially employ a zoom lens. Rod Steiger praises his director and defends his ""over-the-top"" portrayal, and Grant recalls her symbiotic relationship with Poitier and how the actor didn't want his race to define him. If you're a fan of 'In the Heat of the Night', then this commentary is well worth your time.

Special Feature: Turning Up the Heat: Moviemaking in the `60s [480i] [1.78:1] [21:10] The title of this documentary is a bit of a misnomer, as the piece concentrates exclusively on 'In the Heat of the Night' and the myriad aspects of its production. Producer Walter Mirisch, director Norman Jewison, composer Quincy Jones, director John Singleton, and some noteworthy scholars are all on hand to weigh in on the challenges of shooting this film and its ground-breaking nature. The characters, acting, score, themes, and artistry of the film are all examined in this absorbing documentary.

Special Feature: The Slap Heard Around the World [480i] [1.78:1] [7:25] The same crew of interviews dissect this ""incredible moment in cinema history"" when a white man hits a black man and the black man hits him back. Many feel the scene prompted a shift in African-American attitudes from the pursuit of civil rights to Black Power.

Special Feature: Quincy Jones: Breaking New Sound [480i] [1.78:1] [13:02] 'In the Heat of the Night' boasted one of the first music scores written by an African-American composer, and this absorbing documentary examines Jones' innovative jazz music, as well as the bluesy title song, which he wrote with lyricists Alan and Marilyn Bergman, both of whom are on hand to share their memories of the experience. Jones himself discusses how he came to work on the picture and his philosophy regarding film scores, and musician Herbie Hancock talks about how Jones opened doors for black composers. Deleted bits of scoring are also included to illustrate Quincy Jones' breadth of talent.

Theatrical Trailer [1967] [1080i] [2:48] The film's exciting original preview is well paced and chock full of potent snippets that pique interest but don't give too much away. The trailer is in rough shape and appears to be from a low-resolution source, despite the 1080p encoded image in the Blu-ray disc.

Finally, 'In the Heat of the Night' might not hold up as well as fellow Best Picture nominees 'The Graduate' and 'Bonnie and Clyde,' but this Oscar-winning murder mystery remains a searing indictment of racial prejudice and discrimination. Letting the theme's inherent power speak for itself (preachy speeches are kept to a minimum), director Norman Jewison crafts an intriguing tale that focuses on the fireworks between stars Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger, and the two actors don't disappoint. Fox's Blu-ray presentation features solid video and audio transfers, and all the supplements that appeared on the previous DVD. Though changing times and social advancements have dulled some of the film's sting, 'In the Heat of the Night' tells it like it was in the Deep South in the 1960s and stands as a potent reminder of where we were and how far we've progressed. That is why I have loved this film ever since I saw it in the cinema and also owning on the inferior DVD format, which is an honour to add this to me ever expanding Blu-ray Collection, as it is the type of film one can view many times and not ever get bored. Highly Recommended!

944174,5,6304961693,"Considering the year this movie was produced, it is truly a work of art in depicting racism and how it goes both directions and how two persons, one white and one black, came around because of their seemingly antagonistic relationship and their reciprocal racism.  1967 was not only the year of the Watts riots, but also about same time the huge race riots broke out in Detroit and Newark New Jersey.  Those of us old enough to have lived during that time recall just how bad things got, and if you do a little research on the web, you can find some very good research papers discussing why all this happened if you are not from that time period.  Some of the best acting by Rod Steiger ever.  I felt he was priceless in this role; no one else could have done it like he did.  This ranks up there with his acting in The Illustrated Man.  Sidney Portier was equally excellent.  Wait till you hear how much Portier says he makes per month as a Philly detective.  Really puts things in perspective as far as now and back then.  Steiger gets upset because Portier is earning so much more than he is.  Houses and salaries were a lot less back then.  Other supporting actors in this are also excellent.  The story is just plain awesome, especially if you grew up seeing the terrible things happening in our country during the 1960's with how whites treated blacks, and how angry blacks became over the economic and housing inequality.  This movie is a masterpiece both in directing and in acting as well as the screenplay.  It is one of my all time favorite movies, I never tire of watching it.",1395964800,,1588,4.449826989619377

The Chester Bridge across the Mississippi River connects Chester, Illinois and Perryville, Missouri.  (7) Many memorable lines by Poitier and Steiger that have become part of film history including ""They call me, Mister Tibbs!"".  (8) Other performances are also noteworthy by Lee Grant, Warren Oates, Larry Gates (the recipient of ""The Slap!""), Beah Richards (always wonderful), Quentin Dean (""Delores"", seen nicely through a window with strategically placed mullions!), and Scott Wilson (As the aforementioned suspect chased down slowly by Rod Steiger, this was Scott Wilson's first film role.  Scott is best known today for his charismatic role as ""Hershel Greene"" in ""The Walking Dead""!  You've come a long way, Scott!  ""In the Heat of the Night"" truly is a classic as are both of Sidney Poitier's other 1967 films:  ""To Sir With Love"" and ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"".

Review of the Blu-ray disc - It provides the best viewing of ""In the Heat of the Night"" yet!  I have the VHS tape and earlier DVD discs and the Blu-ray is nearly perfect.  The colors and the sound have never appeared or sounded better.  It is also the best wide screen version I have ever seen including the original screenings in Atlanta in 1967.

And not just because of its devastatingly direct racial theme--just as relevant today--but because Norman Jewison is one of the very few Hollywood directors that can make an utterly serious movie (or for that matter a comic one) fun to watch. The plot unfolds step by step adding to the mystery of a murder in a Southern town; keeping suspense to a pitch; the characters are believable roughneck southerners, and the two top ones--Rod Steiger, who was rewarded with an Oscar, and Sydney Poitier solidified his place as America's top black actor--and a pioneer-- of his time ""The slap that was heard around the world,"" when Mr. Chips slaps a prominent citizen is worth watching this movie.

The choice of cameras/film evidently gives this less than the stellar sharpness and clarity in blu-ray of some movies made at the time or earlier (""The Ten Commandments,"" ""The Battle of the Bulge,"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" being the gold standards, in my opinion, for blu-rays for the 1950s and 1960s, respectively).  But, alas, ""In the Heat of the Night"" is not a 70mm production.  It's a bit softer and warmer of a picture, but plenty sharp enough.  The sound is good but not special in any way.

All things considered, an excellent job was done remastering this for blu-ray.

However, there is no separate menu, but instead one that can be brought up from the bottom of the screen and then lowered to make it disappear, all while the movie continues to play, and the film always starts immediately when loaded into your blu-ray player.  In this respect, they could have made it seem less cheap.

All in all, though, I'm very pleased to own this blu-ray for its picture and sound quality, the extras (same as on the most recent DVD), and as always, for the best presentation of this fantastic movie itself.",1390608000,7,1585,4.625

Nearly half a century after its initial release, Norman Jewison's film still packs a wallop.  This is filmmaking at its best. Relevant social commentary, exciting story line, superb acting right down to the smallest role and made by craftsmen at the top of their game.  Stirling Silliphant, so familiar to television fans as the writer of countless  ""The Naked City"" and ""Route 66""  episodes has fashioned an extraordinary Academy Award winning screenplay.  Rod Steiger thoroughly deserved the Best Actor Oscar (probably should have also won two years earlier for ""The Pawnbroker""] and is a great foil for the excellent Sidney Poitier but everyone in this movie is first rate.  Who can forget the reaction of Larry Gates to ""the slap""?. Great music score by Quincy Jones and stunning photography by Haskell Wexler.  And according to producer Walter Mirisch, this film cost barely more than $2 million to make!!!  On this disc there are some interesting extras including commentary by Jewison, Steiger, Lee Grant and Wexler plus excellent featurettes which explore African-American reactions to the film and the score by Jones.  If anyone is interested in exploring this film further, along  with the other four Best Picture nominees of 1967, I heartily recommend the superb book PICTURES AT A REVOLUTION by Mark Harris.

The story is compelling, A murder has taken place, and its this big city slicker, who happens to be BLACK; and a NORTHERNER, whose the BEST one to solve the case ;and has to cross over a lot of southern society taboos to accomplish the task. At the end, the crime is solved and mindsets have been at its best ""re-evaluated"" when future similar situations like that come up. It shows that sometimes in life we all have to re-evalutate our views and go outside our corner of the world in order to get to the truth of a matter. It spun off a wonderful T.V. series as well, so if you like this movie, you'll like the TV show of the same name.

Poitier is a class act and devastating to hear of the threats to his life in the real southern setting... spent a lot of time in deep south and Texas and racism is live, well n thriving to this day and northerners are very disrespectful of that culture... race card was pushed over the top i.e. the killer POV diner scene (ugh)... plot was misguided and unimaginative...

Even today, the slap scene remains brutally effective, a reminder of how much has changed in 45 years.  Poitier claimed in his memoir that he agreed to the film only on the condition that Tibbs be allowed to slap back in the soon-to-be-famous scene. He claimed that, in the initial screenplay, Tibbs was supposed to react to being slapped by seething silently, without retaliating. Poitier reluctantly agreed to shoot the slap scene in the South, since that sequence needed to be filmed at an actual cotton plantation. The filmmakers prepared to shoot for three days in Dyersburg, Tennessee. Poitier slept with a gun under his pillow at the Dyersburg Holiday Inn.  Poitier's fears turned out to be justified. The Dyersburg shoot was cut short by local thugs looking for trouble and raising a menacing ruckus in the parking lot of the motel. The production quickly fled back to Illinois for the rest of the shooting.  I applaud the studios finally agreeing to release the blu ray version of this film.  It is long over due.

Now I have to say, this film is very good, albeit somewhat dated and a tad stuffy, and yet it manages to make a statement and feel relevant while being only a token version of relevance.  It has all the elements for a great film, from a riveting storyline, great acting and interesting characters.  Despite the age and the complete feeling of being `removed', it still manages to be a respectable film and one that we should admire.

Sidney Poitier plays Virgil Tibbs, an African-American cop who's falsely arrested for the murder of a rich white man.  Virgil was visiting his mother in a small Mississippi town of Sparta when the bigot sheriff accuses him of murder.  After revealing his identity his services are offered since he works homicide and may be able to help solve the murder.  From that point on we watch as the town fights to kick Virgil out, and we see Sherriff Bill Gillespie (played by Rod Steiger in his Oscar winning role) learn to accept Virgil.  There's a scene where Virgil and Bill are drinking and talking in Bill's home and Bill is talking about how he has no one, no kids, no wife, no friends, and you start to see him as the man he is and not the bigot he was.  This is far more than just a movie about murder, it's a movie about acceptance and change and how one town, brought up with one way of thinking can change that way when they realize their faults.  It's great to see how Virgil goes from the outcast to the respected partner.

Sidney and Rod are great together here, as is Lee Grant as the widow, who in her two short scenes shows enough feeling and emotion to earn her a Golden Globe nod...and the scene where she learns of her husband's misfortune is acting at its greatest.

I'm a fan.  I don't think it should have won the Oscar, especially not up against `The Graduate' (but 1967 was arguably one of the finest years for film) but it is a worthy winner and one that we can't fault too much, especially when you calculate in the time it was made and released.  While it may not hold up entirely with today's audience, in 1967 this was a film that made a difference and had a very loud and necessary voice.",1377561600,,2389,4.36117381489842

944771,5,6304961693,"I've seen this movie many times, and I recently watched it on a quest to freshly watch all movies in the AFI Top 100. It's not surprising that In the Heat of the Night made it onto the AFI 10th Anniversary list at spot #75. What *is* surprising is that it was NOT on the first version of the list. How could such a classic be overloooked? Not only that, but on the first listing they had Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. On this list they took that one off and added In the Heat on. Did they feel both of them represented a ""black white conflict"" in the late 60s Civil Rights era? The two movies could not be more different.

Sidney Poitier absolutely shines as Mr. Tibbs, the top rated homocide detective in Philadelphia who ends up in Sparta, Mississippi one dark, lonely night. When a murder happens in town, the local police naturally figure he did it, as a strange black man in town. He's hauled in and nearly strung up before he's able to show them that he's a fellow police officer. And even so they are rude, demeaning, and obnoxious to him. The others are in town are even worse. When he asks about a motel that will take him, he's laughed at. A clerk at a run-down deli refuses to serve him. And a car-ful of ""good ole Southern boys"" literally chase him down and prepare to beat him to a pulp with chains and pipes.

Every time I see this I am viscerally reminded of just how powerful racism once was. Tibbs would have been shot dead just for slapping back a white man who hit him first. He laughs when being told that he should be horse-whipped. He takes it in stride.

I realize we still have a wealth of racism issues in the US - but I have to hope with all my heart that we have moved beyond this truly atrocious level. It is quite scary to think that this was barely 40 years ago. Within most of our lifetimes, this type of activity was going on in our own corner of the world. It makes me want to renew my effort to ensure that prejudice is removed from our world, and that every person is treated with respect, compassion, and honor.

944773,4,6304961693,"A good detective story is worth seeing at least twice; the second time is after you know who dunnit, you go back and see all the clues that you should have gotten sooner. A writer who plays fair will provide those clues. This is a good story for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is Sidney Poitier, but I've just watched it for the third time, and I still don't spot clues that should have told me.

Sidney Poitier plays Virgil Tibbs, a homicide detective from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who was in Sparta, Mississippi, to visit his mother. While he's waiting for the train back north, he's suddenly accosted by a cop who takes him in without telling him what it's all about, and without questioning him or asking for his ID. Imagine his chagrin (and his chief's anger) when it is discovered that (a) he's a big-city detective and (b) he makes more money in a week than they make in a month.

It seems there has been a murder. The wealthy industrialist who has been planning to build a factory in town and hire at least 1,000 workers is lying in the street, his head bashed in and his wallet missing. When the chief (Rod Steiger) calls his captain in Philadelphia to confirm his identity, the captain tells Tibbs he should assist the Sparta chief, who has no experience with murder investigations.

But then they've got themselves a suspect. A young man was caught trying to race across the Mississippi River bridge into Arkansas, and he was carrying the victim's wallet. The wife of the victim identified the wallet, and that's all Sparta Police Force needed. But Virgil points out that this kid is left-handed, and the murderer was clearly right-handed.

Race and politics, and the strange mind-set of Mississippi crackers, are all involved in the movie, but Virgil Tibbs solves the mystery anyway. The only reason I'm not telling you more is that I might tell you something that constitutes a clue I missed, and I couldn't stand that.

944895,4,6304961693,"This is a classic film from the 60s, where the concern for the social issues (racism, but also feminist ones) are not too far behind where American society had already been heading. Great acting from the entire cast, with everyone remembering Rod Steiger as the small town sheriff. Also, Sidney Poitier continued 'breaking through' as a black leading man (although there is no romance in this story for him).

This film is shot on location, but not in the South. This does create a problem. The story is called ""In the Heat of the Night"", and we are supposed to believe it's in the still-hot summery South, Mississippi. But in many scenes you can see it is late in year and not that warm, in fact, cold enough for them to be wearing jackets zipped up. When they speak you can see their breath.

Perhaps at the time it was too difficult to take on a story like this while filming in a real southern town. So it would have been possible to make Sparta, Illinois stand in for a southern town--if they had shot a bit earlier in the year.

The overall effect of the use of location is a bit jarring. On the one hand, the film makes great use of locations in and around Sparta, Illinois. On the other hand, despite all the great filiming techniques from Wexler, the film looks to have the production values of a Hollywood TV series of the era. So S. Illinois substitutes for Hollywood.

The story does have a few problems. There seems to be too much vacillation over whether or not Mr. Virgil Tibbs is going to get to stay and finish the case. This makes the sheriff seem weak and indecisive and sometimes out of character. And the biggest revelation is that it's the white sheriff who is the 'fish out of water'. For one thing, most of the town people resent him. His own staff disrespect him. This insight about the sheriff really becomes obvious when it's the black Tibbs character who can get to the seedy underside of the town (where blacks and whites mix it up more) in order to solve the case.

Perhaps the issue is a sort of 'split thinking' over racial issues and how it was at the time in the deep South. The story might actually have benefited from having a director from the South.

Still, overall great cinematography and an intriguing mystery story make this a worthwhile classic to watch repeatedly.",1309305600,,2308,4.483333333333333

SYNOPSIS--
After a dead man is found late at night, lying on a sidewalk in downtown Sparta, Mississippi, Virgil Tibbs (Poitier) is detained for questioning at the RR station. Chief Gillespie (Steiger) soon learns that incompetent Deputy Sam Wood (Oates)  mistakenly arrested a Philadelphia police detective. Tibbs is released and Gillespie, who has no homicide experience, asks Virgil to examine the body. A phone call to Philadelphia's police chief makes his compliance mandatory.

Obvious resistance Virgil receives at the morgue is only the beginning of an escalating bigotry he'll encounter while trying to solve this murder case. Gillespie, who at first has as much disdain for Tibbs as his fellow Spartans, sees the injustice in this treatment and becomes the detective's grudging ally. The whodunit presents a number of falsely accused killers including a prominent citizen that Virgil, because of his own prejudices, is convinced orchestrated the murder.

Soundtrack score is by Quincy Jones. Ray Charles sings the theme. Producers wanted Sam the Sham's ""Little Red Riding Hood"" for the jukebox scene but MGM wouldn't license this pop hit, so ""Foul Owl on the Prowl,"" a Boomer & Travis soundalike written by Jones and lyricists Alan and Marilyn Bergman, was substituted. The transistor radio in Sam's patrol car plays ""Bowlegged Polly,"" another Jones/Bergman/Bergman tune (performed by Glen Campbell) that's clearly in imitation of Roger Miller.

The accused Harvey Oberst was Scott Wilson's screen debut. For his very next film, Wilson portrayed one of two killers in Truman Capote's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/IN-COLD-BLOOD/dp/B0000AN4JE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">IN COLD BLOOD</a>&nbsp;(1967).

944900,4,6304961693,"IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT was not only a monstrous hit when it came out in 1967 (helping cement Sidney Poitier's status that year as the #1 box office star), but it also was highly recognized by the critics and won that year's Best Picture Oscar. It's a pleasure to say that the film has not suffered from its timeliness when it was released or from its ""classic"" status: today it plays beautifully, with tension and excitement and terrific performances. After the national awareness of the deep racial rifts and injustices in Mississippi, particularly after the integration of Ole Miss and the murder of the three civil rights workers during the ""Freedom Summer"" of 1964, this film seemed to play on all kinds of anxieties Americans had about equality and justice in that state, and this film came exactly at the right time. The music by Quincy Jones (explored on a feature for this 40th anniversary DVD) and the gorgeous crisp cinematography by Haskell Wexler seemed to signal a new period in cinema that would bear fuller fruition in the next few year with BONNIE AND CLYDE and MIDNIGHT COWBOY; it showed that Hollywood films could once again be exciting and timely.

The core of the film is in the performances by Rod Steiger as the Sparta Chief of Police Gillespie and Sidney Poitier as the Philadelphia policeman who is initially arrested on suspicion of murder simply because he is African-American and a stranger in the town (after being released, Poitier is persuaded to stay on in the town to investigate the murder, of a wealthy industrialist set to build a factory in the town). Poitier's now-iconic Virgil Tibbs is not given much of a back-story, and seems to be there mostly for the townspeople to react against: but Poitier is such a fine actor he genuinely brings out the best in the other performers, as well as getting his famous moments of resistance against white racism (including his famous slapping of Larry Gates and his scathing riposte to Steiger, when asked what they call him in Philadelphia). Poitier gets wonderful actors' rhythms going, first with Scott Wilson as a murder suspect and then with Beah Richards as an abortionist, in two surprisingly quiet sequences that are among the finest in the movie. Indeed, they may only be surpassed by a remarkable scene between Poitier and Steiger, where Steiger's Gillespie begins to sadly open up to his feelings of loneliness to Tibbs and then quickly turns against him with racist suspicion when Tibbs expresses pity for him. (Both Poitier and Steiger show here exceptional agility by turning emotionally on a dime--perfectly-- when called to do so by the screenplay). The film is not perfect: the mystery is somewhat unabsorbing, and some of the actors--including Quentin Dean as the town nymphomaniac and Anthony James as a twitchy counterman--seem to deserve their more two-dimensional parts.

944936,5,6304961693,"It is hard to find a film that makes an unambiguous moral point without a wiff of preaching, but In The Heat Of The Night does this perfectly

Virgil Tibbs, played by Sidney Portier, is arrested in a small southeren town in 1967 for a murder that happend that night. He is black and has cash on him. In those days, that was a guilty verdict. We soon find out, though, that he is a cracker jack homicide detective from Philadelpia, on the way home from visiting his mom, and Tibbs turns from suspect to, grudingly, lead investigator.

Tibbs nemisis in the film is Chief Bill Gillespie, played by Rod Stieger. Gillespie is not a brutal racist, just an old ignorent southerner bigoted by the segragated south he grew up in. His police force is the same, and they all struggle with the fact that Tibbs is smarter than all of them combigned.

There are the expected crackers chasing Tibbs in the film, but the movie is really more about the subtle prejudice that Tibbs has to deal with. Gillespie actually respects and likes Tibbs , but is too bound by place and time to admit this.

The south had JUST desegragted in 1967 and most of the impact had not hit the small towns. By placing Tibbs in this situation, the film deals with not the burning cross or the lynching, but far more intractable raceism that America was just starting to deal with. It does so through the local. Not once are the words segragation or intagration used in In The Heat Of The Night.

Like the issue, then and now, everything happened between a  few people in the smallest of places. This is why the film works in 2009. In 2067, when we are long gone and the civil rights movement is just a page in a history book, In The Heat of the Night will remain daisy fresh.",1257033600,3,1737,4.37888198757764

Newman and Redford starred in several; Sidney Poitier was half of a forced ""buddy"" pairing in The Defiant Ones; here Poitier and Rod Steiger portray a reluctant pairing, but a more natural one than surface indications would suggest.
Early on, the film suggests Bill Gillespie is a different sort than the rest of white Sparta, that, despite being the town's police chief, he has never fit in. While overtly an unregenerate example of the Old South, Gillespie has different values. Some are professional values. Others, personal ones, are deeply hidden -- the film suggests that Gillespie, life-long bachelor, may be a deeply and carefully closeted gay man. Does Virgil Tibbs, also a bachelor, appear to Gillespie a kindred spirit? Or does Gillespie see Tibbs as a different sort of fellow-sufferer, Tibbs's black skin an overt equivalent to Gillespie's hidden social stigma?
Whichever, the two make contact. Tibbs appears to understand something of Gillespie. In the final scene, Gillespie carries Tibbs's bag as Tibbs prepares to climb onto the train. In their parting words, Gillespie offers friendship and Tibbs, cautiously, accepts.
The point, as the movie ends, isn't some grand social message. The point is that two human beings, whose interplay dominated the film, have found common ground.",1242604800,2,1389,5.177777777777778

When I analyze that-it seems to me Mr. Tibbs did little more than guess.  I mean how would he know the girl would try to get rid of her baby?  Why not try to get rid of it BEFORE you tell your brother?  It wasn't like she was showing.

There are certainly many outstanding dual performances to choose from and unquestionably one of the best can be found in the '67 film `In the Heat of the Night'. If you've seen this movie you know exactly who I'm talking about, Sidney Poitier as New York police officer and forensic specialist Virgil Tibbs and his antagonist Rod Steiger as Bill Gillespie, good ole boy and local sheriff in Sparta, Mississippi.

`In the Heat of the Night' is a superior murder mystery in its own right, but it's the visual posturing and verbal banter between Tibbs and Gillespie that elevates this film to the level of classic. Watching their relationship slowly evolve from hated adversaries to a place of mutual respect and admiration is a cinematic event capturing two of the best performances you'll ever see.

945003,3,6304961693,"This film clearly inspired the kind of distinctive 70's era police detective films to come such as ""Shaft"" and ""Dirty Harry"" and even the great score by Quincy Jones evokes memories of the similar sounding ones connected with those two films.  As a detective mystery, this film does a very good job in addition to being a social statement for viewers in the late 60's.  Racism is a sign of insecurity as racists need to feel that there is a class of people worse or below themselves so that they can feel good about themselves.  It was nice to see how much patience and restraint was shown by Poitier's character amid ignorance and just plain stupidity as he reluctantly goes about solving the murder and makes eventually a positive impression on the racist Sheriff.

One interesting scene was when Steiger's character invites Poitier to his home and starts out on a heart to heart with him showing how natural and possible a friendship based upon equal and mutual respect between races can be but then he catches himself when he realises that he had forgotten to keep him in his ""place"" and so abruptly ends a promising friendship bonding between equals to return to the ""status quo"" of discrimination.  This poignant scene shows just how unnatural and ridiculous racism is.

The problem with this dvd version though is that the picture quality isn't restored which leaves a number of imperfections in many of the frames and the sound quality is just mono quality; also there are no bonus features at all.  This is still a good police detective story and a good social statement on the absurdity of racism making it a worthy Best Picture Oscar winner.

That person indicated in their review, that there wasn't anything different in the 40th Anniversary Collector's Edition DVD, of IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT, which was released a few weeks ago, from the original DVD version, which was released, in 2005. When I read that person's review, I said to myself, ""Well, there's no sense buying it again, just for the movie alone"". Then, it occurred to me. Why would the studios release a great movie, like this one, on DVD...call it, ""The 40th Anniversary Collector's Edition""...and not have any special features, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the film?

In 1967 IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT became the best picture. While the story may seem simple on the surface, it is all that lies under the surface that makes this movie exceptional.

Rod Steiger stars as police Chief Bill Gillespie, a bigoted man in the town of Sparta, Mississippi. When a wealthy Chicagoan who was in the midst of building a new factory turns up dead, Officer Sam Wade (Warren Oates) arrest the first man he doesn't recognize in town. Gillespie's badgering attempts to coerce a confession fall short when he discovers that the man in questions is Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier), a homicide detective from Philadelphia visiting his mother.

One phone call clears up the misunderstanding but also launches Tibbs into assisting the local police in their hunt for the real killer. Tibbs methods involve evidence and proof while the locals use brutality and suspicions to roust out a suspect. Each new suspect they bring in, Tibbs clears with the evidence that proves them innocent.

Tensions between the two officers' rise and fall as each deal with their own form of prejudice. While Gillespie's is apparent from the get go, Tibb's is more subtle and seen as he tries to find ways to pin the murder on the local town patriarch, a man who looks blacks as less than men. Both men want to find a solution to the murder, both are using their own methods and both allow their beliefs to cloud their judgment. Can they find the real killer?

The winner of five Academy Awards (Steiger for acting, best editing, best screenplay, best sound and best picture as well as nominations for director and sound effects) IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT defied the expectations of the studio that produced it, becoming a movie that the public and critics both loved. One watching makes it easy to see why as this tale unfolds beneath the mastery of direction and acting involved. Steiger and Poitier were at their best with this film.

The theme of racism is dealt with in an adult and factual manner, reflecting the times as they were. The progress made in 40 years may not seem like much to some, but in watching this movie it's hard to believe nothing has changed. There may be room yet for more, but films like these were stepping stones in the path for acceptance.

As much now as then, those 40 years in the past, this story still needs to be told. At the same time, the changes since need to be explored as well. One of the joys of DVDs offering classic films of the past is the sense of history that we can watch right before our eyes. And in doing so, perhaps we can learn, perhaps we can make a cause for not making the same mistakes again. DVDs may offer entertainment, but they can offer education as well.

This is a sure sign that Amazon has contracted their web design out to a foreign country.  The people setting up each page do not speak English and do not watch American movies.  They looked up a list of players somewhere and picked the first few in alphabetical order.

The really annoying thing is that this is not an isolated incident.  I have been noticing this for months while working my way through the New and Future DVD Releases.  The other thing they do is list the current year as the year of release of all the movies.  So this year, for instance, every movie was released in 2007.  Yeah, I know the DVD was released this year, but many of the films are much older.

The problem with all this is that when I see a familiar title but don't recognize any of the actors listed and see a release date of the current year, I think it's a new remake and look no further.  I have probably missed the release of DVDs of some of my favorite classic films because of this.

I guess I need to look elsewhere for new DVD release info.  Should I also look elsewhere to purchase them?

BTW, I don't see much difference between this 40th Anniversary Edition and the original release which you can still get for much less money.

Poitier plays a black northern dectective Virgil Tibbs, who is arrested in the deep south for a murder he had nothing to with. Steiger is a bigoted local Sheriff eventually forced to work with Tibbs to solve the case. Both the lead performances are truly mesmerising. There are a number of classic scenes in this film of which perhaps my favourite is when the Sheriff interviews Tibbs for the first time and finds he's a policeman.

The film is very well directed by Norman Jewison and won 5 Oscars in 1967, including best actor for Rod Steiger. Quincy Jones also deservedly won a Grammy for his music score. The only extra is the original trailer, which is a shame. However the film itself is so good that the DVD has to have 5 stars regardless.",1182470400,,930,4.497041420118343
945128,5,6304961693,"1967's ""In the Heat of the Night"" is almost a time capsule of an earlier age.  The long-running TV series of the same name has probably blurred memories of this classic, while the raw racial tensions depicted in the movie may have lost some of their edge in the intervening 40 years.  However, the artistry of this Academy Award-winning movie remains vivid and intact.

In the middle of a hot summer night in the small Southern town of Sparta, Mississippi, a prominent white industrialist is found robbed and murdered in the streets.  One of the town constables arrests a black man at the train depot, who seems to have more money than he should.  Only at the jail, under questioning by the town sheriff (in an Academy Award-winning performanc by Rod Stieger), is it revealed that the black man is a homicide detective from Philadelphia named Virgil Tibbs (played by Sidney Poitier).

Thus begins an uneasy alliance between the white sheriff and the black detective, in a race to find the real killer before tensions in the town explode into something uglier.  Along the way, the two will be forced to face their own and each other's racial prejudices.  Poitier's street-savy and professional cop is quick to anger at any affront to his dignity, an attitude not much seen in Sparta.  Stieger's redneck sheriff must walk a delicate line between his slowly increasing admiration for Tibb's skills and the discontent his presence in the case is causing among the townspeople.  The case itself twists, turns, and doubles back on itself to a tense and surprising conclusion.  In the process, the white sheriff and the black detective arrive at a subtle but touching mutual respect that is the real payoff of the movie.

The movie is blessed with a superb supporting cast, especially Warren Oates as a troubled town constable and Lee Grant as the wife of the murdered industrialist.  The cinematography is unforgettable; the viewer can almost feel the stifling heat and humidity of Sparta.  The detail, from the small diner with pies under glass to the sweat-stained shirt and tie and polite drawl of the town mayor, is spot-on.

This movie is very highly recommended as a classic movie experience that has lost none of its bite and its suspense over the years.",1181865600,,2255,4.8359375

945182,5,6304961693,"Winner of best picture for 1967, In The Heat of The Night may have just been another crime thriller or murder mystery, but the profound and topical <especially at the time> subject matter elevated by the artists attached make the movie a must see for any serious film student or student of sociology for that matter.  Race relations, abortion, class struggle and small town politics all play key roles in the story and all are essential to the plot - not merely convenient window dressing.

Sydney Poitier plays Virgil Tibbs, an African American detective visiting his mother in the Deep South.  He hails from Philadelphia where he's the department's top-notch homicide investigator.  When a wealthy businessman is found bludgeoned to death, Tibbs is arrested as a suspect by a less than competent police officer.  After it's learned that Tibbs is a cop himself, he's coerced by Gilespie (Rod Steiger) the local police chief to stay in town so that he may assist with the investigation.  What follows is a murder mystery full of twists, driven by realistically drawn and realized characters all embroiled in small town conventions and taboos as they deal with the disruption of outsiders intensified by the heated racial tensions which were inescapable during the late 1960's America.  In The Heat of The Night may not have been the first major film to deal with race relations, nor is it certainly the last, but it's hard to name one that does it so skillfully and entertainingly.  Chock full of three-dimensional characters who never come off as preachy or artificial, we never doubt their motivation or actions for a second.  And just when we think we can predict what one of them is going to say or do, we're surprised to learn we're wrong.  It's a film which always keeps the audience guessing and thinking.

In the lead roles, Steiger and Poitier both excel.  Each man physically looks the part of their respective roles and Steiger, always a master of accents, nails the lilting tones of a middle aged Southerner perfectly.  When both men are on the screen together, little else is noticed.  Their exchanges are incredibly electric - two master actors displaying their craft and making it look effortless.  The screenplay by Stirling Silliphant captures the flavor of the time and place wonderfully never skirting away from language, which while tame by today's standards was mature, even raw for 1967.  Lee Grant gives a restrained performance as the widow of the murder victim and the only thing wanting about her portrayal is that she's not given nearly enough screen time.  When her character demands that Tibbs act as lead on the case or else she'll use her wealth and influence against the town, it's neither forced nor contrived.  She knows that Tibbs is simply the best person for the job and no skin color, stink of cronyism nor risk of small town cops losing face in the shadow of a high paid big city counterpart will or should sway the decision.

The movie spawned a sequel, ""They Call Me Mr. Tibbs."" and subsequently a long running TV series starring Carol O'Connor of All In the Family fame filling in the role of Chief Gilespie.  Clearly the characters contained so much depth they could carry on with many other stories.  It's arguable that for both Steiger and Poitier, few other films or roles are as identifiable or as important to their reputations or career than the ones they create here.

In The Heat Of The Night remains a groundbreaking film, but is always accessible and adheres to the cardinal rule of good film making:  it's great entertainment.  While today's crime stories and murder mysteries contain multiple car chases and set pieces for maximum shock value, In The Heat of The Night quietly and powerfully still stands up and remains still relevant.  Recently, the US Supreme Court's Sandra Day O' Connor retired from the bench and the candidate to fill her position had controversy swarming all about him - specifically in regard to Roe VS Wade.  For while race relations have calmed and small towns may no longer be the places of absolute intolerance to minorities as in days past, the issues of abortion, class struggle and full equality for our multi ethnic society still demand our full attention and energies.",1154736000,,4256,4.860110803324099
945183,5,6304961693,"From Quincy Jones' score to Haskell Wexler's cinematography ""In the Heat of the Night"" is worthy of inclusion on anyone's top ten films list.

But as ground breaking as the film was on the subject of 1967 race relations, the most amazing thing is how well it has held up almost 40 years later. I think it rings so true because of way they elected to play several key scenes.

Watch for the carefully orchestrated scene between Mrs. Colbert (Lee Grant) and Tibbs (Sidney Poitier) when alone in the chief's office early in the film. He has just told her that her husband has been murdered and she recoils from his first two attempts to comfort her. Given the upfront racism exhibited in the film up to that point, you assume that it is more of the same. But this is Mrs. Colbert's first scene and when she does not rebuff his third attempt to comfort her you realize that she is completely unaware of his race, she is just devastated by what he has told her and would have rebuffed anyone as she struggled to accept what she has just learned. The attentive viewer realizes that their own prejudice, kindled by what they have seen up to that point in the film, caused them to jump to the wrong conclusion about her character's motivation.

Then watch for the evolving attitude of Chief Gillespie (Rod Steiger) toward Tibbs. Early on he comes to professionally respect him (as he respects the town's black mechanic), then he comes to respect Tibbs as a man when he slaps Endicott (something no other man-black or white-would dare), and finally he comes to respect him as a human being when Tibbs reveals a lust to take Endicott down. The irony being that it is finding Tibbs capable of a higher level human weakness (not a strength) that opens Gillespie's eyes to the fallacy of racism.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1148515200,3,1829,4.533333333333333

Now I have to say, this film is damn near perfect.  It has all the elements for a great film, from a riviting storyline, great acting and interesting charactors.  Sidney Poitier plays Virgil Tibbs, an African-American cop who's falsly arrested for the murder of a rich white man.  Virgil was visiting his mother in a small Mississippi town of Sparta when the bigot sherrif accuses him of murder.  After revieling his identity his services are offered since he works homicide and may be able to help solve the murder.  From that point on we watch as the town fights to kick Virgil out, and we see Sherrif Bill Gillespie (played by Rod Steiger in his Oscar winning role) learn to accept Virgil.  Theres a scene where Virgil and Bill are drinking and talking in Bill's home and Bill is talking about how he has no one, no kids, no wife, no friends, and you start to see him as the man he is and not the bigot he was.  This is far more than just a movie about murder, it's a movie about acceptance and change and how one town, brought up with one way of thinking can change that way when they realize their faults.  It's great to see how Virgil goes from the outcast to the respected partner.  Sidney and Rod are great together here, as is Lee Grant as the widow, who in her two short scenes shows enough feeling and emotion to earn her a Golden Globe nod...and the scene where she learns of her husbands misfortune is acting at it's greatest.

945188,5,6304961693,"Oh, there's a message delivered in IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT, but the movie is much more than that message. I know the standard take is that Rod Steiger's character is a racist who slowly begins to see the light, I don't think that's quite right. He's really not a bad guy, but he's lived in a small southern town all his life and he's never had to confront the laissez-faire racism that existed at that time (and may still). The rich family owns the town, the whites kowtow to them and the blacks are down on the next level. He's never thought twice about calling a black man ""Boy.""  Spending a couple of days with Virgil Tibbs opens his eyes to what a man (black or white) can be if he's allowed to be what he wants to be. But even still, the movie is not that simple. It's so non-PC. Virgil Tibbs is ruled by his pride. Not only does he never back down, he never acknowledges that Sherriff Gillespie is undergoing a transformation and he is on his side. Meanwhile, Sherriff Gillespie can't resist in maintaining his own pose. He constantly taunts Tibbs by calling him ""Vir-gil."" Tibbs and Gillespie are two great characters and they are brought to life by two amazing performances. At the end of the movie, there are no tearful good-byes, no admissions of misguided behavior, not even a handshake, but there is an unspoken understanding that something has happened and the two of them are better off because of it. When Tibbs boards the train and walks down the aisle, you can feel the stress leaving his body. It's as if he took in a deep breath at the beginning of the movie and has been finally allowed to exhale.",1135123200,2,1618,4.411371237458194
945189,5,6304961693,"One of the great films of the 1960s, ""In the Heat of the Night"" hasn't dated one bit in the 38 years since its release. It now deserves to be recognized as one of the great films of all time.

The first rate direction of Norman Jewison and Haskell Wexler's brilliant cinematography make you feel the humidity in the Mississippi town in which black detective Virgil Tibbs and redneck sheriff Bill Gillespie form an unusual and often antagonistic alliance to solve the murder of an important industrialist.

As the sheriff, Rod Steiger is perfect in the role for which he won the Oscar he had earned but was denied two years earlier for ""The Pawnbroker."" Sidney Poitier was at the height of his popularity in 1967 with three blockbusters in release (""To Sir, With Love"" and ""Guess Who's Coming To Dinner"" were the others) but in Virgil Tibbs he found his best role and gives his finest performance. He has many memorable moments throughout, most notably his famous admonition to Steiger that became the title of the less impressive 1970 spin off: ""They call me MISTER Tibbs!""

Unlike too many films dealing with important social issues, ""In the Heat of the Night"" makes its point without resorting to the heavy-handedness or sanctimonious preaching that often mar films with a ""message."" The changes that occur in the relationship between the lead characters is suggested rather than hammered-home, and is all the more powerful for its subtlety.

The supporting cast is as perfect as the stars with veterans Lee Grant, Warren Oates, and Beah Richards all providing memorable moments without overshadowing the equally fine work of newcomers Scott Wilson, Quentin Dean, and Anthony James. The score by Quincy Jones, featuring Ray Charles' rendition of the title song, captures the proper mood throughout.

In a year when the odds-makers were predicting an Oscar victory for either ""Bonnie and Clyde"" or ""The Graduate,"" this beautifully atmospheric thriller with depth was the surprise victor, taking the Oscar for Best Picture, as well as four other awards (Steiger, Stirling Silliphant's screenplay, Hal Ashby's editing, and sound). Considering its theme of racial tolerance, it was an appropriate choice at a ceremony that was postponed after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. The Academy made the right choice. ""In the Heat of the Night"" may have been timely then, but thanks to the artistry of all involved, it remains timeless.

Why is this?  Well, the time the picture depicts was just passing in 1967 and the audience could feel comfortable about feeling superior to all those southern racists with their incestuous cracker sensibilities.

Nowadays, audiences of young people would be confused that many of the topics touched on in this film were so controversial.  A girl having sex outside of marriage, pregnancy, and abortion causing so much trouble?  Or a visiting cop as clearly intelligent and decent as Sidney Poitier's Virgil Tibbs causing a problem simply because of his race?  And no 911 or cell phones?  Still, this is a powerful drama and so well acted.

The movie seethes.  There is the racism, the sexuality, the lies and hidden truths, the hypocrisies of small town life.  It is filmed so that you feel the summer heat and darkness that hides so much.  As you experience the film it has more the feel of a poem than a documentary.

The main characters are Tibbs (Poitier) and Chief Gillespie (Steiger).  They are both decent and intelligent people who are much more sensitive than their exterior personalities will allow.  They have developed a misanthropic loneliness as a protective shell and both suffer.  There is a scene where they both explore behind this shell until Tibbs rebuffs the Chief's question about his experience of being lonely and the Chief instantly returns to his tough and bitter shell.  So, we learn that it is an emotional exoskeleton rather than something that grows out of his heart.  This allows him to like him and for Tibbs and Gillespie to part with a friendship at the end of the movie.

945258,4,6304961693,"There's a handful of reasons Joe Modern viewer may dislike this film.

The pace is very late 60s, relaxed. There isn't much flab in terms of a background score or other ornamentation, in fact at times silence goes belly to belly with grating hissing noises (thanks guys, you cretins in the DVD transfer department.)

Technical shortcomings aside, the film is guilty of the biggest blunder that a film hinging its hopes on mystery can commit -- it fails to come clean to its audience, on several fronts. We never quite figure out why our detective knew many of the things he claimed to know. Simply being a hotshot homicide detective from ""up north"" doesn't quite cut it as an explanation.

But those gripes out of the way, I should say it is engaging to watch how the lack of cinematic accoutrements in those times wrung filmmakers to actually *think* about character development and screenplay. Most modern suspense thrillers could probably take this 1967 Oscar winner to the cleaners in terms of visual and technical snazz, but it does exceptionally well in cobbling together its setup: the feel of its small southern American town, the palpable racism of the town folk (which runs throughout as an undercurrent but never brims over), the misadventures of inept cops, the sentiments of victims and suspects, and so forth.

Given that, I'd more readily label this a police procedural slash drama, not a suspense thriller.

If you have so much as a passing interest in sleuthing and don't mind a somewhat grainy print (par for the course for most 60s films) this should certainly be a worthy rental. I'd also recommend ""Mississippi Burning"" and ""A Time To Kill"" to people who enjoy this film.",1119312000,,1692,4.840830449826989
945259,5,6304961693,"Rare and exciting events in cinema annals occur when two great performers are at the top of their craft and are drawn by each other's energy to scale soaring heights.  This occurred in David Lean's ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" with Alec Guinness and Sessue Hayakawa.  It happened again with Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine in ""Sleuth"" after, as the latter actor noted, he told his co-star at the film's outset, ""Take your best shot, Larry!""

The same kind of brilliant one-on-one chemistry emerged in the 1967 classic produced by Walter Mirisch and directed by Norman Jewison, ""In the Heat of the Night.""  From the very outset, when Sidney Poitier as a visitor to a small rural Mississippi town is arrested by enthusiastic deputy Warren Oates as he sits on a train station bench, believing that he has solved a recently committed murder, viewers were aware that this film contains a special kind of magic.  Oates eagerly takes Poitier to the police station and presents his murder suspect to his boss, the town's police chief played by Rod Steiger.

It is a very small rural town buried deep in racial stereotypical tradition.  When Poitier is spotted on a bench awaiting the next train after a wealthy northern white man has been murdered, it is assumed that the stranger is guilty.  Both Steiger and Oates receive a tremendous jolt when the well dressed Poitier explains that not only is he a visitor from the northeast, specifically Philadelphia, who was preparing to leave town after visiting his mother; he is a top homicide officer from the major eastern city who makes considerably more money more than Steiger.

The interesting character to observe for the film's character arc is Steiger.  While a police chief in a small town deeply rooted in a segregationist past, he immediately demonstrates not only a pragmatic willingness to adapt that is not evident in his deputies and others in town; he exhibits ethical fairness when it comes to evaluating Poitier.  He concludes that Poitier possesses an expertise for shrewd murder investigation that none of the members of his force, including himself, possess.

Considering the controversy of using an African American detective from the northeast to solve a local case, the issue becomes a hot potato for Steiger.  The deciding element becomes Lee Grant, widow of the murdered man, who was a rich northern manufacturer planning to build a factory in town amid great controversy.  Grant concludes that solving her husband's death will be greatly enhanced by Poitier heading the investigation.

The decision is naturally a controversial one and town bullies immediately seek to attack Poitier, who is assisted by Steiger, to the fury of the racist element, that feels Steiger is a traitor to his race and class.  Two strong men from different backgrounds and cultures, there is a natural clash between Poitier and Steiger, but the film's ultimate message of hope is that the latter is able to learn and put past prejudices behind him in the pursuit of justice.

In the most memorable clash between the two men, occurring early in the film, Poitier responds with the most single memorable line of his distinguished movie career.  When, after Poitier has been referred to as ""boy"" with great frequency and is asked by Steiger what he is called among his colleagues in Philadelphia, he stiffens with determination, stares determinedly at Steiger, and emphatically responds:

""They call me Mr. Tibbs!""

As the film progresses and the hunt for the killer intensifies, we learn that Steiger is a natural outsider within the small town he serves as chief of police.  Like Poitier he is married to his job, as both are bachelors.  When he invites the African American visitor inside his house one evening the chief of police reveals that Poitier is treading where townsfolk do not.  Steiger is a man dominated by privacy.

Steiger won a highly deserved ""Best Actor"" Oscar for his brilliant portrayal, assisted by the powerful work done by Poitier, who had secured an Academy Award less than five years earlier for the 1963 release ""Lillies of the Field.""  In addition to Steiger's award, the film was honored as ""Best Picture"" while Stirling Silliphant won in the ""Best Screenplay"" category and Hal Ashby took home the Oscar for ""Best Editor"".

In addition to being a powerful visual experience, ""In the Heat of the Night"" is also memorable for Quincy Jones's brilliant musical score with Ray Charles opening the film on a brilliant note by singing the film's title song.",1109894400,7,4523,4.957615894039735

It turns out MISTER Tibbs is actually a Philadelphia police homicide expert visiting his mother. On their quest to find the killer both men are forced to deal with their racist views about the other and their perceptions of society overall.

He immediately runs into interference from Police Chief Bill Gillespie (Rod Steiger), a bigoted and pompous law man who begins to change his ways when it turns out that Virgil's hunch on the case might just turn out to be true.  Both the central performances of Poitier and Steiger, and the unlikely bond and ultimate friendship that ensue, are electrifying reasons to revisit this powerful drama of the 1960s. Lee Grant, Beah Richards and Warren Oates costar.  In the late 80s ""In The Heat of the Night"" became a prime time television series starring Caroll O'Connor. But by then much of the tempestuous and confrontational aspects of its subplot had been removed. Colors are severely dated with a lot of fading present throughout the print. Age related artifacts are everywhere and sometimes distract. Black levels are often weak. Pixelization is primarily responsible for an unstable image. The audio is mono and badly dated as well, strident and poorly balanced. There are no extras.",1086739200,9,1358,4.969162995594714
945332,5,6304961693,"In 1967, Sidney Poitier again stirred the red-necks with ""In the Heat of the Night"", where he plays Virgil Tibbs, a competent Philadelphia cop stuck overnight in a Mississippi town. It must be 110 degrees at night. The white boys sweat like stuck pigs while Virgil is as cool as a cucumber in a Savoy Row suit. The sheriff, Rod Steiger, is discomfited by circumstances in which Tibbs is ""lent"" to him to solve a murder that happens to occur when he is there. In working together, layer after layer of characterization is stripped away in marvelous fashion, through the skill of director Norman Jewison (who tells everybody he is not a Jew, he is Methodist), until understanding between the two men become a metaphor for the healing of a divided America. Very good stuff.

945333,5,6304961693,"Between the dark film noir of ""The Maltese Falcon"" and the creepy gorefests inspired by ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" the detective film wasn't exactly a vital film genre. But at least one entry into the genre made a major impact during those years, and that was 1967's ""In the Heat of the Night."" Since it was released, much has been made of the movie's status as a powerful story of race relations during the time of segregation, but the fact is, these elements are somewhat secondary to its brilliant character studies and expertly-handled mystery investigation. This is THE detective film, and quite possibly THE police film as well.
The film begins with Bill Gillespie (Rod Steiger) -- sheriff of the small town of Sparta, Mississippi -- investigating the scene where a powerful businessman has been murdered. Gillespie's deputies arrest a traveller named Virgil Tibbs (Sidney Poitier) for the murder simply on the grounds that he is black, but he turns out to be a homicide detective from Philadelphia who was just passing through. After being cleared, Tibbs is anxious to leave Sparta, but Gillespie -- in need of such an expert -- convinces him to stay and help solve the case. And from there, we have our movie.
Besides the story, the main thing ""In the Heat of the Night"" has going for it are the performances of its lead actors. It would have been incredibly easy to portray Tibbs as a noble black crusader, forced by his innate nobility to offer his help in the face of hatred (Poitier had played this type of good-natured gentleman in many of his other films). It would have been even easier for Gillespie to come off as a mindless racist redneck. Neither description comes anywhere close to describing the characters in this film. Virgil Tibbs is arrogant and aloof when we first meet him. He's no hero; he's a real human being who reacts to the way the Sparta police have treated him in the understandable manner of trying to get out of town as quickly as possible. He doesn't want to help them, and even when he's forced to, he lets his prejudices against Southern whites cloud his investigation (Tibbs spends the majority of the film believing one of the victim's business rivals -- a detestable racist -- to be the murderer, only to be proven wrong).
If Poitier's portrayal of Tibbs as a realistic human being rather than a flawless screen hero is admirable, then Rod Steiger's handling of the Sheriff Gillespie character is downright masterful. Bill Gillespie does not like or trust African-Americans, and he makes no secret of this. And yet the filmmakers didn't fall into a cliche trap and take care to show that even though Gillespie is a bigot, he's also a good cop. Unlike certain similar characters (and even some of his deputies in this film), Gillespie doesn't allow his prejudices to stand in the way of his investigation (a character flaw that, oddly enough, Tibbs gives in to while Gillespie does not). This is no ""Bull Connor"" character; this is a man who knows his job, and does it well. Tibbs and Gillespie begin the movie as two prejudiced men who begrudgingly admit to needing each other's help due to the circumstances (Gillespie's lack of a homicide expert; Tibbs' being forced to remain in an unfamiliar and hostile environment), and end it with a powerful respect for one another.
""In the Heat of the Night"" won Best Picture at the 1968 Academy Awards (the first detective film to do so), and Steiger took home the Best Actor award for his career-best portrayal of Gillespie. (Because this, ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,"" and ""To Sir, With Love"" were all released in the same year, Poitier was unable to consolidate enough votes for any one film and thus failed to be nominated; Norman Jewison lost Best Director to ""The Graduate""'s Mike Nichols.) That perfectly sums up this film's legacy: a brilliant film with two powerful lead performances, and an all-time classic of the detective genre.",1072656000,9,3930,4.780882352941177
945334,5,6304961693,One of my favorite movies ever.  I have watched this movie dozens of times and never tire of it.  It is truly great and deserving of all the awards it received.,1066003200,3,160,4.129032258064516
945335,5,6304961693,"""In the Heat of the Night"" won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1967. I was a Freshman in college that year, and all the talk was about ""Bonnie and Clyde"", a great film. ""The Graduate"" was doing the art-house circuit, and wasn't widely seen at the time. ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" was, at the time, considered ostentatious (a rich Black man marrying the daughter of a rich White couple...how shocking!); the fifth nominee that year was Rex Harrison's ""Doctor Dolittle"", but I don't want to talk about that. I find that, 25 years later, I pull out ""In the Heat of the Night"" to get my kicks from brilliant film-making, as well as good suspense and fine acting and direction. This was Norman Jewison's first nomination for Direction, and not his last. Some say he lost it to Mike Nichols for ""The Graduate"" because Nichols probably should've won for his debut film effort, ""Virginia Woolf?"".Maybe. Some say Rod Steiger won his acting Oscar because he lost in '65 for ""The Pawnbroker"". I doubt it. In my humble opinion, this was Steiger's penultimate role, a man who  is so sure of himself, yet is taken down a peg by someone better. He will never show his insecurity, though you know it's there. I also believe, after watching this often, that Steiger's Gillespie is NOT racist, merely dealing with a racist environment. It's mentioned that he's the new sheriff, but it never says where he came from. This is good, because Steiger starts from scratch, builds a compelling character, shows a bit of lack-of-control, and it makes him nervous an wonderfully vulnerable. His mind is usually open. Virgil teaches him; hence, whatever happens later can only be for his benefit. Great characters. Poitier was in 3 good films in 1967: this one, ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"", ""To Sir, With Love"". I'm sure that, when nomination time came, his votes were divided. For this reason alone, I think he would've won. The performances of Lee Grant, Quentin Dean and Scott Wilson (he was in ""In Cold Blood"" that year) were stellar. The great old gospel singer, Jester Hairston, also had a small role; he dubbed the singing for Poitier's Oscar winning role in ""Lilies of the Field"" (""Amen!""). Interesting stuff! Sterling Silliphant's screenplay won the Oscar hands-down, a riveting narrative of a complicated book. The greatest thing about Steiger's performance is that you know nothing about him or his background when the film begins, or even when it's over. What you know is that he's stuck in a place he doesn't like and no one likes him; there are suggested gay overtones, especially when he's in his home and he and Virgil talk about loneliness. It's quite profound when he doesn't get the answer he wants. There's also the great Beah Richards, in a small cameo, as Mama Kaleba; a sweet but nonetheless reprehensible character; she was nominated that year for ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"", as Poitier's wonderfully heart-broken mother, a fine performance. Yes, 1967 was a great year. ""The Graduate"" broke a few barriers; ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" broke some, and, certainly, ""Bonnie & Clyde"" made bad guys look good. Don't forget Richard Brooks' ""In Cold Blood""...A great year, but I still think ""In the Heat of the Night"" is the film I prefer to watch.",1065916800,,3249,4.81216457960644

Oates, after having found a dead man lying on a side street, is looking for a prime suspect and is sure he's found him.

945339,5,6304961693,"This milestone 1967 racial commentary spawned two sequels and a long-running TV show, and won that year's Best Picture Oscar.
Sidney Poitier plays Virgil Tibbs, a Philadelphia homicide expert visiting family in Sparta, Mississippi. When a Northern industrialist is found dead, Tibbs is immediately arrested to confront Police Chief Bill Gillespie (Best Actor Oscar-winner Rod Steiger), who, after learning Tibbs' credentials and calling his chief, must grudgingly accept Tibbs' help in solving the murder.
Steiger's performance as the dedicated chief is brilliant (""I am familiar with the laws in the state of Mississippi, thank YOU!), as he somewhat breaks the film stereotype of Southern sheriffs. However, Warren Oates' superb portrayal of Deputy Sam Wood reinforces those stereotypes; so much so that the disgusted widow (Lee Grant) asks, ""What kind of place is this? Who are you people.""
What follows is the pair's struggle to work together despite tremendous opposition from the town. In one memorable scene, Tibbs exchanges slaps in the face with the white owner of Endicott Cotton, who compares his fragile plants to ""the Negro,"" in that they ""need special care."" Endicott is Sparta's most influential businessman who'd least appreciate an influx of Afro-American labor.
As Tibbs brilliantly eliminates suspects, backtracks, and continually re-evaluates evidence, his time is running short as his sophisticated detective efforts begin to pay off.",1053129600,7,1454,5.583710407239819
945340,5,6304961693,"One of the decade's best Oscar winning films (but lamentably, not for its true star, Sidney Poitier).  those who only know the television series which is tepid by comparison have really missed out.  It is a marvelous study in race relations, driven by two of the best performances ever by Sidney Poitier (portraying a Philadelphia homicide detective called a ""powerful piece of po-lice manpower by Rod Steiger, as the redneck sheriff of a small Mississippi town).  They are thrust together when confronted with the murder of the most influential man in town.
For some, the confronting of race in this film does not seem as dated as another reviewer suggests.  It is fascinating to see Poitier, one of the only African American stars of the time play a role here in such contrast to his roles as a most polite, non threatening Negro in ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner  and ""To Sir, With Love"".  We can tell this is a different kind of man, from the first time he confronts the Sheriff.  When asked if he will be the cause of any trouble, his response ""no trouble at all"" is delivered with quiet but chilling self- assuredness that lets everyone know that even in the Sheriff's office, HE is the one in control.
There is one interesting change of the original script.  Legend has it that the script originally called for Poitier's character to stoically accept a slap in the face from an old Southerner he's questioning admirably portrayed by William Schallert).  Poitier opined that it would be a much more powerful scene in instead of turning the other cheek, he returned the same slap.  He did, and made it one of the more powerful moments in the film.
Great quotable movie line, exclaimed by Rod Steiger: ""I got the motive which is money and the body which is dead!"" Super supporting cast, including the aforementioned Schallert, Warren Oates, Scott Wilson, and Lee Grant.  Its great right down to the title song, sung with more soul than can be contained in any one man - save Ray Charles.

945341,5,6304961693,"There is always something about a film that any person finds appealing; You might be totally consumed with the story, or the music, or even ironic twists in the plot. It could even be the costumes, or the dialogue that captures your endless attention.
For me, in this film, it was the acting of Rod Steiger.
He was approached before the film, and told that if he could put on a nice belly, he could win an award in this movie. For a month, he sat and ate pecan pies until the belly was plump enough to partner with the slightly tight shirt, orange tinted sun glasses, officers hat, arms of bulging iron, and that endless sweat on his forehead that made him into the mississippi sheriff that no one can forget after viewing this movie.
Rod Steigers performance was quite remarkable, and commands the observant viewers respect and admiration. When he was ready to go into a rage at anyone who pulled his strings too tight, there was that momentary pause, where his gum almost exploded in his mouth, his forehead looked like every blood vessel would burst, and his face was turned away as he waited for the person to stop irritating him. oh, how well he did it. How much gum did they go through for this movie, we will never know.
Taking nothing away from the remainder of the cast, Gilespie is the center of the story, as he mirrors the racial bias of the remainder of the town, but over time, comes to appreciate and respect Virgil. Gilespie has to fight his inherit racial bias in order to see that Virgil is correct in his approach, and execution of the criminal investigation. How dare anyone come to his town, and do his job better, especially a black man from the north.
You can credit Sidney Poitier for his performance as well, but for the most part, he silently consumed all the anger and racial hatred with little response. His strength in this film is his restraint in situations where anyone else would have little tolerance. Rod Steiger had a much stronger role, and was able to act more demonsterativly, as he was the white sheriff in the white southern town, silently commanding respect from the towns residents, but never over doing it.
This film was made at a time when racial barriers needed to be brought down. It was most effective, and was appreciated by many for its message. In this country, and in this world, the same message needs to be learned. It is unfortunate that we need to study history to keep from making the same mistakes over again. Thank goodness there are films like this one, and others like Mississippi Burning that point out selective hatred and bias in our society, and teach us where we can go wrong.
Two thumbs up for a daring story line, and command performances from some of Hollywood's great actors.

945401,5,6304961693,"Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger almost set the screen afire in this film that deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1967.  Superbly directed by Norman Jewison, the movie brings us into deepest Mississippi one summer midnight, when a northern industrialist with plans to build a new factory is found murdered in the middle of Sparta's main street.  At the same time, Virgil Tibbs, a black detective from Los Angeles, is waiting at the station for the train that will take him back home from visiting his mother.

This being Mississippi, and a black man out after dark, it must have been the black man who committed the murder, right?  Tibbs is hauled into the sheriff's office and brought face to face with Bill Gillespie, the epitome of every redneck law officer south of the Mason-Dixon Line.  Gillespie's reaction to Tibbs is first contempt (this is a black man after all), suspicion at his full wallet (""Boy, that's more in a week than I make in a month, now where did you earn that?""), and finally shock, when Tibbs hurls the response into his face, ""I'm a police officer.""

Gillespie is further stunned to realize that Tibbs' contempt for him is at least as great as his for Tibbs, when he hears Tibbs telling his superiors over the phone ""They got a murder on their hands, they don't know what to do with it.""  Tibbs' boss volunteers Tibbs's services as a homicide expert to Gillespie, who doesn't particularly want to accept, but he doesn't have much of a choice; the industrialist's widow says if her husband's murder isn't solved and fast, there won't be any factory anywhere.  The resulting reluctant partnership between the two men is a pairing unlike any seen on screen; they resent each other but they can't solve the crime without each other; Gillespie needs Tibbs' expertise, and Tibbs needs Gillespie's protection from the local rednecks who want him dead.

The movie wonderfully evokes the atmosphere of a small town in the deep south, the abject poverty in which most of the blacks in the area lived, and the attitudes of the whites in town that made it dangerous for any black man to stand tall as a man.  At the movie's end, Gillespie hasn't changed his views about blacks, but he has come to respect Tibbs as a lawman and as a human being; and Tibbs comes to realize that inside of Gillespie's hardshell racist attitudes is a decent man struggling to get out.  The acting, the directing, and above all, Quincy Jones's magnificent score, made this one of the best movies of the 1960's and for years beyond.

I think this film accurately depicts the racial attitudes at its time.  Attitudes haven't changed much, honestly, but no black person is going to tolerate the treatment dished out by the rednecks in this town.  No more calling black men ""sonny"", and no more forcing black men to do what you want them to do simply because they are black and you are white.  So in some ways, we have come a long way.

7879850,5,6304961693,"The casting for the lead roles in the timeless classic ""In The Heat Of The Night"" was astounding. Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger elevated a somewhat mundane screenplay to our ionosphere.  The acting,  the rural setting, the searing theme, and the direction produced one of the greatest film in the history of cinematography.  I really enjoy this movie. The Blu-ray is so vibrant, and gives this film a resurgence.
As a baby-boomer, I was barely a teenager in 1967. I vividly remember how racially sensitive that era was.  I was in Detroit during that 1967 riot. I witnessed those wooden houses burning during the day, and the tanks rumbling down Mt. Elliott at night. When I forget all that racial strife, looting, confusion, and burning it is time for me to go because I have lost all memory.",1524182400,,793,4.72463768115942
7879851,5,6304961693,"I saw this great movie when it premiered in theaters long ago. Hang on just a second though...I'd like to watch it again but I'm not going to pay for a HD download if it looks anything like the trailer, a film clip which is badly in need of restoration. Should I just assume that the HD download is restored and pristine? I don't think so. I want a guarantee.",1523491200,,359,4.142857142857143

7879853,5,6304961693,"Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger in an excellent, gripping drama. This film totally stands the test of time and, sadly, is particularly relevant and timely in our present political climate. Highly recommended.",1522886400,,207,5.5
