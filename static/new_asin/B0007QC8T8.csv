2231107,5,B0007QC8T8,"This video captures the poignant and heartbreaking recovery efforts in the aftermath of America's darkest hour.  Though sometimes painful to watch, the video chronicles the efforts of police officers and firefighters searching ""Ground Hero"", for human remains. This video provides an important historical record of the recovery effort, and its toll on those who serve.  Also of interest is the perspective provided on the tremedous engineering efforts involved in removing the remains of the twin towers.

While there are many good books about September 11, as they say, a picture is wort 1000 words.",1109030400,3,600,5.361702127659575
2231108,5,B0007QC8T8,"Just finished watching this DVD and I would highly recommend this video to anyone who has an interest on the events of

September 11, 2001. Steve Spak captures the honor guard services during the removal of the victims from ground zero, this was very moving. This honor guard detail was very moving and was done in a respectful and professional manner. I now have a new appreciation of our Fire Fighters, Police and EMS.",1108684800,,420,4.675675675675675

8050470,4,B0007QC8T8,"I wanted to add this to my September 11th collection because I think it is important to remember what we went through as a nation and how easily it could happen again. The film quality is not the best, but what is wonderful is there is no voice-over to detract from what you are seeing on the screen. It is a little graphic, and would be disturbing for younger viewers if they are not alerted first. The emotions shown by all the people involved are as real and as intense as they were on that September morning twelve years ago.",1380672000,,529,4.3

8050472,5,B0007QC8T8,"I was curious to know what it was like at ""Ground Zero"" during the recovery and cleanup operation. There was limited media coverage during the nine month cleanup & recovery effort. I wanted to know how the firefighters & Police officers, EMT's and construction workers handled the difficulty, in matters, dealing with the scenes of mass destruction, and the process of removing the remains of the victims that they recovered. What a difficult task it must have been!

 After watching ""Ground Zero Heroes"" I have a better understanding of the operation during the clean up & recovery operation. The video was taken during the 9 months it took to cleanup the site. It was taken on different days that the cameraman was at ""Ground Zero"". The DVD shows the progression of the cleanup. You see Firefighters, Police Officers, EMS personnel, and the construction workers, digging by hand & with heavy machinery, looking for the remains of vicims who perished in the terrorist attacks. It seemed to me that all the workers were on a mission, To try & find every victim that was lost & bring them home to a loved one. I was extremely moved watching the ceremony when a victim was found. An honorguard was formed, lining both sides of the ramp leading out of ""Ground Zero"". Clergy would then say a prayer. Then the victim was carried up the ramp as the ""Ground Zero"" workers saluted the victim. All involved showed great care & respect for the victim. Words cannot describe the emotions I had while watching the Honorguards. The video also shows some of the crushed vehicles that were recoverd. One scene shows the leaking slurry wall, another shows a tieback being drilled into the slurry wall. It has closeup action of a Path train being recovered, and a crane knocking down number 4 WTC. The DVD ends with very moving scenes from the construction workers, and final closing ceremonies. I liked the scene when the workers are shouting USA! USA! USA!

If you want to know about the ""Ground Zero"" operation, Then I would highly recommed this DVD, Tim",1129420800,10,2040,4.757062146892656

8050474,5,B0007QC8T8,"Watching this DVD reminded me of my time working at Ground Zero. It brought back the sights, the noise, and the smells. The grapplers constantly working, and trucks always moving in and out of the site, 24 hours a day 7 days a week. If anyone wants to see what it was like to work at Ground Zero then this video is the one to watch. I really liked  watching parts of the closing ceremonies. ""Good Job"".",1112832000,8,402,4.220779220779221
8050475,5,B0007QC8T8,As a member of the FDNY who was there Steve's video brought me back to that time. It was a true display of what went on. I recommend this DVD. Never Forget,1112054400,6,155,3.875
8050476,5,B0007QC8T8,"As I watched this DVD, I felt like I was back at Ground Zero, It stirred up a lot of emotions. If you want to see what it was like to work at Ground Zero, then this DVD is for you. Although it was emotional to watch, Steve recorded history. I am proud to say the job we did at Ground Zero, although painstaking, makes me proud. Lets never forget 9/11/01",1112054400,5,353,3.9859154929577465
8050477,5,B0007QC8T8,"Like Day of Disaster, Steve Spak has filmed close up footage of emergency workers, this time during the recovery phase, that most similar programs do not have. Steve's access to emergency workers allows for a perspective that most other documentaries have not shown. It shows action and emotion that have been excluded in similar works. If the viewer wants to feel what really took place in the pit, this is the one to watch.",1109635200,4,425,4.756756756756757
8050478,5,B0007QC8T8,"After constant footage that plagues our televisions, I am sure that we all became slightly, if not severly, desensitized to the effects of 9/11 to New York City and greatly, the United States.  All the emotions that were felt so strongly about four years ago came back even stronger.  It is surely footage that has never been seen before.

I first was moved by a book I purchased by Steve Spak for my classroom.  It's a book of photos taken the day of 9/11 and the relief afterwards.  The video, however, together with narration and music moved me in ways that I cannot even find the words to describe.  They don't show on TV or any documentary that I have seen the honor guards that so proudly and with the greatest of care carried each recovered victim away from what would be the burrial ground for so many unrecovered children, parents, grandparent and relatives.

I was, to say the least moved by the commentary and small insights of the thoughts from the firefighters and police officers.  I also became angry at points, remembering what the terrorists have done to the United States.  I reminded myself that the United States did not fall apart.  We as a nation pulled together and my feelings of patriotism reawakened.  Remorse for the families and the co-workers became overwhelming and I cried at many points.  The ending of the film was very touching because hundreds of workers were chanting ""USA, USA, USA!!""  The last image you see is a video of the Twin Towers taken from a fireboat passing on the Hudson River.  I reminds me to tell all Americans, ""Never Forget.""

This video is a must addition to every family's collection of DVD's.  It is a true reminder of disaster and recovery that we as Americans need to never forget and for us to remind our future generations that as long as we are blessed to live in America, we all bleed the same; Red, White and Blue.",1109030400,5,1878,4.577844311377246
