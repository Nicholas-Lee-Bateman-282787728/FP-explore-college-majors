7975572,5,B00007ELFE,"I remember when this story broke on tv and in the newspapers. It's a good story and shows alot of what really happened in Philadelphia, and can happen in any city. Definitely one worth watching",1458086400,,193,4.542857142857143
7975573,5,B00007ELFE,I work with a former Philidelphia Police Officer. He gave further background information this is a fairly accurate movie and recommended for Police officers who have heard the story of the white rabbit beating confessions from suspects.,1357689600,,236,5.405405405405405
7975574,5,B00007ELFE,"I worked for the newspaper for many years; not in editorial, but in the advertising department.
Living in Philadelphia, I had a second reason for being interested in this movie.

Very well done; really like Rob Morrow as well as Paul Sorvino.

Enjoyable, interesting.",1354406400,,267,5.045454545454546
7975575,3,B00007ELFE,"It's unfortunate that the story's author found it expedient to write that his hero-reporter began exposing police torture and framing of innocent people by solving the racially motivated arson murder of a Hispanic family in Philadelphia. The true facts of that case, which was actually solved by ATF special agents, are detailed at length in a book titled ""Very Special Agents"" by James Moore (Pocket Books, 1997; reprinted by the University of Illinois Press, 2001).Reporter Jonathan Neumann did write about this case for Philadelphia newspapers but all of his facts came from ATF reports and the trial of homicide detectives convicted of framing the man they accused of the crime in order to please their superiors and protect a local politician. As a result of the ATF investigation, the victim whom detectives framed was freed and the detectives were sentenced to Federal prison for terms exactly matching the years their victim had served. So much for Helfgott's story ""based on true facts."" It'd also be noice if, amidst all his awards, reporter Jonathan Neumann had the integrity to correct this phony aspect of the story. Oh well, maybe journalistic integrity is elastic, like that of the detectives in this film.",1328227200,2,1221,5.11
7975576,5,B00007ELFE,"I appreciated this film because I as a Philadelphian was witness to the controveries  that were depicted in the film.  There was an attempt by the Late president Richard Nixon To put republican money behind then Mayor Frank Rizzo to run for Governor of Pennsylvania and unseat Democrat Milton Shapp. Walter Annenberg owner of the Philadelphia Inquirer[examinerin the film]supported Mayor Rizzo as well.  The Watergate scandal derailed President Nixons plans for Mayor Rizzo,Walter Annenberg sold the Inquirer to Knight Ridder who were more analytical of Mayor Rizzo. Governor Shapp and former Mayor Richardson Dilworth published a 500 page book on Police corruption in Philadelphia the same year based upon secret investigations conducted by State Police.  Mayor Rizzo sanctioned his Police to arrest any State Police that they saw and they did.  The inquirer  led the outcry about Police abuse of Power.  Mayor Rizzo sanctioned his Police at the time to surround the Inquirer building.  Former President Nixon drew Mayor Rizzo into a briar patch and could not sustain him.  Mayor Rizzo was a Policeman who became Mayor at a fortuitous time and tried to bring order to a city going through a big transition he made an alliance which was over his head and made himself and his Police Department targets-all of their actions came under scrutiny,all abuses of power by local law enforcement were exposed in the Philadelphia Inquirer-The Evening Bulletin-The Daily News-Philadelphia Tribune.  A long trash and Garbage Strike in 1976 caused the legioaires disease to break out at the Bellevew Stratford Hotel the strike ended quickly after that.  There is a lot of accuracy to the film which was well acted and performed by Paul Sorvino E.G. Bailey Randy Quaid and all of the other artists.  It was like living the 1970's again.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Thin-Blue-Lie-2000/dp/B00007ELFE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Thin Blue Lie (2000)</a>",1289347200,,1985,5.514851485148514
7975577,4,B00007ELFE,I discovered this movie only recently.  I watch Rob Morrow in Numb3rs and was surprised to see how his character in Numb3rs has many of the characteristics as the character he played in The Thin Blue Line. Very good movie based on a true story.,1265155200,,244,4.4222222222222225
7975578,4,B00007ELFE,Exciting story of Philadelphia Inquirer reporter Jonathan Neumann who went up against the entrenced corruption in Mayor Rizzo's administration and in the Philadelphia police dept.,1229040000,,179,6.2
7975579,4,B00007ELFE,"I grew up in a police officer's home in Philadelphia during the 1970's. My father I'm sure while he didn't condone this felt that once a criminal always a criminal was the rule of thumb, so even if the people were innocent of one crime they were always a criminal because of any prior offenses. I am always grateful to Mayor Rizzo because he helped my older brother get into a private housing place in Berwyn because he was autistic, and the special school in Philadelphia closed down. I certainly don't condone using psychological torture, or bluffing criminals into a confession. To quote Mayor Rizzo in this movie:""Drastic Times Call For Drastic Measures."" I feel that this certain time in history seems to be where the values of the country were certainly coming undone, and laws were being created to favor criminals over the law, but like us the cops are certainly under the same umbrella, and including Mayor Rizzo, and that's the only thing that a man/woman have that they can really call their own is their values, and when they're sold out there's nothing left. I can now certainly see why Rizzo didn't win the mayoral race in 1987, but the mayor in 1987 didn't deserve to win either as he pulled a Rizzo out of the hat by attempting to round up a bunch of criminals called the MOVE family he dropped a bomb on the bunker of the house, and caused a whole row of homes to go up in flames, and therefore a bunch of innocent people would suffer, and yet the mayor was overwhelmingly voted again for a second term. Well it seems as though the citizens of Philadelphia had a vision of seeing a black man who was the mayor in 1987 succeed, but however, zealous Mayor Rizzo had a vision too, and that was a city that was with low crime, and unfortunately, both visions were made reality through costs, and values were disposable with the intent that they could easily be picked up again, and cleaned off, but once sold out the values are meaningless because it's always going to be the dark stain, and it won't go away easily. As I said I had to watch this movie for understanding because I grew up with this, and even though my father didn't particpate in this it leaves a dark stain on all the honest police officers anyway. Overall it was a rather stark movie, but in some way I wish it was never told because it felt like an attack on my life because it was my father's paycheck that put me through school, and now it's made me question was it worth it? I ask because I certainly don't want people who get arrested to get hurt just to get a confession out of them even though they may be innocent. I feel that for a police officer that the only recourse is to think like a criminal to do his job, but not to necessarily become like one.",1153785600,6,2743,4.3803921568627455
7975580,3,B00007ELFE,"Frank Rizzo made a stamp as Phildelphia mayor in the 1970s; he cleaned the streets of crime in a way Rudy G. could have only dreamed in New York. But how he did it -- well, people whispered, and police carried big sticks. Not unlike the LAPD of the mid-90s, the force spiraled out of control, feasting on violence and hubris, removing lines so it didn't have any to cross.
The Phildelphia Examiner exposed the brutality, won a Pulitzer Prize, and stopped Rizzo's runaway train before he could change the city charter and run for a third term. ""The Thin Blue Lie,"" a painful title, revisits the time and chronicles the reporters (Rob Morrow and Randy Quaid)who busted the story. The camerawork is a little cheap and the soundtrack is little too omnipresent, but the movie's a quick, dirty, 90-minute pleasure for a lazy day.
Morrow is a go-getter and new in town. Quaid is the good-natured newsman who wants to get his two stories a day and go home. As usual, the go-getter reveals the good natured sort as a victim of blind apathy, and the two combine forces, so to speak, to ferret out brutalized victims, as well as a [tough] cop who likes to go to work on suspects with a pair of handcuffs. There's even a  lifesized white rabbit involved.
Morrow has the arrogant...schtick down cold. And Quaid broadens his range. Paul Sorvino has a cup of coffee as the tantrum-throwing Rizzo. Aside from G.W. ""Proctor!!!"" Bailey -- longtime ""Police Academy"" villain -- the supporting clan are actors I don't know, but have sufficiently big 1970s hair.
I like newspaper movies, usually because they're based on true stories -- aside from the ludicrous ""The Pelican Brief"" -- and because they cover familiar-yet-enjoyable ethical questions. Morrow's character is confronted by other reporters who make it clear Rizzo's regime lets them safely walk the streets at night. Morrow hasn't been around long enough to know the difference. In that detail, you sense how complacent a newsforce can become in the wake of a powerful leader, and how a fresh pair of eyes can see the injustices others have let fall through the cracks.",1046649600,5,2109,4.778082191780822
