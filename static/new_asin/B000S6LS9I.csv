8204490,5,B000S6LS9I,I watched this before I watched the Pitt/Affleck movie regarding the same.  The documentary explained a lot of things about James that are only hinted at in the fictionalized movie - but it does support a lot of the movie's claims and is a great way to brush up on the old west before watching Hollywood's version of it.,1227398400,2,320,4.423728813559322
