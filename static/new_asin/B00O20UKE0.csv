6701742,2,B00O20UKE0,"I picked this film up thinking it was going to be a action flick with a gun toting female. Where did I get that idea?

Lisa James (Naomi Banxx/ Amanda Dee) is involved in real estate scams with her boyfriend Todd Scott (Cordell Rainey). She suspects him of infidelity and takes up with the janitor (Simeon Henderson) at work.

The acting was lower tier. The action wasn't there and the drama was fairly boring.

6701774,3,B00O20UKE0,"This movie had a different twist than most movies I have ever seen before. I give it a 3 because it starts off slow and you really have to stay with the movie to get the meaning in it. But overall for the message and ending of the movie I give it 4 stars. The movie ends with a twist that you never will expect and for that it really gets 4 stars. There is a sex scene in the movie that is not needed. I really wish movies would leave se scenes out and really focus on the content of the movie. So be prepared just in case you are watching this movie with others or family. I think the director was trying to tell a story of deceit and showing the consequences of betrayal from every side which was really neat. Overall, the movie made me really think and it did have a deep message. But in honesty the movie goes very slow but overall if you keep watching their is a message and a powerful one at the end.",1459209600,4,906,3.9835164835164836
