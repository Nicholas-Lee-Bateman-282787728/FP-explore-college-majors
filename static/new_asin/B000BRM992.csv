2438867,5,B000BRM992,"I always do extensive research before deciding on a purchase and when I decided to try a yoga DVD I stuck with my program. I asked around, I read all the reviews (though I don't have much faith in most of the reviews out there), I surfed the web and looked at many many clips . My criteria for a perfect beginner Yoga DVD were:

a)The instructor should be a real yoga master with many years of experience - no ex-actresses  or aerobic instructors.

b) no need for props, ie. ropes, balls, blocks, blankets etc...

c) short sets ( as a beginner I may not be able to do more then 30 minutes at a stretch. I also do other fitness and want a short yoga routine as an add-on)

d) preferrably no cliche new age sounds which make me cringe - birds chirping, bells, oceans. Something a litlle more urban and edgy would be nice.

e) finally, I was looking for a real yoga workout. I wanted to experience yoga at its rawest i.e., no fluff, no excessive talking at the start. I just wanted to be able to get right to a workout that would stretch, strengthen, relax and inspire me

And that is exactly what I got with Ravi Singh & Ana Brett's Kundalini Yoga for Beginners & Beyond. It's a really great program! I actually happened to find it at my library, tried it and paused it halfway while I ordered from Amazon. I knew this was the one:Two 25 minute sets from 2 long time yogis. Ravi Singh has been teaching 30 plus years. Ms Brett has been doing it since childhood.

The way it's sequenced really builds in a way that open your body very gradually and I think it is excellent for someone looking for a complete, gentle yet thorough, yoga practice. Not only is this a completely doable enjoyable workout for a newcomer to yoga like myself but I feel this is one I can still continue to do no matter how far I advance. In other words: this one is a classic.

I look forward to trying other of the Ravi & Ana workouts.",1137110400,234,1909,4.236914600550964
2438868,5,B000BRM992,"I usually refrain from writing a review of a product I just bought.. but I had to.  I received my DVD yesterday and worked with it last night.  I have been telling my friends that I woke up with someone else's back!  I usually wake up sore and stiff. Today I woke up with an incredibly stable back, and feel as if I'm an inch taller, as my posture feels wonderful.  I highly reccommend this DVD. The meditations and relaxation is very effective, as well.",1135123200,25,454,4.305882352941176
2438869,5,B000BRM992,"I am writing this review having just experienced the dynamic and invigorating Kundalini sets on Ravi Singh and Ana Bretts new dvd, Kundalini Yoga for Beginners and Beyond.

The fusion of the initial set which culminates in inhale/exhale holding and Sat Kriya fuses the will or essence of the mind exactly with the breath. The transition into the Five Tibetan Rites, after having done extensive spinal flexing and breath control is brilliant.

I have already done the Tibetan Rites for quite some time, but adding an inner meditative focus through Sat Nam and placing them after the first set adds an entirely new dimension to the practice.

I possess a rather extensive yoga library, and of course several of their previous DVD's including Warrior Workout, Ultimate Stretch Workout and Navel power.

However, in terms of combining the meditation and a complete body conditioning as well as succinctness and elegance of flow and form, this new tape ranks as one of my most favorite yoga experiences of all time.

I consider this a useful and innovative masterpiece.",1134950400,17,1064,5.0227272727272725
2438870,5,B000BRM992,"The first day I did this DVD, my back, which had been aching for a solid month, was practically healed overnight.  My four kids (ages 2,5,7,10)did it with me and we had so much fun!  It is not too hard for them.  It was a little easy for me as I have done yoga for several years (on and off).  I definately plan on buying all that Ana and Brett have to offer.  She is like an angel to watch.  Beautiful.  It made me feel beautiful, too.",1133740800,18,436,3.942528735632184
2438871,5,B000BRM992,"I first read about the 5 Tibetan rites about 2 years ago and tried to do them on a daily basis.  Like most people I find it hard to do exercises from a book. I need someone to do them with me. This DVD is perfect.  It starts off with a basic spinal set "" rise and spine"" and ends with Sat Kriya (my favorite) The second set is the 5 Tibetan rites.  Albeit in reverse order than what is written in the books.  But that's Ok because Ravi's exercise order seems to work better for the spine and compliments set 1.  He also adds a kundalini spin to the camel exercise.  The original doesn't include bowing forward and camel and breath of fire.  Ravi's version is so much better. The magic number for the rites is 21 reps.  Ana doesn't count, but if you want to track your progress you can mentally count your reps.  The books say that you should work up to 21 and not go over that number as you will not derive any more benefits by increasing the reps over 21.  Whatever! It works and it feels great! Love it Love it!  The meditation at the end of set 2 is to feel you pulse in your finger tips and say sat nam to each pulse.  This requireds SO much concentration that it takes you to another plane.  Thank you Ravi and Ana.",1131408000,347,1220,4.07563025210084
2438872,5,B000BRM992,"Ravi Singh & Ana Brett always seem to know how to put together a winning workout. This is another one that should be put into your weekly workout rotation no matter what your level. Some of the exercises in the second section may give a complete beginner something to build up to.

The program begins with a breath primer and ends with a meditation. In between are invigorating, energetic, exercises that will get you breathing deep and feeling more alive then you have in a long time!

I love the playful feel of these interesting exercises. There are spinal warmups which work their way up the spine and are very effective at priming the engine and opening the chakras. Then there are the 5 Tibetan exercises which are a very clever group of exercises which build strength, health, and longevity.

Clear instructions by both Ana & Ravi and beautiful and expert demonstration as always by Ana.",1130457600,19,894,4.717948717948718
2438873,5,B000BRM992,"Wow.  I am so glad my friend told me to buy this DVD! I have a whole new perspective on yoga now that I have discovered Kundalini Yoga. All other yoga systems concentrate on 1 small part of what yoga is. Kundalini is the real stuff. You really ""get ""yoga after experiencing it.

After doing this DVD I don't know how I lived without it. It has truly restored my life.

There is a great spinal series that works its way up your spine. Till your whole hips and back are warm and buzzing. There is a heart opening exercise that gives your shoulders and uppper back a tremendous release. TThen there is something called the ""5 Tibetans,""  ancient exercises to keep you young and vital. Ravi & Ana do them Kundalini style.  The first 4 are pretty tough. Good strength builders. You follow along with Ana and do as many as you can. She tells you to rest when you need and start back in when you can.

I may be a beginner but I can definitely recognize quality. Ravi & Ana are everything yoga teachers should be. They teach the proper breath & form throughout. I love the breath primer which makes the breath of fire so simple to learn! This DVD is better then any live class I have ever taken.

I am really building some strength. I also feel so relaxed and open and it sounds wierd but less fearful of things in my life since doing this type of yoga. I guess what I am feeling is more balanced which is what the aim of yoga is! What a great yoga practice.",1129593600,20,1450,4.212996389891697

It improves digestion, tones muscles, relaxes you, and makes you want to do yoga everyday. I also have the Fat free yoga -which is also amazing. I am pretty fit already -but this DVD makes me feel better overall.

2438907,5,B000BRM992,I bought this 2 years ago.  At the time I was combatting a longtime hip injury and this video made me aware that I was going to be able to heal myself through yoga.  I felt a lot of pain but in the middle of it I questioned if it was good pain or bad pain and I decided it was good and to follow my breath into that hip which eventually led to 2 years of yin yoga and hip openers and now finally I'm mostly healed.  I set this aside for awhile in order to really concentrate fully on opening that hip.  I just did it again in what seems like forever and forgot just HOW AMAZING this video is.  I love the instruction and what they both say about the body as the video progresses.  I feel myself expand in a million ways and imagine my breath turning into light inside of my body.  This yoga is most definitely LIFE CHANGING.  I'm not the same person that I was when I first bought it 2 years ago.,1440460800,2,896,3.938888888888889

Still sore.  SO...I happened to remember this kundalini dvd that I bought several years ago, but had forgotten about.  Thinking about all the great pelvic rotations that I used to love, I popped it in and when the workout was done, I remembered that it is very important to drink a lot of water to flush out toxins released after exercising the back.

The repetition wasn't inspiring but was a bit of overload. Ana, while very lovely, really, just get dressed girl! Her performance is more hoochy-mama, than inspiration. She is so busy flipping her ponytail and smugly smiling that I considered she may be laughing at we fools buying her DVDs. I haven't a clue why Ravi's name or picture is included on the DVD, he only tosses out minimal whispers about a pose. When I watched it the 2nd time, however, my stance softened a bit and although this DVD is not a good fit for my morning session, it could be a session (or two) that I might consider doing once or twice a month after work or on the weekend. Something must be appealing about this as I also went to the website and spent a lot of time reviewing their health articles, which increased my respect for Ana & Ravi. So, while I would tell you to take a pass if you're new to yoga or want a more traditional session, this training may give you a bit of a pop for the more adventurous.

We started with his one and although we didn't consider ourselves beginners , we did feel like we had done a good session. We love the fact that you get both breathing, poses and chanting ....just like our classes and we now own all the DVDs. This was was a great one to start with and it goes at the right pace, good instructions especially if you have never done a class before. I ve leant this DVD to everyone I know and whilst not everyone is into chanting they love Anna and they love how much it feels like a real class. Thanks again Anna and Ravi for being such great teachers",1401408000,5,765,4.175675675675675

2438938,5,B000BRM992,"This DVD is aptly named. It has two sets (which is what the sequences in kundalini yoga are called):

""Rise and Spine"" is a great introduction to kundalini yoga, useful whether you're entirely new to yoga or have been practicing other styles for years & are new to kundalini yoga. Kundalini is pretty different from (and complementary to) other styles of yoga. But now, almost ten years after my introduction to kundalini yoga, I still practice the ""Rise and Spine"" set a LOT. It's great for days when I'm tired or recovering from a cold, but it's also good for resetting my spine any time it feels ""unbalanced"" from sitting too much, a long car ride, tough workouts, or whatever. It's very accessible, but very effective.

The ""Five Tibetans"" set is a yoga classic, not specific to the kundalini style, but harmonious with it. Ravi & Ana show a different sequence of the five exercises than is traditional; I like theirs, and whatever order you put them in, the five exercises make for a nice little workout.

The DVD also includes meditations.",1401408000,15,1045,4.730769230769231
2438939,5,B000BRM992,"When I ordered this dvd, I had just moved to a small town without a yoga studio after practicing various forms of Hatha, Iyengar, and Vinyasa for years. I had never heard of Kundalini. I had torn my a.c.l. some months before and was no longer encouraged to run the hiking trails I had been using to expend stress, ease tension, and quiet my thoughts. I didn't know how else to control my energies then (seven years ago). I followed along with Ana. Perhaps I am the kind of person who embraces the untraditional, because if I found some of the postures unusual, I valued that as kind of adventure. But what really convinced me was the soft feeling of aliveness and calm that pervaded my body when the video ended. I didn't feel spent or in need of rewarding myself for my efforts; the effort was inherent in the deep relaxation that followed the sets. My heart led me to more of the Raviana series and even to in-person classes in nearby cities with other Kundalini teachers, including Ravi and Ana. I don't think I could say the same of any other dvd, but this one absolutely changed my life, and for the better.",1401408000,18,1112,4.429268292682927

I thought it was a little weird, but when I was finished, I felt very good. I embraced that feeling and stuck with it.

Kundalini Yoga, especially as taught on Ana Brett and Ravi Singh's DVD's, is one of the most amazing things I've ever done. It's literally been a live saver for me. I would call this style of yoga accelerated fitness. It's not only working your body, but also your glands nerves, as well as mind, emotions, and soul. One big component of this process is the use of rhythmic breathing along with the exercises. Also, rather than just doing static poses, many of these exercises employ movement. The sequencing is not just random but creates a dynamic where you get deeper benefits. If you buy this DVD don't make a rash judgement. Try it for a bit and see how you feel.

In the second part, I'll say some more general things about Ana and Ravi and kundalini yoga. It seems the negative reviews of their DVDs come mainly from people who didn't know what to expect when ordering kundalini yoga DVDs -- because they ARE a little bit different from what you're used to, if you've only practiced hatha yoga in the past. I am unabashedly an Ana and Ravi fan, but hopefully my evaluation will help you make the correct decision for yourself, even if your opinion happens not to be the same as mine.

----------
Part I
----------

Like most of Ana and Ravi's DVDs, Kundalini Yoga for Beginners and Beyond has the matrix menu which allows you to customize the length of your workout. All exercises in this DVD are done equally on both sides of the body.

Breath Primer (4:28): Please note that this segment may not play if you just play the entire DVD through. It is accessible from the matrix menu and the chapter selection menu, however. If you are not familiar with kundalini yoga, you will definitely want to follow along here. It's actually a pretty good refresher for anyone who has practiced for awhile, as well. You learn how to do long deep breathing, a panting breath that serves as an introduction to breath of fire, and then a standard breath of fire technique.

Tune In (2:39): This segment is similar/the same in many of Ana's and Ravi's DVDs; you sit cross-legged, focus on your breathing, and chant ""ong namo guru dev namo"" three times.

Warm Ups (6:11): This segment consists of the following exercises.

*Sit cross-legged and grind your stomach in a circle
*With your legs extended along the ground, extend your arms parallel to the ground and lean forward and back
*With your legs extended along the ground, lean forward, hold your ankles, and do a static stretch

Set One: Rise & Spine (20:20): This is a fairly long set, but it goes by reasonably quickly for me.  Ana and Ravi call it a ""basic spinal series.""  I feel that it is particularly well-suited for beginners.  In fact, this was the first full yoga set of Ana's and Ravi's that I ever did, and it's part of the reason I became such a fan of theirs.  It consists of the following exercises.

*With legs crossed, flex your spine back and forth
*Sitting on your heels with your hands on your thighs, flex your spine again
*With legs crossed and hands on your shoulders, twist your torso left and right
*With legs crossed, hold your knees, lean back, and flex your spine
*Hook your hands together in front of your sternum and lift alternate elbows (somewhat like a propeller)
*Hook your hands together in front of your throat, hold your breath in and squeeze your stomach and pelvic floor, then do the same with your breath held out, then repeat both with your hands overhead (this is repeated several times)
*Sat kriya (it's easier for those who don't know what this is to search it on the web than for me to explain it here, as this review is already quite long)
*Relax on your back

Ana and Ravi do offer some modifications here (such as sitting on the edge of a sofa if you cannot sit on the floor).

Set Two: The Five Tibetans (17:32): This set is a variation on a well-known yoga sequence called ""The Five Tibetan Rites for Health and Longevity.""  Ana and Ravi have changed the order of the movements in this set and have added a stationary camel pose. I actually think the order/flow of exercises works very well, here, though this *is* my first experience with the five Tibetan rites.  It consists of the following exercises.

*Sit with both your legs flat on the floor, then lift up into a table/bridge position
*Double leg lifts while lying on your back
*Move from downward do to upward dog, then back again (repeats many times)
*Do a modified camel pose, then bow down until your head is on the floor (repeats many times)
*Stationary camel pose (several modifications are offered)
*Standing, spin in a clockwise direction with your arms extended to the sides

Please note that this set is a bit more advanced (Ana and Ravi call it ""intermediate"") than the basic spinal series in set one.  If you are just starting out, you may want to hold off on doing this one for awhile.  Alternatively, you can take it slowly: you don't have to match Ana's pace, and you can take breaks if you need to.  This is a physically challenging set and you will likely break at least a light sweat doing it.

I have a special fondness for this set.  I was having a hard time in my life a year or two ago, and I committed to doing this every day for 40 days.  I stuck with it and I really felt like I'd accomplished something by the end of that period.  It's also during that time that I worked my way into doing a full camel pose for the first time, by taking it a little farther each day.

You should beware, however, that both the seated-to-bridge/table and the down dog/up dog segments can be a bit hard on the wrists.  You may not want to do those sets every day if you have wrist issues.

Deep Relaxation (3:19): This is similar in many of Ravi's and Ana's DVDs. Lie on your back, slow your breathing, and listen to Ravi.

Please note that the Matrix Menu says this is 8 minutes and 36 seconds.  This is not accurate.  I have listed the actual time in parentheses above.

Meditation (5:18): Sit cross-legged with your thumbs meeting the tips of your index fingers.  Touch the bottom of your tongue to the roof of your mouth and have your bottom and top teeth touching.  You are supposed to try to sense a pulse between your thumbs and fingertips.  (This works well for me some days and other days, it is more difficult.)  This exercise is then simply breathing in and exhaling.

Closing Prayer (2:59): This is similar to what appears in other Ravi/Ana DVDs.

For those of you familiar with Ravi's and Ana's DVDs, this is one of the ones with the pink circle rug and flower pattern on the floor, the white background, and dark-haired Ana. I've noticed a lot of the music in those overlaps, as do some of Ana's outfits.  Much of the music is instrumental.  This DVD does not have any mantra chanting (performed by the participants at home) other than the ""tune in"" and ""closing prayer"" sections.

If you have a stiff back when you wake up in the morning, I cannot recommend the first set enough.  It really helps to work out the kinks.  The second set is probably not for absolute beginners, but you can try a few exercises from it and work your way up.  Finishing the second set is actually a good goal to work towards.

This is the first Ana and Ravi DVD that I ever bought, and I think it is also my very favorite DVD that Ravi and Ana have put out (I have about 2/3 of their DVDs). Ana and Ravi do offer some suggestions for modifications of certain poses. And don't forget -- you don't have to keep up with Ana. Work at your own pace.

----------
Part II
----------

Now, on to a more general discussion of kundalini yoga in general, and Ana's and Ravi's DVDs in particular.

Most of the yoga that people are familiar with falls under the umbrella of hatha yoga. Perhaps you've done a series of static poses, or some vinyasa/flow yoga. Kundalini yoga is not exactly like either of these, although Ana's and Ravi's DVDs do incorporate elements of hatha yoga (e.g., this DVD has a lot of camel pose in it). However, kundalini yoga is also what I would consider to be a very active form of yoga, consisting of some repeated movements and a lot more work with the breath than you may be used to. It can be difficult to keep up with at first, but can be very rewarding if you stick with it. If you are bored of holding static poses all the time, or if you want a bit more movement but hate vinyasa (sorry, but I am not a fan of flow yoga), kundalini might really work well for you. And, as I said earlier, use the modifications Ana and Ravi discuss if you need to use them. Yes, Ana is fit (and this makes her an excellent demonstrator for the poses), but this is not a competition. Don't strain yourself, and don't try to keep up with her. Just try to improve a little bit every time!

Kundalini yoga also involves a lot of meditation. Sometimes this is quiet and involves breathing either in a sitting position or lying down, occasionally with your hands in a mudra (hand position). Sometimes it involves chanting a mantra. This DVD does not contain much in the way of chanting except in the opening and closing segments. Whenever there are mantras, Ana and Ravi tell you what they mean. If you are uncomfortable with mantras for religious reasons, check out Ana's and Ravi's website (can't post links in reviews but they're easy to find through Google) for alternatives.

With respect to calorie-burning, this is probably not the sort of program that will make you shed a ton of weight. What it is good for, is improving your mood and your flexibility. And as a physical activity, it does burn some calories and strengthen some parts of your body. But kundalini yoga works on your inner self as well as your outer self, and so some parts are a little less ""active"" than others. For my own part, I still do plenty of pretty intense cardio at other times of the day.

Ana's outfits are a bit skimpy, but certainly nothing less than you would see at the beach. And the reason she dresses like she does is so that you can really see her performing the movements and asanas. That way you know exactly how to position yourself for maximum benefit. (Most of the time, kundalini yoga is done with the eyes closed, anyway.) There is not a lot in the way of initial instruction in this DVD. If you are familiar with Ana's and Ravi's work, you can jump right in. But if you are new to kundalini yoga, watch it first. Observe Ana, listen to the cues, make sure you understand. You'll be glad for the lack of excessive instruction later -- you don't want to be told on the 20th time you do a DVD how to do camel; you know it by this point!

Some health claims are made in this DVD. Take those with a grain of salt. I find that Ana and Ravi are quite accurate when it comes to muscular and skeletal issues (like my sciatica). I don't know that I believe everything they say about the glands, however, for example. Perhaps that's my Ph. D. in chemistry intruding. At any rate, certainly don't use yoga as a substitute for seeing the doctor. But doing a routine like this isn't likely to hurt you or make your health condition worse (as long as you PACE YOURSELF).

If you are struggling with a pose, or don't feel there's an adequate explanation, Ravi and Ana are very accessible and quite nice. They have contact information on their website (the URL is on the DVD case) and usually get back to you in a couple of days. They also have a monthly e-mail newsletter that I enjoy.",1384128000,14,10884,4.429573934837093
2438962,5,B000BRM992,There's no way you couldn't enjoy this product. It's relaxing and soothing. I'd recommend it to any hardcore yoga lover!,1383955200,,120,5.05
2438963,5,B000BRM992,"It was easy to follow, and challenging at the same time.
Helps me to sleep. perfect for beginners like me.",1382400000,,106,4.35
2438964,4,B000BRM992,"I've owned and enjoyed many DVDs from husband/wife team Ravi Singh and Ana Brett, but this is the first time I've tried KUNDALINI YOGA FOR BEGINNERS & BEYOND, one of their first releases (not to be confused with their newer release,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-for-Beginners-Beyond-Stretch-Strengthen-Be-Stress-Free/dp/B001L54TQO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga for Beginners & Beyond: Stretch, Strengthen, Be Stress Free!</a>).  I had been somewhat hesitant to try this DVD because I was aware that included the 5 Tibetans, a series of five specific exercises that I had tried previously and that I had found did not work particularly well for me.  However, there is quite a bit of additional footage on this video, so I thought it was worthwhile to give it a try.

I have the ""matrix"" version of this DVD, which allows you to pick and choose chapters, programming them to customize your own workout.  The Main Menu of the DVD lists options for Play DVD - Chapter Index - Design Your Own Workout ""Matrix"" Option.  The Chapter menu appears as follows:

Breath Primer, 4:28
Tune In, 2:39
Warm Ups, 6:11
Set One: Rise & Spine, 20:20
Set Two: The Five Tibetans, 17:32
Deep Relaxation, 8:36
Meditation, 5:18
Closing Prayer, 2:59

As with all Ravi/Ana DVDs, this routine features Ana practicing alone, with Ravi and Ana sharing responsibility for voiceover instruction.  Ana appears on a furry mat in a white, featureless studio.  The Breath Primer also is a mainstay of their DVDs:  it provides instruction on the various types of breathing used during the practice, including long deep breathing and breath of fire.  Finally, Tune In is the standard opening to the routine which includes a chant of ""ong namo guru dev namo"" and the mantra ""sat nam,"" which is used for meditation throughout the practice.  I have provided details on the remaining chapters of the routine below.

WARM UPS
The warm-ups featured here include spinal grinds, spinal rock forward and back (rowboat), and double forward bend.

SET 1: RISE & SPINE
This section focuses on repetitive movements, or kriyas, combined with breath.  The exercises include spinal flexion forward/back, ending with contraction (Ana later names this mula bandha); spinal flexion forward/back seated on heels, again ending with contraction; spinal twist (washing machine); spinal flexion in a leaning position for upper back; alternating elbows up and down with hands clasped (propeller); pull and contract clasped hands at throat and overhead (repeated several minutes); and conclude with sat nam kriya (2 minutes) and brief relaxation (2 minutes).

SET 2: THE FIVE TIBETANS
Ana states that this is a more intermediate set.  Throughout the routine, she shows modifications and encourages going at one's own pace.  The five dynamic movements are as follows:  1) staff pose to table, 2) double leg lifts, 3) down dog to up dog, 4) ""baby"" (child's pose) to camel, ending with held camel with breath of fire (the only BOF in the entire practice), and 5) standing spinning (this is the ONLY movement during the entire practice that is not performed on the floor).

The deep relaxation felt much briefer to me than then >8 minutes specified on the Chapter menu.  For the ""Calm and Clear"" meditation that follows, Ana cues a focus on the pulse between the thumb and finger, timing ""sat nam"" in the mind to this pulse.  This was the only instruction for this mostly silent (other than the background music) meditation; I would have found a bit more coaching from Ana and Ravi helpful here.  Finally, the routine concludes with the standard ""Closing Prayer"":  wishing positive well-being towards yourself, healing power to someone you know who needs it, and peace on earth, ending with a final ""sat nam.""

Overall, I enjoyed this workout.  I definitely preferred the warm-ups and the first set to the second (the five Tibetans), which was significantly more challenging and strenuous.  However, I appreciate the matrix on this DVD, which gives me the option of only choosing the chapters I like from this routine.  Given that Set #2 is more intermediate, I'm not sure that I would recommend this DVD to those completely new to Kundalini yoga, although Set #1 might be a good place to start.",1381881600,3,4280,5.154848046309696

Personally I prefer their 2009 Yoga for Beginners & Beyond: Stretch, Strengthen, Be Stress Free dvd.  However, I do understand this is good introduction to those new to Kundalini yoga since it has the classic spine series and the 5T kriya is more traditional workout that can appeal to the practitioners looking for something more physical.

The first half of the DVD is a spinal series meant to help get your breath and spine in alignment. After doing it I definitely think my posture's been improved! The second half is more of a workout, particularly for your abs and arms. Don't be fooled, it may be beginner, but it's totally capable of kicking your butt.

2439000,5,B000BRM992,"I believe this is the #1 Kundalini DVD out there.  I discovered this Kundalini Yoga Series by Ana Brett and Ravi Singh on Amazon about 2 years ago and it is incredible.  I have been doing casual yoga of various sorts here and there via DVD and at the (Hatha, Kripalu, etc.) over the years but this series by Ana Brett and Ravi Singh fundamentally changed my approach to wellness, fitness,  personal growth and outlook on life.  I was totally new to Kundalini Yoga and, frankly, a but skeptical about it since it has some ""unusual"" moves and poses and chanting compared to other forms of exercise and Yoga I have done at the gym and via DVDs.  Now I see the power of Kundalini via Ana and Ravi ""technology"" that integrates physicality, mindfulness, and spirit.  It is not easy at first - but that is the point.  You do what you can, dot judge yourself and you reap massive benefits.  I progressed quite rapidly from things I felt were impossible but worth trying to not so hard to challenging to ""not hard any more"".  I feel GREAT every single time I complete a DVD - -my mood, my body, my creativity, my stress, my mind clarity, my stamina, etc.  Its truly amazing.  The key to reaping these benefits is to not get caught up in saying ""this is weird"" but to say ""just try it and see how you feel"".  Incredibly fit and wise people did this type of yoga and meditation hundreds and thousands of years ago as a regular regime but Western society has somehow made it non-traditional and inaccessible.  Many other types of Yoga focus too much on the body and physicality and don't see the mind, body, spirit interconnection like Ravi and Ana.  Ravi and Ana make it so accessible - combining direction on how to do the poses and breathwork and sounds (mantras) that vibrate your body to heal it, strengthen it and give new clarity.  Ana demonstrates the poses (don't be intimidated by how easy she makes things look - just do your best is what I found) and Ravi and Ana explain the physiological basis of how each pose affects your glands, nervous system, muscular system. Brain and energy and spirit.  Ravi has amazing poetry sprinkled in to make it just a beautiful relaxing experience (even though its quite physical!).  The production is very professionally done -- different angles, alternatives if you have certain issues or challenges, music editing, pacing, etc.  I totally recommend any of Ana Brett and Ravi Singh's DVD's to anyone whether you do Yoga already or not.  It can truly take your fitness to another level along with your outlook on life.

I was able to break out of drug addiction because of what Ravi and Ana offer. Eventually I ordered more of their dvds (Ultimate stretch, journey through the chakras, and their meditation for beginners and beyond). I find them all to be very helpful on many levels. Ana and Ravi present in a kind, clear and encouraging way that I find uplifting and inspiring. They give modifications and explain the benefits of each exercise while guiding you to and through new ways of relating with energy.

All in all, I find Kundalini Yoga to be a powerful, beautiful tool for developing strength and flexibility of mind and body, releasing tension, staying present in the moment, and raising Spirit high.

energized and alive in a much deeper way like new life flowing through my veins.  The second set is more like
hatha style yoga, its called the 5 Tibetan rites. This is the more intermediate part but anyone can do it, you

However, even as someone who has practiced Kundalini for many years at home, I still find this a solid, useful practice.  I especially like to use the 20-minute spinal series in the morning hours as it leaves me physically and mentally elevated for the rest of the day and it is easy to fit into a busy schedule.  There is also a 17-minute series of exercises called ""The Five Tibetans.""  I don't tend to use this set as I don't really feel any effect from it, but that is not to say it wouldn't be very beneficial for someone else.

The ending meditation is very simple, so also suitable for someone new to meditation.  You simply concentrate on your pulse or heartbeat while silently repeating the phrase ""Sat Nam.""

I am also sleeping better at night, which is amazing considering that I've lived with sleepless nights from neck pain for over a decade and didn't think there was hope for my situation. The Rise & Spine part of the DVD is fabulous! For the rocking exercises, though, I find my spine is too fragile to match the instructor's pace, so I just slow my speed down a bit. I like that you can go at your own pace (unlike doing cardio DVDs where you feel like all is lost if you accidentally get half a step behind). There another main segment, the 5 Tibetans, and I did it once. Not a fan of all the back bending; it didn't feel good for my spine. When I gain more flexibility I'll try the Tibetan segment again, but for now I'm happy focusing on the Rise & Spine segment (along with the smaller segments for warming up and meditating).",1355961600,6,1174,4.222222222222222

For anyone who is in good health, which is a necessity, but who is not already flexible and in good condition, it's going to be challenging at first. Mastery comes in time if you stick with it. It's important to drink plenty of water before beginning, and after you've worked all the way through, you'll want lots more.

Some people are unable to work from beginning to end at first, but that will come in time. Because it is so intense, I worked on one section at a time until I mastered all of it. Learning the correct breathing, form and movement is important for it to be effective. It's worth it to focus on that from the beginning because correcting is difficult after you are ""set"" in a method. The breathing technique might come as a surprise, but that also gets easy with time and practice. It helps if you prepare for the program by learning about the background and unique aspects of this type of yoga.

The most beneficial section in the routine is the one on the Five Tibetan Rites, an amazing sequence that has been written about extensively and is especially worth researching. There are print outs on the net that provide a solid introduction to the forms and the benefits of the ritual.

Once learned and a comfortable part of your fitness repertoire, you'll feel great for the rest of the day after you do it, and no one could complete this program regularly and not become flexible and well conditioned. I'm very happy I discovered it.",1350259200,3,1567,4.589285714285714

In addition to the physical benefits of this yoga practice, there are mental, emotional, and spiritual benefits arising from repeated viewings and continued practice.

My perspective is that of a 62 male with a lifetime interest in fitness, mental well being, happiness and spiritual development. I have purchased and used regularly for several months eight of their DVDs. My life has been changed very positively as a result. I feel better, more flexible, and more energetic. I have more stamina, am calmer, more centered, and most importantly, more open to possibilities in my life.

Unlike many other yoga DVDs available, these use simple interior studio sets without the distractions of an exotic beach, stark desert, or lush tropical locations. The music is varied and thoughtfully chosen for the particular exercise. Ravi's soothing voice is uplifting while instructional. Most yoga poses are easy to follow, simple to do, and generally are NOT the pretzel bending type. The meditations and chanting are interesting and enjoyable additions to the physical practice, and I believe would not offend devout practitioners of Christianity or any religion.

I recommend these DVDs without reservation, and urge you to give this gift to yourself. But then, don't let it sit on your shelf. Create the habit of frequent, if not daily practice, for it is in this way that you will experience the transformative power therein.

The greatest gift that I have received from watching and practicing yoga with these DVDs is a better ability to view life's never ending challenges as possibilities for positive change.

Thank you so much, Ravi and Ana.

2439031,3,B000BRM992,"This is truly a unique experience for me. I did not expect this type of yoga at all. I gave it a try due to great positive comments by most users.

Positive: Unique experience

Negative:
1. I got a shooting pain at the side of my inner thigh the very next day - weird feeling - it's not muscle - I think it's nerve.
2. Too much uncomfortable movements - I feel as if my body is not aligned (centered) at all - I do yoga and pilates every day and I never felt this uncomfortable.
3. The purpose is to rid of toxins inside your body - great concept; however, the transition is too fast.

I did not really get any thing from this video but pain in my inner thigh. Each section are too long. If is completely different from what you normally know about yoga. Like most of the reviewers mentioned - you might read about kundalani yoga first prior to ordering this video.",1324857600,7,865,4.167664670658683
2439032,4,B000BRM992,"I love kundalini yoga for being able to tap into your energy and your sense of belonging in the universe.  If you're a beginner I recommend following Ana's advice in the dvd to ""go at your own pace"".  Some of the movements are quite fast to keep up with the breath and they can leave you a bit overtaxed.  Done a little slower, you still get the benefit and will be more likely to continue.  I like the music, the narration and the ample opportunity for meditation in this dvd.",1323216000,2,477,4.266666666666667
2439033,5,B000BRM992,"I will leave it to others to give a minute-by-minute review of everything on the DVD--it is worthwhile, but my comments are more about what the information on the DVD does. It is plenty, and it is positive in ways that exercise, including yoga, has never been for me.

I approached this as I might any yoga DVD, anticipating exercises of varying difficulty that would leave me exhausted, a bit sore, but feeling OK. Imagine my surprise...Kundalini Yoga, based on this more or less introductory DVD, is astonishing! The exercises are demanding, they are much more active than 99% of yoga workouts, but they, in combination with the meditations between exercises, actually give you more stamina and vitality to be able to do more than you thought you could do, which I find astonishing! Ravi and Ana's light touch and obvious expertise guide you through the workouts in a wonderful, easygoing, fun but knowledgeable way.

This DVD includes two separate sets, Rise & Spine and The Five Tibetans, which can be done separately or together. A word here about the Five Tibetans: These are five exercises which are said to have come from Tibetan Yogic practice and are for youth, vitality, and longevity. I had encountered them before and had tried doing them, and usually wound up with a wrenched, painful back and a discouraged attitude. Not so with Ana and Ravi, quite the opposite, in fact--Ana's and Ravi's way of presenting the exercises is so very different that I have been doing them for several weeks without the slightest injury or negative feeling about them--on the contrary, I feel confident they will be an ongoing part of my yoga repertoire! I intend to purchase more of their DVDs and report my experiences with them.

The most positive thing, for me, is the change in my energy levels and general health, both of which were going from not-so-good to worse, and which are now greatly improved and continuing in that direction. There is also a psychological/spiritual component (as above, so below, after all) involving a purification and release of old toxic patterns and emotions, never overwhelming or even nearly so, but quite noticeable and welcome.

Check this or Ravi's and Ana's other DVDs for a wonderful, knowledgeable, and fun introduction to Kundalini Yoga and its many benefits. I think you will be very glad you did!  I know I am!

2439034,5,B000BRM992,"I use this DVD in a women's prison every week.  I have gone through a long process with various yoga DVDs until I came upon the marvelous work of Ana and Ravi.  Hands down these are the best DVDs out there for my purposes.  I am working with a population that is deeply depressed, that has suffered trauma and heartache and it is hard, very hard to motivate them.  But Ana and Ravi do, in these great DVDs they have put out.  In this one, the women have learned to meditate, as basic breathing is taught and they are invited to meditate on ""the truth within"" in short moments between exercises.  They love this, since they have been taught there is nothing of value in them.  The exercises are great, you gain flexibility in your spine, which is so important for feeling good.  Ravi and Ana's words are so encouraging.  We always leave our practice laughing and that is saying a lot for this setting.  On the days we aren't using this one, we do Dancing the Chakras, total bliss!  Highly recommend both!",1318723200,10,1003,4.426229508196721
2439035,5,B000BRM992,"I have been doing yoga for a while now. I have resisted kundalini yoga for the longest time I don't know why. I just thought it is not true yoga since I believed yoga to be the one where you are bending like a pretzel or doing sun salutations. there is a lot of reason for my prejudice one being that i am from indian origin the land of yoga where vinyasa yoga and its derivatives are very popular, though there is talk of chakras, kundalini yoga is not that popular infact i had not even heard about it until i came to the US.

My second prejudice comes from the fact that the cover on this dvd shows Ana in a shorts and top, not very conservative and i some how believed that a yogi should have reserve after all yoga is about showing your inner radiance without any intentional show of beauty .

Well yoga is about letting go and i humbly accept my prejudice as wrong as I am here writing this review after completing the entire dvd. Kundalini yoga was an experience unlike anything i have ever experienced. First of all it is dynamic but still not a frenzy since the breath initiates your movement, there is this amazing calmness in the dynamic movement. I am reminded of Ravi saying that the body is way to experience the soul and thats exactly what it feels like, the calmness in movement.

If you have been doing different kind of yoga I think you owe it to yourself to explore kundalini yoga for the reason that it enhances any other type of yoga you are doing.

Ana's clothes has been so much under scrutiny, in that regard i will tell you this come out of your prejudice and look at it from your spirit, marketing or advertisement or sexism etc are all what it is takes to earn a living. They promise a kundalini yoga practice and that spirit and honesty is definitely there in this DVD.

Thanks to the amazon gift card my husband gave and asked me to spent on something i would never think of buying :)

I don't usually write reviews, but this Kundalini stuff has really saved my life. I felt horrible, and just couldn't seem to get myself motivated to do anything. I have tried a million exercise DVDs, and so didn't have high hopes this would do anything.

But, wow, to my amazement, I felt better immediatly. I then got inspired, and bought 3 more Kundalini DVDs. I couldn't even say which is my favorite, I use them all!

I am not really a yoga person, I find it too slow. I love this stuff because it is quick, has great music, and gets me moving, but also has a very amazing spiritualness to it. I found myself happier, more aware, and with more confidence. Oh, and my body feels great too.

2439039,1,B000BRM992,This does not give a person a good workout.  There were not many yoga poses used and it was comprised mostly of body thrusting.  There were only two main workouts and the first one is comprised mostly of sitting.  I was very disappointed with this DVD.  I do not recommend this yoga DVD if one wants to utilize yoga to stretch and tone.,1316476800,7,336,4.285714285714286
2439040,5,B000BRM992,"I was searching for a Yoga practice suitable for an out-of-shape person (me)and the Kundalini Yoga for Beginners and Beyond with Ana Brett and Ravi Singh works very well for me, unlike many yoga DVDs I have tried.

Much of the practice is done with Ana sitting crosslegged, but can be done seated on the edge of chair or couch for those who can't sit crosslegged.  Since I can't sit crosslegged it is nice to be able to participate in every section of the practice with this simple modification.

Kundalini Yoga is very different from other types of Yoga I have ever seen and I enjoy doing all the different sections.  It starts off with a Breath Primer (4:28) which is very helpful to get the breathing started correctly.  There is a short chant and meditation section (2:39) which I find very beneficial and relaxing.  There are Warm Ups (6:11) and Set One (20:20)and Set Two (17:32)of exercises, followed by Deep Relaxation (8:36), meditation (5:18), and a short Closing Prayer (2:59).  You can use the Matrix option to switch this around or delete a section although I like them all.

Kundalini Yoga includes much flexing of the spine and CAUTION should be exercised.  Ravi states one time that you should not feel you have to keep up with Ana and I think it would help if he said it more often or with more emphasis.  I would highly recommend taking the spine flexing sections very slow and carefully.  Ana is fast and she also ""snaps"" her spine, but she has probably been doing this practice for many years.  Benefit is found in doing the same exercise slowly and smoothly without the ""snap"".  Keep in mind at all times that you do not want to ever hurt your back or spine.

If you have any spinal or back issues, this is probably not a good practice for you at all.

I enjoy being able to do this practise, and I feel relaxed and positive when it is over.

A few reviewers mentioned the distracting boy shorts so I learned my experience was not unique!  Since you will want to move your body like Ana is moving hers, it is helpful to actually be able to see what she is doing.  Personally I found her lack of muscle definition just as distracting as the shorts.  She must be physically fit and strong to do this practice but you can't tell by looking at her.  So these are just some of the thoughts that can distract you from your practice and at least they keep you focused on the DVD.  After a few times doing the practice the shorts will be less distracting and in the meantime you might be glad that you can clearly see her body movements.

I also enjoyed the setting (daisy flower) and music.  Overall I like this DVD very much and use it frequently, unlike some others I have which remain in the closet waiting until I am in better shape.",1314403200,7,2751,4.42544731610338

This is the first Kundalini Yoga DVD I've gotten and I have to say the effects of using this entire DVD is magical. I highly recommend trying this if you are stressed out or if you want to live the benefits of a life of awareness and living in the present moment.

An amazing discipline and this is an amazing DVD to own.

What I recommend is that you do not skimp on the breathing, this is a vital aspect of Kundalini Yoga and chakra clearing. Breathe as they say, in sync with the movements and how they say, and hold the breaths in and out when directed. The breathing is vital in Kundalini Yoga as the breath has an intelligence of its own and is instrumental in the process.

Don't worry so much about perfection, but doing the movements in the way that you are able to.

Guys: Don't judge the cover and think that this is only for women or that you will feel feminine doing this. That is a story you are telling yourself. The benefits of doing this far outweigh giving in to your fears of self-consciousness!

  So, entering the yoga experience there are so many varied practices.  The 2 i found that pulled me in were Vinyasa Flow and Kundalini.  Kundalini is in itself is serene, calming, and meditative.  B/C of the well instruction in this dvd Kundalini for Beginners and Beyond, i've made Kundalini Yoga an absolute must have in my life... i was doing it daily, than burned out. Now, i make sure to at least incorporate it once a week- preferably in the beginning of my work week to stablize my chi and align my spine which TRULY works!!!  The Kundalini Yoga Ultimate Stretch i also practice every first day off on my weekends... if you've never done yoga Kundalini is the best way to start.

2439051,5,B000BRM992,"The first thing you need to understand about this DVD series is that it truly IS Kundalini yoga, so if you love Kundalini, you will probably love these DVDs, and if you like Power yoga, you probably will not.  My first yoga experiences were with Kundalini, and I came to expect a work-out that also addressed my internal body, my emotional body and my spiritual self.  When I moved to the east coast, I had a hard time finding a Kundalini class and have always been disappointed and bored in Hatha, or worse yet, Power yoga, especially as offered in most gyms.  I feel something is missing if there is no meditation or chanting in Sanskrit.  I know a lot of people think it's weird.  I think they are missing out.

Kundalini will give you a challenging workout, but you have to open your mind to getting a workout in a way that doesn't feel like lifting weights or spin class.  If that's not for you, that's fine.  If it is, Ravi and Ana do a great job in general.  I would give them 9 out of 10.  The things that bug me about the video are mostly her clothes.  I honestly do not know why her butt hangs out of her shorts, which is noticeable in one of the sets where you stand up and twirl.  Her outfit feels kind of show-offy, but hey, if Madonna is your client, maybe you get used to that.  Nonetheless, you do most of the exercises with your eyes closed, and Ravi and Ana's audio overlay is really great.  So I just accept that and choose not to let it get in the way of me enjoying these DVDs.

These are a great series if you don't have access to Kundalini classes or want to supplement during other times of the week.  I am truly grateful they have been made!",1297728000,8,1666,4.208201892744479
2439052,5,B000BRM992,"Wow, this is a fantastic Kundalini yoga DVD. I bought it because I have spinal arthritis with functional scoliosis and I have to do things like Gyrotonics and Kundalini Yoga just to walk normally and stand up straight. I used to mainly do Iyengar yoga which I still love, but Kundalini movements really move the spine into the right position and put attention on the bandas (pelvic floor, navel, etc) which have to be strong to have a straight spine and move correctly (as one learns in Pilates).

When I saw the negative review here that mentioned the ""strange"" gyrating movements I knew this would be good for my spine but I was not prepared for the immediate benefit of feeling FANTASTIC after only doing the short warm-up and ""Rise and Spine"" portion of the DVD. I even went to the chiropractor after just doing the ""rise and spine"" who was amazed at how easy it was to put me into shape that day. Since then my chiropractor has told me I don't need to come so often and hardly ever has to crack my neck! Except for the fact that I often adjust my posture in the course of a day, my friends say they can hardly tell I have scoliosis, now, they just think I have great posture!

Another great thing about this DVD is that I can use the menu option to just do the segments I want to do right now because each part of the practice, from doing Om, to the warm-up, rise and spine, Tibetan rites, Sivasana, they're all separated out so that you don't have to waste time fast-forwarding through anything.",1296518400,9,1501,4.39568345323741

I tend to research and read a million reviews for even my smallest purchases, and while this usually serves me well, it did not with Kundalini Yoga. This is the first time I have written a review, but I think it is necessary for those avid review readers like me.

I'm not a yoga professional, but I have done my share of videos and been to several classes. This is not even close to traditional yoga - it is unlike anything else I've ever done (in a bad way). There are few traditional asanas (poses), it's mostly very repetitive with rapid thrusting, spinning, and twisting. I became dizzy and nauseous. They say ""Do this pose anytime to get a great lift."" - yeah, because you're oxygen deprived. The things the voiceover says seem condescending and somewhat of ""psychobabble"". Also, the girl is almost naked and the camera is in her crotch.

The first half is glorified kegels (you are asked to tense your rectum and ""sex organs"" several times). The second part is repetitive to the point of boredom. I actually ended up fastforwarding.

2439055,5,B000BRM992,"Wow!  I've been doing this DVD once or twice a week for about 2 and 1/2 months now and I just can't believe what it's done for me!  I've had a catch in my lower right back for ohhh..about 4 years now.  It's nothing critical, and sometimes I don't notice it at all, but typically in the mornings, I have to sloooowly roll up out of bed.  After sitting for any amount of time in a 'comfortable' chair (i.e. recliner ;p), there is no quick from sitting to standing, it's a ""try to come standing, stop at 90 degrees, kinda torque my body to the left and hunch my way into standing"" maneuver.  Nothing debilitating, just crazy annoying! (And to all you pessimists out there, yes I AM overweight but have been doing core work (ab/back exercises) for years to try to strengthen this area but have always ended up with rather limited benefits.)
So here we are 4yrs with this little issue of mine and now I've been doing this DVD for a little over 2 months.  And let me tell you my friends, last week I almost cried when I stood up straight from that recliner and was 1/2way across the room before I realized that there was no pause, there was no hunched sway to come to standing, it just WAS!  The whole DVD is wonderful but the Set 1: Rise and Spine..well, I just can't believe it! ;D  There's a ton of flexing of the lower and upper spine that if your back is a little weak (like mine was!) you'll be shocked at how quickly you'll want to stop, lol!  But listen to Ravi as Ana is doing the work on screen, he'll say variations of ""Don't push too hard, only go as fast or as slow as you are able"", etc.  And sometimes it may not seem like it, but going at your own pace is still extremely beneficial in these exercises!
I still have days where I ache (hey, who doesn't!) but now I almost embrace them!  If I'm sore in my back area that day, I know that I can do the Rise and Spine segment, be a little MORE sore afterwards(heh) but then in an hour or 2, I just feel amazing (and I just can't get tired of going from sitting to standing fluidly over and over again!)
Along w/ that wonderful set is Set 2, the Tibetan Poses...again, WOW!  A person already gifted w/ a strong body may not appreciate how tough this set can be!  It is absolutely remarkable..I read elsewhere that the Tibetan Rites are typically performed 21 times for maximum benefits..well, i'm not even close to that number! ;p  But I've gone from just watching Ana's performance (wow, she is BEAUTIFUL in her work!), to timidly trying a few exercises of each, to now seeing an increase of my strength, positioning and number of poses performed each time I give it a go!
That along w/ the soothing meditation at the end..well all I have to say is: Please, PLEASE get this wonderful DVD to achieve new horizons in your yogic journey! :DDD",1286496000,11,2795,4.278937381404175

The routines are challenging but doable and I can feel myself getting stronger and able to endure longer or move toward the more advanced position gradually.
In re: the several comments about the ""decor"" and Ana's attire. A)I don't find anything negative about either one but, more importantly, B) I have my eyes closed 95% of the time so, even if I thought the decor was too stark or Ana's dress was too skimpy, I wouldn't be distracted by it since I would not be seeing it.
The meditations are relaxing and soothing and help me focus on peace, renewal and grace. There is nothing that can be construed as non-Christian for any of you that are concerned about this as an issue. And, as a matter of fact, Christ meditated regularly so you can actually feel closer to Him doing this.

I feel like the spinal series helps me get my back into alignment, improve my posture, and improve my energy. My favorite exercise is called the ""washing machine"" feels so good after sitting at the office all day! Love the matrix option. Then I can just do the warm up and spinal series if I want a quick 30 minutes of yoga, or I can do the whole thing, for like an hour I think.
Thanks Ravi and Ana, for all your good work!",1285632000,5,493,4.040816326530612

2439060,3,B000BRM992,"Yoga is something I have always wanted to get into and I finally decided to pick up a dvd to give it a try.  I did my research and liked what I saw with this DVD.  As someone who has never done yoga before, I don't feel like this ended up being the right purchase for me.  The biggest issue I had was that I didn't feel like there was enough direction about proper positioning.  It made me very nervous I was going to injure myself.  I thought the breathing exercise were good, however for a DVD that has ""Beginners"" in the title, I felt very uncomfortable with it. I believe this DVD is something that I need to come back to when I find something else that teaches me the basics a little better.  The style of this DVD was also something that I would maybe appreciate a little more with a stronger Yoga background. The music and the woman and the voice overs were all a little too surreal and distracting for me...again, I am saying this as someone who strives to, but doesn't yet understand the deeper meaning/purpose of yoga.  I just don't think this is for beginners.

The one thing I did really appreciate was the matrix option which I am seeing more and more on different workout DVDS.  It's nice to be able to mix and match sections of workouts to fit your time and needs for any given day.",1282089600,7,1297,4.261224489795918

2439062,5,B000BRM992,"Kundalini Yoga for Beginners and Beyond with Ana and Ravi.

My yoga journey started with Hatha Yoga which I very much enjoyed for approx 1 year prior to discovering Kundalini Yoga.  Once I began doing Kundalini Yoga it soon became my main yoga practice as I resonate with it completely.  There is more movement such as flexing and twisting with Kundalini and the breath is incorporated and eyes closed.  I find that I go deep into the practice and it has certainly benefitted my life greatly.  For example I am calm and mindful yet also energised and committed to whatever I may choose to do...much more willpower!

I won't do a great detailed review of this class structure as others have already done such a good job in their reviews.  I will tell you that this is one of my very favourite DVD classes to work with.  The production is high quality, the class flows very well from Tune in, then a lovely warm up section that prepares body and mind for what follows next and loosens up the spine ready for the work ahead.  The five tibetans is beautifully demonstated by Ana and instruction is clear and conscise.  You are encouraged throughout and the music helps to keep you going too.  Of course I always work within my own limits on any given day, each day can be different so I just accept what I can do and it is fine.  The relaxation is lovely and meditation blissful and then Tune out.

A wonderful class, with many benefits!  Thank you Ana and Ravi x",1278979200,5,1459,4.456603773584906
2439063,5,B000BRM992,"As others have mentioned this isn't your typical yoga class. You will engage and tone muscles as well as stretch areas you didn't even know existed, BUT unlike typical yoga, you are moving and breathing the whole time and the end effect is nothing short of feeling incredible! I fell in love with this style of yoga instantly and am thrilled that my boyfriend (who thought he could never do yoga), feels comfortable with this DVD and is actually is looking forward to doing this program each day with me!

It is so lovely to have the 2 sets: a releasing set that works through the spine and then the full body workout in the 5 Tibetans - awesome sequencing! I can't say enough good things about this title. I'm sure it has made so many people confirmed Kundalini Yoga addicts! I'm one of them for sure!",1278374400,2,802,4.45578231292517

The tape is challenging and I see myself doing the poses a littler better as I continue, plus my shoulders and arms are looking good. I'm glad I bought the tape, it's worth the money if you like Kundalini yoga. Oh and the talking is encouraging and relaxing but not too much.",1274918400,3,378,4.414285714285715

I watched this DVD a few days before I attended my first kundalini workshop. I have since become very enthusiastic about kundalini yoga and am getting further training in it. I feel that the material in this DVD was very helpful in preparing me for my workshop and I continue to use it for ongoing instruction. All of the kundalini techniques are explained and demonstrated very professionally and thoroughly. No prior knowleged is necessary to understand the DVD. I highly recommend it to the kundalini novice and also to the experienced practitioner. I will certainly keep it as a valued part of my yoga library.

I want to relax and stretch and breathe, but I also want to feel like I worked my muscles. This DVD does all of that. It gives me the whole yoga experience. It's excellent to learn the basics of yoga. Like the great reviews say, I felt the effects even 3 min. into the workout. I can see using this forever.",1270684800,3,474,4.053191489361702

It is more active than other styles you may have tried, but what is so fabulous about it is if I do nothing else in the day, I still feel I got it all done!!! In addition to toning and stretching and working you inside and out, the breathwork combined with the flowing movements give you some aerobic benefits.  This DVD has 2 sets which can be done together, or you can just do one.

I wasn't sure if she was trying to do yoga or some porn moves...  I don't get all the positive reviews.  The sterile white background, despite the flower, is too boring looking after all.

2439070,5,B000BRM992,I like to mix up my routine and have started committing to at least 15-30 minutes of yoga a day after I do my weights. I have fallen in love with Kundalini Yoga because it has an aerobic quality so if I feel like I'm getting some extra cardio in. It also is the only thing that has helped with my chronic tummy pooch! Ana & Ravi are the Queen and King of Kundalini Yoga DVDs. Their dvd programs ard simply the best. They make the yoga accessible and also make sure you get a quality full body workout in each dvd. They also make it convenient to break up the workout according to whatever amount of time you have. This one is great because it works the whole spine and then has a great yoga set that has you moving from one hatha pose to the next all with the breath. Its a great little workout in itself and makes me feel like I every part of me is getting yogacized!,1268265600,3,868,4.0523255813953485
2439071,5,B000BRM992,"Wow. This one is put together excellently. I am a huge fan of RaviAna Dvds. I bought my first one, Fat Free Yoga, about a year and a half ago and have been hooked ever since. I own Fat Free, Ultimate Stretch, Cleanse, Beauty Body, Yoga for Beginners and Beyond (Strech, Strengthen, Stress-Free), Dance the Chakras, Bliss Hips, Quick Fixes, Journey thru the Chakras, and their new Meditation one.

 I absolutely love every one and usually rotate and do a new one each day. The only one that I don't do often is the Quick Fix, at this time in my life I have time for a full workout everyday so don't really need to do short routines, but I am sure when the time comes that I do, I will utilize that one more. It is hard to say what my favorites are because they all work on different things, but the one that I have always LOVED doing for its effectivness and just how concise it is would be Beauty Body.

 Now I think I need to add this one right up there to the top of the list. I have heard good things about it for awile and decided to go ahead and add it to my collection, sooo glad that I did.

 It is layed out wonderfully. The spine set is very relaxing and makes you feel like jello. The five tibetin rites were new to me and they are great, not to difficult but also not easy. They just flow, I thought I was going to hate the downward dog to upward dog, but it actually feels wonderful. When I got done with it for the first time yesterday I just felt great, blissful.

 If you own other Raviana dvds this one is great to add to the collection, the spine series can be found in pieces on other dvds but not for an entire set and the second segment is completly different then anyting on the dvds that I own from them. LOVE IT!",1268265600,3,1735,4.08235294117647

I had tried 2 or 3 yoga classes at my gym but they didn't really do anything much for me. Ana & Ravi's dynamic form of Kundalini Yoga is an exciting yoga form. It's like a good cup of coffee for body & soul! The breathing combined with movement and poses is just so powerful. I experienced a literal high. That got me to go back and keep doing it and this DVD has not left my DVD player in 2 weeks. I've been wracking my brain, trying to decide which one(s) of their's to get next. I think I'm going to go for either their Fat Free Yoga, Kundalini Yoga Cardio, Stretch/Strengthen, or their new Transformer. So many Ana/Ravi DVDs. So little time!",1268179200,3,764,4.168918918918919

This DVD contains some nice options for the participant. The first set is a spinal series that contains very pleasantly energizing twists and bends of the spine. Everything is connected to the breath and wow am I buzzing by the end of the 25 minutes or so. The second set is called the 5 Tibetans and is a great little strengthening and releasing routine. Very nice. Both sets are very accessible to beginners and very useful for Kundalini intermediates and advanced as well. Beginners can still participate in the 5 Tibetans just rest when it gets tough and join in again when you are ready. I highly recommend this one!",1268092800,5,787,4.621428571428571

I have many yoga DVDs and the one Kundalini one. This is a dippy chick on a flower rug twisting. It is just too much. No real physical impact I could detect (unlike the Gurmkuh tape that kicks my rear every way until Sunday). And it just seemed silly and out there.

I've been doing yoga and pilates for years and I would never have described yoga as exciting. However, Kundalini yoga is and especially with these two. It's 16 times more powerful than any other yoga. The high will put a grin on your face. My posture is straigher, I've lost kilos, I'm more toned and it's noticeable in stomach, arms, bottom and thighs. I'm giving all my other dvds away because you only need Ana and Ravi's.

I was a little amazed at how fast I felt results: more energy, calmer, happier, and  motivated. I thought I wasn't going to have enough energy to do this workout but I found that I gathered more energy as I went along. There is really something to this combination of poses, movement, breathing, and meditating. It's a workout and a visit to the spa in one. I can't thank Ravi and Ana enough for their wonderful programs!",1266364800,8,531,4.418367346938775

2439078,5,B000BRM992,"After finding out about Kundalini yoga from Ana & Ravi's ""Dance the Chakras"" DVD, I ordered this one for my upper back & right shoulder area. My upper back & especially right scapula(shoulder blade) was so tight that it hardly moved. Also, I had increasingly frequent numbness in my right hand from nerve impingement from soft tissue tightness all around my right should joint. I had been going to a massage therapist for deep tissue massage. Going on [...] & looking up neck & upper back tightness in their ""health archive A-Z"" area, they recommended their ""Rise & Spine"" segment on this dvd along with core strengthening exercises which are on most of their dvd's(seems like most of their dvd's give you an all body workout with some concentrating on certain areas more than others). After just 1 workout of the 20min ""Rise & Spine"", my right scapula was moving again closer to normal range. Two of the workouts on the 2nd part of this dvd in the ""Five Tibetans"" loosened up my chest area providing more relief to my right hand numbness. Over time(it's been about 1 month) with doing these & other Kundalini yoga exercises(the yoga ones from ""Dance the Chakras"") 5-6x per week, the numbness is now only occasional!!  I no longer have the need to go to the massage therapist. $35 for two dvd's that work better than massage therapy at $60 per session! And this dvd will give you a great full-body workout: stretch, strengthen, aerobic & relaxation too. Kundalini Yoga is a big help for the mind & emotions. This is the best stress reduction I have ever done!  Also, being a Catholic, I do not follow the spiritual parts of this (the chanting & mudras). Again, that is something you can go along with or not. I do my own version of meditating when they meditate (basically just visualize a beach, forrest, starry night, etc, & think ""peace & calm"").",1265587200,14,1849,4.651376146788991

I feel totally stretched and my muscles feel worked out in a really deep way. I'm a sort of a meat and potatoes exercise person and never thought I'd gravitate to yoga type things. I'm really intrigued by Ana & Ravi's style of Kundalini Yoga.

I was picturing some core work, some downward-dog, etc.  This is a strange, new-agey video of breathing exercises and odd body movements.  This is not a workout.

I have given this as a gift to no less than 15 friends and relatives. The first set can, for the most part, be done sitting in a chair.

I woke up feeling cold and kind of tired so I chose this DVD to see what it could do for me. It's not cardio, it's not toning, nor is it stretch although it has a little bit of each in it.  I would say it's more about energy more than anything else. Energy specifically in your spine and around your chakras.

Although it doesn't give me the same kind of well-being that traditional yoga gives me...it does give something.  More than any other workout it works on your energy centers and glands.  After doing these calisthenic type exercises (with plenty of breath and meditation breaks) I do get a feeling of warmth and well being. I can only explain that the exercises worked my chakras and glands giving me the pleasant feeling. You do feel healthier even if you are not sure why or how.

One thing this DVD offers that I have not found in other yogic workouts is the practice of bandas.  Ana has you practice bandas after each exercise.  It takes some time and patience but they are worth it.  This is very good as bandas are very good for you and this workout reminds you of that fact and gives you an opportunity to incorporate them into your life.

This is not my favorite or most joyful workout but it's a unique one that fits a niche in overall well being.  This workout makes you take the time to do these Kundalini exercises, exercises that probably would not be done without a video and for this, it is valuable in my workout rotation.",1262736000,2,1570,4.324232081911263

2439093,3,B000BRM992,"I bought this partly because of all of the positive reviews.  I was less impressed and thought to add a different take.

I bought the good DVD, Kundalini Yoga to Detox and Destress with Maya Fiennes, and liked how well it made me feel and wanted more or different instruction.  I'm fit, a little older, and have practiced other forms of yoga for some time, but am hardly an expert.

The routines in the video left me with a good energized feeling.  Some of the more intermediate routines were challenging and definately something to practice for better strength and flexibility.  The easier routines were within my comfort range and probably good for a beginner.  I'll continue to use the DVD for those reasons.

Visually the DVD was less than good.  The young lady was on a flower design with bright yellow pedals and a pink center pad.  I would perfer a more neutral environment and thought this distracting.  The man's voice was almost sing-songy, like he was instructing grade school age.  I almost expecting him to offer a high five.  As a beginner instruction I thought this should have more about proper form and also some safety discussion.  You can truely injure yourself trying to exceed your comfort zone in some of these routines.  Finally, as an inexpert opinion, the routines tended slightly toward gym aerobics with less instruction on good traditional yoga form and routine.

I might add, I can feel a little poorly after one of these routines if I don't drink several glasses of water afterward.  Drinking water seems to really help eliminate some of the toxins that are released.",1255046400,4,1597,4.791208791208791

Now I have Fat Free Yoga, Solar Power, Yoga Transformer, & Meditation for Beginners & Beyond and they're all equally incredible.

2439095,1,B000BRM992,"I am not an expert to comment on the effectiveness of the content of this DVD, but in my opinion portraying this as Yoga is a complete disappointment. The music, movements and style does not match with the intent of Yoga. One funny point worth mentioning is that in between the exercises (not Yoga asanas) the creator of the DVD has included a cheesy Bollywood song! probably just to make it feel like yoga.

I would highly recommend considering other Yoga DVDs.

2439096,5,B000BRM992,"When I first added this DVD to my Ana and Ravi collection, I only did it now and then for some reason. But, now the more I do it the more I enjoy it and realize its far reaching benefits. It starts with a Basic Spinal Series...I believe it is the spinal series that Yogi Bhajan first taught when he came to America. It involves various flexing of the spine from the bottom of the spine to the top. It seems extremely simple at first, but it really works wonders for you. The next section is the Tibetan Rites. They are a challenge, but get easier with practice. They involve going from seated forward bend to bridge, down-ward facing dog to upward facing dog, kneeling forward and then back into camel, standing turning in a circle. Most everything is done with Long Deep breathing, except when you hold camel...it is done with the Breath of Fire. There is a wonderful meditation where you feel your pulse with your fingers and thumbs together.",1253923200,,944,4.494186046511628

We both love the fluid movement, the meditation and the easy flow of the video. We are both avid cyclist, so the exercises are fantastic for loosening up our tight shoulders and hamstrings!  My favorite part of this video is the Five Tibetans; I had previously been practicing them for several years as introduced to me by a friend and through the Ancient Secret to the Fountain of Youth books, but really enjoy the way Ana demostrates them in this video - it makes them much more dynamic, and really gives me a great all-around quick yoga session when I am short on time. I have shared this and the other videos with friends who have enjoyed them and gone on to purchase for their own home practices as well...

The production quality appears poor - lighting, sound, music, etc...  The movements are awkward and so repetitious to the point of boredom.  I tried this video solo and with some friends whom I work out with.  I thought if I tried it in a group setting that I might find it more enjoyable.  None of us liked it, and we didn't even complete the DVD.  It was a big disappointment, and I haven't touched it since.

2439101,1,B000BRM992,"I bought this DVD because it had been rated so highly here. For me, at least, there are too many distractions. The music is horrid. It sounds like smooth Indian jazz during sections where the narrator talks and then moves into smooth Indiana jazz with a back beat during the exercises. How one can meditate with this distraction is mind boggling. I meditate in silence.

If there was a way to turn off the sound track, I might be able to get through the DVD, but the narrator (and the side kick narrator) is off-putting. The cadence of his voice suggests someone reading a children's book. This is echoed by a woman's voice speaking to six-year-olds.

I also very much agree with other reviewers that the pace of the exercises is far beyond that of the beginner. The speed of the repetitions is way out of my league. I knew this and that's why I opted for a DVD specifically geared toward beginners.

This is the first thing I have bought from amazon (and I purchase more than I care to admit) that I will be dumping into the trash.",1252540800,25,1032,4.421052631578948

Also, if you want to lose weight with yoga and get in shape and relax this is the best style of yoga to do all that. This yoga is so easy. To start you sit on the floor and hold your knees and rock, flex, twist, and stretch your spine with the breath. It's a great warm-up which makes me feel a foot taller. Then you do the 5 Tibetan set in which each exercise is done 21 times. What's exciting is that the results keep coming! I have lost weight doing nothing but this yoga (though I am now so psyched by my weight loss that I find myself making healthier food choices). Ana & Ravi's workouts keep me inspired and the two of them are so likeable they motivate me to get more of their workouts as well.

I started doing this dvd 3 times a week and it has done miracles for my energy levels and somehow reduces my hunger-I've lost 5 pounds!

I can't explain the pleasant buzz it gives me, just that my spine feels so good and even though I can't keep up with the pace and have to do modifications of the poses, I'm sweating by the end of it. Paradoxically, it relaxes me profoundly at the same time.

I needed something to be a push to get back to my old energetic healthy self and this dvd is perfect.

I try to practice a little each day.  The matrix menu allows me to pick out a 20 - 30 minute workout, because I use this to supplement other strength workouts and running.  I have also been in the process of a huge relocation, so this is something I have been able to do on the go.  I like the video because it is different and challenging, the instructors are obviously very experienced, and the instructions are fantastic.  I recommend watching the breath section first to better understand the breathing, I think it is key with yoga in general, especially this style.  I have improved my flexibilty greatly and feel more lithe and centered.  My posture has improved.  But the most amazing thing that has happened after practicing this video, is that my lung capacity has increased, AMAZING.  I did my first run in almost a month yesterday, due to relocation, and I didn't even notice until about 1.5 miles that I was strictly nose breathing, as in yoga and totally fine, not out of breath at all.  For those who run, this is pretty amazing after not running for a month.  So, I sped up, I had been trying to take it easy first run back.  End of story, ran my fastest 3 miles ever and still wasn't completely winded at the end.  AWESOME!  Ana Brett and Ravi Singh have definitely found a true follower of their videos.  I also own the Ultimate Stretch video.  I am trying to get my husband to do them now, he is also a runner.  Oh, I am also a Christian and have noticed some concern from other reviewers.  My response is to use the matrix, do the parts you want and skip some of the more meditation/chanting sections.  I usually skip them because I have two kids running around me when I am exercising, so meditation is quite difficult.  I really love the videos and will definitely buy more  Expanded lung capacity, for real, I am truly amazed!",1245024000,3,1998,4.398907103825136

I love that these exercises culminate both vigorous/snuffling light breathing with movement to workout the entire nervous system and organs. I find that the rolling back movements help extend my spine, and keep it straight. If you have sensitive knees or a back, please variate the movements in this DVD! I double over my mat to compensate, and find it really helps protect my back for a lot of the exercises presented in this DVD. Great narration, positive affirmations to listen to daily and solid workout. You will not be bored, and will find the challenge in being one with yourself each time you do this DVD.

First I will say that I enjoy their ""Fat Free"" DVD the best. Even though I do not like this DVD as well, it will be good for changing things up a little.

There are two main sessions to this video. The first session seems geared more for the beginner and is fairly easy and relaxing. The second session is much more advanced. With some of the poses that Ana was doing in this session I was unable to get my body to cooperate.

2439112,1,B000BRM992,"I have studied kundalini for years, but I had stopped for a couple and I thought an introduction dvd would be a good way to get back into it.  I really hated this dvd.  I think kundalini is so amazing - I've done every different kind of yoga around, and I love it the most.  It has been such a huge source of transformation in my life.  But this isn't a good introduction for newbies.  Or anyone really.

In a way, it was dumbed down - like calling a posture ""washing machine""?  Wha??  No one calls anything that - its like an adult saying ""poo poo"" (to another adult, mind you).  So the philosophy has been diluted, yet, I can't imagine a brand new student being comfortable with something like Sat Kriya.  That is something to work up to.  It's hard - mentally and emotionally/spiritually.  Plus the NPR voice over and girl talked so darn much!  They need to remember that if one were to make this a part of their regular practice, they don't need to hear about ""making this part of your daily grind"" day after day!

I also couldn't stand the music choices - they changed the tempo and style so much, it was really distracting.  I can say that this is a very unique kundalini experience - one unlike anything I've ever seen before, so if you don't like it, please don't be put off trying a different class/dvd.

And - I totally agree - in the hundreds of classes that I've been to, I've never, never seen a teacher (or student) dressed like this - it's kind of inappropriate.  What is wrong with this girl?",1236816000,41,1508,4.328571428571428
2439113,5,B000BRM992,"This series of DVDs seems to be a lot like the little girl with the curl in the middle of her forehead.  The hundreds of people who have given this release a 5 star rating (myself included) all exuberantly proclaim that salvation has arrived in the form of Ravi Singh and Ana Brett.  On the opposing side, those who hate this DVD REALLY hate it with the fiery passion of a thousand suns.
How to reconcile such a vast gulf between the opinions?  Well, first I would suggest trying to find this series through your library, as I did. (Netflix doesn't have it yet).  This is a very specific form of yoga, and if you're not prepared to just go with it, I can see how a person might be confused or disappointed, especially given how highly rated this disc is among Amazon users. (that old psychological trap of raised expectations, I suppose)
Anyway, throughout years of various movement classes, I have developed a pretty good sense of my own body and what I need to do to keep myself safe.  Someone trying to keep up with Ana who doesn't have this sense of their body's limits may very well experience the workout as frightening.  At certain points I felt myself getting dizzy so I sat out one or two repetitions and then joined back in.  I personally felt like I was in very safe hands, with plenty of guidance and safety tips, but clearly some reviewers feel that this area needs improvement.
Ultimately, however, I found this DVD workout to be deeply therapeutic and it put me into what I can only describe as a transcendent state; I was practically high.  At first I thought that with the chanting and meditating that this would mostly be a relaxation workout.  It certainly does have that benefit, but my body got an incredible physical workout, as well.  About half an hour after my husband and I had finished this practice, he remarked that he felt all wobbly like a baby giraffe, and I thought that description was very apt.  I was quivering from head to toe from the exertion.  Today I feel lactic acid fermentation in the muscles of my back, glutes, and arms, but none of the typical aches in my neck or back that come from alignment problems.  I just feel like correct posture is the easiest thing in the world right now.

The second set, The Five Tibetans, are great yoga-based exercises which work all of the major muscle groups.

I have very much enjoyed the yoga classes at my gym, but they are only once per week, so I was looking for something I could do at home. The instructor is a nurse and well versed on how the poses actually strengthen the body and increase health. This video was more what I would call ""new age"" or ""spiritual"" - I definitely should have researched the style before purchasing, as other reviewers have recommended.

I also did not think this would be a very good video for beginners even if this is the style of yoga that you are looking for. The instructor does not explain proper form very clearly (if at all) and moves through many of the poses very rapidly. A beginner might hurt themselves trying to go at that pace and without proper form.",1231200000,34,785,4.376712328767123

-Breath Primer (a description of Long Deep Breathing and Breath of Fire)
-Tuning In
-Warm Ups
-Rise and Spine
-The Five Tibetan Rites
-Deep Relaxation
-Meditation
-Closing Prayer

The ""Rise and Spine"" section would be a good place to begin for those new to yoga or not used to much physical exercise (my category).

On the other hand, the Five Tibetan Rites is where the ""Beyond"" bit kicks in- after my first time I landed up with a headache and sore muscles. I guess I tried to do too much in one go. The key lies in gradually building up your stamina...so don't give up!

The other great feature about the DVD is the matrix option which allows you to choose a combination of the above-mentioned sets and customize your yoga routine. Just be sure to read all the instructions on the insert.

When ever my back starts hurting me, I throw in the DVD and do the warm-up and the basic spinal series.  Sometimes I can feel my spine adjust back into place within the first couple of exercises.  Of course the muscles might continue to be sore for another couple of hours, but usually I am fine after that.

I have also noticed that if I practice it on a regular basis my back does not get out of whack in the first place - so I would also recommend as a preventive measure.

I also have the Kundalini Yoga With Gurmukh DVD, but find that I like the more meditative disposition of Kundalini for Beginners and Beyond.

Setting expectations:
1. It's not a hard core yoga DVD, especially the first 25 minutes or so.
2. It's a different kind of Yoga than main stream, focusing on energy development and mindfulness rather than powerful forms.
3. There is a lot of time for meditating and breath practice.
4. Some of the stuff seems a little weird at first, but the benefits are so incredible, I tend to overlook the weirdness of hit.
5. Anna Brett could put on more clothes, but it's really not a big deal - just kind-of awkward when I recommend it my neighbors and people in my church.",1230508800,10,1432,4.2234432234432235

It is nice that Ravi and Ana think outside the box of one tradition and do what works in service of the body, mind and spirit. It starts with the basic spinal energy series, working the central nervous system, and building flexibility. The spinal energy series is fundamental to the practice of kundalini yoga, and excellent to do on its own if you don't have time for any other exercise. Then the DVD strengthens you with the Five Tibetan movements, another valuable daily practice.",1228435200,2,603,4.8076923076923075

Intermediate and advanced can also get a good workout especially from the 5 Tibetens segment! Whew, that section really makes you work!  The set is plain which is good for me so I can focus on my yoga. I have yet to become bored of any of my Ravi and Ana dvds.  Each one seems to have something special in it for me.

They are challenging, and I don't always get through the whole set of each movement, but I notice my upper body strength getting much better.  As always, I love the variety of meditations that are so uplifting.

As a young adult, I was in a river accident and broke my tailbone...only to break it three more times later in life. I also ruptured a disk in my neck while delivering my second daughter...so I had a full cervical diskectomy with fusion. I'm older and living on the East Coast in the cold winters. When I do this DVD, it's like I'm having a complete overall body manipulation treatment without having to leave my home. I don't need pain pills if I do this DVD soon enough before the pain gets too bad. At that point I need to take a muscle relaxer, then do the DVD and after about three days from then, I'm PERFECT! I don't have to see a doctor for those pains anymore because of this DVD. Also, I have IBS and Interstitial Cystitis. I love how this DVD cleanses the organs. It WORKS!! Thank you! Thank you!

2439140,5,B000BRM992,"I am a long-time student of Kundalini yoga, and I heartily recommend this DVD to jumpstart the addition of yoga into your fitness routine. I have shared  ""Kundalini Yoga for Beginners and Beyond"" with friends new to Kundalini-style yoga or to yoga in general, and the feedback has been extremely positive.

The DVD includes two 25-minute workouts, both easy to follow. Everything is explained -- you really can't get lost.  The quality and pace of the presentation works equally well for the novice and those poised to take their practice to an intermediate level.

The first set focuses on the back and is great for building energy and releasing tensions in the body. The second set deals with strength building. I do both together for a super workout.

I especially appreciate the primer on the use of the breath and proper breathing, as it is one of the things that sets Kundalini-style yoga apart from the other types of yoga. The benefits associated with the breath techniques have made a tremendous difference for me, personally. The addition of the Matrix Menu allows for personalizing the workout to whatever order of exercises you choose. The DVD also comes with a booklet that explains Kundalini Yoga and how best to incorporate its practice in your life.

Ravi and Ana are seasoned teachers and both bring their particular strengths to their work. Ana is expert in teaching proper alignment and Ravi is known for the inspiration and encouragement he brings to yoga students. (I say that also from direct experience: I have had the pleasure of attending their classes.) In short, Kundalini Yoga for Beginners and Beyond is a must-have!

A warm fuzziness starts to spread out from my center to my finger tips, toes, and crown of my head! I feel my heart center start to open. Awesomeness! That's just part 1! Now I am nicely warmed to go into the 5 Tibetan Rites. Bone strengthening moves that tone my muscles and keep me from aging another day - awesomeness!

I'll continue to do this yoga DVD on days where I don't really feel like putting much effort in to a workout but push myself to do at least something.

2439144,5,B000BRM992,"I teach yoga in a style that is different from Kundalini, but after discovering Ravi and Ana's DVDs I have found Kundalini yoga to be incredibly fun, and excellent for producing results you can really feel and notice in the body and mind.  Their DVDs are my favorite yoga practices now - I invariably feel stronger, healthier and happier after I practice them!

The Beginners and Beyond DVD is a great place to start if you are new to yoga or new to Kundalini yoga in particular. The DVD is fun and feels great. If you are new to this practice, I would suggest a few things:

-Read the insert that comes with the DVD first. This gives some helpful tips like not eating a few hours before practice, etc., that will help to create a more enjoyable yoga session.

-Do the Breath Primer on the DVD - if you simply hit ""play DVD"" then it skips the Breath Primer, so make sure to go to the Chapter Outline and do the Breath Primer the first few times you practice until you feel you ""get"" the breath of fire and long deep breathing.

-Listen to your body - Ana does say at the beginning of the practice that if at any time the pace being demonstrated (for moving or for breathing) is too fast for you, it is fine for you to back off. These breaths and movements can ultimately be amazing for the body, but you may want to start them a bit more slowly - there's no ""shame"" in that - you're still getting plenty of benefits and probably more benefit in the long run by not forcing your body and taking it at a pace that works best for you.

Practice in a way that is mindful for your body, and ENJOY the benefits!",1222905600,3,1605,4.2117263843648205

It truly has positively affected how I deal with my family and work everyday.  Not to mention, I have lost about 10 pounds so far.  I believe it has eliminated my previous habit of emotional eating.

This yoga transformed my body (especially my back) and mind. I love meditation and even though I don't follow the mantras included in the DVD, I find that after the yoga my body and mind are very clear. This yoga is different than the other yoga that I had been doing (I'm a beginner) so I thought it was weird at first....but wow, the results are amazing. I also didn't think it was that great of a workout the first time I tried it...but I wasn't doing all the exercises correctly.

The second time I gave it a try I asked a friend who's fairly experienced with yoga to join me. She ended up being worn out by the end and I realized what an intense workout this DVD actually provides.

After less than a month of daily practice of this DVD I feel much stronger and and in better shape. As much as I have big respect for kinesology and nutrition science, Yoga in general shows that body is not a mechanic thing and is a direct expression of the mind. That is why body shape and health is subject to a larger set of factors that are not limited to nutrition or physical exercise. Although eating right and exercising are inevitably a part of our well-being, Kundalini Yoga takes us 'beyond the veil' and allows us to work on our minds.

Problem is....Boring!!!! My next problem was, yoga classes are a fortune! I decided to try buying a yoga dvd first to see if I would actually try staying w/ these yoga exercises or would I quit them & be out the $12. I can deal with throwing $12 away a lot easier than 10 times that amount for one month of yoga classes. Anyway, the dvd is great. The first part of the dvd (which last aprox 25 minutes)is core exercises & core stretching. Every movement is done sitting on the floor, no weird pretzel moves to make you feel like a clutz. I do a lot of the stuff sitting on the edge of a chair (my knee doesn't like to be bent for very long in a cross-legged position). After the first use of the dvd I was able to go to bed & actually sleep w/o waking up w/ lower back pain.

The music is first rate as well and not generic yoga music You don't need to  view this one first to get it like other programs I have tried. Just put it in the player and go! I particularly like what the first program ""Rise & Spine"" does to alleviate my chronic back pain. The spinal twists and flexes feel amazing and energize at the same time.
The other 25 minute set is the classic 5 Tibetan workout program. Each exercise is 2 yoga poses done in a flowing manner back and forth. You do not repeat more than 21 times and the full 21 is something to work up to. It is an entire body workout and lots of fun as well  I highly recommend this as well as their Fat Free Yoga.

The reason for only 4 stars is because, I like to sweat more during my workouts. I've been doing pilates for 5 years and was curious about Kundalini. I think I'll use it more as a cool down due to the fact that it IS a more slow and meditative workout. FUNNY COMMENT: the background music they play on the DVD is kind of addicting.

This one eases you right into a great workout starting with sitting exercises for the spine (you can do them crosslegged or even in a chair). This set is awesome if you ever have back troubles. Better then a chiropractor visit! The second set eases you towards an Intermediate level with strengthening poses made interesting by flowing between one strength building move to another. Awesome! I got results so quickly I wrote to Ravi & Ana to ask for their suggestions as to what to buy next. They wrote back within the next day which was great!

2439163,5,B000BRM992,"This DVD is a great start in learning a practicing Kundalini Yoga. As a Yoga teacher trained in other Yoga  traditions as well as Kundalini Yoga(by Ana and Ravi), I have found the breath practices and basic spinal set presented here have become favorite teaching set of mine and I usually recommend this DVD to beginning students looking to build a Yoga practice at home for this reason. The movements are accessible for most with the modifications provided and most of the essential techniques of  Kundalini Yoga are included in the sets.
 Ana and Ravi pace the instruction in a way to support working at your own level in the practice and some modification are suggested for those who feel limited. The mood of the DVD is calm and encouraging and I think this is essential for those trying to get back to exercise if they have been sedentary for awhile. Be patient with yourself and have fun as you begin, results will come as you apply yourelf!!!
Like some other reviewers, I had not seen a presentation of the 5 Tibetans before this. Ana and Ravi did a good job including this in the DVD. It is a simple and powerful practice to grow into over  time.
Finally, I also agree with the reviewer Lisa below who suggests that students read up on Kundalini Yoga to expand their knowledge further.  I also encourage people to find a Kundalini Yoga class at some point in time in order to enjoy the community and group spirit that can spark inspiration and ongoing motivation to practice Yoga.",1217462400,7,1488,4.6

If a workout is not fun I just won't do it but they really do make it over the top fun! I've been using my Ravi/Ana tapes for 2 months and was already seeing and feeling results after 1- 2 weeks! The 5 Tibetans is the more challenging set and I am still working up to the 21 repetitions that each flowing set of exercises is supposed to be done for so I would recommend this DVD to beginners like myself,who still that want a good,toning strengthening workout, cause it works up a sweat!

I admit when I first saw one of Ana and Ravi's DVDs, I didn't really like Kundalini all that much.  I definitely suggest if you are a beginner to kundalini yoga to try this DVD first.  The movements are simple, but at the same time challenging.  This practice allows the person to perform the movements at their own pace, since each asana is repeated multiple times which increases the benefits.  This type of yoga is also really easy to stick to! Plus the new matrix menu option is awesome.  It allows users to choose certain sets if they are short on time or need a quick relaxation pick me up.

I still love Ashtanga, but it was almost like a chore a lot of the time to roll my mat for it.  I knew I would feel great after, but it took a lot of intense concentration and sometimes I would get impatient.  This yoga is easy to give my concentration and easy to follow.  I feel calm and comfortable, yet challenged and rejuvenated.  I can't tell you enough how grateful I am to have found these DVD's.

Beginners and Beyond is a perfect start for any beginner.  There is a great little section that goes over the two different breaths.  I still like to do the breath primer actually because it makes me feel so good, and is a great way to start practice.  The warmups are fantastic, and the spinal exercises make your back feel so strong when you are finished.  The 5 tibetan rites, can be a bit challenging for a beginner, but the thing about Ravi and Ana is if you just try your best and breath, you will get incredible benefits.  I do try to perfect my poses, but I am not as impatient about it with them as I was with Ashtanga.  It just feels great to breath and go on their Kundalini journey.

Also, as a side benefit, since I have started their yoga, I am getting told by EVERYBODY that I look so young and refreshed.  When I meet people they are astounded to find out that I am in my thirties as they would swear I am in my mid twenties.  It is really amazing what this does for your body inside and out.

I hope this has helped even one person decide to get this, trust me, you won't be sorry.",1216339200,5,1672,4.158878504672897

Everything is meticulously executed, right down the the thoughtfulness of the aesthetics. (I love the simple, round, pink mat in the middle of the flower petals and lack of distracting elements.)  I have been doing Kundalini Yoga for a year and didn't know it.  I had been practicing the Five Thibetan Rites and needed a boost because it was getting boring.  This tape has the Rites but done in a slightly different way and also another workout that I love.  I feel invigorated and energetic when I do these exercises.  I ordered another DVD to try because I love it so much and just want to experience some variety.",1215129600,3,713,4.559055118110236

I have now updated to the matrix menu option version of this so you can progam your workout beforehand and include the segments you want. That way you stay in the zone and don't have to fumble with the remote at all. The exercises are all emminently doable and very easy to follow, with modifications supplied as well.  One major selling point for Kundalini Yoga is that you really feel the benefits right away. It is a great style of yoga, a whole body workout, with no impossible poses. With this DVD I get stretching, energizing, strengthening, relaxation, and peace of mind! This DVD will do whatever you want it to do for you.",1214524800,3,787,4.465277777777778

Ana & Ravi are seasoned teachers and you can really trust you are getting a safe and effective practice! What I love most about Kundalini Yoga are the unique postures. You'll see poses in this video you won't see in most of the other Yoga dvds such as alternating from up-dog to down-dog, bridge to staff, flexing hero pose, moving camel, washing machine!!! (I feel clean as fresh laundry after this one!!!) and quite a few I don't know the name of yet. I own almost all of the Ana & Ravi DVDs. Everyone of them gets regular use but  I have to say that this one is one of my favorites for what it does for my back and moods!",1214438400,2,760,4.241379310344827

I have practiced Hatha, Iyengar, power and hot yoga.......this Kundalini is a total yawn.  It is basically a breathing yoga and not physical at all.  I would not recommend this for someone who is anything more than sedentary.",1214438400,7,395,4.52112676056338
2439173,5,B000BRM992,. I've been doing this yoga set every night after my daughter goes to bed - after a c-section a beginner set like this is about the right speed for me.  I highly recommend this dvd to people looking to check out Kundalini and to practiced yogis too!,1214006400,2,249,4.1875
2439174,5,B000BRM992,"When I first experienced Ravi Singh and Ana Brett in a kundalini yoga class in Washington, DC, I couldn't believe how packed the room was.  Asking a few students how they heard about the teachers, they said ""their DVDs"".  Finally I watched ""For Beginners..."".  Now I know why so many students find kundalini yoga through their DVDs.

I really enjoyed the music transitions in the rest periods, and the consistent reminders to mentally chant the mantra ""sat nam"", helping me relax and prepare for the next exercise.  For even an experienced yogi like myself, it was very nice to be shown modifications, coupled with reminders to go at ones pace or take breaks whenever needed - to accommodate any beginner's limitations; for example, during the standing rotation, stare at a spot on the floor to regain balance

Both Ravi and Ana had a lot of catchy phrases - some with rhyme! - about the health benefits with every exercise, for not only the body but also the mind, that were memorable and made the experience more enjoyable, for example:

""expanded lung capacity brings expanded awareness"" (during spinal twists)

""in spite of all that holds you back, the navel will carry you forward"" (from double leg lifts)

""if your mind wanders, don't follow it - let your mind come back to you"" (during the meditation)

I thought it was cool that they used a Tibetan series for the second kundalini yoga kriya.  Doing so gives one a sense of the universality of the teachings.  It was nice to know how camel pose affects men and women differently.  And the meditation to chant based on ones pulse was very cool, especially if one is patient until one actually feels the pulse.  Once the pulse vibration comes through the fingers, it gave me a sense of connection with my internal self - that was amazing!

The production itself was clear, colorful and gentle.  Even in the credits Ravi and Ana gave just the minimum info needed, and checking their website, [...] I saw that too had the same friendly vibration.",1213833600,3,2000,4.720461095100864
2439175,5,B000BRM992,"This was the first DVD I bought from this series by Ravi & Ana. And I have gone on to buy more of their DVD's. Not only do I own them, I practise the yoga regularly. They are essential to my health and my peace of mind. I highly recommend this DVD, no matter what level you think you may be. It is a great introduction for beginners, and a great tune-up for the seasoned yogis. I like to do this when I feel I am misaligned, and regularly rotate this DVD into my morning routine.
Their instructions are so clear and concise, and I often garner pearls of wisdom from their DVD's. At the end, I always feel I have done a great thing not just for myself, but also for my family, for my peace attained radiates out to them as well.
Try it for yourself, and you will not regret it! Sat Nam.",1213833600,2,785,4.038461538461538

2439180,1,B000BRM992,I had high expectations of this dvd but was utterly disapointed. The exercises don't give you  a good worked out feeling afterwards. The music is pretty boring and the voice over sounds drowsy.,1213142400,13,193,4.848484848484849
2439181,5,B000BRM992,"There's nothing better than the sound of Ravi Singh's raspy, yet whisper sweet voice offering you gentle congratulations and words of encouragement after moving through an asana or, better yet, an entire set of them.  On Fat Free Yoga, in the `Fire in the Belly' segment, shortly after holding the ""bow pose"" that voice comes along and tells you to ""relax no longer think about the pose, be in a new  place""  Okay, is the man reading my mind?? (that's supposed to be still right now, by the way!)

Those were just some of the reactions to my first Ravi and Ana Kundalini Yoga DVD! I found the collection last year while browsing Amazon for meditation CD's.  I had recently lost about 20-25 lbs and was getting bored with my current morning workout routine.  I'd tried yoga before and found it cumbersome and difficult. And, there was NO way I'd be able to actually clear my mind while trying to hold a pose.  Or so I thought.  Life was really beating down on me at the time.  So the thing that attracted me to these DVD's more than anything was reading review after review that spoke about the calming affect of the workout on your mind.  Well, I tried it and IT WORKED!

Fat Free Yoga was my first DVD.  I did the entire 1  hour routine the first sitting, every segment, every meditation.  And you know what?  Instant reprieve!  No, not total relief...that would have been astonishing.  I was coming down from death in the family, near death and life changing illness for another close family member, and death of a friendship.  After my first practice I felt more genuine reprieve than I had in quite some time.  I started to practice in earnest twice a day. My thoughts were taking on new form and so was my form!

My body was shedding pounds in places that have held long, lasting, meaningful relationships with FAT!  My belly, my thighs, my ARMS were trimming and toning in ways that they never had before.  And my skin, (something I admit that I always get compliments on anyhow) was in rare form!  I was amazed at the glow!

Now, and this is just my take on the matter- but all of the physical changes, I wholeheartedly attribute to the ""Breath of Fire."" As Ravi says, it's more aerobic than aerobics! With Ravi's soothing voice, and Ana's expert moves I breathed my way into a new body and new state of mind.  I've always been a spiritual person, I meditate, try to remain conscious in what I do . . .but this yoga (this moving meditation) opened new things in my world.

I have in my collection Fat Free Yoga, Kundalini Yoga for Beginners and Beyond, Yoga Beauty Body, Dance the Chakras, Yoga Hip Bliss, Ultimate Stretch Workout, and Journey Through the Chakras! I do love them all and they are all challenging in different ways, but I truly believe that Fat Free and Beginners and Beyond helped me to work through a lot, both spiritually and physically! Initially, I hated for Beginners and Beyond because of a sequence that requires you sit on your heels. OH THE PAIN!!  However, with determination (helped along with a little fire in the belly) I worked my way into the asana with ease, eventually preferring that pose to meditate in.  I would be remise if I did not mention that I love, love, love Dance the Chakras and even more I LOVE the Chakra Mudra chant at the end.  Instant happiness, instant bliss!  The first time I did it, I sat in the bed and played the DVD afterwards just to sing along!

Two final, important things: Ravi and Ana's monthly newsletter and CHAKRA44 reseller. When you go to Amazon to purchase, make sure you go into the used option and purchase your items directly from CHAKRA44 that's Ravi and Ana!

 If you visit their website [...] you can sign up for the monthly letter. With this, you are kept abreast of any new projects, appearances (they teach all across the country) DVD specials, and most importantly the monthly question and answer segment.  About 4 questions are highlighted each month.  Here I always find something that speaks to me.

Most profound was the answer Ana gave to a customer about their smoking habit.  It was such a free and easy answer.  She said, ""Don't worry about it, keep at your practice and when it's time it will happen for you!""  I followed the advice. Months later, I was feeling a rising desire to quit. In frustration, I asked, out loud, ""What is this hold on me?!""  An answer came to me in the form of a feeling.  The feeling I got was of a deep deep inhalation!  I immediately thought, ""That is the Dumbest thing you've EVER come up with!""  I like to smoke because it feels so good to inhale???  Come on now... The very next day, the newsletter came and in it was a letter from an ex-smoker, who wrote about missing the deep inhalation once she quit.  Oh yeah, I breathed my way through every urge! Although I've made many attempts prior to this, this time it was done with ease!

As I mentioned in my daily post circumstances took me away from my yoga practice, but I am ever so happy to be back.

Lifeis: so much better with Kundalini Yoga!",1213056000,69,5024,4.476347634763476
2439182,5,B000BRM992,"This tape is absolutely excellent for beginners as it really easy. But this simplicity deceives. The postures combined with kundalini breathing are very effective and will benefit every level of practitioner to quickly balance and recharge their system.
It is a blessing that this knowledge is being taught to wider audience. It works on vital forces which has nothing to do with mere physical benefits (which will still come).
From a personal experience it helped me overcome extreme inner tension after having lost someone very close to me. Western medicine could not help at this point as nothing manifested as a physical illness. Where Western medicine ends this kind of yoga begins. Having found these exercises at the time it supported me to overcome the energetically tension and restored my balance for which I am extremely grateful. This does not replace that one grieves or does not have to find a way to deal with whatever happens in our life, but somehow it seems to support you to flow more natural with it.
Give it a try for 2 weeks and if you can just stick with any of these DVD's for a month & see for yourself! Experience will convince.",1212883200,4,1154,4.746268656716418

You can customize the workouts with the matrix option for any length of time up to 60 minutes or so. It's AMAZING what just one of these 25-minute kundalini yoga workouts will do for you. The 25 minute spinal series is great for my back, and the 3rd one (of the 5 Tibetans, also 25 minutes each, work on opening the chest and shoulders. The 4th works on the navel center. Ordinarily, I have terrible posture (I work at a computer all day) so this practice makes me feel wonderful.  Also my posture is improving and I am learning to be more mindful when I am not on the mat.  Thank you Ravi and Ana!  I love how Kundalini Yoga is so easy and the results are immediate.

It has definitely toned muscle groups that other yogas just didn't reach.  Very easy to follow exercises - you can pace yourself - and Ana and Ravi are so encouraging and cheerful that I find myslelf ridiculously happy by the end of the practice.

I suggest going to the main menu right away and start with the breathing primer. I also think it's helpful to watch the DVD first before attempting, or at least watch parts to get an idea of how it works. The first part of the DVD is a workout focused to beginners, which is explained well with good directives.

The second half of the DVD with the ""Five Tibetans"" I found to be pretty challenging. For me it is something to work toward. I am using another Brett & Ravi DVD along with this, so I mainly just do the first half of this DVD.",1211155200,,701,4.116788321167883

There is absolutely no prior yoga experience necessary, but, if you happen to be an intermediate yogi - you will gain from it as well! I have my grandparents doing the first set ""Rise & Spine"" on the edge of their sofa and they love it. They say they have never felt better with more energy and are even starting to make plans and do more with their days and planning for the future!!!. I am so grateful to Ravi & Ana for that fact alone. My friend, who is a yoga instructor loves this too and says that Ravi & Ana's version of the 5 Tibetan Rite exercises, which are a vigorous and energizing set of strengthening exercises (the 2nd set on this program) is the best version she has ever tried.

  * A head-to-toe workout in two half-hour sessions. The first set warms and wakes up the spine, and you get a really good, light sweat going in the second half.

  * Clear instruction for every pose. You get way more alignment cues here than in any other yoga tape I have tried. Alignment tips that you can actually use in your everyday life, or in other workouts.

  * An explanation of what each exercise will actually do for you which, for me, is added inspiration to get through those more challenging ones.

  * A clean, bright cheerful set.

  * A smiling yoga instructor (now there's a refreshing change!).

  * Music that is just what I am always searching for; it brings you up and leaves you humming it afterwards!

You should definitely choose this DVD if you are looking for a workout that will leave you uplifted, energized and excited to go back to it again and again. I have had this program for over a year and do it at least once a week.",1209600000,8,1074,4.306532663316583

One of my favorite DVDs is Ellen Barrett's Superslim down Yoga/Pilates blend, and I was hoping for something similar. I wanted something less ""Denise Austin"", and I saw these rave reviews, so I went with it. But it is the other end of the spectrum- too slow and quiet for me.

But this video makes my back feel better for the rest of the day, and the good feeling lasts for at least 3-4 days after doing it.  The movements really do work out your spine.  While I have pulled my back doing cardio exercises I don't pull my back doing this video.  I really feel this is a great video. I recommended it to friends with back pains (but I am not a doctor, so...)

That being said, it was very difficult for my fiance. He is a muscular man and he could not sit in the positions Ana wanted us to sit in.  Like the cross-legged positions did not work for him and the movements were hard.

Also, I am not sure if I can picture my parents doing this video. I feel that it may be hard for them...but maybe I am underestimating them.

Overall I definitely recommend this! Sometimes I do it in the beginning week if I know the next day I will do a cardio with a lot of jumping that I feel may hurt my back.",1209513600,5,989,3.95959595959596

I am more relaxed, sleep better, have lost weight, have a toned and flexible body, and a ""mindfulness"" of the positive and negative patterns in my life.  I have developed a daily practice which I look forward to for morning energy, midday workouts, and evening relaxation.  Kundalini takes a holistic approach to health, mind and body.

I cannot recommend their dvd's more.  I own several of them and choose one based on my mood and what I want to work that day.  I have also been to a class taught by them and they bring the same care and attention to their dvd's that they demonstrate live.  Go to one if you get the chance!

Ana and Ravi have made this practice, which is thousands of years old and was once reserved for a select few, available to anyone, from beginner to advanced.

The second set is a fun sequence of the Five Tibetans. The level is more intermediate, but again Ana and Ravi offer modifications. The matrix version of the DVD is great to design your own workout.

TOP 5 REASONS WHY THIS DVD ROCKS!

1. You get all the benefits of a workout plus stretching and peace of mind
2. Even if you only have 10 minutes this DVD can work wonders
3. Kundalini Yoga is like nothing else I've ever done. It's amazing.
4. Ana & Ravi are really great teachers. I feel I'm in good hands

I like to do this before my gym workouts or if I don't feel like driving, I do the second segment (5 Tibetans) twice through. That gives me great upper body work. There's so much to this. Doing this DVD makes it very clear why yoga is so popular. Ten years ago I thought yoga was for fringe types. If I would've heard the term Kundalini Yoga then I would've laughed in your face. Now it's part of my daily life. I guess the Age of Aquarius is here to stay!",1208131200,,593,4.076923076923077
2439196,3,B000BRM992,This was not a bad DVD but It was not very challenging and was less them stimulating.  I did it once and will not return to it.  I would look else were if you are looking for a workout.  Now it does have the Tibetan workout on the end it is a real work out but you only need to do this once and then you will not need the DVD.  I learned it from a pamphlet years ago.,1208131200,2,367,3.607594936708861
2439197,5,B000BRM992,I got this DVD a year ago.  I had no real experience with yoga and this has been a great investment!  Once I felt comfortable with the Beginners I purchased more of Ravi and Ana's offerings.  While I enjoy them I do return to this DVD regularly.  It is a solid workout -- very enjoyable and well paced.  Ana is a pleasure to watch and Ravi's narration is detailed and encouraging.  I especiually love the music!  I took a chance on this DVD and will always be grateful I did.,1208044800,4,475,4.211111111111111
2439198,5,B000BRM992,"I highly recommend this DVD.  The instruction is crystal clear, and Ravi and Ana make yoga so easily accessible.  Anyone can do these exercises.  The best part of the way they teach yoga is the simple but powerful knowledge they impart to you about the benefits of the exercises.  It is incredibly empowering to know the tremendous good you're doing yourself, and how the exercises are healing and strengthening your body.  This video wakes your body and mind.  It's energizing, empowering, and centering.  I have new found flexibility, and I have new muscles that I didn't even try for!  Best of all, I have less stress even though the circumstances of my life are still crazy.  The spinal series at the beginning of this DVD is great.  It can be done on its own or as a warm up.  The 5 Tibetan set that comes later is more challenging, and there is only encouragement to join in as it is right for you.  If you are a first-timer with limited flexibility, don't worry.  These exercises will gently include you and help you to feel better and better over time, and the supportive instruction will guide you through it all.  This DVD offers revitalization.

Some of the exercises are difficult and I definitly felt this workout the next morning in my arms, stomach, and upper legs. However, I have a bad lower back and some of the potions were too painful for me to do and some also hurt my wrists to the point where I had to take a rest.",1207699200,,424,4.120481927710843
2439200,3,B000BRM992,"I found this dvd to be clean and simple, but lacking in substance.

It's definitely suitable (in difficulty) for beginners, although I'd caution anyone who is entirely new to Yoga not to judge all of Yoga by this dvd.
The breathing exercises are enjoyably challenging, but I didn't find the session to deliver head to toe, as compared to the yoga classes I've taken and other yoga dvd's I've tried.

The series isn't terrible, perse, but after trying a few sessions I felt it just wasn't worth my time.

I think most who are accustomed to the more common Vinyasa flow series might want to carefully consider other options before trying this one.

It left me thinking, ""That's it?....""",1207353600,6,684,4.722689075630252
2439201,3,B000BRM992,"Alright, it looks nice and soothing. But it just shows you the movements in action. This is a beginner DVD. In my opinion, it is supposed to have some features to inform you more about the yoga you are doing in a written way or even in verbal narrative as a special feature. This is directly about yoga moves and little explanations about them while you are making the moves. I didn't learn anything about why the movements that I have done will be good for my body. This DVD is so short, and makes me feel like it is only produced to gain easy money from people...",1207353600,4,565,4.2407407407407405
2439202,5,B000BRM992,"I've worked out for years...everything from running to weight lifting to different styles of yoga and I really loved Ana and Ravi's DVD. It is a refreshing alternative to everything out there, at least that I have tried. It is a great way to start the day...very calming and, yet, energizing, as others have mentioned. I feel great when I'm done. While it is not your typical yoga, nor is it a hardcore sweaty type of workout, I highly recommend giving this one a try!
One consideration for people with back problems...possibly too much twisting, especially if you've had a recent herniated disc. But,I would check out Raviana.com for a complete listing of other DVD's. They may have one that suits someone with back issues.
Otherwise, enjoy this wonderful presentation!",1206316800,3,770,4.930769230769231

I am especially fond of this particular class because it has clear instruction, inspires me, and makes me feel good after having done it.  Although the title says ""for beginners and beyond"", it truly gives an excellent overall workout whether you are a new Kundalini yoga student or have been practicing for many years.  In this DVD the warm-ups perfectly transition the student into a basic Kundalini practice that moves and oxygenates all parts of the body.  The last part of the DVD is an extra special treat as Ravi and Ana take the workout up a refreshing level by moving the student through a fabulous workout using the Five Tibetans, a series of moves that energize the body and mind by getting the heart pumping.  I thoroughly enjoy and practice all of the DVDs, but this is the DVD I do most often because it covers everything thoroughly in a reasonable amount of time.  My body is energized and my mind is positive.",1206144000,5,974,4.537142857142857
2439204,5,B000BRM992,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this DVD as I didn't know much about Kundalini Yoga, nor had I ever purchased of a DVD by Ana Brett & Ravi Singh before. So I have to say I was more than pleasantly surprised by Beginners and Beyond, - this is a great DVD!

This excellent beginner program has two short sets: The ""Rise & Spine"" which is Kundalini Yoga 101  and will give you all the basic moves concentrating on working up the spine. I've since learned that Kundalini Yoga works from the ground up and leaves one feeling grounded, centered and focused. This is great therapy for the spine & back. I started to feel amazingly different within the first 10 minutes, and nearly blissed out by the end of the first set.

The second set is the ""5 Tibetans"" which are simple Hatha exercises set to rocking Indian type music.
it flows from one move to another to strengthen and lengthen every muscle group.
I sometimes do part one in the AM and part 2 in the PM.
If you're a beginner, this DVD is just about all you need. But I've since bought a several more titles by Ravi & Ana and they are all excellent. I also recommend Fat Free Yoga to those who are new to Yoga.",1206144000,3,1162,4.225225225225225

I stumbled upon reviews for this video, and like others, gave it a try due to overwhelming reviews.  Wow!  I felt more energy the very next day.  I immediately felt better circulation in the solar plexus area, and much less stress at work.  As I practice, I am getting better at letting the breath guide my movements in the first half of the DVD.  I love the Five Tibetans - you can feel its benefits as you go through the continuous movements.  Another bonus is the music and pace is not too new-agey - it's totally motivating.  I can't wait to incorporate more of their workouts!  Thanks Ana and Ravi for making these workouts accessible!",1205625600,18,789,4.539007092198582

The matrix option on this DVD is great!  I also like the fact that there is a breath primer (the version of Fat Free Yoga that I have doesn't have the matrix or the breath primer).
Kundalini Yoga is not your ""typical"" yoga.  There is a lot more movement with this type of yoga - which really like.  The day after I did this workout, my upper body was sore...so, I know it's working.
*One word of caution: I felt nauseous the first couple of times that I did the ""camel pose.""  Since then, I've been doing the modified version of that pose and breathing very slowly.  It helps.",1205280000,4,649,4.201612903225806
2439208,5,B000BRM992,"I have been giving this DVD to friends and family to get them interested in yoga.
I feel this is sort of an easy access path to getting into a regular yoga practice. First off, its fun, secondly, to me Kundalini Yoga as presented by Ana & Ravi is the best of all worlds because you get all the poses of hatha but they add movement and breath to the poses like Vinyasa and boy does my body respond quickly to this type of dynamic yoga! I feel one can get all the strengthening of Power and Ashtanga Yoga with the precision of Iyengar and all the stretching of Vinyasa as well. There is even a cardio element. Add the energy and relaxation benefits (I am sleeping like a baby again!)  and what more does one need? If you are new to yoga this one can get you on your way. If you've done some yoga before this will openup a whole new world to you. The instruction is clear, well paced and easy to follow. The Spine set is awesome and the 5 Tibetan sequence is the best 5 Tibetan sequence out there!",1205193600,21,994,4.123711340206185

This video ""Kundalini Yoga for beginers and beyond"" is an everyday workout for people who are not whimps. If someone doesn`t get it , it is a personal obsticle that must be overcome! The key to overall well being dosen't come from an insurance company`s policy but from your own endevours into your body, mind & spirit.
Anna Brett is also a fine example of locking in and keeping up, not giving in to outside pressures.
Kundalini Yoga is the best kept secret in history due to getting what you need you flourish! If only we learned this in elementary school...",1205193600,10,678,4.475806451612903
2439210,2,B000BRM992,"I've tried this dvd twice & it is definitely not for me. The main complaint for me is the breathing...it feels like I'm hyperventalating!!
Ana's breathing is VERY quick but they do mention to go at your own pace. Well, I tried to keep up & I was beginning to get dizzy. I can't understand how this breathing can be beneficial. I always thought that in yoga, breathing was supposed be slow & deep.
Overall I found the video to be a bit bizarre. I'm not into the spiritual part of this dvd either, with all the chanting but I guess that's my fault for not doing enough research on kundalini yoga. Some people may enjoy it but I prefer a yoga dvd without it.",1205193600,16,655,4.248

2439212,5,B000BRM992,"After 6 months of Hatha yoga I stumbled upon this DVD on Amazon with its extreme positive to negative user rating. One rarely finds any product with so many positive reviews and so few negative ones.
This series of exercises was a little tough to get through the 1st few times but I perservered and am glad that I did. It has a drug like effect on me and I just felt fantastic when nearing the end and long after finishing. I admit that I felt self conscious doing some of these movements and chants but since no one else was home to ridicule me I went on with it. I highly recommend it to anyone. The few negative reviews state that they were injured or feel duped by claims made by the authors. Well, as for injuring oneself, they do advise you throughout the dvd to use alternative positions (and they demonstrate these) if you are experiencing difficulty. In other words, use common sense and do what feels right for you. Don't stand on the top rung of a tall ladder on a banana peel and then complain because you fell off. Think, man!!!
As for the unfounded claims, how do you know they are unrealistic if you don't give them a chance? You've already paid for the dvd. Give it a shot.
I have used this dvd as well as ""Journey through the chakras"" and think these may have been the best thing I've ever done for myself, right up there with quitting smoking many years ago.
Another quality of these dvds is that you aren't made to feel as though you are competing with the instructor in flexability or speed. I felt these 2 instructors were here to help me and nothing more. After seeing how the particular movement was made, I stopped watching Ana and just focused on my own actions, not trying to keep up with her. I think that's the best approach for me.
I'm sure that if you buy one of these dvds you will buy more. It's quite addictive.",1204934400,8,1844,4.31700288184438

Now, In this particular DVD, I was extatic all through the first half hour but then, I wasn't crazy about the tibetan moves. I think it goes too fast as these are not the easiest pose (camel, up-dog, down-dog, etc.). I found it a little too streanous for a beginner's DVD.
But I still Loved it and it is still one of my favorites (I prefer the Fat Free-Lose weigt and feel great-Absolutly perfect !)",1204243200,6,594,4.173913043478261

Most of the entire hour is done sitting or laying down and the moves are very easy and beginner friendly. The first time I used the DVD I went almost the full hour before tiring and afterwards felt amazingly better! You'd be surprised how much even the simplest yoga movements help you a lot. I very much recommend this DVD to anyone wanting to start an exercise program that is easy to do and gives a lot of benefit.,1204243200,3,508,4.247422680412371

Except for Ana and Ravi's Yoga Bliss Hips, which i just got in recently. I have also ordered 3 more of their DVD's.(i plan to buy them all) I cannot wait to try the new ones out! I am finally EXCITED to exercise! The exercises can be challenging to a beginner, but are certainly possible. I have just gotten back into yoga after hurting my hip. I also have a bad knee, but Ana & Ravi's yoga has begun making an improvement in the pain after only two and a half weeks.

The second section is more challenging, but doable, and I always feel firmer and stronger the next day. I also have their Fat Free Yoga and Dance the Chakras, which I rotate with this one -- I'll rate them 5 stars as well. I have felt stronger mentally and emotionally since starting these workouts. I recently tackled a problem I had been putting off because of fear and I think Ravi & Ana's videos have somehow helped me be strong enough to do it. This type of workout seems to be the answer for me. An added bonus is that as a mother of 2 at age 37, I have the strongest, flattest ab muscles I've had since before my first pregnancy.",1202860800,6,723,4.246376811594203

This DVD was my first encounter with Kundalini Yoga. I was familiar with Hatha Yoga and meditations, I had even read some information about Kundalini Yoga before, but never practiced or had seen it. So, this was my first impression, this amazing DVD.

Ever since I have been a faithful Kundalini Yoga practicioner and have been diving deeper and deeper into it, which has also led me to purchase all of Ana's DVDs.

The DVD offers a wonderful introduction to Kundalini breathing and spinal exercises. You can feel the improvement in flexibility after just a couple of times of doing the exercises. It is easy to do, easy to follow and gives you an instant satisfaction of being able, and doing.

Get it, and do it, often!",1202774400,5,882,4.670967741935484

My flexibility has improved tremendously, my energy level is through the roof. I feel relaxed, calm, excited all at the same time! I don't understand why I crave this dvd every day. I don't know if its the breathe of fire, or what. I have quickly experienced exceptional health as a result of this dvd. I'm not kidding.

2439223,5,B000BRM992,"I have done traditional yoga for a bit and really enjoyed it.  After seeing the reviews for Ravi and Ana's DVDs, I had to get one and see what all the fuss was about. I tend to watch exercise DVDs before actually attempting them, and this was no exception. The evening I received this DVD I popped it in and had it on in the background while hanging out with my husband and 18 month old daughter.  I stared with one eyebrow raised as Ana demonstrated the breath of fire with her tongue stuck out.  My husband and I exchanged looks.  I had never meditated before, so the chanting and such was odd looking as well.

Nonetheless, I tried it anyway and WOW!  Once you get past the initial akwardness (the breath of fire, the chanting, kinda laughing at yourself for feeling silly) it actually feels great!  I had never tried Kundalini yoga before and I am pretty out of shape.  I was able to do this DVD all the way through only making minor modifications.  It gave me so much energy, yet relaxed me at the same time.  It has become a regular part of my workout rotation.

The individual workouts are short, but you can do more than one.  The production quality is great, and Ana demonstrates the moves gracefully and beautifully. She's inspiring to watch and her and Ravi's voices are soothing, not annoying or weird in any way.

This may be a bit much for people who don't know what to expect, although neither did I and I love it.  I did a complete 180 from the way I felt when I first watched it to the way I feel after having had done it a few times.  :)",1201219200,5,1555,4.2593856655290105

Even though I have only tried the poses once, I am sure with the clear instructions and breaks that I will be able to master them sooner than I thought! This series allows you to venture into Yoga in a safe, manageble and most importantly, fun fashion. After having tried 2 of Ana and Ravi's DVDs, I am certain that I will be religiously adding more to create a collection in the future!

I am in my early 20's and wanted something that would tone my body, yet help me clear my mind and melt away stress. I found exactly what I needed on this DVD. These instructors are amazing! Not to mention I actually look forward to working out! Ana Brett does all the demonstrations and Ravi Singh does the voice overs and instruction. It is faster than the poses I do for Hatha yoga, yet I feel like even if I'm not keeping up, I'm still getting a good workout and they assure you that you need to just experience the poses ""where you are"".

After one of their workouts you will feel energized, renewed, and on top of the world. I read all the reviews and thought ""Wow, there is very rarely a product that gets THAT many 5 star reviews.""

I don't think that laughing at your instructor is condusive to good yoga. But I tried and the more I watched the video, the better I got at it. And don't think you won't get a work out!

Maybe it's the intro to mantra and breath work or the hypnotic background music?
Both sets work well together and you probably get more out of doing them back to back so you are fully warmed up for '5 Tibetan' movements. It leaves me feeling energised and strong for the day ahead. I sometimes do the spinal series as warm up when doing other yoga discs or just in the morning to get me moving.

I had three of his DVD's, one was called ""The Best Kundalini practices"" and had his previous wife on the DVD, since then Ravi has published a handful of DVD's with his current wife Ana Brett. It was a fabulous workshop with lots of people and energy. I think he was just starting his career in the limelight and now he's hit it big! I will look forward to trying his DVD. My sister and I have done a bit of Bikram yoga and always laugh about practicing in bra & panties. Ana is a beautiful woman and she used to practice in skimpy clothes to help with marketing their product, it looks like it has worked ;O) congrads to them for bring their DVD's and yoga instruction to hundreds of people!

2439241,5,B000BRM992,"I am not a yoga practitioner.  I cannot bend into any pretzel positions and my sense of balance isn't that of a dancer's.  However, I had heard about Kundalini yoga- how it is as much mental as physical, how it doesn't require you to bend into difficult shapes, how it focuses on meditation and mental calm, and how you can actually move and dance while doing it.  All of that is true, although not all true about this DVD.  This is an excellent beginning DVD- you can do a 30 minute or 60 workout.  Much emphasis is placed on meditation in between each exercise.  Yes, there are a few stretches and positions that newcomers will find challenging, but the instructors quickly provide alternative positions. Try this DVD after a stressful day when you really don't want to exercise, but know you should-- the mental focus and the breathing exercises will help you focus on the present and forget your worries. If your mind wanders, as they say, just let it come back to you.

I didn't need to lose weight when I started this program so that was not a goal- I just wanted to exercise more than I had been and it definitely got me doing that. As a bonus within about two weeks of using it my jeans and other clothes fit much better and I noticed more muscle definition/less fat particularly around the mid-section.  I suspect if you combine this workout with a diet, you'll experience even greater results.

My only complaint is that at the beginning and the end of the routine the woman is dancing in a free-form joyful way-- I wish that were part of the workout.  Perhaps it's on another DVD. In any case, this is a great DVD for stress reduction, stretching, mind-body awareness, and as a way to ease back into exercising if you haven't been working out a lot.  I highly recommend it.",1183939200,43,1784,4.492260061919505

I'm slowly building strength and doing more and more of the second set. I always feel rejuvenated after doing this DVD. It is well worth the money.

I've never tried Kundalini yoga before, and it feels much more natural than ""conventional"" yoga (sun salutations, etc).  I've done many DVDs where the instructor is so obsessed with form, lining yourself up exactly, etc, that they become not fun because you're so focused on those little details.  But this one does NOT do that.  Ravi gives you a brief description of what to do, but he doesn't nitpick and keep reminding you to keep your limbs, etc at precise angles.

I did the 1st half, and the whole thing took place while sitting on the floor, and required little movement.  Each exercise was interspersed with a meditation, yet I got very warm and my muscles were BURNING!

What I usually don't like about exercise DVDs is a flashy presentation, cheesy music, and condescending presenters.  This DVD has none of these things!  The narrator and music are relaxing, the set is very minimal (just a small carpet on the floor).",1181952000,15,995,4.672413793103448

First - the young lady (Anna?) demonstrates proper form and breathing very well, BUT a I felt like a slacker not keeping up with her.

I overdid it, felt sick to my stomach and dizzy and put the tape away for a while.  Then, I did a little research.  Found out what could be causing the nausea:

1.  I shouldn't by trying to keep up with Anna.  The moves may look very simple, but I need to take it slower.

2.  Some the the moves (twisting) are focusing on cleansing and massaging inner organs that have been sitting idle full of toxins for a long time.

3.  Incorrect breathing can also cause nausea.

I did some research, learned how to practice the long breaths.  I'm also going to stop trying to keep up with Anna and move at my own relaxed pace and focus on the breath and proper form.

Other things I learned are:

1.  Not to eat an hour before, but hydrate well.
2.  Drink water after the workout to help get rid of the toxins that have been released during the workout.

I can't twist my body into a pretzel or educated you on the way to inner light and reflection.  That being said, I would like to tell you a little bit about a great DVD I recently purchased - Kundalini Yoga for Beginners and Beyond by Ana Brett and Ravi Singh.  Kundalini Yoga is a bit different than your traditional yoga.  It's really about invigorating the body, mind and spirit into a beautiful harmony. This DVD program is the perfect introduction and will leave you feeling refreshed, energized and ready to take on just about anything. It is conveniently divided into two 30 minute sets.  You can do them together for a full 60 minute session or if you only have time squeeze one or the other in - that's alright!  In between 30 minute sessions, there is a deep relaxation segment. I love that I'm able to do yoga to my schedule instead of having to work around the DVD's pre-planned hour long session. If you're like me, I know that you don't always have an hour in the day.  A little is better than nothing!  Ravi & Ana both narrate you through the exercises, with Ana demonstrating.  They work in through the exercises, explaining a bit about them and reminding you of the importance of breath.  All and all, they've created a yoga DVD that is a treat for your entire being.

Listening to the different sayings like ""Let the work work for you."" and ""When you allow yourself to be still , things happen internally to move your life forward.""

As other reviews have listed, this DVD starts out with the two basic breathing techniques used in kundalini yoga. It then goes into a meditation followed by a 25 minute spinal excersize. Then you can choose to go to the final meditation or do another 25 min set that is the 5 tibetan rights.

I found most of the spinal workout to be moderately difficult but i was able to do all of them. The second set was difficult but not impossible with the different modifications they suggested. Over time, I think that I will be able to do these workout quite well. One thing that I suggest, is that you use a matt for this.

The one thing I will say about this particular DVD is that it is much more spiritual than other workouts that I've done. This is something that I enjoy greatly but keep that in mind while looking at this DVD.",1155945600,26,1079,4.228155339805825

I have a long way to go with kundalini and i'm not sure I will ever really be into the chanting part of it. unfortunately I feel like those elements make it seem really cheesy and would put off alot of people who could really benefit from the excercises. I know die hard kundalini yogis would not agree, but I wish someone would come out with a kundalini dvd that can integrate the quiet mediation aspects of it and leave out the cheesy parts (instead of cramming ""meditation"" down the viewers throat how about calling it simply a few quiet deep breaths between excercises and the same at the beginning and end, and leave out the chanting which personally i do not feel necessary to complete the practice. One HUGE problem I do see with the instruction given during the practice is that they push to hard to keep going. I know enough to go at my own pace (you don't have to follow at exactly the same pace, which could probably by quite dangerous if you are not in shape enough to do so) and if you really feel the need to stop, do so and begin again when you can.

2439278,5,B000BRM992,"I have done Ravi and Ana's ""For Beginners and Beyond"" many times - my favorite so far - I like this one too (""A Journey Through the Chakras""), though there is more chanting, and there are some exercise that I cannot do with my spine.  But, I love this DVD.  Well-put-together, pleasant to watch, makes me feel like a queen during and afterward.  I do the whole thing all the way through.  Ravi and Ana answered the e-mail I wrote, asking about my spine problem.  They answered rather quickly, and gave me the info I was seeking, plus.  I am getting, as per suggestion, ""Fat-Free Yoga"" for more weight-bearing exercise.  I have done some research, some by the reviews, and have concluded that I do need in addition to do the treadmill or walking for at least 1/2 hour a day if possible.  This is because of Osteopenia - and the need to build bones up.  All my aerobic , muscular, spine and so many needs are taken care of with these DVD's, and if rotated daily, I suspect more good things will happen.  I lost only 5 pounds, and I already look pretty good at 156 lbs.  My stomach has really shrunk.  The core exercises are fantastic.  I am on Weight-watchers, but I am in a higher points range, and only losing 1-2 lbs a week.  Very healthy!  In other words, the DVD's are making me look as if I have lost more weight than I have.  I keep hearing the chanting and music throughout my day, and it is making me feel confident!!  One more thing - I adapt the exercises to what I can do with my spine.  That is ok, because I am getting worked out well anyway.",1154822400,11,1554,4.263698630136986

Not only do I not feel like I get a stretch, but I also don't feel like I am developing muscle, or really relaxing from the yoga!

This one doesn't futz around with long boring explanations but leads you through the exercises as they also explain the many benefits - I LOVE THAT!

The Beginners & Beyond is the first that not only doesn't insult my intelligence, but is fun to do at the same time. The music is excellent. The pace is just right. I feel I am gaining strength, tone and flexibility.

I can tell these teachers: Ana Brett & Ravi Singh really know what they are doing.

I feel fantastic after doing this workout almost daily for 3 weeks and am already seeing changes. I look forward to purchasing the other Ana Brett & Ravi Singh DVD's.",1153958400,8,945,4.292134831460674

The actual workout is easy to follow( even when you are unable to look at the TV) but challenging enough for someone used to working out but new to this sort of practice.

Both during and after the workout I feel relaxed and rejuvenated.

I will definitely be using this DVD for a long time to come because of the many benefits I feel in my mind and body.

They get right into their workout's which I really like, not a whole lot of boring intro to sit through.

Everything is well chaptered so you can shoot to the section you want. The poses are all doable and easy to follow, with modifications given when necessary. When practicing to this dvd you really feel the effects immediately. You're in touch with your body, breath, spirit and mind. This is a great video for all levels of yoga buffs.

I could never move beyond beginner because, until Beginners & Beyond, I had yet to find a program that I could stick with long enough to advance! This is a different type of yoga. As other reviewers have mentioned, movements are faster and more flowing then regular yoga, yet, easier to follow then other yoga programs. Overall, very fun & effective.

If you have not tried them, you will love Ana & Ravi. You feel like you are in the studio with them. They are great instructors with great style. They really draw you in so that the time flies and before you know it you have had a wonderful yoga workout! The look of this DVD, the music, the chaptering is excellent.

This yoga has benefited me in so many ways - my body feels more flexible and ""lighter.""  My moods have improved and I am definitely calmer.

Yoga has been the best thing that's happened to me recently. I have read a lot about yoga philosophy. I have experimented with many different schools of yoga. I seem to have a special affinity towards this approach. Practicing Beginners and Beyond on a daily basis keeps me feeling vital in ways nothing else comes near.

The music is great!! and not to be shallow but I love Ana's outfit... very colorful!!!

Kundalini with Ana and Ravi has been very beneficial to me. I am calmer and overall happier!!! If I don't do one of their DVD's for a couple of days, I feel that *something* is missing!!!

My abs are getting stronger, also my back and shoulders and legs. I do a lot of heavy lifting in my day job  I am noticing I am not straining to lift anymore. My posture has really improved enough that I have received some comments. Maybe it is just the yoga making me more conscious of my form but I think it is also because my back is stronger.

This Beginners & Beyond DVD is a very intelligently thought out yoga DVD for beginners to advanced beginners.

Their instructions are so insightful and explicit. I find it quite valuable in helping me plan out my beginner Kundalini classes. I have started teaching some of the things in this DVD to my regular classes and they are asking for more! Ana & Ravi have done an outstanding job. Their collaboration is very beautiful.

Two weeks later I still am pain free.  I also feel a good inch taller. My two little boys do this with me and love to show off the 5 tibetan rites at which they seem to be naturals. It is making me imagine them yogis in a past life.

2439303,5,B000BRM992,"I've been practicing hatha yoga (primarily Ashtanga yoga) for years, and decided to give Ravi and Ana a try.  I chose ""Kundalini Yoga for beginners & beyond"" because (a) I had no experience with Kundalini yoga and (b) I am quite familiar with the 5 Tibetan rites, which make up the second half of the practice on this DVD.  The DVD is chaptered so you can do the whole thing or select the portions you want to do.

This is a winner!  Ravi does the instructing via voice-over; his wife Ana performs the postures and sometimes speaks on the voice-over as well.  The vocal instructions and Ana's demonstration of the postures are excellent.  The music is also really good.

The DVD begins with breathing instructions, then goes on to ""warm ups"" and then the ""spinal series"" which is designed to make your spine stronger and more flexible.  It ends with a relaxation and you can stop there, or go on to the 5 Tibetan rites.

As described in another review, Ravi has changed the order of the 5 rites, but it works better, in my opinion.  These 5 ""rites"" are 5 exercises that are like ""regular"" yoga postures, but each one is repeated 21 times.  As I have a background in Ashtanga yoga, and have done the 5 Tibetans before, I'm pretty strong and was able to complete all the repetitions. That said, this is not easy and I advise anyone who has never done these before to pace yourself and rest when you need to.  Most people will not be able to complete all the repetitions if they have not done any kind of yoga before, but with practice, eventually one's strength will develop and the entire series can be done. After the 5 rites are completed, there is a wonderful long relaxation, a meditation, and a closing prayer.

The feeling of well-being that I got from this practice from the get-go really surprised me. It is a very effective mix of meditation, breath work, and postures. I felt like a million bucks afterwards, and it has become my favorite yoga practice, bar none.  Highly recommended!",1151107200,17,1993,4.546218487394958

- the following day I can tell the workout has hit every single muscle group (I have sorness - but don't be afraid it is just the type of soreness that lets you know you have done something good for your self)

-The pace is not breakneck - it is just right with quick little breaks between various evercises- just enough to get you ready for the next burst of energy

-The music is great - very motivating and not new agey as I had feared.

-I love the way Ana does the yoga and Ravis voiceover too.

-I feel so relaxed and refreshed afterwards. I can't remember feeling so good after a live class!

I was delighted that this DVD contains Tibetan Rite exercises.  I have started doing them some 10 - 15 years ago from a book, but have now found it's even more fun going over the Tibetan rites with the DVD.

It really feels pretty amazing and very enlivening.  Like another viewer said, this yoga is pretty athletic and feels like mild cardio. The second section is many of the same type of asana poses you see in hatha but you move through them such as updog to down dog and in and out of modified camel , then holding camel w/ bof. In and out of Hatha Bridge too. This set is called the 5 Tibetan Rites and it is done kundalini yoga style.  Don't worry you will be able to do it all. I did, though I rest then start again, which you are told too do, when neccesary. Ana & Ravis sequencing is brilliant. You really feel a difference in your physical and mental state..

It is a mild form of cardio that feels much healthier to my body then all that hard stepping up and down and running that I had been doing  I have been amazed to see I have finally started losing weight and actually seeing some muscles in my arms legs, back and stomach - all former problem areas.

The Spinal series which like a reviewer mentioned earlier really does leave you feeling like you got a new back! And the 5 Tibetans - simple yet challenging and effective exercises for strength building and youth. In the start Ana teaches you two breath techniques used throughout this and all their workouts.

You would not believe how old I really am but my skin retains its youthful glow and elasticity and my posture and energy level is that of a much younger person.

The first one works on the whole spine which is of course, the key to everything. It is moderately gentle so this is perfect for me when I am not in the mood for a more advanced workout. The second set is a strength building set which works everything, including the abs, and great for after I have a run/bike/cardio session.

I know how important the spine is, because everything is connected to it.  THe first 25 min. or so set works its way right up the spine in a way that no other yoga I have come across has done.  The second set is a bit more challening but doable for an old fogey like me (('m 46). It's definitely a workout.

I tried yoga before and didn't like it because, frankly, it was too slow and I got bored. This DVD has you meditate between the exercises, perfect for someone who can't sit still for too long (its easier to rest your mind after working out your body). Anyway, If you are new to yoga and want something that will keep your attention, try this.

The DVD is divided into two parts.  The first 25 minutes are a ""spine series"" which has relieved most of the strain on my back. I feel taller, slimmer, and more energetic. Its a lot of stretching and is pretty suitable for anyone, even if you are not in the best shape. It will help you unwind by relaxing your mind and body, and I look forward to it at the end of a challenging 12 hour day.

The second part is definately more difficult and will take some getting used to. I used to do gymnastics in middle school, and I can feel my body getting back to that kind of flexiblity.

The DVD is also really motivational and inspirational without being cheesey. Its hard to explain, but several reviewers for Ana and Ravi's DVD's have described the same feeling of being able to let go of a lot of negativity. It's almost-free therapy for the high-strung.

The  first  25 minute sequence works up the spine with different flexing exercises. The second 25 minute sequence called the 5 Tibetan exercises, is doable for everyone but manages to work just about every muscle in the body.

 Every single program of theirs was really highly rated. When I saw that one reviewer, in a review of Beginners & Beyond, had written ""the next day I woke up with someone else's back!"", that was all I needed to hear. Their DVDs are so good for back problems. My back is coming alive after sleeping for so many years! I have had unsuccessful back surgery & was on heavy narcotic pain meds for several years. I have tried several yoga DVD programs specifically for back care in the past, but they have been boring & ineffective.

Then one where you sit with legs stretched out and then quickly up into a Bridge type pose...then there was in and out of Camel Pose and then you held it with Breath of Fire.  Another one was to and from Downward Dog. This is a powerful yet very safe workout, which I like.  There is a great mediation at the end in which your sort of feel the pulse in your fingers and it takes you deep inside.  I've done lots of yoga at my gym, but nothing like this.

I have been practicing Yoga for past 4 years.  It was discontinued for some 2 years and am practicing it now.

I came across this dvd on internet. I was interested to see how they combined Yoga and Kundalini.

 What I have learnt is though Yoga and Kundalini are indirectly connected i.e., when we practice yoga and bring our body under control, which makes the mind to set on its centre and while practicing meditation, the kundalini is raised.

This dvd is good for Kundalini, vitality ,and absolute best of health.

My gains have been slow and steady, so my increases in flexibility sneak up on me. It will suddenly hit me that ""hey my head is almost to my ankles in forward bend"" when one year ago I couldn't even reach my ankles (let alone the floor!) with my hands.

The flexibility gains are wonderful. I feel a delicious openness in my lower back and more length in my spine. But, I wouldn't say flexibility is the reason I am sticking to yoga - it is more like a perk of the practice!

Doing a yoga practice versus a step, aerobic or even pilates, workout does nothing to increase mind/body awareness which I have found to be the most important thing for fitness.

I especially like the breath awareness! I am so tuned in to my breath now and feel my energy is so much better.

Plus these Ravi/ Ana workouts are just so enjoyable to do! Even when the exercise gets tough and I want it to be over with , I am still enjoying the process in a way I just don't with any of my other fitness workouts.",1142812800,10,1091,4.256038647342995

I don't know how it works, but it feels great!

I agree with the reviewer below that this yoga is more athletic. I like that aspect since I don't have time to do anything else somedays. The second set is a great strength building routine

What I do like is this DVD because you actually MOVE in the exercises which makes it more enjoyable and more athletic and as a beginner I have found this type of yoga the easiest yoga to adjust to. I also feel it has a more martial arts bent to it, which I like a lot.

Every morning I do the first 25 minute set, the spinal flexes, and I have literally no back pain anymore!! The 2nd set ""The 5 Tibetans"" works every major muscle group in the body. I do this set 3 times a week. I started practicing my Aikido again and I can already see a difference. I am much more flexible then I used to be. Another thing I have noticed is that my energy level is better. I am a doctor and am on my feet all day. This has made a huge difference for me. I've been trying to get all my friends to do this.

I got this one after taking a fantastic workshop with Ravi & Ana (I recommend taking a class live with them if the chance ever arises) in which they presented the ""5 Tibetan Rites"" kundalini yoga style which I found beyond brilliant. That set is the second 25 minute set on this DVD. The 5 Tibetans is said to help turn back the clock and it works the navel ,the glands, balances the chakras and builds body strength gently. They present it in a way that somehow feels even more effective then the way it was originally presented.

The first 25 minute set is a spinal series which does wonders for the back( I feel as if I have someone elses back after this!) and opening up the hips and increasing oxygen in the body for an amazing energy boost.

On most of their DVDs Ana demonstrates and Ravi speaks but on this Ana instructs also. They are true masters at cultivating deep inner peace while leading you through a thorough workout.

They are also masters at accomodating all levels in their workouts. The only one of their DVD's I would tell beginners to maybe wait on is the Warrior Workout.

The instructions could not be clearer or more concise. The exercises are straightforward. There are no props to fumble with. Many exercises from the opening spinal series could actually be done sitting on the edge of a sofa.

This is the first dvd or class to really get me into yoga, and it has honestly made a huge impact on my daily life.

I've found it somewhat challenging because i was very inflexible when i started using it. The first set which works up the spine freed my stress-ravaged body from its tension lock! I actually began sitting in my chair to do it - (yes its possible) and gradually I have made my way to the floor. You probably think I am elderly by reading thus far but I am only 30!

The second set is the 5 Tibetans ""Kundalini Style"". I recognize poses from other forms of yoga. Down Dog, Up Dog, Camel etc.. What I love is the way this yoga flows and keeps moving so these poses are never static.  Yoga is never boring done this way and you feel so integrated afterwards. Ana & Ravi obviously know what they are doing.. I feel this set has really improved my muscular endurance and upper back and core strength.

I enjoy every minute of both sets. They are fun and effective and ultimately relaxing. It is a great way to get started in yoga but I feel a yogi of any level would get a great workout!",1138924800,20,1372,4.158490566037736
