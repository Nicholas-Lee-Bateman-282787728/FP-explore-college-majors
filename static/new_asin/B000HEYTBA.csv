8139524,4,B000HEYTBA,"This documentary reveals the life and music of Hank Levy. His career began as a playing Jazz musician who worked in the Band of Stan Kenton and became a prolific composer/arranger for not just Kenton but some of the best Big Bands of the 60's, 70's and beyond including Don Ellis and Buddy Rich. Hi s particular penchant for odd time signatures was featured in much of his work. Desiring a more stable life than that of a traveling musician he dedicated himself to teaching. His students were very loyal and continue to champion his work. The Academy Award wining movie, ""Whiplash"" which is based on Levy's composition of the same name may renew interest in his body of work.",1430006400,,675,4.633333333333334

8139526,5,B000HEYTBA,"This alliteratively titled documentary profiles Jazz composer, bandleader and educator Hank Levy. Mr. Levy is best known for his use of unusual time signatures or meters. He became known for his work with bandleader Don Ellis and later Stan Kenton. He could have had his own successful commercial band. Instead, he took a job at Towson State University where he built up an exemplary Jazz program. He also continued to compose.

A personal note: I had the opportunity of meeting and working with Mr. Levy at a music clinic hosted by Don Ellis at the University of Redlands in 1972. It was there that I was first exposed to his work. Later, I was in various bands that played his work and I came to really love him via Stan Kenton's last records.

Mr. Levy's work is both challenging to play and at the same same time highly accessible. Charts like Fringe Benefit, Indra and Hank's Opener are ultimately happy riff tunes with a generally optimistic tone. Sometimes, he goes a bit darker, ie. Ambivalence. Most of his pieces can be described as 'straight ahead' in terms of form but there are exceptions there as well. Chiapas begins with a simple fanfare and and expands on it in unconventional ways.

This documentary was produced in 1996, five years before Mr. Levy died, so happily he was able to participate. He is the delightful person I remembered him to be. A lot of great people are interviewed making this a 'talking heads' kind of documentary, albeit an informative and entertaining one. A lot of great music is interspersed throughout. The DVD, produced 'on demand' is of good quality.

Overall, a well done and highly recommended film.",1352764800,2,1646,4.764912280701754
8139527,3,B000HEYTBA,"This DVD is a pretty interesting documentary, but not as good as I expected  - there are some very enjoyable performances by the Army Jazz Ambassadors, but it's heavy on interviews - many with rather obscure people - the famous musicians listed by Amazon as ""starring"" in the DVD do NOT perform - there are short interview clips with Maynard and others, so in my opinion it isn't worth $29.95 at all - especially considering you don't get the companion CD with it!  (That's an extra $15).  If you can get it for $10 or $15, that would be ok.  At $29.95 it is way overpriced.

Hank Levy wrote numerous odd meter charts that represented innovative writing in the 60s and 70s (mostly), although they are somewhat dated sounding now in comparison to contemporary writers like Chuck Owen - but still well worth listening too.",1226707200,6,820,4.627586206896551
