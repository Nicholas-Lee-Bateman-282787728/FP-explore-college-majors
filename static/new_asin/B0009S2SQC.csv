8065759,5,B0009S2SQC,"I grew up watching the Dukes weekly...long before reruns and DVR! Before having children, one could turn on the TV and see the Dukes on TBS, TNT, and TvLand 24/7 it seemed.  A few months ago, my husband blurted out ""Look at those Daisy Dukes!"" when he and our 12 year old son saw a woman wearing short shorts.  As you can already guess the next question, ""What are Daisy Dukes?"", he asked.  One thing lead to another and my husband tried and tried to explain where that saying came from--but to no avail.  So I felt it ""my duty"" to introduce my children to Classic Television.

I was SO excited when the First FOUR Seasons arrived that I immediately opened it and began watching them (without commercials!)!! It was like stepping back in time! My children now know what Daisy Dukes are, have picked their favorite actor, and questioned how can the General Lee stay in such good shape despite all the wrecks, jumps, and car-to-car slamming! I absolutely love hearing my 10 year old yell, ""Yeeee Hawwwww!""

The DVDs arrived quickly and nicely wrapped in their own commerative cases by each season.  Each case has 4 DVDs with approximately 6-8 full length episodes on each.  I highly recommend ordering this collection and bring back great family TV!!",1280016000,,1248,4.666666666666667
