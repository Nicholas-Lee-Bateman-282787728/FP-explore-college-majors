8379533,5,B002SRNPT6,"Really great DVD. All titles on the line, including X-Division Ultimate X and Knockouts Tag Team Championship Matches.",1406419200,,118,5.611111111111111
8379534,4,B002SRNPT6,"Zakk Wlyde opens the PPV with the National Anthem. I wasn't there live but it seemed pre-recorded and out of place.

Ultimate X Match with Daniels, Amazing Red, Chris Sabin, Suicide, Alex Shelley, and Homicide: This was the usual spotfest with many, many crazy things going on thru out the match. It was hard to track the wrestlers as the came in and out thru out the match. I enjoyed it but it some parts felt rehearsed just to get fans chanting. Red retains the X division title in the end.

Side note: X Division is what made me watch TNA in the first place. However it's grown to be like the WWE cruiserweight division and it pains me to say that. It's always the same wrestlers but I guess due to budget cut backs in TNA and Hogan running things now, I'd come to expect that.

Taylor Wilde and Sarita VS Beautiful People: I skipped over this match

TNA Legends Champion Kevin Nash VS A Poor Man's Chris Jericho, Eric Young VS Herenandez: I've never stood the appeal of Eric Young, he can wrestle but never enjoyed him. This was a basic handicap match as Young paid for Nash's service because he loves money. Nothing really wrong with the match but the ending was weak.

Full Metal Mayhem Match TNA Tag Team Champions Booker T & Scott Steiner VS I.W.G.P. Tag Team Champions British Invasion VS Team 3D VS Beer Money: Anther spotfest. It feels like TNA was trying to make there best impression with this PPV. It was a good match up though.

Awesome Kong VS Tara VS ODB: Three women who can wrestle and yet I skipped over it.

Samoa Joe VS Bobby Lashley: This was billed as TNA VS MMA match-up and boy did this suck! Would have been fine if it was a regular match and once again, the ending was weak.

Monster's Ball Abyss VS Mick Foley with Dr. Stevie as guest ref: This was a basic handicap match. Some cool spots but I found this way to boring. Abyss chokeslams Daffney thru a barbwire board in a cool spot. The ending was weak once again.

Kurt Angle VS Matt Morgan: A good match can't really complain too much about this one.

TNA World Champion AJ Styles VS Sting: A good main event. Alot of people thought it would be Sting's last match but it wasn't. The ending came off weak on the dvd.

Overall, a good event. TNA was on it's A game here following storylines and building feuds. It seems they pulled out all stops here with alot of stipulation matches. Angle VS Morgan and Sting VS Styles weren't spotfests but were two good wrestling matches. I'd say diffently watch this event.",1275782400,,2491,4.393478260869565
8379535,4,B002SRNPT6,"The 6 way Ultimate X match was easily the best match on the card. High flying action, crazy stunts and an ending to remember for. The 4 way Full Metal Mayhem Tag Team match was just as good as The T.L.C match from WM 17. The Kurt Angle-Matt Morgan match had the best wrestling on the card. The A.J Styles-Sting match was not great but pretty good. The rest of the card is also not great but pretty good. I give BFG 09 an 8 out of 10.",1271721600,,433,3.9318181818181817
8379536,4,B002SRNPT6,"TNA X Division Champion Amazing Red Vs. Daniels Vs. Suicide Vs. Chris Sabin Vs. Alex Shelley Vs. Homicide (Ultimate X Match) - Just two side notes here, the steel structure used for ""Elevation X"" was used here for extra support in stretching out the ropes and secondly, ""The Pope"" D'Angelo Dinero had to be replaced by the Motor City Machine Guns at the last minute due to a family emergency. Just like previous Ultimate X bouts, this match had its usual crazy, wild, and crash and burn spots that will just amaze you. The Gunz were extrodinary out there, doing eveything in sync, Kaz...oops I mean Suicide bringing back the Flux Capacitor with Daniels taking falls you just wouldn't believe and questioning to yourself, how on earth is he still alive?! But in any case, this was a great start to TNA's biggest stage of the year with Red able to retain his championship in the end. 4.5/5

TNA Knockout Tag Team Champions Taylor Wilde & Sarita Vs. The Beautiful People - A short contest but not particularly a bad bout among the Knockouts. With the exception of a botched DDT, this was an okay tag team match for the Knockout Tag Team Titles and deserving of a watch. 2.75/5

TNA Legends Champion Kevin Nash Vs. Eric Young Vs. Hernandez - If you have been following TNA up to this point, you could predict what was going to happen in the end of this match. The match played out how it was planned to the fullest with Eric Young paying and teaming up with Kevin Nash to protect himself from Hernandez and allowing Nash to take out Hernandez for once and for all and retaining his Legends championship in the end. However, after being dominated and overpowered all throughout the match and letting Nash do his dirty work, Eric Young outsmarted everyone as he walked out the new Legends champion. 3/5

TNA Tag Team Champions Booker T & Scott Steiner Vs. IWGP Tag Team Champions The British Invasion Vs. Team 3D Vs. Beer Money (Full Metal Mayhem) - Both titles were on the line here and for those of you who aren't familiar with Full Metal Mayhem, this match is TNA's version of a ""Tables, Ladders, & Chairs"" match. The steel structure that was previously used for Ultimate X was brought back for this match to suspend the titles above the ring. And just like Ultimate X, this match too was a wild and crazy affair full of reckless spots involving Beer Money working as a very cohesive duo and taking out Booker T in the process, Scott Steiner going it alone and being dominate and even bringing out the Frankinsteiner, and also the  return of Rhino. In the end, it was Team 3D capturing the IWGP Tag Team titles and with help from Rob Terry, the British Invasion became the new TNA Tag Team champions. 4/5

TNA Knockouts Champion O.D.B. Vs. Tara Vs. Awesome Kong - The Knockouts again prevailed in having a pretty good match here. But this match was more about pushing storylines in such with Tara having a brawl with a mystery woman and leaving the match for a brief while and the mistake by Raisha Saaed in costing Awesome Kong the match which allowed O.D.B. to remain Knockouts champion. Overall, this is fairly an enjoyable and good 3 Way match for the Knockouts Title. 3.25/5

Samoa Joe Vs. Bobby Lashley (Submission Match) - This match was advertised being ""TNA Vs. MMA"" with Bobby Lashley representing MMA and of course Samoa Joe representing TNA. Lashley came to the ring with his ribs heavily taped and Joe went right for Lashley from the start. After the wild brawl, this match stayed pretty much MMA-style with both guys concentrating on using submissions and relying on their ground game. The only negative aspect of the match is the quick and sudden end that came off very weak but other than that, this match succeeded. 3.5/5

Mick Foley Vs. Abyss (Monster's Ball Match w/Dr. Stevie as the referee) - This match has to be a hardcore dream for anyone but inretrospect, I was a little disappointed with this match. Where this match could've been the best hardcore match of the century, this match just came off being average to me. And to make things worse, the added on stipulation was that if Abyss uses thumbtacks, he would be disqualified. The match started out with Foley attacking Abyss on the stage with Foley putting Abyss through the stage right out of the gate. From there, Abyss and Foley laid it all on the line bringing out various weapons such as the barbed wire bat, boards with barbed wire on them, and eventually thumbtacks. The only negatives I have to really point out are the ""stun-gun"" incident and the heavily botched 3 count which has been edited out on the DVD but what occurred with Daffeny afterwards heavily makes up for those two incidents. But overall, this was a hardcore dream match for everyone and these two gave their all and in any case, this match prevailed. 3.75/5

Kurt Angle Vs. Matt Morgan - While this match was built up being ""Wrestling's Best Vs. Wrestling's Future"" and maybe was the match to put Morgan into that main event spotlight, the crowd was heavily for Kurt Angle. In the early stages of the match, Angle was heavily dominated and overpowered by Morgan until Angle was able to fight back and begin to take control of the match and really crafted his ground work onto Morgan. From there, these two went back and forth with many near falls, Morgan able to power out of the anklelock at one point, and Angle scoring with a frog splash. In the end, it was Angle rolling up Morgan for his first Bound For Glory win. This was a very good match and it was a good match in elevating Matt Morgan's game in showing he can hang in there with the best of them. 4/5

TNA Heavyweight Champion AJ Styles Vs. Sting - This match had sportsmenship written all over it and it showed in the match. This match was also built up to being Sting's ""Final Curtian Call"" and it showed as Sting came to the ring with a brand new, sparklely ring coat and like always, bringing his best effort to TNA's signature event. The match was pretty much a stale mate between both challenger and champion with the match being comprised of many counters, reversals, and signature moves performed by both men. This is the best AJ Styles and Sting bout to date and this was a very good main event. After the match, we get a surprised speech from Sting where he expresses his thoughts about his future in TNA. 4/5

Overall, I found this Bound For Glory event being a good one but is certainly not the best in my book. Not having a single bad match on the card, I give Bound For Glory '09 a strong recommendation.",1266364800,,6531,4.541206457094307
8379537,5,B002SRNPT6,Great PPV with excellent matches throughout.  Unfortunately you can't skip the opening montage that runs EVERY time you put the DVD in.,1265328000,,135,5.136363636363637

Six-man Ultimate X match for the X-Division championship
Amazing Red vs. Suicide vs. Daniels vs. Homicide vs. Chris Sabin vs. Alex Shelly
A very highflying and entertaining match. This is another great match that makes the x-division, the x-division. This match had a new ultimate x structure overhead of the cables. Sick moment when Daniels fell off the cables and landed on his neck. Great match, and big upset victory for Amazing Red.
match rating:4.25/5

TNA Knockout Tag-Team championships
Taylor Wilde and Sarita vs. Velvet Sky and Madison Rayne
I know that these Knockouts are tougher than WWE divas, but, this match was terrible. I didn't even like this match. Also, this was the shortest match on the card that night.
match rating:1.75/5

Triple Threat match for the Legends championship
Eric Young vs. Kevin Nash vs. Hernandez
Okay match here. I wasn't very thrilled with this one. Nash and Young made this match sucky because they teamed up most of the match until the end when Hernandez was down and Young attacked Nash's leg and took the opportunity.
match rating:2.5/5

Fatal Four way Full Metal Mayhem match for the IWGP and TNA Tag Team championships
British Invasion vs. Team 3d vs. Booker T and Scott Stiener vs. Beer Money
Wow. This match has everything you could want in a tag team match. Everything from tables, to chairs, to ladders, to trash cans were used in this match. The two teams that pulled off the win were Team 3d(IWGP)and the British Invasion(TNA). Another good match worth watching.
match rating:4/5

Triple Threat match for the Knockouts championship
ODB vs. Tara vs. Awesome Kong
Another disapointment match at this ppv. This match is another WWE divas sucky type of match that lasted about 8 minuets. This match is not watchable.
match rating:1/5

Submission match
Bobby Lashely vs. Samoa Joe
Good, but way too short to be a submission match. This match had a lot of counters, ground and pound by Lashely, and some submission's by both men. Really, this match was way too short to be a good match between these two superstars.
match rating:3.5/5

Monsters Ball(special guest referee Dr. Stevie)
Abyss vs. Mick Foley
What a hardcore bout. This match reminds me of Randy Orton vs. Cactus Jack back at Backlash 2004, except not as long. This match starts out with Mick getting a sneak attack on Abyss. Mick hits Abyss a couple of times with a barbed wire baseball bat, then, a few moments later, Abyss goes through the stage. The match gets really hardcore when the barbed wire boards come into play. Great moments like Abyss getting ddted on a bwb, Dr. Stevie getting slammed on tacks, a chokeslam on Daffeny off the top rope through a bwb, and Mick getting chokeslamed on a bwb for Abyss to get the win. Also, when Abyss gets shocked by a tazer.
match rating:5/5

Kurt Angle vs. Matt Morgan
This is their best encounter yet. A lot of counters, submissions, and good wrestling by both men. A lot of technical wrestling from Kurt(as usual) and also ground and pound by Morgan. Definatly a worth watching match.
match rating:4/5

World Heavyweight championship
AJ Styles vs. Sting
This was a very good, but short world title match. At the last ppv(No Surrender)Sting let AJ win the belt because he wanted to face AJ one last time for the world title in his final match. Great match put on by these two with styles winning with the melee and 450 splash.
match rating:4.5/5

This is a great dvd. I would only get this for the ultimate x, monsters ball, full metal mayhem, Angle/Morgan, and the world heavyweight championship match.",1261958400,,3672,4.777602523659306
8379539,5,B002SRNPT6,First of all I was at the event.  I just watched the PPV on DvD and it is just as awesome as being there live.  This is a must have for the Ultimate X match alone.  Most of the matches were pretty good.  The monster's ball match was great except for the fact that Abyss forgot to put shoulder up when he was supposed to kick out of Foley's pin.  haha,1260662400,,350,3.8732394366197185
8379540,5,B002SRNPT6,"Ultimate X TNA X-Division Championship Match: The Amazing Red (Champion) vs. Alex Shelley vs. Chris Sabin vs. Daniels vs. Homicide vs. Suicide
A phenomenal opener. The match was fast-paced and intense throughout the entire thing, with so many spots that it was mind boggling. There were suicide dives and people being sent outside of the ring a lot at the beginning, until the only two remaining competitors were The Amazing Red and Daniels. Red took Daniels to the outside with a hurracanrana on top of everyone else! Everyone hit their signature offense throughout the match and their finishing moves, and Homicide hit a Gringo Cutter on Suicide from off the freaking Ultimate X ropes! There was one spot where a bunch of the guys were on the top ropes and there was a German suplex/superplex/powerbomb/Pele Kick combination that has to bee seen to be believed. Towards the end of the match, Red, Daniels, and Suicide were all on the Ultimate X ropes, and Suicide hit a freaking Suicide Solution OFF the ropes and onto the mat below on Daniels! Red took this opportunity to ward off Sabin and Shelley, who had just taken out Homicide, and grab the Championship to retain! Winner: The Amazing Red. Match Rating: 5/5

TNA Knockouts Tag Team Championship Match: Sarita and Taylor Wilde (Champions) vs. The Beautiful People (Madison Rayne and Velvet Sky)
Short and not so sweet. Lacey Von Erich was ejected from the match early on after a bunch of making out occured between her and a couple of referees. The match was rather short, with Sarita and Taylor dominating Sky at first. Sky fought back and got Rayne mixed into the action, which worked out well until Sarita hit some high impact offense and got Taylor in the ring. There was a bit of confusion with both of The Beautiful People in the ring at the same time, which allowed Sarita to hit an awesome missile dropkick on Sky to send her out of the ring. Taylor then set up Rayne, and they hit their tag team maneuver to pin Rayne to retain their titles. Winners: Sarita and Taylor Wilde. Match Rating: 3/5

Three Way Legends Championship Match: Kevin Nash (Champion) vs. Eric Young vs. Hernandez
Pretty good match, and a pretty big improvement over the previous match. Nash and Young double-teamed Hernandez pretty much the whole time. Young even managed to counter a suplex attempt by Hernandez thanks to Nash attacking Hernandez. Young then followed it up with a suplex of his OWN! Hernandez had bursts of offense that included his basic stuff. Nash started to become weary of Young when he went for a pinfall, but Young was sent to the outside by Hernandez shortly after. Nash threw Hernandez towards the ropes, but Hernandez hit a freaking suicide dive OVER the top rope and onto Young! As the match continued, Hernandez hit a sit-out powerbomb on Young that almost won him the match, but Nash broke up the pin at the last second. Young and Nash started beating down Hernandez again, and when Nash went for a Jackknife Powerbomb, Young knocked Hernandez into Nash's crotch! This allowed Young to pin Nash and win the title. Winner: Eric Young. Match Rating: 4/5

Full Metal Mayhem TNA World Tag Team and IWGP Tag Team Championships Match: The British Invasion (Brutus Magnus and Doug Williams) (IWGP Tag Team Champions) vs. The Main Event Mafia (Booker T and Scott Steiner) (TNA World Tag Team Champions) vs. Beer Money, Inc. (James Storm and Robert Roode) vs. Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray)
BRUTAL as HELL. There were still some weak chair shots, but there were also some extremely strong chair shots that made you cringe. Everyone hit their signature moves, and the entire thing was a technical tag team clinic. Tables were broken everywhere, with Team 3D Chokeslamming people through tables and Scott Steiner was even double powerbombed through a table off a ladder by Team 3D. Team 3D managed to pull down the IWGP Tag Team Championship, but their victory was short-lived as Rhino ran out and attacked them with a steel chair! Booker T was taken away on a stretcher, leaving the only teams being British Invasion and Beer Money left! Beer Money were about to win, but then Big Rob came out and MILITARY PRESS SLAMMED ROBERT ROODE OUT OF THE RING AND THROUGH A TABLE AT RINGSIDE!!! Rob then carried Magnus on his shoulders to grab the title while Williams kept James Storm down. Winners: Team 3D and The British Invasion. Match Rating: 5/5

Three Way TNA Women's Knockout Championship Match: ODB (Champion) vs. Awesome Kong vs. Tara
An epic women's encounter! ODB and Tara double-teamed Kong at first, hitting a double suplex on her and continuously hitting her with power moves. ODB and Tara started fighting though, which led to some stiff shots and Tara debuting a new move that she borrowed from Tajiri...the Tarantula! Kong broke up the submission hold by splashing ODB, which sent Tara to the outside. As Kong dominated ODB, Tara was distracted by something and then went backstage. Kong and ODB continued their match. ODB managed to hit a Samoan drop on Kong (no joke), but Kong managed to recover and get ODB on the mat. Tara returned to the ring and tried to get involved, but Kong knocked her off the apron. Kong then hit a splash off the second rope on ODB, and Tara just barely broke the count. Kong tossed Tara back to the outside again and then hit the Implant Buster on ODB!!! ODB KICKED OUT OF THE IMPLANT BUSTER! Raisha Saeed, Kong's handler, ran out to the ring and tossed a steel chair into the ring. Kong kicked the chair out of the ring, but Saeed threw it back into the ring just as Kong was about to do a powerbomb on ODB. ODB countered in mid-air and hit a Cutter on Kong on the steel chair to retain her title! Winner: ODB. Match Rating: 5/5

Submission Match: Bobby Lashley vs. Samoa Joe
Surprisingly, this match was awesome as hell. Joe and Lashley started out applying a bunch of different submission holds to each other, and then they started with some straight wrestling. Joe then LEAP FROGGED over Lashley went he went for a Spear! Joe took advantage and started focusing on Lashley's injured ribs. They went to the outside, where Joe utilized the ring and the security barricade to hurt Lashley. Back in the ring, Joe hit a series of suplexes and not one, but TWO Rock Bottom moves on Lashley. Joe applied some submission holds, but Lashley fought out of them. Joe coreographed more leap frog attempts by Lashley by jabbing him in the thumb and hitting some more power moves. Joe went for a third Rock Bottom, but Lashley tripped him and applied...THE COQUINA CLUTCH!!! Samoa Joe passed out, and Lashley won! Winner: Bobby Lashley. Match Rating: 5/5

Special Stipulations Special Guest Referee Monster's Ball Match: Abyss vs. Mick Foley (with Special Guest Referee Dr. Stevie)
They screwed up majorly in the middle of the match, but it was still amazing. This match will be a match to remember forever. A pure classic. It started out with Foley ambushing Abyss during his entrance. Foley hit Abyss with a neckbreaker and then tried to climb the scaffolding on the stage, but Abyss followed! Foley punched Abyss off the scaffolding, who FELL THROUGH THE STAGE!!! Foley followed this up with a flying elbow drop off the normal part of the stage onto the broken part with the barbed wire baseball bat!!! Stevie helped Foley back to the ring, but Abyss suddenly broke out...OF THE MIDDLE OF THE RAMP!!! Abyss headed to the ring, and then it turned into madness. Abyss tried to Chokeslam Foley onto a board with barbed wire, but Foley countered into his Double-Arm DDT onto the barbed wire!!! Meanwhile, Dr. Stevie set up another barbed wire board bridge-style between the security barricade and the ring. In the ring though, Foley started to work over Abyss by SWINGING the barbed wire bat at his arm! Foley then tried to throw Abyss into the a barbed wire board set in the corner, but Abyss countered and Foley was sent into the board! Abyss went for a splash, but Foley moved out of the way and Abyss smashed into the barbed wire! Foley and Dr. Stevie then sandwiched Abyss between the two barbed wire boards! Foley then brought out the thumbtacks that he banned Abyss from using, but before he could slam Abyss on them, Abyss recovered and went for a Chokeslam! Dr. Stevie reminded him that if he used the thumbtacks, he would be disqualified. Abyss responded by hitting the Electric Shock Treatment on Stevie! Daffney ran down to ringside and slid Foley a taser, which Foley subsequently used on Abyss! A new referee ran to the ring and Foley technically got the three count, but the referee decided not to count it for whatever dumb reason. Foley then got the sock and put it on his hand. He ran at Abyss, but Abyss tripped him face-first into the barbed wire board! Daffney climbed to the top ropes, but Abyss Chokeslammed her...THROUGH THE FREAKING BARBED WIRE BOARD HE SET UP EARLIER!!! Dr. Stevie started attacking Abyss, but Abyss hit a Black Hole Slam on him onto the thumbtacks!!! Abyss then Chokeslammed Foley onto the barbed wire board, and he dragged Stevie over and forced him to make the three count! Winner: Abyss. Match Rating: 5/5

Kurt Angle vs. Matt Morgan
Awesome, awesome match. It started with Angle fleeing from Morgan, but Morgan kept pursuing him. Morgan manhandled Angle in the ring, and then started focusing on his previously injured neck. Morgan did a reverse Chokeslam to Angle and made his face land on the top turnbuckle, and then continued with the violence. Angle fought back by focusing on Morgan's leg, and he applied a couple of unique submission holds and even chopblocked it. Matt fought back and went for a Chokeslam, but Angle countered into a roll-up! Morgan barely kicked out and then managed to hit Angle with the Chokeslam, but Angle kicked out! Morgan then hit his signature offense and went for the Hellevator, but Angle fought back and got Matt on the ground again. Focusing on the leg, Angle applied a Figure Four Leg Lock, but Morgan finally reversed it, forcing Angle to grab the ropes to break the hold. Morgan countered the Angle Slam, but Angle hit it with his second attempt after a series of German suplexes, and but Morgan kicked out! Angle then tried to apply the Ankle Lock, but Morgan pushed him away. Angle kept reapplying the hold, and Morgan tried to push him away again, but Angle jumped WITH Morgan's foot and kept the pressure on!!! Morgan managed to get Angle away finally, missed the Carbon Footprint, but then connected with the move when Angle charged him! This only earned another two count, but then Morgan hit the Hellevator...BUT ANGLE KICKED OUT!!! A visibly frustrated Morgan went to the top rope and hit a flying forearm smash, but Angle still kicked out. Morgan went for another Hellevator, but Angle rolled through and applied the Ankle Lock! Matt got to his feet and broke the hold, only to end up eating an Angle Slam! Angle didn't just leave it at that though. He went to the top ropes and hit a Frog Splash, ala Eddie Guerrero, but Morgan STILL KICKED OUT!!! Angle went to the top ropes again for a moonsault, but Matt got up and then went for a Tombstone Piledriver!!! Angle rolled through and applied another Ankle Lock, but Matt fought out yet AGAIN and hit the Discus Clothesline! ANGLE KICKED FREAKING OUT! Morgan went to the top ropes again, but Angle suddenly sprang to his feet and hit a super belly-to-belly suplex! Morgan STILL freaking kicked out and then went for a powerbomb, but Angle rolled him up. Morgan then went for another Hellevator, but Angle rolled him up for the final time and won the match!!! After the match, Angle shook Morgan's hand. Winner: Kurt Angle. Match Rating: 5/5

TNA World Heavyweight Championship Match: AJ Styles (Champion) vs. Sting
Great, great match. It started with a lot of psychology and submission holds, and Sting and AJ dodging each other's moves. Then Sting went on the sick offensive, throwing AJ hard into the corners and hitting some power moves. Sting clotheslined AJ to the outside, but then let him back into the ring. The fight spilled to the outside again after AJ hit a nice missile dropkick, but Sting moved out of the way before AJ could hit a Suicide Dive. AJ then went for a Suicide Dive off the ring apron, but Sting moved out of the way and AJ hit the security railing. Sting then went for a Stinger Splash on AJ while he was leaning against the security barricade, but AJ moved out of the way and Sting hit the barricade. AJ stopped Earl Hebner from counting Sting out, and he demanded Sting came back into the ring, thus returning the favor from earlier. AJ went for a Tombstone Piledriver, but Sting countered...INTO HIS OWN TOMBSTONE PILEDRIVER!!! AJ kicked, amazingly, and Sting then continued on the offensive. Sting went for a Scorpion Death Drop, but AJ countered into a Scorpion Death Drop attempt of his own. Sting countered again, and then AJ countered again, and then Sting countered again, finally hitting the move! Sting's injury from earlier by running into the barricade kept him from capitalizing on the move, and AJ got up first and rested in the corner. Sting then got up and while AJ was resting, with his face away from Sting, Sting hit a reverse Stinger Splash and then ANOTHER Scorpion Death Drop!!! AJ kicked out, but Sting wasn't derailed. He applied the Scorpion Deathlock next, but AJ managed to power out of the hold. AJ went to the top, but Sting followed. AJ headbutted Sting to the mat, but his legs were injured so he fell off the top ropes and onto the apron. Sting went to capitalized, but AJ came out of nowhere with a Pele Kick on the apron! AJ then hit a springboard splash on Sting to win the match and retain his title! Winner: AJ Styles. Match Rating: 5/5

OVERALL EVENT
This show was the best TNA show of the entire year. There was only one average match, and besides that, almost every single match was a perfect match, with the exception of one really good, but not amazing, match. The main event delivered, but we were left on the edge about if Sting will retire or not. Angle's possible face turn was interesting, and all the title changes added suspense to everything. There were amazing, never before seen things in many of the matches, and it felt like TNA has finally discovered the magic that goes into doing a WrestleMania-esque show. Bound for Glory though now stands away from WrestleMania. People will no longer say, ""Bound for Glory is TNA's WrestleMania."" No, they will just say, ""Bound for Glory is TNA's biggest show of the year."" This is how you do a wrestling show, and this is what about professional wrestling is all about. There was high-flying action, hardcore action, technical wrestling, women's wrestling, and even some of the crazy and silly shenanigans that goes along with any good wrestling show. This is TNA's pay-per-view of the year, no doubt.",1258502400,5,14868,4.706605222734255
8379541,4,B002SRNPT6,"Before I get started, I just want to make note that I was actually at this event live & I wrote this review before the DVD itself was released so the 4 star rating this is strickly for the event itself.  It should also noted that Guitarist Zakk Wylde of ""Black Label Society"" played the National Anthem, TNA wrestlers showed their support for the fight against breast cancer all night by wearing pink bands on their ring outfits & A.J. Styles even having the universal logo for breast cancer awareness on his wrestling tights, and eventhough it's advertised...the preshow match between the Motor City Machine Guns vs. Lethal Consequences is NOT on this DVD.

Ultimate X Match: X Division Champion Amazing Red vs. Daniels vs. Chris Sabin vs. Alex Shelley vs. Suicide vs. Homicide - ""The Pope"" D'Angelo Dinero was originally scheduled for this but was replaced last minute by the Gunz due to a family emergency.  The setup for this Ultimate X was new as they had the usual ringropes stretched out above the ring with the championship hanging in the middle but above that was the Elevation X structure as well that was also used in the Ultimate X match back at Victory Road '07.  Just as you would expect from the Ultimate X match, this was a wild & crazy stunt fest that led to us chanting for the wrestlers to ""Please Don't Die"" at one point.  One highlight without a doubt was the team of the Gunz themselves as their speed & doubleteam moves were just amazing to watch.  And speaking of amazing, other moments to look out for were the wrestlers fighting on top of the Elevation X structure & the failed attempts at winning the belts resulting in some heavy falls like Sabin & Red landing facefirst at one point while Daniels landed so nasty on his head that most of us were shocked that he was able to walk out the ring.  Without a doubt, this the best way possible to start the PPV.

Knockouts Tag Team Champions Taylor Wilde & Sarita vs. The Beautiful People - It should be noted that Lacey Von Erich recently joined TNA & became the 3rd member of the group replacing Angelina Love and had a pretty funny moment in the beginning of the match with the referee.  This match was really short & quick with nothing noteworthy to it past a botched DDT by Velvet at one point but I'm warning you know that if you can't stand the sound of women screaming non-stop then hit the mute button on his one.

TNA Legends Champion Kevin Nash vs. Hernandez vs. Eric Young - As stated in the prematch interview, this was setup to be a glorified handicap match as Eric Young paid Kevin Nash to help him take out Hernandez & protect himself in the process.  Hernandez returned to his L.A.X. attire & showed why Young was smart enough to pay Kevin Nash right from the beginning as he overpowered & dominated Young right from the start to the point where the back of his head was bleeding right away.  Nash got involved & did his job throughout the match and the match was exactly how it was setup to be but in the end, it was Eric Young who ended up outsmarting everyone.

Full Metal Mayhem Match: TNA Tag Team Champions Booker T & Scott Steiner vs. I.W.G.P. Tag Team Champions British Invasion vs. Team 3D vs. Beer Money - Just a couple of notes here but a ""Full Metal Mayhem"" match is TNA's version of a ""TLC/Tables & Ladders & Chairs"" match.  This was a match were one of both championships were hung from the Elevation X structure that was used in the Ultimate X match earlier and the match doesn't end until both title belts are taken down & whatever belt a team takes down, they officially become that set of champions.  This was similar to Ultimate X earlier in that this was a ""car crash"" but in a good way filled with various spots & moments like Booker T doing the spinaroonie before being taken out of the match (and TNA) by Beer Money, various cameo appearences including Zakk Wylde getting involved in the action at one point, and Scott Steiner being the M.V.P. of the match by just being a dominate beast in the ring taking out all the teams alone at one point & even out of the ring just completely beating down Devon to the point where the camera didn't catch it but you could hear it on the headsets the sounds of Steiner whipping him non-stop with the other TNA Tag Team Title belt.  An awesome match.

TNA Knockouts Champion O.D.B. vs. Tara va. Awesome Kong - This started off as a nice triple threat between all 3 girls that even saw Tara break out Taijir's old move of the Tarantula at one point but this was more about pushing other storylines more than anything else as there was a moment that between Tara & a female at ringside (MMA fighter Kim Couture) that had Tara taken out of the match for a while along with what happened between Kong & Raisha Saaed.  It was a good triple threat match but again, this was about pushing storylines more than anything else.

Submission Match: Bobby Lashley vs. Samoa Joe - Before I get started, it should be noted that TNA kept promoting this match as ""TNA vs. MMA"" eventhough Lashley is an official TNA wrestler & even at one point, the announcers pointed out how this match was subtitled ""TNA vs. MMA"" but said that Lashley himself said this had nothing to do with MMA since he's a TNA wrestler...talk about backwards promotion.  Lashley came into the match with his ribs taped & eventhough he had a few supporters on his side, a majority of the crowd was for Samoa Joe in this match.  This resembled the match Joe had with Kurt Angle back at LockDown where it was an MMA-style match where both men heavily relied on staying close to the body & with Joe hitting big moves early on & using kicks throughout the match that even caught Earl Hebner at one point.  The only thing negative I can say for this match is that I felt that the ending came too quick & came off very weak.
On a personal note, I said earlier that I was at this event live & I just wanted to tell a funny story here in that two rows ahead of me was one fan who was a heavy Samoa Joe mark (he even admitted it) & wanted Joe to win the match so badily that he got so heavily pissed off at the result and ended up taking my empty drink cup & nailed Lashley right in the face while he was walking up the ramp on the way back.  It got Lashley's attention right away as the entire section pointed out who did it & Lashley started him down while this guy ended up getting thrown out of the rest of the show.

Monster's Ball w/Dr. Stevie as the referee: Mick Foley vs. Abyss - This match had a special stipulation that if Abyss used thumbtacks in this match, he would lose by disqualification (yes, a DQ in a hardcore match).  They started out on the stage that at one point saw Abyss go through it only to come out the ramp like it was a scene from a monster movie.  I don't want to give too much away here but the only negative things I can say here is that the way the ""tazer"" came off looking when it was used was just so hokey & there was a big botch with the count at one point that it was worthy of the chant it got.  Past that, you had barbed wire come into play via the baseball bats & wooden boards covered with it, thumbtacks, and Daffney getting involved & doing something so unexpected that it had the arena chanting through the video package for the next match ""She's Hardcore!  She's Hardcore!""  You got just about everything you expected in his match & more just based off the reputation both men have when it comes to the word ""hardcore.""

Matt Morgan vs. Kurt Angle - This was built up as ""Wrestling's Future vs. Wrestling's Greatest"" & the crowd as pro-Angle here.  Morgan dominated early with his power but the match really picked up when Angle started working on his ground game leading to both men going back & forth with each other (look out for Kurt's amazing frog splash at one point) & countering each others moves various times including Morgan powering out of the anklelock with both men coming so close to beating each other at various points.  This wasn't a ""blowaway"" classic Kurt Angle performance that you would expect on their biggest show but he did his job here in elevating Matt Morgan in the eyes of people by showing the youngest could hang with the veteran to the point where Morgan got the respect he was looking for in the end.

TNA Champion A.J. Styles vs. Sting - This was a true ""gentleman's match"" here as they shook hands before the match & put on a performance that didn't need ""heel"" tactics as both men kept a level of respect with each other throughout the match.  As usual when it comes to Bound For Glory & even pointed out various times throughout the night, Sting is TNA's ""Mr. October"" & did bring his ""A"" game here for this match as he kept up with A.J. Styles here & took the fight to him straight up with even hitting his Scorpion Deathdrop & locking in the Scorpion Deathlock at various times for Styles to keep fighting while A.J. did tone down his high flyin' offense for more of a grounded style.  If you can get past the ending which came sudden & had a poor setup to it...this match surpassed their previous match a year earlier from Turning Point however I enjoyed Sting's performances against Samoa Joe & Kurt Angle at the previous BFG's more than this one.  Afterwards (once they found a mic that was working), Sting gave an unexpected speech where he didn't answer if this was his final TNA match or not.

The second disc is full of DVD extras such as two versions of Dead By Sunrise's ""Crawl Back In"" music video with one being the regular version & the other full of BFG highlights, the ""Beyond The Glory"" special highlighting the top matches going into the PPV, a Sting interview done on his way to the fan interaction, interviews with the celebrities in attendance at BFG including a comedic one between Zakk Wylde & Jeremy Borash, pre-match interviews with people like Angle & Sting & Morgan & Lashley & Foley, post match highlights featuring Hernandez showing his knocked out teeth & Eric Young getting stitched up & the aftermath of the Monster's Ball with Dr. Stevie & Abyss & Daffney (she got the worst out of everyone), and highlights of fan interaction (you can see me in the opening shot...I'm the african american was wearing an all black suit with sunglasses on).

Overall, the only real negatives I can say about this show is that the Knockouts didn't really deliver on this show and there seemed to be alot of botches/technical difficulties/misques at various times throughout the night but overall, this was a very enjoyable show & one of TNA's best shows (if not their best show) of the year so far so this is definately an event worth picking up.",1258329600,4,10642,4.40519877675841
