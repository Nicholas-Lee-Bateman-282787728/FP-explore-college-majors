8277079,5,B001AD6UZU,"Stop Train 349 is a Hollywood version of a real life incident that happened November 24, 1961. I was stationed with the 570th MP Railway Guard which had a unit in Frankfurt and Berlin. In 2009 I started doing research on this incident and located Grabowski, the other MP on the train in my unit, a schoolteacher that was on the train. After about a year and a half later, I was able to locate the refugee  Peter S. A Berlin journalist contacted me about a possible documentary. Four of us went to Berlin in September 2010 and filmed the documentary ""Fluchtlefer in Uniforms"". The real life hero of this story is Colonel Grabowski who refused to turn the refugee over to the Russians after being given a direct order by his superiors to do so The U S Army was going to court martial him but General Lucas Clay who was in Berlin at the time rescinded the court martial and gave him a medal instead. This was not a plot by the Soviets to heat up the Cold War. Peter lost his mother and father during the war and was living with his stepparents. He was being pressured by East Germans to join the military. He thought that if he could get aboard the U. S. military train he could escape. He took a rock, broke the glass, boarded the train, but was noticed by the East German train conductor reported him to the Soviets at the checkpoint. There was a message given Jan. 2, 2010 by Mssspk-624-698222. Your father, Charles Fitz, was one of the officers that was sent there to turn the refugee over to the Russians. We could not find him because we were told his name was Fitzgerald. You may contact me at ableshome1@comcast.net. 304-594-1389.",1437264000,,1635,4.431893687707642
8277080,5,B001AD6UZU,A great docu movie - better than the first time I viewed it years ago.,1434067200,,70,3.7333333333333334
8277081,4,B001AD6UZU,"Having grown up in Berlin while my father worked for the British Military Government and travelled several times on this train, it brought back memories.  The first time I saw the film was in Strassburg, while waiting to board the French military train.  Once, while on the US train, it derailed and we too were surrounded by Soviet troops.

The film is fairly well made, with some interesting dynamics between the characters, and it does a good job of reflecting the tensions of that time.  Well worth seeing to sample the atmosphere of the cold war.

This DVD works fine on a Region 2 (UK/European) player.  Picture quality (B/W) is OK considering the age of the film, and soundtrack is adequate, though sub-titles would have been a bonus.",1349222400,3,741,4.75
8277082,3,B001AD6UZU,"Having lived in Berlin as a Berlin American High School (BAHS) student, and having ridden the duty train (as we called it) many times both between Berlin and Frankfurt, and Berlin and Bremerhaven (also lived there), and finally having seen the movie, it holds a little more special significance than it might for the average viewer. As one reviewer said, it's not a very exciting film, and Jose Ferrer is the only name star in the movie that most folks would recognize. but many movies that dramatize true-life incidents like this one aren't exceptionally good. There are times it seems contrived, but if you know the true story, and the heroic efforts of the train commander (real life Lt Norbert Grabowski) to perserve U.S. sovereignty (which at the heart of the film is the real issue), you might cut it some slack. And the incident was fairly typical of the ways in which the Soviets heated up the Cold War by using the East Germans to provoke international incidents with the U.S. without directly confronting the U.S. Thank God that nightmare is over.

By all means go ahead and see the movie...it's a nice little B&W B-movie that passes the time. For those of us with duty train experiences, it's a bit of nostalgia.",1341360000,,1223,4.714953271028038
8277083,5,B001AD6UZU,"As a Cold Warrior, road that train about 50 times. I recommend it for those that did; what a walk down memory lane! The train occupies an entire chapter in my book, Secrets of the Cold War, also on Amazon.",1328313600,2,205,4.15
8277084,2,B001AD6UZU,"Not a ""Euro Spy"" movie and not a good vehicle for Sean Flynn. Little action, leaden direction, and a dull story line that goes almost nowhere. Try his other availble movie, Mission to Venice; a much more satisfying B movie.",1321056000,,223,4.6
8277085,2,B001AD6UZU,"I purchased this movie thinking it would be somewhat like ""The Train"" with Burt Lancaster or ""The Third Man."" This film has a good story line, but the producers and directors seem not to think so. They throw in plenty of gratuitous semi nudity and nudity to try hold your attention. This movie has the right stuff when it comes to plot but falls flat handled by folks who don't have the budget or the imagination to do it right. This would be a good candidate for a remake but that is all.
The story revolves around an East German man who attempts to escape the east by hopping a special train allowed to shuttle from Berlin to the west. Admittance to the train is tightly controlled by the Russians East Germans and the Western Allies. The stowaway creates an international incident by hopping on the train. A female steward allows the man on the train because he is hanging on to the outside of one of the doors while the train is traveling at a high rate of speed. She shows compassion and allows him on the train. Jose Ferrar is on the train but it is obvious he took this part because he had not a better offer. I ended up throwing this in the trash and chalking this up to the price of an education.",1263340800,,1205,4.2894736842105265
