8481768,5,B005OT3FUE,"This is a DVD on catechesis that I find excellent beyond all telling. Solid Catholic teaching, presented in a very matter-of-fact, straightforward and unpretentious way, coupled with superb imagery and music make these great instruments in evangelizing our family and friends whilst enriching our own faith. One of their installments is this DVD 'Gifts from God'.

A two part documentary on important aspects of church teaching, viz the Papacy and Confession, and that many Catholics find either hard to understand or to explain to non-Catholics or even both, this DVD serves well to explain these points that will further make us more appreciative of these gifts from God.

The first documentary entitled Keys of the Kingdom: Understanding the Papacy takes us into the Biblical, doctrinal and theological basis of the Papacy and its meaning and its relevance throughout the centuries. We learn the aspect of Kingship in ancient Israel and the courtly culture and how its attributed to Jesus Christ and Saint Peter. We are then taken through different historical epochs of the Papacy, from its early days of persecution to the present time, delving on its contributions spiritually, morally, historically and through art and architecture, their failures and successes. the turmoils and eras of peace. And in all theses we are taught why something imperfect was ordained by Christ to be His representative on earth. We are also taught the importance of the magesterium and its function down the ages.
Contributing to this documentary are Fr. Marcus Holden, Fr. Andrew Pinsent, Fr. Joseph Carola. Fr. Nicholas Scofield, Steve Ray (EWTN) and Joanna Bogel.

This documentary is 40 minutes long and in English without subtitles.

The second documentary is approximately 20 minutes long and it takes us into the sacrament of reconciliation otherwise known as confession. Again a cast of expert theologians help us to unlock this sacrament with teaching based on Holy Scripture. From here were are taught:
1) The different types of sin, the effect that sin has on our souls and this is beautifully explained with imagery and the teachings and sayings of the saints.
2) The spiritual effects of confession
3) The Mercy and Joy of God in regard to the penitent.
4) General fears lay faithful have about this sacrament.
5) The proper disposition of the priest.
5) Formula for Confession,i.e. what needs to be done before, during and after the sacrament.

After watching this one realises that Confession is actually an instrument of God's mercy and gift for us, and that it is to be approached with confidence and trust in God's unfathomable love. This documentary will empower us to readily make use of this grace of salvation.
The priests interviewed very gently allay the fears that one might have regarding this sacrament and puts to rest all myths that surround it. Their approach is full of love, kindness and mercy.

Interviewed are : Frs. Marcus Holden, Andrew Pinsent. Jeremy Davies, Thomas Cream and Timothy Finnigan.

These two documentaries, with a running time of approximately 60 minutes is so wonderful that it has the ability to draw people back to the church with its content. Wonderful for any parish or to circulate amongst friends who have fallen away, or doubtful or assailed with fears, to draw them back to the one true fold.
