3120342,5,B0013XZ6O8,"This DVD brings us two classics of Mexican cinema, DISTINTO AMANECER (Julio Bracho, 1943) and LA PERLA (Emilio Fernndez, 1946).  Considering the age of these films, both copies are in very good condition, although the sound is not always perfect.  The main actors (Pedro Armendriz & Andrea Palma; Pedro Armendriz & Mara Elena Marqus) are all superb.  The cinematography, by Gabriel Figueroa in both instances, is nothing short of stunning. A treat for those who value a great period in Mexican cinema.",1257120000,6,501,5.085365853658536
3120343,2,B0013XZ6O8,"I ordered this DVD under the impression that the copy of LA PERLA on the disk had English subtitles.  I am not attempting to return it; my son has a friend that he can give it to.

However, I would like to know if a subtitled version of this film does exist.  Can you give me any information on that?  And if there is such a version, can you name a source for me?  Thank you for your attention to this request.",1250985600,8,410,3.951219512195122
3120344,3,B0013XZ6O8,"Distinto Amanecer is one of those movies you get drawn into. Atmospheric as hell and excellent performances from Armendariz & Palma. It is unfortunate the sound track goes ""off track"" on a couple of scenes and kind of makes one lose the movie magic for a few minutes. Other than that, it's a great film.",1211760000,5,303,4.527272727272727

8253400,3,B0013XZ6O8,"I agree with all the previous reviewers as far as the content, performances, plot, and such are concerned. Five stars for cinematography and acting. My biggest gripe is the terrible audio. WIth today's technology, why can't this feature be enhanced, fixed, or at least improved? Thus, the 3 stars. On a different note, I really enjoyed the ""jarocho"" music and dances in ""La Perla"". This was the true hidden pearl in the movie. Too bad ""Los Costeos"" were not credited for their performances and the soundtracks not listed. I briefly lived in ""Jarocho"" country while attending the University of Veracruz in Jalapa.",1405468800,,612,5.009803921568627
8253401,5,B0013XZ6O8,Two great Mexican movies in ONE DVD! Great price for these timeless movies! Arrived quickly and in great shape. Bought as a gift. Saw these movies on the big screen at the Los Angeles Museum of Art. La Perla is a John Steinbeck classic and filmed in wonderful black and white! A DO NOT MISS movie!,1380844800,,297,4.321428571428571

8253403,4,B0013XZ6O8,"Having seen Distinto Amanecer WITH subtitles at a local arthouse venue (The Detroit Film Theatre), I give this product four stars for its availability and quality, but subtract one from a possible five because it does not have subtitles. As an enthusiastic consumer of films noirs I find this film is very much in line with that particular type of film, and recommend it to those who share my enthusiasm. But please, someone, make this available with subtitles. Do so and I'll buy it in a heartbeat.",1358380800,4,499,4.747126436781609
8253404,3,B0013XZ6O8,"As is common with movies of this era, the sound quality leaves something to be desired.  Voices sometimes are muffled, making it difficult to understand the dialogue.  Subtitles in Spanish would be welcome.",1355529600,,206,5.212121212121212
8253405,4,B0013XZ6O8,"These  two movies from the 40s are in Spanish without subtitles.  But if you are fluent in Spanish, they are a real bargain.  They are expertly shot, and the plots are also well done.  The video on La Perla is very clear.  Pedro Armendariz, who also acted in some English language films, such as From Russia With Love, is the star in both.  Distinto Amanecer is about an underground union movement against evil people in power.  Though it takes place in the 40s in  Mexico, the themes are universal.  La Perla takes place in a small fishing village, and is about how richness (the pearl) corrupts.  Although the sound on the films is not that clear, both were enjoyable, and the price makes this set very attractive.",1330819200,6,716,4.566929133858268
