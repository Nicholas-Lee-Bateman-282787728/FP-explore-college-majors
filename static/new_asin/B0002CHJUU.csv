In this case, they're on Lake Travis at Devil's Cove, Texas, so all of the action is at a marina or on boats on the lake. Sometimes the girls go totally in the buff, but mostly they're topless or flashing their back sides. And WOW, there's lots of great-looking girls there! An activity done a lot at this party is putting jello or whipped creme on a lady's bare chest, then some lucky person gets to lick it off.

Unlike some of the other Crazy Chicks volumes, this one has two gorgeous and sexy hosts that are on camera a lot, so there are several segments of the hosts doing strip shows in private rooms, and in one great segment they're in the shower together, so those are nice extras too. Camerawork is quite good, though still a fair bit of jitteriness at times, and some scenes were not good enough to use. The whole DVD runs about one hour, and the bonuses are a 5-minute scene with Jessica Jaymes in a jacuzzi from the Peach video ""Bikini Bash"" and trailers from other racy Peach DVDs. So, I'd say that CRAZY CHICKS: DEVIL'S COVE is quite a good DVD.
