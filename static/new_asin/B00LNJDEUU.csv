8666941,5,B00LNJDEUU,"very confusing to order. I ordered 7 and 8. It worked once - perfectly and then in various parts it didn't work right at all. After about an hour of hunting, I found another 7 and 8 for $15. or something. Then I found it for $23.00 or $15.00 used. Then I came upon it new for, as I wrote $23.00 or something. I'm exhausted. I've never had such a hard time ordering ever!

I would have loved to order this beautiful section or series new, but I'm not going back to try to order it new and then try to cancel the other order. I don't have the energy and I don't feel like fighting off the trash bag ad that kept jumping on top of my attempt to order series 7 and 8.

Still, it's such a lovely dvd, I suppose it was worth the struggle - to order it I mean. I wonder what will come. I don't need any  trash bags.
Thank you",1430524800,,818,3.8862275449101795
