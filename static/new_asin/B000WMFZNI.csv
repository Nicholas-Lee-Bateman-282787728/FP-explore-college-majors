2987545,5,B000WMFZNI,"Let's see if Amazon will allow me to post this review, having been denied on a recent attempt because I referred to a practice that rhymes with belching, which John Waters discusses in hilarious detail in this documentary.  I do appear in the series, so I am biased.  Still, I will say that it's really professional, eclectic, and smart.  I am proud to have been part of it, and proud that IFC made it.  I am ashamed that Amazon feels compelled to censor innocuous terms that are quite legitimate to discuss in relation to films about this subject.  After all, the multi-billion dollar Amazon corporation is happy to make a profit from such sales, but they want no responsibility for how their customers respond to their products.  That's a cheap trick.  Wait-- can I say that?",1323475200,2,777,4.669117647058823

2987547,5,B000WMFZNI,"While not comprehensive, this is an excellent beginners guide to understanding how & why sexuality is portrayed in film.  Our great country has its strengths, but one of our weaknesses is our Victorian inability to maturely and intellectually explore or confront issues of a sexual nature.  Such issues are interwoven into the human experience whether we approve of them or not. They are essential to making us human, and consequently, are inescapable.  Thus, we find that many film-makers are attempting to confront those issues which society at large is unwilling to do.  I would love to see a more thorough follow-up to this series, but at least this is a good start.",1275868800,3,670,4.955357142857143
2987548,5,B000WMFZNI,"One of the most interesting documentaries I have ever watched, certainly it blows the History channel and VH1's sex shows out of the water.  Goes through sex in movies from the earliest stag films (seriously, humans have always been kinkier than you'd imagine) right onto current times.

I find it a good reference material source to locate old movies or to be more exact, scenes, from movies forgotten, their is a lot more information on this DVD then I expected, Nice's to get more for a change, If you enjoy vintage movies and like them spiced up with maybe just a quick peek at a breast, or knowing Ester Williams, the swimming star of yesteryear's did a nude swimming seen in a Tarzan movie, nothing raw or raunchy, just nudity that fit in to the movie perfectly, to have worn a bathing suit would have ruined the shot and the movie, Back in the days Hollywood could really make movies, I reminisce and digress.  Buy this video if you want to learn or buy it just for the nude shots in the video reviews.  This is not Hardcore porn, so don't buy it for that, it just a well made  video full of information for movie buff's, and the woman on the cover is not an out take from an old vintage film, she's a burlesque actress who appears in the video.

2987550,4,B000WMFZNI,"Indie Sex is a four-part documentary about the evolution of sex in cinema. Produced by the Independent Film Channel, Indie Sex features John Cameron Mitchell, Dita Von Teese, Rosanna Arquette, Peter Sarsgaard, Tatum O' Neal, and others discussing their thoughts and opinions on everything sexual.

Part one is the segment ""Censored,"" in which filmmakers and critics discuss the necessity of sex in cinema. We also get to see examples of early stag films and see the subtle ways filmmakers would imply sex to get past the Production Code Sensors. ""Censored"" talks about the introduction of the NC-17 rating (first bestowed upon&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Henry-June/dp/0783230559/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Henry & June</a>) and how&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Showgirls-Fully-Exposed-Edition/dp/B000PMFS2I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Showgirls (Fully Exposed Edition)</a>&nbsp;ultimately ruined the NC-17 rating's chance of getting a mainstream audience.

""Teens"" covers sex in teen films and how it wasn't until the 1960s that this subject was explored. It talks about Hollywood studios seeing profit in teen sex comedies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Pie-Unrated-Widescreen-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000031WD9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Pie - Unrated (Widescreen Collector's Edition)</a>. Of course, the impact of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kids/dp/B00004YA6G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kids</a>&nbsp;on the teen-sex subgenre is discussed in depth, as well as the early `90s starting to explore teenage homosexuality.

""Extremes"" talks about pedophilia, S&M, and unsimulated sex in films. Stanley Kubrick's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lolita/dp/B000UJ48VI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lolita</a>&nbsp;as well as Adrian Lyne's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lolita/dp/B00001IVFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lolita</a>&nbsp;are discussed at length. This is also covers fetishism and unsimulated sex in films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/9-songs-Unrated-Full-Uncut-Version/dp/B000BGH29K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">9 songs - Unrated Full Uncut Version</a>&nbsp;and Vincent Gallo's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Brown-Bunny/dp/B0009VRHLK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Brown Bunny</a>.

Finally, ""Taboos"" (a 30-minute segment) covers much of the same ground including the `70s detaching romance from sex...Here the films of John Waters, David Lynch, and David Cronenberg are the main topics.

Much of the same material is discussed in an older and superior documentary called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Celluloid-Closet-Special-Edition/dp/B00005AWR9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Celluloid Closet (Special Edition)</a>, although that mostly explores homosexuality in cinema rather than just sex, so this is almost an extension of that material. I found Indie Sex to be entertaining, funny, and educational...Some may find it ""enlightening,"" but I already knew much of what was talked about. The bit about stag films was new to me though and rather surprising too.

My biggest problem with Indie Sex is how repetitive it gets. I wasn't a fan of John Cameron Mitchell's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shortbus-Unrated-Edition/dp/B000LAZDQA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shortbus (Unrated Edition)</a>&nbsp;already and it's discussed various times in different segments. This also occurs with Last Tango in Paris, almost like the filmmakers ran out of new ideas and fell back on the old ones.

Beyond that, Indie Sex is a very watchable, not-too-graphic documentary. The commentators provide some very amusing insight and besides some well-known facts scattered in here and the typical ""why is sex more controversial than violence?"" pep-talk; many will find something new and surprising by watching this. Worth checking out, for sure.
