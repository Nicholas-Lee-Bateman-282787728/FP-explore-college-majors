2564731,5,B000FGGNDC,"This style of sign carving is fantastic! The disc is well done, easily understood even by a novice woodworker. My contractor was here and watched it. He was impressed and is anxious to try this method. This is much better than your ordinary sign carving!",1173744000,10,254,4.666666666666667
2564732,5,B000FGGNDC,"This DVD is an awesome buy. Not only does it give clear, easy-to-follow instructions, but the techniques and skills taught are incredibly useful and ensure a really nice, professional-looking finished product. The visual detail is very clear thanks to the DVD quality, making it easy to see exactly how Jim Bartz carves his signs. I haven't seen these techniques anywhere else, and I've yet to carve a sign using a easier or more professional method. I certainly reccomend this to anyone of any skill level that is interested in learning how to carve a great sign that is easy to do and looks awesome. Buy this and you won't be dissapointed.",1147219200,20,641,4.783783783783784
2564757,5,B000FGGNDC,"I want to start making wooden signs and bought this DVD. As a intermediate woodworker the DVD was helpful, things were explained properly and clearly demonstrated...a good product",1351987200,,179,5.428571428571429
2564758,5,B000FGGNDC,"Frustrated with trying to find someone who could make a house sign for us, I finally decided to look into doing it myself.  I bought a letter template kit and a ""Pantograph Jig"" for doing shapes, and finally this DVD.  The DVD was ALL I needed!  It steps you though the process of using your router free-hand, and it is surprisingly easy!  I just finished my first sign (of the ""engraved"" vs ""relief"" type) and I actually did 2 because I want them to show the same on both sides.

With a little care and preparation, smooth hand, and some sort of computer to help with the template design (I used Microsoft Publisher), I turned out my sign(s) in a matter of a several hours each, which allows for designing, laying out, transferring, carving, sanding, sealing, painting, with mulitple coats and dry time on the sealers and paint.  I am thrilled with my first results.

The soft spoken Jim Bartz provides perfectly clear instruction and leaves no detail out of his straight forward and easy to follow process.  He also provides the music for the DVD which is punctuated with snowy scenes around his workshop.  Just a nice video all around.  I don't see the need for the lettering kit and pantograph that I purchased, but I will keep them just in case.  This DVD and a good plunge router is all you need.  By the way, for my signs, I used white oak from 12"" wide board stock at the Home Depot and it worked just great for my 2-sided sign.

Just a great instructional video!",1296864000,7,1471,4.464419475655431
2564759,5,B000FGGNDC,This dvd was well worth the purchase.  I picked up a lot information and techniques in sign making. Great dvd.,1281571200,4,110,4.5
2564760,3,B000FGGNDC,"I ordered this hoping to get a comprehensive video on sign making.  If you have never made any signs with a router, this is a good beginning.  Portions are very tedious with you watching the author use his router with no voice over.  This could have been shortened.  It would have been nice to have more information on pattern making, paint selection, and working in various types of wood.

It is a good basic video that will get you started.",1280966400,12,442,4.475
2564761,4,B000FGGNDC,"I really enjoy this DVD! It's fun to watch and puts you in mood to go in your workshop and get going. I like that you can actually see exactly how Jim Bartz makes relief carving. He could have spent more time covering engraved carving, but you will not be let down. Don't worry if you can't find specific software to make signs. I have been using windows power point and word pad to create fonts with ease. I find myself re-watching the dvd to learn more time and time again!",1237248000,7,475,4.230769230769231
2564762,5,B000FGGNDC,"This is an excellent source for the budding sign carver who just needs a little inside knowledge to get started. I built my own router base from 3/8"" acrlic stock and went right to work. I couldn't get the drawing program to do what the video demonstrated but I found a way around that part and got the job done.",1226275200,2,312,4.216666666666667
2564763,5,B000FGGNDC,"The video is great, he goes through everything you need to know, slowly and in a way that is easy to follow. It is however kind of corny, the scenery is beautiful, but the music is not too great, but that doesn't matter, overall, it's a very helpful video. Alot of other reviews I have read say that ""he never tells you what program he's using on the pc"". Actually he does say you can use whatever program you like, ms paint,etc, it's only important to remember that when you print out the sign, you need to select, TILE or Poster, so that the actual size prints out in different pictures. I'm envious of his shop, he has everything, what a life, make signs for a living, my dream. I recommend the video completely, all the info is presented in an easily digested manner, he does not rush anything. If your interested in creating a beautiful sign, he shows you everything you need to make it.  Buy this DVD, there is nothing else out there like it.  Thanks",1203033600,8,956,4.365168539325842
2564764,5,B000FGGNDC,"Sign Carving with your router, it is a great CD and a excelent idea. I recomend.",1193443200,2,80,4.0625
2564765,5,B000FGGNDC,"I designed my sign using the word processing program at the library, and found simple wildlife pictures in children's books to add pizzaz. I just followed the directions in the dvd and made a great sign for my Dad's birthday. My boyfriend can't believe I could do this! He is working on a design right now for his family's cabin. Great product.",1186185600,2,344,4.564516129032258
2564766,2,B000FGGNDC,"The video is very vague on specific information.  First: he uses the computer to print out the sign pattern on paper in order to trace the design on the sign.  He never mentions what software he uses to accomplish this.  Second: he talks about showing you a technique on how to avoid dropping off of the letters while carving them later on in the dvd, but never does.  Third: he never tells what type of paint to use on the signs. He does talk about the stain but never tells what name brand he uses.  Fourth: he says he is using his largest router bit to do part of the sign but never mentions what size that might be.  Just very vague.  I knew basically how to carve a sign with a router and thought this video would increase my knowledge but I was wrong.  If you have never seen this type of sign being made the dvd is good but if you want details beyond the very basics I would look somewhere else.  It reminded me of an episode of ""How its made"" on discovery channel.  The subject is glossed over.",1184716800,17,1002,4.171875
8122238,5,B000FGGNDC,Very good information some is said in YouTube or the internet cans figure it out but is nice to watch video and get the information not have to think so hard and work through the mistakes. I have made several signs now and this video made it easier to start and get it done better,1507507200,,280,4.109090909090909

8122240,5,B000FGGNDC,great dvd,1423008000,,9,4.0
8122241,4,B000FGGNDC,"Pretty well done dvd.  Price is a bit high given the amount of content, 44 minutes.  Good dvd for someone like me that hasn't done much sign making.  I would recommend it to others just getting started.",1422835200,,202,4.405405405405405
8122242,4,B000FGGNDC,"A good DVD well explained,",1413849600,,26,4.4
8122243,4,B000FGGNDC,Nice video but could have been better if he'd shown the process on more than one sign.,1413676800,,86,4.117647058823529
8122244,5,B000FGGNDC,"Well done video, looks very do-able for a neophyte woodworker.  We had a local cabinetry shop countersink the holes for the plexiglass bottom plate on our router.",1403395200,,162,5.0
8122245,5,B000FGGNDC,"VERY informative DVD.  The reviewer that wanted more information on making the pattern must be a very detailed, precise, particular person.  For the average crafter, this DVD gives you all the information you need to make really cool signs.",1398816000,,240,5.128205128205129
8122246,3,B000FGGNDC,"If you've never carved anything with a router (or even thought about it much) this video could be useful. It was fairly well-done and it did have some nice music to listen to while you watch him carve a sign, but pretty basic.  Don't get me wrong, it does have some very useful information, but it's mostly stuff that seems kind of intuitive to me -- but I've been dealing with wood and finishes for a while.  Good beginner video.",1376956800,,430,4.3625
8122247,5,B000FGGNDC,"I used this video to create a 3' x 6' sign.  To have one custom made would have cost over $1000, so I was able to save by making it.  It took a few weeks in my spare time but it turned out great.",1357084800,4,195,3.409090909090909
