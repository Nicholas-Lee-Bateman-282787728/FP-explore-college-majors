8529041,4,B008MU8ZNE,"A couple of well above average, intelligent romantic comedies, with their roots more in the indie world than in Hollywood.  Both films are funny, but it's humor based on behavior and humanity, not wild and wacky antics.  Both are well acted.  Both are not afraid of containing darker and more dramatic moments, and both have some lovely, original playful directorial and cinematic touches.

They even share (for me) the same mild weak spots in having endings that are less complex, rich and satisfying than the body of the films that precede them.

But if you're looking for a good deal on a couple of humorous stories of young love that won't insult your intelligence, that will make you smile and maybe recognize yourself, this is a strong double feature",1459468800,,756,4.829457364341085
