I only paid for this collection because I couldn't get Netflix. But if you like collecting shows on dvd than by all means buy this collection. Basically what I'm trying to say is: find a way to watch this show.",1430524800,,380,4.0131578947368425
8610999,5,B00EZWKCVG,This was a gift for my daughter for her 26th birthday. I ordered it somewhat late but was assured it would arrive on time and it SURE did. My daughter cried when she opened her package and said it was the BEST gift she could've received. She's getting her own apt and said thIs was the first thing she was going to play on her TV. I love giving gifts that make people happy so THANK YOU from the deepest part of my heart for helping me make this a memorable birthday for my lil girl. ;-),1408060800,31,487,4.030927835051546
