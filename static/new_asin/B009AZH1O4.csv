Then I got this Feels Like Christmas CD on Amazon and played it last night.  Great Christmas music and very well done.  It has a very family Christmas feel to it.  In a short time I have become totally attached to this family.  I love their harmony, violin playing, trumpet playing, Kim on the piano with her God given amazing talent.  Their singing is far more than a talent show.  They sing totally from the heart and listening to them awakes a feeling that God is very close.  Buy this DVD.  You won't be sorry.  You can also get the mp3 version  from Amazon and listen on your phone or car stereo.",1507680000,,750,4.24113475177305
