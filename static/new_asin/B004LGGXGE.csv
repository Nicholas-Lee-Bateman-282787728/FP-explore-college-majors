4401261,4,B004LGGXGE,"This features three seperate discovery dinosaur shows, two of them are from clash of the dinosaurs. One is one from the 90's or early 00's about t-rex. so i can understand why some people are unhappy with this dvd. However if you do not own 'clash of the dinosaurs' then this is a good set to get. If you do you may want to skip this one. The earlier t-rex episode features much more primitive effects because they were not as cheap or easy to do back then. the other two are from last year so they look much more effective. Still there's alot of good information in these shows and the picture quality is very good. you don't have to be a kid to enjoy learning about dinosaurs and these shows deliver in that regard.",1358812800,,717,4.279411764705882
4401262,5,B004LGGXGE,this is a greaat educational video.. I love it and so does my grandson. I've been lucky so far and got pretty good ones so far,1356739200,,126,3.8846153846153846
4401263,3,B004LGGXGE,This was bought for my son who is really into dinosaurs. He doesn't seem to like the movie as much as other movies he has.,1355702400,,122,3.92
4401264,1,B004LGGXGE,"I am at a college taking a Geology course on the Age of the dinosaurs. For our assignments we are supposed to watch three movies. I chose this movie seeming like it should be a good informational one.

Yet almost all the information they say is incorrect. The T.Rex in the media is a predator, but in reality is just a scavenger. Because of its bone sizes, the T.Rex could not run, at most is that it could walk long distances. The one thing this movie did get correct about the T.Rex is that it has bone-crushing teeth.

I wonder if anyone told them.",1350777600,,551,4.288461538461538
4401265,5,B004LGGXGE,"While there is a bit of redundancy with another DVD in the set, that's to be expected, and the redundancy helps to emphasize the point that these creatures aren't one dimensional .. they have a wide range of behaviors and capabilities. Plus the presentation is great.",1327795200,,267,4.826086956521739
4401266,5,B004LGGXGE,Great doc. 3 hours of Dinosaurs. Kids loved it!! CGI is nice. Describes how they lived. Hours of entertainment for any Dino fan!!!,1325462400,,130,4.695652173913044
4401267,3,B004LGGXGE,"Dinosaurs: Extreme Survivors is merely a repackaging of Clash of the Dinosaurs. If you already have that series on DVD, buying this one would be a waste of time and money. If you don't have this one, by all means, get it. It is entertaining and - for the general public - informative. As the title of this review implies, it's a rerun, but well worth watching if you missed it the first time around. My choice of 3 stars was a compromise meant to reflect that.",1307145600,8,460,4.2988505747126435
8434312,4,B004LGGXGE,"This DVD brings together three specials on dinosaurs.  The first, running about 40 minutes, looks at survival strategies of the young.  The herbivores relied on sheer force of numbers, the predators were more protective of their young.  The second, running about 80 minutes, investigates the theory of a prominent paleontologist, that the large predators were capable of complex social interaction and pack hunting behavior.  This theory is controversial, since it implies intelligence, and opposing views are presented.  Nonetheless, using evidence from Western Canada and Mongolia, the conclusion is that the tyrannosaurs did use the same tactics as apex predators today.  The final, running an hour, is a clinical analysis of the asteroid strike that killed off the dinosaurs.  It correctly notes that the initial impact would not have been sufficient to annihilate them, but that a subsequent increase in volcanism altered the climate enough to finish them off.",1517702400,,965,5.47972972972973
