3035152,4,B000YRY7VC,"After too long a wait, TCM follows up their excellent Forbidden Hollywood collection with another volume. Good choice of films, but I question TWO Norma Shearer films being included when Joan Crawford, Carole Lombard and other stellar ladies were passed by. Ms. Shearer is OK in small doses, but there's a reason she's been forgotten: popular in her day, time has not been kind to her hammy performances.",1206489600,,404,4.955882352941177
3035153,5,B000YRY7VC,"""FORBIDDEN  HOLLYWOOD VOL.2"" features more adult, racy early '30's dramas featuring strong actresses in potent dramatic roles that were later deemed too hot for post-production code audiences. Some of these actresses (Ruth Chatterton, Norma Shearer, Ann Dvorak) faded from the screen, but some (Barbara Stanwyck, Joan Blondell and Bette Davis) went on to have lasting careers. These discs capture those performances in mostly pristine condition. I had only seen ""Night Nurse"" with Stanwyck, Blondell and a young Clark Gable. The rest were surprises to me. Especially ""Three on a Match"" with Blondell, Ann Dvorak, Davis and a young Humphrey Bogart as ,what else, a gangster. This film is gritty and strong stuff as three young women find divergent lives with one taking a spectacular dive to oblivion. In fact, some critics at the time felt it was ""distasteful"". Both ""Night Nurse"" and ""Match"" feature children in jeopardy and ""Match"" is pretty explicit about drug addiction. This collection is highly recommended for the rare vintage films it contains. Plus the disc about the production code is very informative and surprising, especially in light of what movies contain today. And yes, all the films deal with sex as a frank fact of life and the women are just as game, or more so, as the men. Completely entertaining and well made. All of them.

3035154,5,B000YRY7VC,"NOTICE: THIS REVIEW IS ABOUT THE SET DESIGN from the movie FEMALE. THIS MOVIE IS NOT A MUSICAL. It is included in the set.

Here is a little gem for all you musical Busby Berklely Fans.

After FOOTLIGHT PARADE Came out in 1933, ""FEMALE"" was released the same year . The backyard pool is the left over set from the ""By A Waterfall"" number with Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell. Do you remember the scene from Foot light Parade when the ""natural"" forest waterfall scene is done, imagination takes flight and the pond becomes a fantastic Deco stylized pool.

Well,the backyard of Ruth Chatterton's home has THAT pool. You can recognize the pools edge by the deco style carving. There is also a ""Fountain"" that looks suspiciously like the water tower - which rotated and was about 60 feet high,at one end of the pool. (Remember the bathing beauties swinging their legs out and over the sides while the camera was overhead?). It had a stylistic ""Twig/Branch design on the Fountain's bottom edge. It is in it's collapsed state not the full 60 foot height.

I was surprised when it saw it, and got out my photo's of that scene and it IS the old set all right. Later you can see that the water tower has been raised several feet higher and is now more recognizable. The water tower is of the most iconic images in depicting the glamorous Berkeley style. It sits at one end of the pool and has water shooting out of it.

Several of the charters in the movie actually sing or hum some of the Warren/Dubin songs as if to give you hint that maybe you might overlook the pool set? Movie makers often did use set from other movies - But this one, WOW! I was thrilled to find this gem - I now know why early in the movie, the actors were doing those famous tunes.

All the reviewers missed this funny gag! But I just LOVED seeing the set used again. I'd loved to have been able to see it preserved, it must have been fantastic. I heard that people from all over the studio came to see the set as it was being built - WOW! Also  Pay attention to the fascinating Art Deco Frank Lloyd Wright's Ennis House as Alison's mansion.

3035155,4,B000YRY7VC,"Those who enjoyed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Volume-One/dp/B000I2JDF8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Volume One</a>&nbsp;of Turner Classic Movies' Forbidden Hollywood Collection will undoubtedly be thrilled by Volume Two. Before the Hays Code neutralized the sexually oriented behavior that could be shown in Hollywood movies for over three decades, there was a crop of movies that reflected a more laissez-faire attitude toward risqu subjects like promiscuity, homosexuality and drug use. Three films were presented over two discs in Volume One, and five are presented here over three discs along with a new seventy-minute documentary produced specifically for this set and aired on the TCM network.

Disc One contains two early classics starring Norma Shearer, 1930's ""The Divorcee"" (***1/2) and 1931's ""A Free Soul"" (****). Along with Garbo, Shearer was fast becoming MGM's prestige star at the time thanks to some degree to her marriage to the mythic studio head Irving Thalberg. However, she was also uniquely talented as proven by the diversity of her films. Although she is remembered today more for her later roles in the title role of 1938's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marie-Antoinette/dp/B000GRUQKG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marie Antoinette</a>&nbsp;and as the virtuous center of 1939's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Women/dp/B0008ENICU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Women</a>, Shearer plays Jerry Martin, the blazing center of ""The Divorcee"" in which she plays a carefree young wife who cheats on her husband after he carelessly cheats on her. Instead of treating her in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scarlet-Letter/dp/0743487567/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scarlet Letter</a>&nbsp;fashion, the film takes a refreshing look at the double standards between men and women when it comes to adultery. Naturally, they eventually regret their behavior but not before a lot of alcohol-fueled hell-raising with their fair-weather friends.

In comparing the two Shearer vehicles, I find ""A Free Soul"" the more interesting film because it has some sizzling dialogue from screenwriter Adela Rogers St. John and an uncommonly powerful cast that includes Clark Gable, Leslie Howard and Lionel Barrymore. She plays Rogers St. Johns' alter ego, Jan Ashe, the free-spirited daughter of an alcoholic attorney (Barrymore) who successfully defends mob leader Ace Wilfong (Gable) in a murder case that is eerily prescient of the O.J. Simpson criminal trial. Jan gets hot and steamy over Ace, even though she is engaged to the socially acceptable Dwight (Howard). The inevitable complications occur with alcohol abuse, gambling and murder. Although not a natural temptress like Garbo, Shearer manages to imbue her role with an effective carnality mixed with her innate nobility. Gable was in his sinister period, while Barrymore pulls out the stops as her father, especially in the climactic murder trial scene. As an indication of public acceptance of these racy films, Barrymore won an Oscar for his role here, as did Shearer for ""The Divorcee"".

Disc Two is a Warner Brothers double-header with the studio feeling like the working class cousin to the glossier MGM. Both films barely run an hour, and not a scene is wasted in these fast-moving vehicles. The first is 1932's ""Three on a Match"" (****), which follows three schoolmates over the course of a dozen years. Joan Blondell plays Mary Keaton, the dropout who goes to reform school for her wild ways; a bottle-blonde Bette Davis plays class valedictorian Ruth Wescott who becomes a stenographer; and the forgotten Ann Dvorak plays popular Vivian Revere who marries a wealthy lawyer and has a son. Directed by Mervyn LeRoy, the film is most intriguing for the way the plot twists the characters' fates. In a very early role, Davis barely registers as Ruth, but Blondell is terrifically likable showing how Mary turns her life around. Bearing a striking resemblance to Luise Rainer, Dvorak gets the meatiest role as Vivian as she descends from bored socialite to unrepentant cocaine addict. It's a mesmerizing turn capped by a shocking finale. A very young Humphrey Bogart shows up in a minor role as what else, a gangster.

The second half of Disc Two is 1933's ""Female"" (****), the most intriguing of the five films as it manages to be a sociological statement as well as a romantic comedy. Directed by Michael Curtiz, it centers on Alison Drake, the powerful CEO of an automobile company. There is great fun watching her order her subservient male staff around like a drill sergeant and using them for inappropriate conjugal visits at her palatial estate to satisfy her desires. Naturally, she meets her match in auto designer Jim Thorne first in a meet-cute situation and then in a battle of wills at the company. Ruth Chatterton (the selfish wife in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dodsworth/dp/B00005PJ6U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dodsworth</a>) is wonderfully game as Alison, while the usually bland George Brent (her real-life husband at the time) complements her well as Jim. The ending is trite but inevitable. Pay attention to the fascinating Art Deco set decorations, including the use of Frank Lloyd Wright's Ennis House as Alison's mansion.

Disc Three contains 1931's ""Night Nurse"" (***1/2), a tense melodrama starring Barbara Stanwyck in the title role as Lora Hart assigned to take care of the two young daughters in a wealthy family. However, she uncovers a plot hatched by their alcoholic mother to kill the girls in order to steal their trust funds with the assistance of a nasty chauffeur and a corrupt doctor. Directed by William Wellman, the movie features several risqu moments with Stanwyck and pal Joan Blondell dressing and undressing in their uniforms, as well as moments of unexpected violence. Again, Clark Gable shows up in a sinister role as the chauffeur and slaps Stanwyck around with convincing malevolence. While I prefer her work in 1933's ""Baby Face"" on Volume One, no one shined more than Stanwyck in these pre-code films since her non-nonsense manner was a perfect fit for the era's candor and directness.

The 2008 documentary on Disc Three, ""Thou Shalt Not: Sex, Sin and Censorship in Pre-Code Hollywood"" (****1/2), offers a fascinating overview of the pre-code period before 1934 when the Legion of Decency helped bring about strict adherence to the Hays Code. It offers plenty of clips from both famous and obscure films of the period including those on the Forbidden Hollywood Collection. Some are surprising such as scenes cut from 1933's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-Kong/dp/B00003CXAW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King Kong</a>, one where the giant ape strips the gown off Fay Wray and another where people are literally eaten and crushed. My favorite is the nude sequence with a body double for Maureen O'Sullivan swimming provocatively with Johnny Weissmuller in 1934's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tarzan-and-His-Mate/dp/6302120438/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tarzan and His Mate</a>. Several people provide comments including the late Jack Valenti (who developed the film rating system still in use today), social critic Camille Paglia and director John Landis. As for extras, film historians Jeffrey Vance and Tony Maietta provide informative and often enthusiastic commentary tracks for ""The Divorcee"" and ""Night Nurse"". The original theatrical trailers are included for ""Three on a Match"", ""Female"" and ""Night Nurse"".",1204588800,20,7744,5.879111111111111
3035156,5,B000YRY7VC,"The announcement of the second set of the Forbidden Hollywood series is welcome. The set falls neatly into 2 groups - the MGM pair and the Warners trio.

The former are well mounted up-market A pictures with the prestigious Norma Shearer. Shearer was the wife of MGM wonderboy producer Irving Thalberg and his management of her limited talent was masterful. Both films carefully showcase her in ""modern"" stories of liberated women with attitudes to sex which were scandalous in 1930.

- In ""The Divorcee"", Shearer won the best actress Oscar playing a woman who divorces her husband because he is unfaithful then proceeds to ""liberate"" herself with other men. The film is a very early talkie with all the associated limitations - stagy, endless talk and some corny acting, including a very mannered Shearer. The disk contains a commentary which notes these limitations, particularly Shearer's.
- ""A Free Soul"" enhanced Shearer's reputation as THE prototype of the sexually liberated woman in this tale of a woman whose fiance, Leslie Howard, murders her lover, a very raunchy Clark Gable. Lionel Barrymore won an Oscar for his performance as Shearer's lawyer father and deservedly so. This is a much better film than ""The Divorcee"", demonstrating how quickly Hollywood progressed with talkies - better direction, photography, recording and acting. The story is really interesting with some great twists and Shearer is generally less mannered and accordingly much more effective than the earlier film. She also wears some of the best clothes ever seen on the screen, transforming her dumpy figure into a svelte and sexy one.

The remaining trio reflect Warner's assembly line approach to film making at the time and have shorter running times and faster pace.

- ""Night Nurse"" is a sordid tale starring the relentless Barbara Stanwyck as a nurse, with great support from Joan Blondell and a particularly nasty Clark Gable whose star quality is impossible to ignore. Stanwyck and Blondell seem to be constantly stripping for the camera and there are some great lines. Blondell says ""I used to  worry that the hospital would burn down. Now I have to watch myself with matches"".
- ""Three on a Match"" is a very short film which moves with lightening speed. It stars the luminous Ann Dvorak as a bored wife, the reliable Blondell as the heart-of-gold showgirl and an attractive but subdued Bette Davis as a secretary/nanny of all things. The women, who were childhood friends, renew acquaintance at lunch and light their cigarettes with one match, a superstition with ominous consequences. The film's plot involves kidnapping, a subject taken straight from the headlines in 1932, and covers sex and drugs and rock 'n roll, well jazz anyway. Note also the array of great players in supporting or cameo roles, some unbilled - Glenda Farrell in the reform school, Humphrey Bogart as a particularly vicious gangster, Allen Jenkins as one of the gang, Edward Arnold as the head of the kidnappers, Frankie Darro as as a schoolboy and Anne Shirley, billed as Dawn O'Day, playing Dvorak as a child.
- ""Female"" is the oddest film in the bunch because it stars the sophisticated and dry Ruth Chatterton, a polished diva probably more suited to MGM gloss than gritty Warner's realism. Chatterton plays a business woman competing in a man's world until she meets her nemesis George Brent. The pre-code aspects of the film relate to Chatterton placing her sex life in a compartment with a string of lovers on call, but no time for true love. It is surprising. The film is very funny at times and Brent, who was married to Chatterton at the time, is excellent.

The prints of all the films are good enough, with ""Three on a Match"" particularly mint. The Warners group contain the original trailers. The set includes a first rate documentary on the pre-code era which neatly captures the intrigue of this short period as talkies evolved. The documentary, produced by TCM, largely confines itself to the products of MGM and Warners which of course are the TCM libraries. ""Night Nurse"" contains an entertaining commentary shared between 2 relaxed historians.

It is worth noting that the stars of all of these films are women, like the previous Forbidden Hollywood Series. The Hays Code curtailed the actions and attitudes of women, taking them out of the bedroom and boardroom and placing them back in the kitchen and lounge. For men, nothing really changed much. By the way, that's Bette Davis, who was very attractive in those days, on the cover.",1196985600,61,4525,4.9696169088507265
3035157,5,B000YRY7VC,"I just read about the release of Volume 2 of this great series featuring Pre-Code film.  This volume will be released just in time for several Pre-code Film Festivals in my city.  I was especially excited to see my favorite, Clark Gable, in two pictures: as the wonderfully wicked mobster, Ace Wilfong, who manhandles his mistress, Norma Shearer, in A Free Soul; and the equally evil chauffer, Nick, who is poisoning his employer's children to take control of their trust funds and inheritance from their drunken mother and belting the kid's nurse, Barbara Stanwyck, for meddling in his plans in Night Nurse.
The Pre-Code era was rich with incredible films.  It is amazing what was allowed in these movies of the early thirties.  Before the Code came in on July 1, 1934, women enjoyed their sexuality, took lovers, kicked out cheating husbands, went to work, and slept their way to the top.  Men were dangerous; crime paid, and cracking wise was a way of life.  After the Code, the genie was stuffed back in the bottle....women were pushed back into their kitchens, crime never paid, sin was either repented before the last reel or punishment (even death) was the final reward.  (Check out Jimmy Cagney's character's demise in Public Enemy.)
I can't wait to own these fascinating films of the Pre-Code era.  Check them out for yourself........you'll be very surprised what your grandparents and great-grandparents were watching (or even up to) back in the early thirties.",1195603200,16,1471,4.951219512195122
3035158,5,B000YRY7VC,"March will mark the release of some PreCode gems on this Forbidden Hollywood set, in particular for Norma Shearer fans.

""The Divorcee"" (1930).  Ms. Shearer's Academy award winning performance as Jerry in the role her husband, Irving Thalberg, initially thought she wasn't sexy enough to play (a few wonderfully seductive portraits, courtesy of Mr. Hurrell were enough to prove his doubts had no basis) is excellent.  Great minor role by her future leading man, Robert Montgomery, as well.

""A Free Soul"" (1931).  Ms. Shearer is Jan Ashe; Mr. Lionel Barrymore (in his Academy Award winning role) is her alcoholic, lawyer father, Stephen Ashe.  Young Clark Gable made his cinematic bones with his role as mob heavy Ace Wilfong.  For those who've only known Norma for ""Marie Antoinette"" and ""The Women"", be prepared for an entirely different actress. Ms. Shearer, resplendent in her erotic white gown, is pure bombshell.

""Night Nurse"" (1931).  Barbara Stanwyck was at her best in PreCodes (though I think ""Illicit"" is a better film) and Joan Blondell packs a punch as her nurse friend.  This film has a plot to kill children, a nymphomanical mother, drug references and Clark Gable mobbing up again as Nick, the chauffeur.

""Three on a Match""(1932).  Anne Dvorak, Joan Blondell and Bette Davis play the three ladies who share the karmic match. One's a bad girl who turns her life around (Blondell); another one is a good girl who remains true to her goodness (Bette Davis); the third has all the luck, money and  the love of a faithful husband (Dvorak), but throws it all away for booze, drugs and shady men.  Humphrey Bogart, also making his start as a mob heavy, plays her connection/kidnapper, Harve while the charming Warren Williams plays her abandoned husband, Robert.

""Female"" (1933). The exceptionally talented Ruth Chatterton plays Alison Drake, president of a successful automobile factory, with a penchant for having trysts with her male secretaries and promptly transferring them to the company's Canadian office. Enter George Brent (Ms. Chatterton's husband off-screen at the time) as designer Jim Thorn and the sparks begin.

Commentary, trailers and a new documentary make this a must-own for fans of Pre-Code cinema. Let's get working on set 3, why don't we?  Classic film fans (myself included) are only glad to spend those preorder dollars for Pre-Code releases.",1195516800,169,2380,5.108527131782946
3035159,5,B000YRY7VC,"A little over a year after the release of volume one, Warner Home Video is finally giving us volume 2 of its Forbidden Hollywood series. There are supposedly to be two releases of this series a year from this point forward. Included in this set are:
a. Five films instead of the three in volume one.
b. Commentaries for two of the films.
c. A new documentary on the precode genre.

The films included are:

""The Divorcee"" (1930) and ""A Free Soul"" (1931). These two films feature great performances from Norma Shearer. In ""The Divorcee"" she plays a wife who discovers her husband has cheated on her. When confronted he admits what he did but insists it meant nothing. However, he has a different attitude when Norma does the same with hubby's best friend (Robert Montgomery). The two divorce and Norma enters into a long string of ill-fated affairs. Shearer won Best Actress for her performance.
In ""A Free Soul"" alcoholic attorney Stephen Ashe (Lionel Barrymore) and his daughter Jan (Norma Shearer) have always lived a lifestyle of which the rest of their socialite family disapproved. Stephen has always taught his daughter to go her own way and not pay attention to what other people think. Now this may be good advice when it has to do with priggish conventions rooted in tradition rather than right and wrong. However, what Stephen has failed to point out to Jan is that people also generally think it is a bad idea to walk into a busy intersection blind-folded, and just because this is a majority opinion does not make it a convention ripe for the testing. Thus, completely blindfolded, Jan walks into the busy intersection that is the world of gangster Ace Wilfong (Clark Gable), a murderer that her father has recently managed to get acquitted in one of his more sober moments. Stephen Ashe is faced with a parent's worst nightmare - he has given his daughter what turns out to be very bad advice, and she has not only listened but followed it. Barrymore won a Best Actor Oscar for his performance.
DVD Special Features:
The Divorcee commentary by Jeffrey Vance and Tony Maietta

""Three on a Match"" (1932) and ""Female"" (1933) are on the second disk.
""Three on a Match"" stars Ann Dvorak, Joan Blondell, and Bette Davis as three girls who grow up together but go very different ways. However, as adults they reunite for lunch one day and from that moment their lives intertwine once again, this time resulting in tragedy. Dvorak plays a woman whose narcissism she has confused as a bent for the romantic, Blondell plays the woman with a jaded past but a good heart, and Davis is in the background as a reliable Girl Friday type.
""Female"" stars Ruth Chatterton as the sexually liberated manager of an automobile factory. However, she meets her match in inventor Jim Thorne (George Brent). A kind of ""Taming of the Shrew"" meets Ernst Lubitsch, although Lubitsch himself had nothing to do with this film. If you can ignor the improbability that a woman would ever be able to reach this position in management in the 1930's while so flaunting convention, this is a very enjoyable little movie.
DVD Special Features:
Theatrical trailers for both films

""Night Nurse"" (1931) and the precode documentary are on disk three.
""Night Nurse"" stars Barbara Stanwyck, one of the queens of the precodes, in a film that is more of a depression era crime/mystery film than anything with some precode bits thrown in. Unlike ""Baby Face"", here Stanwyck is using her toughness more than her sexuality. She plays a nurse on the night shift who ends up caring for two wealthy children who are being systematically starved by an evil chauffeur (Clark Gable) so that he can marry the childrens' mother and grab their trust funds. Stanwyck faces indifference on all fronts, and is helped out by a bootlegger friend (Ben Lyon) in her effort to save the children.

3035160,5,B000YRY7VC,"This is a fine set of DVDs that needs to be cherished by all fans who like movies of pre-code era and the golden age of Hollywood. These are some of the best movies that came out of the studios. My favorite in this set is the movie Divorcee (1930) starring Norma Shearer

Divorcee (1930)

Norma Shearer shines like a star in this pre-code film of 1930. This is one of the early pre-code films that test the nerves of Hays office that would later police the morality depicted in Hollywood films. Jerry (Norma Shearer) and Ted (Chester Morris) are happily married couple until their anniversary, when Jerry discovers that Ted is unfaithful to her. When confronted he dismisses it as ""it doesn't mean a thing."" In a hurtful mood, she responds with her own one night stand. One of the prominent features of this film is that not only discusses very openly the double standards in judging women with regards to morality but Shearer offers an outstanding performance as a married woman who is hurt and angry. Rightfully so, the Academy honored her with an award in the best actress category.

The movie has a bit of history, when MGM was seriously considering Joan Crawford for the role, Shearer placed a bid on it. But her own husband and MGM executive Irving Thalberg thought she is not glamorous for the role, but after seeing her publicity shots made with photographer George Hurrell, he agreed to cast her in the movie. This caused a serious rift with Joan Crawford who was very interested in this project. The story is based on the novel Ex-Wife by Ursula Parrott, which was directed by Robert Z. Leonard

Female (1933)

Female (1933) starring Ruth Chatterton is my second favorite movie from this set. The story is about Alison Drake (Ruth Chatterton) is the wealthy owner a large automobile company, and she uses her wealth to have affairs with much younger men and some are her own employees, until she meets a man who is not too impressed with her money.

A Free Soul (1931)

A Free Soul is a 1931 Pre-Code film which tells the story of an alcoholic defense attorney who has to defend his daughter's ex-boyfriend on a charge of murdering the mobster she had started a relationship with. A Free Soul is drama that casts top stars of the day which includes; Norma Shearer, Leslie Howard, Lionel Barrymore, and Clark Gable.",1415318400,,2324,4.6536585365853655

BUT, last year the first disc's coating started to turn into muck, making it unreadable and now the second disc is also unreadable although there is not a scratch on the surface.

3035177,1,B000YRY7VC,"I purchased this set one year ago from a Barnes and Nobel store. It was brand new, with the cellophane wrap. I got it home and tried to watch all the films, but Disc 1 (""The Divorcee"" and ""A Free Soul"") had some kind of viscous residue on it. When you look at it, it looks like an oily film on the underside of the disc, and when you take it out it hardens and makes the disc virtually unwatchable. (It will freeze, stutter, etc.) So, I saw it for cheap on Amazon.com a few days ago and decided to purchase it again, in order to complete the first set I bought. But this set too, had the same issue. I called TCM about it, and they hadn't heard of the problem -- but clearly it's defective. (Two separate buys, one year apart, from two completely different stores.) Still in the middle of trying to find a resolution as I write this review. Hopefully, this helps any of you wanting to buy the set. The other two discs play fine, and if you do purchase at a store, make sure to open it first. The films themselves are wonderful and some of the best pre-code cinema out there.

UPDATE: Have yet to hear from TCM or receive any information on how to get a new disc. For the folks who seemed to find this unhelpful (for whatever reason) -- why do you think that both the other sets hover at around $30-to-$40, while this set is constantly being discounted at $14-to-$18 around the holidays? TCM knows it's defective, and are trying to unload what they have. Not cool. I've never had an issue with any of their other products, and still will buy certain items. (I've pre-ordered their Carole Lombard set due out in 2013.) But it's disappointing that such a reputable company would sell this the way it is, without providing any response, any compensation, or alternative. Film lovers who spend tons of cash every year deserve better, and for that matter, Norma Shearer deserves better too. I've posted this same concern at the official TCM.com site, in the hopes of keeping film buyers from losing money, but shamefully they never allow the review to appear. (Note: See two-star review here at Amazon.com from buyer named ""Bernie L. Hulme"". Sounds like that person is having the same issue too. In fact, read the 10 other customers' responding to ""Bernie's"" comments: [...] They all note the same problem with disc one.)

LAST UPDATE: As of March 5, 2013, I have called and talked with various Amazon.com sellers of ""Forbidden Hollywood: Vol. II"", asking each to look at their Disc 1, and if it is indeed good, I will buy the set. So far, I'm 5-of-5, with each seller (thankfully honest), saying that once they took a close look, that their Disc 1's have the same problem as stated above. In other words, the likelihood of your set not being defective is very very low. Sorry to say it, but hopefully it keeps you from purchasing this set that TMC is clearly looking to ditch on unsuspecting buyers. So disappointing TMC does this to people, without offering the slightest acknowledgement. Best wishes everyone, and keep watching Pre-Code film.

The comments on marriage are still true.  ""A Free Soul"" is a great melodrama with Shearer, Clark Gable, Lionel Barrymore, & Leslie Howard.  Daring then, dated now, but still fun.  (I always try to watch a film from the perspective of the time when it was made.). ""Night Nurse"" is a Warner Bros hard hitting film with a tough Barbara Stanwyck, Joan Blondell, & Clark Gable in a small part.

""Three On A Match"" in about an hour contains incidents from true events at the time the film was made.  Ann Dvorak (another under appreciated actress) is terrific!

3035180,5,B000YRY7VC,"Some of these films I have been dying to see since I was a kid.  As a film fan, I always wanted to see films where actors had won Oscars such as Norma Shearer for both The Divorcee and A Free Soul and these films were unavailable for television and in poor shape.  I also loved Clark Gable and Barbara Stanwyck and made it a point to try to watch all their films.  The silents and early talkies were usually not shown and I wasn't able to see them.  Now with this collection, I am watching The Divorcee, A Free Soul, and Night Nurse for the first time.  They are wonderful!  The Divorcee is a landmark film in which a married woman answers her husband's infidelity with infidelity of her own but it's not the same to HIM.  A Free Soul stars Norma Shearer as a wealthy young woman with an alcoholic father who encourages her to be a free soul until she gets herself into a little sexual trouble.  Night Nurse is played by Barbara Stanwyck who takes a job and vows to be a dutiful nurse until she realizes that breaking some rules are in the best interests of her patients.  The film Female is a movie I had never heard of until this year.  A woman runs a business like a man but in the end must settle for not being in charge and being subservient if she is to marry and have lots of babies.  Still until the end, the character is a great depiction of a strong liberated woman.  Three on a Match is great film about 3 women who attend elementary school together and end up with different lives as adults.  The one headed for boarding school goes the wrong way, the one who ended up in reform school, becomes successful and the one who went on to vocational school finds a good job.

3035181,2,B000YRY7VC,"This package of films represents the triumph of merchandising over merchandise. If you imagine they might represent revolutionary or daring film-making, otherwise lost to us because of a blinkered, art-crushing censor, forgot it. That's just the sales pitch of the 'forbidden Hollywood' tease.

The films you'll find here are conventional, melodramatic, improbable and distinguished neither by their scriptwriting nor acting. Norma Shearer was a big name star, and she has definite presence, but I do not think the two films featuring her on this set advance her claims to greatness. They tend to confirm - as critics have noted - that she was an actress who got ahead by hard work and will-power rather than a tutored dramatic craft-skill. Shearer sometimes acted by assembling gestures, the way she thought a scene should be acted, rather than from character, and was prone to histrionics.

None of these films is memorable or truly worthy of preservation. At best, they might be regarded as curiosities: 'forgettable Hollywood' perhaps. The nonsense of suggesting that something other than a prurient sexual element enters into the productions is driven home most forcibly by the film 'Female', which gives us the character of a woman running a motor vehicle corporation who discovers she is 'just playing a part' and, to be herself, must find a man, hand over the business to him and have his babies.

3035183,5,B000YRY7VC,"The five films considered separately, I'd give three stars once and four and five stars twice each. But is has to be honored that these pre code films are available in good quality, with subtitles and accompanied by a fascinating documentary and audio commentaries for ""Night Nurse"" and ""The Divorcee"". This is what makes me give a five star rating for the entire box. The following may be said to the films:

1. Female (1933, 60 minutes, Warner, dir.: M. Curtiz, starring Ruth Chatterton, co-starring George Brent): She's rich. She's powerful. She's seductive. She runs an automobile company and dominates any man she wants - in business and in bed. She's on the man hunt, taking men as sexual objects and pure trophies, to be hired and fired. This is clearly pre code, hard, fast and beautiful... but why must this wild animal be tamed by someone who declares with a total lack of irony that women are by nature born for love, marriage and children?!? Fascinating film with an unbearable ending, but the first 50 of about 60 minutes are that fresh and witty that I'd still give a four star rating.

2. Three on a Match (1932, 63 minutes, Warner, dir.: Mervyn LeRoy, starring Ann Dvorak and Joan Blondell, co-starring Bette Davis and Warren William, featuring Humphrey Bogart): Interesting film about three (female) schoolmates who meet again about ten years later - you'll see a fine little drama about what women can expect from life and from men (and what they can't expect), where Dvoraks adultery will at the end be punished, but the film doesn't condemn her: Women also have a right to strive to happiness, and they have a right to miss something even if their husbands are gentle, kind, loving, noble and wealthy (as is William in the role of Dvoraks husband). This very short and fast-moving film is full of deliberately realistic"", fresh down-to-earth-dialogue instead of MGM-polishing, and with many relations to actual events and trends in American History from 1919 to 1932, often shown by newspaper headlines or some semi-documentary footage. Even an allusion to Mussolini is made! The whole movie is a vivid proof for Warner being the studio for realistic sociocritical dramas instead of creating a polished world of its own (as did MGM). Five stars.

3. Night Nurse (1931, 72 minutes, Warner, dir.: William Wellman, starring Barbara Stanwyck, co-starring Clark Gable, Joan Blondell): Thrilling sociocritical drama about nurses' lives under hard conditions, due to prohibition, depression, cynicism, and hypocrisy of some of the doctors. Finally, Stanwyck will need all her courage to prevent two little kids from being slowly murdered by underfeeding. She undoubtedly is the best actress to succeed, sometimes very energetic (but never overacting), sometimes just with a silent facial expression which tells both Gable (as the villain) and the public that this tough lady is just overwhelming. The best movie in the entire collection. Five stars.

4. A Free Soul (1931, Metro, 93 minutes, dir.: Clarence Brown, starring Norma Shearer, co-starring Lionel Barrymore, Clark Gable, Leslie Howard): Drama about a young woman between three men, two of them being potential love interests and one being her father who taught her to be ""A Free Soul"" - but who won't get along with her being in love with a gangster (Clark Gable). Interesting story, but spoiled by some absolutely silly goofs (such as a man not being killed by machine gun fire although sitting just behind a thin wooden wall) and many pathetic talking, static camerawork and exaggerated mannerisms by Shearer (sometimes) and Barrymore (ALWAYS - his performance is the worst overacting I've ever seen, making Robert De Niro a master of understatement). Three stars.

5. The Divorcee (1930, Metro, 82 minutes, dir.: Robert Z. Leonard, starring Norma Shearer): It's quite better than ""A Free Soul""! Shearer has, in some scenes, her mannerisms, obviously imported from the silent era, but she is touching and courageous in most scenes - and so is the script which even advocates sexual equality in adultery!!! Men, and particularly Shearer's husband, are shown as infantile machos, and Shearer clearly points it out, for which we may love her. The last ten minutes, however, are pure clich&eacute;, and the audio commentary is absolutely right in stating that the film is very well written and deserved its Oscar nomination for best script - but not because of the last scenes. Nevertheless, I'd give a four star rating.",1265155200,7,4491,5.047169811320755

The installation of sound cameras made the films less cinematic, but stronger in pace and plot.
The Divorcee, with Norma Shearer is a good example of exploring different roles, and displaying society with the flaws that did and still do exist in human relationships.
The moralists, usually Catholics, of the time would have hated such aberrations of the norm, and after they took hold when the economy recovered, art as daring as this took a nosedive, as the limits put on freedom of expression took hold.
Unfortunatley these self-appointed guardians are still out there.
The fact that this collection of gems are not rated reveals how purile their rantings were, and still are today.

3035187,5,B000YRY7VC,"There were a few years in movie making when sound was first introduced but the Production Codes had not yet been in force.  These codes would severely limit the ability of movies to depict the real world:  sex, violence and corruption were toned down - often to the point of sheer blandness.  Crime could never pay, authority figures were always forces of good and even married couples were confined to twin beds.  There were those few years, however, from the late-1920s to 1934 which was known as the pre-Code era, a period that offered films that would be much more daring than the movies of just a few years later.

TCM's set, Forbidden Hollywood Collection, Volume Two, showcases five such pre-Code movies.  On the first of three discs are a pair of Norma Shearer films.  In The Divorcee, she won an Oscar as a wife who discovers that her husband had an affair.  Although he assures her it means nothing, it is an obvious hypocrisy that's exposed when she balances the books with an affair of her own.  In A Free Soul, she defiantly has a fling with gangster Clark Gable, only to discover that the relationship will have unintended complications.  Lionel Barrymore, playing her alcoholic father, won an Oscar for his role and Gable's performance would help transform him from a supporting player into a star.

On Disc Two, there is Three on a Match and Female.  The former is a story of three schoolmates who meet in adulthood.  Joan Blondell is the bad girl turned good, Ann Dvorak is the good girl turned bad, and Bette Davis is somewhere in the middle.  This movie features an early gangster role by Humphrey Bogart.  Female has Ruth Chatterton as the driven owner of an auto company.  She works hard by day and chooses various male employees to be her playthings at night.  It's a fine arrangement until she meets George Brent as the one man who resists her charms.

Finally, on Disc Three, Barbara Stanwyck is the Night Nurse, a woman from the wrong side of the tracks who betters herself by becoming a nurse.  Unfortunately, the ethics of the profession compel her to look the other way when she sees malpractice, but she'll put what's right above what's required.  Clark Gable is in one of his most villainous roles as a thuggish chauffeur out to kill a couple children.  The resolution of this one would involve an act that would never be allowed under the Code.

Also on the third disc is a nice documentary called Thou Shalt Not:  Sex, Sin and Censorship in Pre-Code Hollywood.  This feature describes more fully what this era meant to film, and what it meant when it ended.  One thing that stands out is that this was a time where actresses could have juicy roles, a heyday for Blondell, Davis, Stanwyck and Shearer as well as folks like Crawford, Hepburn and Loy.  The Code with its ""family values"" agenda would pigeonhole the women into much more limited roles.

All these movies are well-made and relatively short: the longest (A Free Soul) runs 93 minutes and Female is just an hour.  With the documentary and a couple commentaries (on The Divorcee and Night Nurse), this is a wonderful set that will not only entertain, but serve as a reminder as to what the Production Code took away from movie making.",1219536000,12,3224,4.648409893992933

there are three additions to the collection, which is also accompanied by a nice new documentary titled 'thou shalt not' that make worth the price.  the first is 'three on a match', which stars the now-obscure ann dvorak as a bored socialite, and joan blondell and bette davis as her childhood friends.  dvorak's character has the life her friends aspire to--a rich powerful husband (warren william) and sumptuous digs on park avenue (or whereever rich white people lived in warners film of the 1930s).  but she doesn't appreciate any of it and abandons it all for a fling with a handsome loser (lyle talbot). blondell and davis acquire all dvorak leaves behind to pursue sexual escapades. and as they rise, dvorak sinks lower, until she winds up a cocaine addict that must sacrifice her life to save her little boy.

this film is tight and features the neatest montage sequences at the beginning!

then, there's 'female', a true find!  'female' is way, way ahead of its 1933 release date.  allison, played by ruth chatterton, is a high-powered auto-plant exec with a sharp mind, a great orry-kelly wardrobe and a sexual rapaciousness equal only to hugh hefner's. she plucks her boy toys from the factory and when she tires of them, she transfers them to canada! canada in 1933 must have been a lonely place.

'female' shows its timelessness when allison plucks a handsome stud that would fain worship her as a goddess--in other words, he's gay as a ukelele! then, as she seduces another, successfully with chilled vodka and pillows in front of the fire, she wears a gown that is a dead ringer for the gown cate blanchett wore to the 1999 oscar ceremony. all it needs is a painted hummingbird on the back.

of course, allison must realize a woman is nothing without a strong man so the film sinks at the very end but that's minor.

third but not last, is the documentary 'thou shalt not', which examines pre-code hollywood film product.  the biggest revelation is to see jeanne eagels in a clip from the 1929 version of 'the letter'.  this is priceless.  eagels was more than intense--she was jennifer jason leigh at her most manic.  tcm must show this version in its entirety soon.",1211155200,6,2417,4.746411483253588

Some things never change. The best of the bunch is The Divorcee, the film that is considered the official kick-off of the pre-Code era. Norma Shearer won an Oscar for Best Actress as a woman who decides to match her cheating husband tryst for tryst after catching him husband in a compromising position. The phenomenal critical and financial success of the picture led other studios to try topping it, and soon almost every actress in Hollywood was required to sin. And repent. The sensational series of films that emerged helped Hollywood survive its economic crisis and moviegoers enjoy the vicarious thrills the films provided. The era came to an abrupt close beginning July 1, 1934, when Catholic watchdog groups threatened boycotts of all films and the Church established the Legion of Decency to monitor movies. Studio heads bowed to the pressure and the era of censorship began, lasting until the establishment of the industry's rating system in 1968.",1210118400,7,1379,5.216216216216216

3035194,3,B000YRY7VC,"This was an enjoyable set overall and an interesting look at the short films churned out by Hollywood in the heydey (meaning talkies) of its pre-code era. ""Three on a Match"" was the strongest of this set (though not without its problems), ""Night Nurse"" the weakest (I just never could figure out what the heck was going on), not to mention Clark Gable and George Brent look ridiculous without their moustaches (and I hate moustaches, but the absence of facial hair didn't hinder these early talkies).

CAUTION: SPOILERS AHEAD!

** The Divorcee (with Norma Shearer): I will never understand the stupidity of people who will get into a car with a drunk person. I felt terribly sorry for the woman whose face was disfigured from the accident (we only see her wearing a black hat that totally covers her face, how she sees where she`s going, I don`t know) and who the driver married out of duty and because he couldn't have Norma Shearer.

I didn't have any respect for Norma's cheating husband in this, who says it shouldn't matter [to his wife] because it didn't mean a thing, but when Norma sleeps with said admirer, her husband can't take it.

I say, she is better off without him, though I was disappointed in her that she slept with her admirer that night out of revenge. It made me less sympathetic to her character. She should have just let her husband believe she had let another man touch her--she would have gotten the same result without debasing herself.

One thing I hated (or rather three things) were the close-ups of Miss Shearer's and her various suitors' hands (not to mention the men had laughably bad foreign accents) to show how Miss Shearer was getting around after her divorce (though it is implied that she doesn't sleep with any of them because one of the men calls the ring he has just given her platonic--I get the impression these are rich old geezers who just want a young chick on their arm to take to shows, etc.).

Miss Shearer is a tease who cannot bring herself to have casual sex. Sleeping with the DUI guy was a mistake (for she did regret it the morning after) she made when she vulnerable and her sorrow was still raw.

Norma's husband did apologize at the end when she tracks him down in Paris (why she can't find someone else, I don't know--I say start fresh), realizing he is the only man she has ever really loved, and they get back together. I was annoyed when she said she should have fought harder for her marriage when he was the one who cheated on her. He was the one who should have bent down and begged for her forgiveness instead of saying she was being silly because ""it didn't mean a thing"".

But, these kinds of films were a product of the times and it's funny because this kind of thinking would never go over today. Unlike many people my age (I'm twenty-six), it's interesting to go back and watch these films and appreciate them, even if we do not agree with them. It's sickening most people today have probably not even watched a movie pre-dating the Hippie Movement and think all silent films are boring because they have to actually read something.

** A Free Soul (with Norma Shearer, Clark Gable and Lionel Barrymore): Either Norma Shearer's character had dual personalities or her part wasn't well written, but she acted like a totally different girl with Gable than she did around her father (and she did act pretty amorous toward her pop, calling him darling, dear, and ruffling his hair--Ick!).

Ashley Wilkes, I mean Leslie Howard, is given another thankless role (I would never kill anyone just to save some trollop's reputation, but then, his doing that finally made her love him, so I guess he got what he wanted in the end, not to mention his freedom...with Lionel's help).

I really don't think Miss Shearer was all that much in love with Gable if she was willing to give him up (her idea) to get her father to stop drinking, but then maybe my perception is skewed--perhaps that shows just how much she cared for her father.

""Free Soul"" is father/daughter love story until the end, and the moral of this story? Father really does know best.

*** Three on a Match (with Ann Dvorak, a dark, mysterious beauty, a pudgy Joan Blondell and platinum-haired (a la Jean Harlow) Bette Davis when she was still young and lovely; also Anne Shirley (billed as Dawn O'Day), who had not yet developed her understated beauty):

The three leading ladies were excellent, and though the little moppet playing Dvorak's son is cute as can be, he's just too cutesy (he's the little boy version of Shirley Temple) for this film. His talents would have been better suited to a movie like ""National Velvet"" playing one of Elizabeth Taylor's rambunctious brothers.

I also found indicating the passage of time using newspapers hackneyed. Sometimes just flashing the year in the next frame will suffice.

I never really understood Ann Dvorak's motivations (why did she want to take the kid along?)--I am guessing she was just one of those people who is never satisfied (and they`re usually the ones who have everything, as Dvorak did in this case). I didn't have any sympathy for her character till the end, and you'll see why when you see it. It would have made more sense for Bette Davis to have taken Dvorak's place than for Joan Blondell, as Bette was slim and youthful-looking whereas Joan looks worn-down and is slightly overweight, but then, I guess Dvorak's husband was looking for something different than his ex-wife.

The ending was totally unexpected and really quite shocking. The only thing I'll say is that Dvorak managed to redeem herself in the end, and it was only then I felt sympathetic to her character.

As for Bette Davis, she really isn't given much to do except show some leg (which she does well), but this is really Dvorak's vehicle, who really could have been Miss Anne Shirley all grown up.

*** Female (with Ruth Chatterton and George Brent): This was going good until Mrs. George Brent in real life (at least for a couple of years--Miss Chatterton divorced her first husband and married Brent the next day) decides she's just a woman. I could see her really falling in love with the one man who won't bed her at her whim, but to totally change character was jarring--to go from career woman who sleeps around to submissively sweet and wanting nine children shifted too suddenly, but then perhaps the moral of this story is that true love changes us.

* Night Nurse (with Barbara Stanwyck, Clark Gable and Joan Blondell): Watch the documentary on this disc instead, which is excellent, as it discusses each vice (people getting away with murder, homosexuality, etc.) with examples from those early films. (Though I do think post-code Hollywood went overboard at times--like in ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" when Cary Grant had to say he was the son of a sea cook instead of a bastard--I think it takes a much more creative person to work with subtlety rather than brashness, and better films are made. Look at the garbage Hollywood peddles now).

Anyway, had this extra not been included with this last film, I would say sell ""Night Nurse"" separately from the rest of the pack and keep the rest.",1208563200,,7160,4.657686212361331

****  The Divorcee, with Norma Shearer
****  A Free Soul, idem
***** Three on a Match, by Mervyn LeRoy
***** Female, by Curtiz
***** Night Nurse, by wellman with young Stanwyck

The first 2 films are show-off vehicle for Norma Shearer, which reduces a little the value of the film per se. But the other three are authentic cinematic gems. I loved them. Three great directors have total control over their work and are in their best and unbriddled. This is genuine filmmaking, where the story matters more than the stars, the special effects or whatever. It's the story, dude, could be the motto for this genre. They let the facts tell the story, no melodrama, no cynicism, just pure story-telling it.

The pace is so rapid that if you blink you lose. But you won't blink, it's that good.

""Three on a match"" is of mandatory view for social church-goers, the self-righteous liberals in general.

""Female"" puts feminists back in their place. Where? Watch for the end.

""Night Nurse"" is a social reality, tell-it-as-it-is story that utopians of both sides of the political spectrum will deplore.

No compromising. Pure down-to-earth reality film-making. Mandatory view today as yesterday. Classic 40's movies look fake compared to this older movies.",1206662400,7,1274,4.971698113207547

Some of these actresses (Ruth Chatterton, Norma Shearer, Ann Dvorak) faded from the screen, but some (Barbara Stanwyck, Joan Blondell and Bette Davis) went on to have lasting careers. These discs capture those performances in mostly pristine condition. I had only seen ""Night Nurse"" with Stanwyck, Blondell and a young Clark Gable. The rest were surprises to me. Especially ""Three on a Match"" with Blondell, Ann Dvorak, Davis and a young Humphrey Bogart as ,what else, a gangster. This film is gritty and strong stuff as three young women find divergent lives with one taking a spectacular dive to oblivion. In fact, some critics at the time felt it was ""distasteful"". Both ""Night Nurse"" and ""Match"" feature children in jeopardy and ""Match"" is pretty explicit about drug addiction. This collection is highly recommended for the rare vintage films it contains. Plus the disc about the production code is very informative and surprising, especially in light of what movies contain today. And yes, all the films deal with sex as a frank fact of life and the women are just as game, or more so, as the men. Completely entertaining and well made. All of them.

3269651,5,B000YRY7VC,"NOTICE: THIS REVIEW IS ABOUT THE SET DESIGN from the movie FEMALE. THIS MOVIE IS NOT A MUSICAL. It is included in the set.

Here is a little gem for all you musical Busby Berklely Fans.

After FOOTLIGHT PARADE Came out in 1933, ""FEMALE"" was released the same year . The backyard pool is the left over set from the ""By A Waterfall"" number with Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell. Do you remember the scene from Foot light Parade when the ""natural"" forest waterfall scene is done, imagination takes flight and the pond becomes a fantastic Deco stylized pool.

Well,the backyard of Ruth Chatterton's home has THAT pool. You can recognize the pools edge by the deco style carving. There is also a ""Fountain"" that looks suspiciously like the water tower - which rotated and was about 60 feet high,at one end of the pool. (Remember the bathing beauties swinging their legs out and over the sides while the camera was overhead?). It had a stylistic ""Twig/Branch design on the Fountain's bottom edge. It is in it's collapsed state not the full 60 foot height.

I was surprised when it saw it, and got out my photo's of that scene and it IS the old set all right. Later you can see that the water tower has been raised several feet higher and is now more recognizable. The water tower is of the most iconic images in depicting the glamorous Berkeley style. It sits at one end of the pool and has water shooting out of it.

Several of the charters in the movie actually sing or hum some of the Warren/Dubin songs as if to give you hint that maybe you might overlook the pool set? Movie makers often did use set from other movies - But this one, WOW! I was thrilled to find this gem - I now know why early in the movie, the actors were doing those famous tunes.

All the reviewers missed this funny gag! But I just LOVED seeing the set used again. I'd loved to have been able to see it preserved, it must have been fantastic. I heard that people from all over the studio came to see the set as it was being built - WOW! Also  Pay attention to the fascinating Art Deco Frank Lloyd Wright's Ennis House as Alison's mansion.

3269652,4,B000YRY7VC,"Those who enjoyed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Volume-One/dp/B000I2JDF8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Volume One</a>&nbsp;of Turner Classic Movies' Forbidden Hollywood Collection will undoubtedly be thrilled by Volume Two. Before the Hays Code neutralized the sexually oriented behavior that could be shown in Hollywood movies for over three decades, there was a crop of movies that reflected a more laissez-faire attitude toward risqu subjects like promiscuity, homosexuality and drug use. Three films were presented over two discs in Volume One, and five are presented here over three discs along with a new seventy-minute documentary produced specifically for this set and aired on the TCM network.

Disc One contains two early classics starring Norma Shearer, 1930's ""The Divorcee"" (***1/2) and 1931's ""A Free Soul"" (****). Along with Garbo, Shearer was fast becoming MGM's prestige star at the time thanks to some degree to her marriage to the mythic studio head Irving Thalberg. However, she was also uniquely talented as proven by the diversity of her films. Although she is remembered today more for her later roles in the title role of 1938's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marie-Antoinette/dp/B000GRUQKG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marie Antoinette</a>&nbsp;and as the virtuous center of 1939's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Women/dp/B0008ENICU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Women</a>, Shearer plays Jerry Martin, the blazing center of ""The Divorcee"" in which she plays a carefree young wife who cheats on her husband after he carelessly cheats on her. Instead of treating her in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scarlet-Letter/dp/0743487567/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scarlet Letter</a>&nbsp;fashion, the film takes a refreshing look at the double standards between men and women when it comes to adultery. Naturally, they eventually regret their behavior but not before a lot of alcohol-fueled hell-raising with their fair-weather friends.

In comparing the two Shearer vehicles, I find ""A Free Soul"" the more interesting film because it has some sizzling dialogue from screenwriter Adela Rogers St. John and an uncommonly powerful cast that includes Clark Gable, Leslie Howard and Lionel Barrymore. She plays Rogers St. Johns' alter ego, Jan Ashe, the free-spirited daughter of an alcoholic attorney (Barrymore) who successfully defends mob leader Ace Wilfong (Gable) in a murder case that is eerily prescient of the O.J. Simpson criminal trial. Jan gets hot and steamy over Ace, even though she is engaged to the socially acceptable Dwight (Howard). The inevitable complications occur with alcohol abuse, gambling and murder. Although not a natural temptress like Garbo, Shearer manages to imbue her role with an effective carnality mixed with her innate nobility. Gable was in his sinister period, while Barrymore pulls out the stops as her father, especially in the climactic murder trial scene. As an indication of public acceptance of these racy films, Barrymore won an Oscar for his role here, as did Shearer for ""The Divorcee"".

Disc Two is a Warner Brothers double-header with the studio feeling like the working class cousin to the glossier MGM. Both films barely run an hour, and not a scene is wasted in these fast-moving vehicles. The first is 1932's ""Three on a Match"" (****), which follows three schoolmates over the course of a dozen years. Joan Blondell plays Mary Keaton, the dropout who goes to reform school for her wild ways; a bottle-blonde Bette Davis plays class valedictorian Ruth Wescott who becomes a stenographer; and the forgotten Ann Dvorak plays popular Vivian Revere who marries a wealthy lawyer and has a son. Directed by Mervyn LeRoy, the film is most intriguing for the way the plot twists the characters' fates. In a very early role, Davis barely registers as Ruth, but Blondell is terrifically likable showing how Mary turns her life around. Bearing a striking resemblance to Luise Rainer, Dvorak gets the meatiest role as Vivian as she descends from bored socialite to unrepentant cocaine addict. It's a mesmerizing turn capped by a shocking finale. A very young Humphrey Bogart shows up in a minor role as what else, a gangster.

The second half of Disc Two is 1933's ""Female"" (****), the most intriguing of the five films as it manages to be a sociological statement as well as a romantic comedy. Directed by Michael Curtiz, it centers on Alison Drake, the powerful CEO of an automobile company. There is great fun watching her order her subservient male staff around like a drill sergeant and using them for inappropriate conjugal visits at her palatial estate to satisfy her desires. Naturally, she meets her match in auto designer Jim Thorne first in a meet-cute situation and then in a battle of wills at the company. Ruth Chatterton (the selfish wife in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dodsworth/dp/B00005PJ6U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dodsworth</a>) is wonderfully game as Alison, while the usually bland George Brent (her real-life husband at the time) complements her well as Jim. The ending is trite but inevitable. Pay attention to the fascinating Art Deco set decorations, including the use of Frank Lloyd Wright's Ennis House as Alison's mansion.

Disc Three contains 1931's ""Night Nurse"" (***1/2), a tense melodrama starring Barbara Stanwyck in the title role as Lora Hart assigned to take care of the two young daughters in a wealthy family. However, she uncovers a plot hatched by their alcoholic mother to kill the girls in order to steal their trust funds with the assistance of a nasty chauffeur and a corrupt doctor. Directed by William Wellman, the movie features several risqu moments with Stanwyck and pal Joan Blondell dressing and undressing in their uniforms, as well as moments of unexpected violence. Again, Clark Gable shows up in a sinister role as the chauffeur and slaps Stanwyck around with convincing malevolence. While I prefer her work in 1933's ""Baby Face"" on Volume One, no one shined more than Stanwyck in these pre-code films since her non-nonsense manner was a perfect fit for the era's candor and directness.

The 2008 documentary on Disc Three, ""Thou Shalt Not: Sex, Sin and Censorship in Pre-Code Hollywood"" (****1/2), offers a fascinating overview of the pre-code period before 1934 when the Legion of Decency helped bring about strict adherence to the Hays Code. It offers plenty of clips from both famous and obscure films of the period including those on the Forbidden Hollywood Collection. Some are surprising such as scenes cut from 1933's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/King-Kong/dp/B00003CXAW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">King Kong</a>, one where the giant ape strips the gown off Fay Wray and another where people are literally eaten and crushed. My favorite is the nude sequence with a body double for Maureen O'Sullivan swimming provocatively with Johnny Weissmuller in 1934's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tarzan-and-His-Mate/dp/6302120438/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tarzan and His Mate</a>. Several people provide comments including the late Jack Valenti (who developed the film rating system still in use today), social critic Camille Paglia and director John Landis. As for extras, film historians Jeffrey Vance and Tony Maietta provide informative and often enthusiastic commentary tracks for ""The Divorcee"" and ""Night Nurse"".

3269653,5,B000YRY7VC,"The announcement of the second set of the Forbidden Hollywood series is welcome. The set falls neatly into 2 groups - the MGM pair and the Warners trio.

The former are well mounted up-market A pictures with the prestigious Norma Shearer. Shearer was the wife of MGM wonderboy producer Irving Thalberg and his management of her limited talent was masterful. Both films carefully showcase her in ""modern"" stories of liberated women with attitudes to sex which were scandalous in 1930.

- In ""The Divorcee"", Shearer won the best actress Oscar playing a woman who divorces her husband because he is unfaithful then proceeds to ""liberate"" herself with other men. The film is a very early talkie with all the associated limitations - stagy, endless talk and some corny acting, including a very mannered Shearer. The disk contains a commentary which notes these limitations, particularly Shearer's.
- ""A Free Soul"" enhanced Shearer's reputation as THE prototype of the sexually liberated woman in this tale of a woman whose fiance, Leslie Howard, murders her lover, a very raunchy Clark Gable. Lionel Barrymore won an Oscar for his performance as Shearer's lawyer father and deservedly so. This is a much better film than ""The Divorcee"", demonstrating how quickly Hollywood progressed with talkies - better direction, photography, recording and acting. The story is really interesting with some great twists and Shearer is generally less mannered and accordingly much more effective than the earlier film. She also wears some of the best clothes ever seen on the screen, transforming her dumpy figure into a svelte and sexy one.

The remaining trio reflect Warner's assembly line approach to film making at the time and have shorter running times and faster pace.

- ""Night Nurse"" is a sordid tale starring the relentless Barbara Stanwyck as a nurse, with great support from Joan Blondell and a particularly nasty Clark Gable whose star quality is impossible to ignore. Stanwyck and Blondell seem to be constantly stripping for the camera and there are some great lines. Blondell says ""I used to  worry that the hospital would burn down. Now I have to watch myself with matches"".
- ""Three on a Match"" is a very short film which moves with lightening speed. It stars the luminous Ann Dvorak as a bored wife, the reliable Blondell as the heart-of-gold showgirl and an attractive but subdued Bette Davis as a secretary/nanny of all things. The women, who were childhood friends, renew acquaintance at lunch and light their cigarettes with one match, a superstition with ominous consequences. The film's plot involves kidnapping, a subject taken straight from the headlines in 1932, and covers sex and drugs and rock 'n roll, well jazz anyway. Note also the array of great players in supporting or cameo roles, some unbilled - Glenda Farrell in the reform school, Humphrey Bogart as a particularly vicious gangster, Allen Jenkins as one of the gang, Edward Arnold as the head of the kidnappers, Frankie Darro as as a schoolboy and Anne Shirley, billed as Dawn O'Day, playing Dvorak as a child.
- ""Female"" is the oddest film in the bunch because it stars the sophisticated and dry Ruth Chatterton, a polished diva probably more suited to MGM gloss than gritty Warner's realism. Chatterton plays a business woman competing in a man's world until she meets her nemesis George Brent. The pre-code aspects of the film relate to Chatterton placing her sex life in a compartment with a string of lovers on call, but no time for true love. It is surprising. The film is very funny at times and Brent, who was married to Chatterton at the time, is excellent.

The prints of all the films are good enough, with ""Three on a Match"" particularly mint. The Warners group contain the original trailers. The set includes a first rate documentary on the pre-code era which neatly captures the intrigue of this short period as talkies evolved. The documentary, produced by TCM, largely confines itself to the products of MGM and Warners which of course are the TCM libraries. ""Night Nurse"" contains an entertaining commentary shared between 2 relaxed historians.

It is worth noting that the stars of all of these films are women, like the previous Forbidden Hollywood Series. The Hays Code curtailed the actions and attitudes of women, taking them out of the bedroom and boardroom and placing them back in the kitchen and lounge. For men, nothing really changed much. By the way, that's Bette Davis, who was very attractive in those days, on the cover.",1196985600,61,4525,4.9696169088507265
3269654,5,B000YRY7VC,"I just read about the release of Volume 2 of this great series featuring Pre-Code film.  This volume will be released just in time for several Pre-code Film Festivals in my city.  I was especially excited to see my favorite, Clark Gable, in two pictures: as the wonderfully wicked mobster, Ace Wilfong, who manhandles his mistress, Norma Shearer, in A Free Soul; and the equally evil chauffer, Nick, who is poisoning his employer's children to take control of their trust funds and inheritance from their drunken mother and belting the kid's nurse, Barbara Stanwyck, for meddling in his plans in Night Nurse.
The Pre-Code era was rich with incredible films.  It is amazing what was allowed in these movies of the early thirties.  Before the Code came in on July 1, 1934, women enjoyed their sexuality, took lovers, kicked out cheating husbands, went to work, and slept their way to the top.  Men were dangerous; crime paid, and cracking wise was a way of life.  After the Code, the genie was stuffed back in the bottle....women were pushed back into their kitchens, crime never paid, sin was either repented before the last reel or punishment (even death) was the final reward.  (Check out Jimmy Cagney's character's demise in Public Enemy.)
I can't wait to own these fascinating films of the Pre-Code era.  Check them out for yourself........you'll be very surprised what your grandparents and great-grandparents were watching (or even up to) back in the early thirties.",1195603200,16,1471,4.951219512195122
3269655,5,B000YRY7VC,"March will mark the release of some PreCode gems on this Forbidden Hollywood set, in particular for Norma Shearer fans.

""The Divorcee"" (1930).  Ms. Shearer's Academy award winning performance as Jerry in the role her husband, Irving Thalberg, initially thought she wasn't sexy enough to play (a few wonderfully seductive portraits, courtesy of Mr. Hurrell were enough to prove his doubts had no basis) is excellent.  Great minor role by her future leading man, Robert Montgomery, as well.

""A Free Soul"" (1931).  Ms. Shearer is Jan Ashe; Mr. Lionel Barrymore (in his Academy Award winning role) is her alcoholic, lawyer father, Stephen Ashe.  Young Clark Gable made his cinematic bones with his role as mob heavy Ace Wilfong.  For those who've only known Norma for ""Marie Antoinette"" and ""The Women"", be prepared for an entirely different actress. Ms. Shearer, resplendent in her erotic white gown, is pure bombshell.

""Night Nurse"" (1931).  Barbara Stanwyck was at her best in PreCodes (though I think ""Illicit"" is a better film) and Joan Blondell packs a punch as her nurse friend.  This film has a plot to kill children, a nymphomanical mother, drug references and Clark Gable mobbing up again as Nick, the chauffeur.

""Three on a Match""(1932).  Anne Dvorak, Joan Blondell and Bette Davis play the three ladies who share the karmic match. One's a bad girl who turns her life around (Blondell); another one is a good girl who remains true to her goodness (Bette Davis); the third has all the luck, money and  the love of a faithful husband (Dvorak), but throws it all away for booze, drugs and shady men.  Humphrey Bogart, also making his start as a mob heavy, plays her connection/kidnapper, Harve while the charming Warren Williams plays her abandoned husband, Robert.

""Female"" (1933). The exceptionally talented Ruth Chatterton plays Alison Drake, president of a successful automobile factory, with a penchant for having trysts with her male secretaries and promptly transferring them to the company's Canadian office. Enter George Brent (Ms. Chatterton's husband off-screen at the time) as designer Jim Thorn and the sparks begin.

Commentary, trailers and a new documentary make this a must-own for fans of Pre-Code cinema. Let's get working on set 3, why don't we?  Classic film fans (myself included) are only glad to spend those preorder dollars for Pre-Code releases.",1195516800,169,2380,5.108527131782946
3269656,5,B000YRY7VC,"A little over a year after the release of volume one, Warner Home Video is finally giving us volume 2 of its Forbidden Hollywood series. There are supposedly to be two releases of this series a year from this point forward. Included in this set are:
a. Five films instead of the three in volume one.
b. Commentaries for two of the films.
c. A new documentary on the precode genre.

The films included are:

""The Divorcee"" (1930) and ""A Free Soul"" (1931). These two films feature great performances from Norma Shearer. In ""The Divorcee"" she plays a wife who discovers her husband has cheated on her. When confronted he admits what he did but insists it meant nothing. However, he has a different attitude when Norma does the same with hubby's best friend (Robert Montgomery). The two divorce and Norma enters into a long string of ill-fated affairs. Shearer won Best Actress for her performance.
In ""A Free Soul"" alcoholic attorney Stephen Ashe (Lionel Barrymore) and his daughter Jan (Norma Shearer) have always lived a lifestyle of which the rest of their socialite family disapproved. Stephen has always taught his daughter to go her own way and not pay attention to what other people think. Now this may be good advice when it has to do with priggish conventions rooted in tradition rather than right and wrong. However, what Stephen has failed to point out to Jan is that people also generally think it is a bad idea to walk into a busy intersection blind-folded, and just because this is a majority opinion does not make it a convention ripe for the testing. Thus, completely blindfolded, Jan walks into the busy intersection that is the world of gangster Ace Wilfong (Clark Gable), a murderer that her father has recently managed to get acquitted in one of his more sober moments. Stephen Ashe is faced with a parent's worst nightmare - he has given his daughter what turns out to be very bad advice, and she has not only listened but followed it. Barrymore won a Best Actor Oscar for his performance.
DVD Special Features:
The Divorcee commentary by Jeffrey Vance and Tony Maietta

""Three on a Match"" (1932) and ""Female"" (1933) are on the second disk.
""Three on a Match"" stars Ann Dvorak, Joan Blondell, and Bette Davis as three girls who grow up together but go very different ways. However, as adults they reunite for lunch one day and from that moment their lives intertwine once again, this time resulting in tragedy. Dvorak plays a woman whose narcissism she has confused as a bent for the romantic, Blondell plays the woman with a jaded past but a good heart, and Davis is in the background as a reliable Girl Friday type.
""Female"" stars Ruth Chatterton as the sexually liberated manager of an automobile factory. However, she meets her match in inventor Jim Thorne (George Brent). A kind of ""Taming of the Shrew"" meets Ernst Lubitsch, although Lubitsch himself had nothing to do with this film. If you can ignor the improbability that a woman would ever be able to reach this position in management in the 1930's while so flaunting convention, this is a very enjoyable little movie.
DVD Special Features:
Theatrical trailers for both films

""Night Nurse"" (1931) and the precode documentary are on disk three.
""Night Nurse"" stars Barbara Stanwyck, one of the queens of the precodes, in a film that is more of a depression era crime/mystery film than anything with some precode bits thrown in. Unlike ""Baby Face"", here Stanwyck is using her toughness more than her sexuality. She plays a nurse on the night shift who ends up caring for two wealthy children who are being systematically starved by an evil chauffeur (Clark Gable) so that he can marry the childrens' mother and grab their trust funds. Stanwyck faces indifference on all fronts, and is helped out by a bootlegger friend (Ben Lyon) in her effort to save the children.

3269657,5,B000YRY7VC,"This is a fine set of DVDs that needs to be cherished by all fans who like movies of pre-code era and the golden age of Hollywood. These are some of the best movies that came out of the studios. My favorite in this set is the movie Divorcee (1930) starring Norma Shearer

Divorcee (1930)

Norma Shearer shines like a star in this pre-code film of 1930. This is one of the early pre-code films that test the nerves of Hays office that would later police the morality depicted in Hollywood films. Jerry (Norma Shearer) and Ted (Chester Morris) are happily married couple until their anniversary, when Jerry discovers that Ted is unfaithful to her. When confronted he dismisses it as ""it doesn't mean a thing."" In a hurtful mood, she responds with her own one night stand. One of the prominent features of this film is that not only discusses very openly the double standards in judging women with regards to morality but Shearer offers an outstanding performance as a married woman who is hurt and angry. Rightfully so, the Academy honored her with an award in the best actress category.

The movie has a bit of history, when MGM was seriously considering Joan Crawford for the role, Shearer placed a bid on it. But her own husband and MGM executive Irving Thalberg thought she is not glamorous for the role, but after seeing her publicity shots made with photographer George Hurrell, he agreed to cast her in the movie. This caused a serious rift with Joan Crawford who was very interested in this project. The story is based on the novel Ex-Wife by Ursula Parrott, which was directed by Robert Z. Leonard

Female (1933)

Female (1933) starring Ruth Chatterton is my second favorite movie from this set. The story is about Alison Drake (Ruth Chatterton) is the wealthy owner a large automobile company, and she uses her wealth to have affairs with much younger men and some are her own employees, until she meets a man who is not too impressed with her money.

A Free Soul (1931)

A Free Soul is a 1931 Pre-Code film which tells the story of an alcoholic defense attorney who has to defend his daughter's ex-boyfriend on a charge of murdering the mobster she had started a relationship with. A Free Soul is drama that casts top stars of the day which includes; Norma Shearer, Leslie Howard, Lionel Barrymore, and Clark Gable.",1415318400,,2324,4.6536585365853655

No nudity at all and I was surprised at that and also no bad language. They consider a married woman having a date with a single guy as the damaging parts and I agree of course but it isn't fun to watch in my opinion.

Norma Shearer has true charisma, and steals the whole show. Two of her features are in this collection, ""The Divorcee"" (perhaps one of the most influential Pre-Code films ever), and A Free Soul. This collection is wonderfully packaged, and features true pieces of cinematic history. The Pre-Code era was a time when ladies ruled the movies, and oozed sex appeal and star power. I enjoy this collection very much, and recommend it to anyone who wants to get into Pre-Code films, and become a fan of the great Norma Shearer, and the other fine leading ladies.",1386115200,2,688,4.939655172413793

3269673,1,B000YRY7VC,"I bought this set in 2009. The films are good prints and the sound is more than acceptable ... BUT, last year the first disc's coating started to turn into muck, making it unreadable and now the second disc is also unreadable although there is not a scratch on the surface. I tried to play it on 2 different dvd players and my computer to no avail. Don't waste your money!",1357948800,7,372,4.253521126760563
3269674,1,B000YRY7VC,"I purchased this set one year ago from a Barnes and Nobel store. It was brand new, with the cellophane wrap. I got it home and tried to watch all the films, but Disc 1 (""The Divorcee"" and ""A Free Soul"") had some kind of viscous residue on it. When you look at it, it looks like an oily film on the underside of the disc, and when you take it out it hardens and makes the disc virtually unwatchable. (It will freeze, stutter, etc.) So, I saw it for cheap on Amazon.com a few days ago and decided to purchase it again, in order to complete the first set I bought. But this set too, had the same issue. I called TCM about it, and they hadn't heard of the problem -- but clearly it's defective. (Two separate buys, one year apart, from two completely different stores.) Still in the middle of trying to find a resolution as I write this review. Hopefully, this helps any of you wanting to buy the set. The other two discs play fine, and if you do purchase at a store, make sure to open it first. The films themselves are wonderful and some of the best pre-code cinema out there.

UPDATE: Have yet to hear from TCM or receive any information on how to get a new disc. For the folks who seemed to find this unhelpful (for whatever reason) -- why do you think that both the other sets hover at around $30-to-$40, while this set is constantly being discounted at $14-to-$18 around the holidays? TCM knows it's defective, and are trying to unload what they have. Not cool. I've never had an issue with any of their other products, and still will buy certain items. (I've pre-ordered their Carole Lombard set due out in 2013.) But it's disappointing that such a reputable company would sell this the way it is, without providing any response, any compensation, or alternative. Film lovers who spend tons of cash every year deserve better, and for that matter, Norma Shearer deserves better too. I've posted this same concern at the official TCM.com site, in the hopes of keeping film buyers from losing money, but shamefully they never allow the review to appear. (Note: See two-star review here at Amazon.com from buyer named ""Bernie L. Hulme"". Sounds like that person is having the same issue too. In fact, read the 10 other customers' responding to ""Bernie's"" comments: [...] They all note the same problem with disc one.)

LAST UPDATE: As of March 5, 2013, I have called and talked with various Amazon.com sellers of ""Forbidden Hollywood: Vol. II"", asking each to look at their Disc 1, and if it is indeed good, I will buy the set. So far, I'm 5-of-5, with each seller (thankfully honest), saying that once they took a close look, that their Disc 1's have the same problem as stated above. In other words, the likelihood of your set not being defective is very very low. Sorry to say it, but hopefully it keeps you from purchasing this set that TMC is clearly looking to ditch on unsuspecting buyers. So disappointing TMC does this to people, without offering the slightest acknowledgement. Best wishes everyone, and keep watching Pre-Code film.

HOLIDAY UPDATE: As of November 21, 2013, boxset still contains a single defective disc.",1353888000,28,3128,4.572192513368984
3269675,5,B000YRY7VC,"Forbidden Hollywood 2 is just as good as the first!  The film quality is great, & all 5 films are excellent.
Every actress today is in debt to Norma Shearer for paving the way for the modern woman in film in ""The Divorcee"".  She is terrific & the film still holds up today.  The comments on marriage are still true.  ""A Free Soul"" is a great melodrama with Shearer, Clark Gable, Lionel Barrymore, & Leslie Howard.  Daring then, dated now, but still fun.  (I always try to watch a film from the perspective of the time when it was made.). ""Night Nurse"" is a Warner Bros hard hitting film with a tough Barbara Stanwyck, Joan Blondell, & Clark Gable in a small part.  ""Female"" has Ruth Chatterton as the president of a corporation who has an affair with a different male employee each night!  Chatterton was a great actress who should be more appreciated today.  ""Three On A Match"" in about an hour contains incidents from true events at the time the film was made.  Ann Dvorak (another under appreciated actress) is terrific!  The film is as frank in its depiction of some plot points as films of today, & in about half the time!  They don't make 'em like this anymore (unfortunately).

3269676,3,B000YRY7VC,I was dissapointed how in the documentary (so obviously biased here toward product under Warner licence) there was absolutely no mention of Mae West - the biggest thorn in the moralists side and one of the main targets in the move toward cleaning up of motion picture production post 1934. Shame on you Warner Home Video for blowing your own trumpet in such a blatantly misleading and commercial way to those audiences exploring this era of film for the first time! Real coffee table stuff trying to be credible and of substance. Misses by a mile.,1346025600,3,547,4.708333333333333
3269677,5,B000YRY7VC,"Some of these films I have been dying to see since I was a kid.  As a film fan, I always wanted to see films where actors had won Oscars such as Norma Shearer for both The Divorcee and A Free Soul and these films were unavailable for television and in poor shape.  I also loved Clark Gable and Barbara Stanwyck and made it a point to try to watch all their films.  The silents and early talkies were usually not shown and I wasn't able to see them.  Now with this collection, I am watching The Divorcee, A Free Soul, and Night Nurse for the first time.  They are wonderful!  The Divorcee is a landmark film in which a married woman answers her husband's infidelity with infidelity of her own but it's not the same to HIM.  A Free Soul stars Norma Shearer as a wealthy young woman with an alcoholic father who encourages her to be a free soul until she gets herself into a little sexual trouble.  Night Nurse is played by Barbara Stanwyck who takes a job and vows to be a dutiful nurse until she realizes that breaking some rules are in the best interests of her patients.  The film Female is a movie I had never heard of until this year.  A woman runs a business like a man but in the end must settle for not being in charge and being subservient if she is to marry and have lots of babies.  Still until the end, the character is a great depiction of a strong liberated woman.  Three on a Match is great film about 3 women who attend elementary school together and end up with different lives as adults.  The one headed for boarding school goes the wrong way, the one who ended up in reform school, becomes successful and the one who went on to vocational school finds a good job.  A great drama and has a truth and honesty about the story that I really enjoyed.  What a treat to see these films and restored to a beautiful pristine condition.  Love them!",1329609600,,1855,4.2272727272727275
3269678,2,B000YRY7VC,"This package of films represents the triumph of merchandising over merchandise. If you imagine they might represent revolutionary or daring film-making, otherwise lost to us because of a blinkered, art-crushing censor, forgot it. That's just the sales pitch of the 'forbidden Hollywood' tease.

The films you'll find here are conventional, melodramatic, improbable and distinguished neither by their scriptwriting nor acting. Norma Shearer was a big name star, and she has definite presence, but I do not think the two films featuring her on this set advance her claims to greatness. They tend to confirm - as critics have noted - that she was an actress who got ahead by hard work and will-power rather than a tutored dramatic craft-skill. Shearer sometimes acted by assembling gestures, the way she thought a scene should be acted, rather than from character, and was prone to histrionics.

None of these films is memorable or truly worthy of preservation. At best, they might be regarded as curiosities: 'forgettable Hollywood' perhaps. The nonsense of suggesting that something other than a prurient sexual element enters into the productions is driven home most forcibly by the film 'Female', which gives us the character of a woman running a motor vehicle corporation who discovers she is 'just playing a part' and, to be herself, must find a man, hand over the business to him and have his babies.

Unfortunately, in the replacement set all 3 disks refused to play all the way through.  Amazon has done all they can do to make it right.

3269680,5,B000YRY7VC,"The five films considered separately, I'd give three stars once and four and five stars twice each. But is has to be honored that these pre code films are available in good quality, with subtitles and accompanied by a fascinating documentary and audio commentaries for ""Night Nurse"" and ""The Divorcee"". This is what makes me give a five star rating for the entire box. The following may be said to the films:

1. Female (1933, 60 minutes, Warner, dir.: M. Curtiz, starring Ruth Chatterton, co-starring George Brent): She's rich. She's powerful. She's seductive. She runs an automobile company and dominates any man she wants - in business and in bed. She's on the man hunt, taking men as sexual objects and pure trophies, to be hired and fired. This is clearly pre code, hard, fast and beautiful... but why must this wild animal be tamed by someone who declares with a total lack of irony that women are by nature born for love, marriage and children?!? Fascinating film with an unbearable ending, but the first 50 of about 60 minutes are that fresh and witty that I'd still give a four star rating.

2. Three on a Match (1932, 63 minutes, Warner, dir.: Mervyn LeRoy, starring Ann Dvorak and Joan Blondell, co-starring Bette Davis and Warren William, featuring Humphrey Bogart): Interesting film about three (female) schoolmates who meet again about ten years later - you'll see a fine little drama about what women can expect from life and from men (and what they can't expect), where Dvoraks adultery will at the end be punished, but the film doesn't condemn her: Women also have a right to strive to happiness, and they have a right to miss something even if their husbands are gentle, kind, loving, noble and wealthy (as is William in the role of Dvoraks husband). This very short and fast-moving film is full of deliberately realistic"", fresh down-to-earth-dialogue instead of MGM-polishing, and with many relations to actual events and trends in American History from 1919 to 1932, often shown by newspaper headlines or some semi-documentary footage. Even an allusion to Mussolini is made! The whole movie is a vivid proof for Warner being the studio for realistic sociocritical dramas instead of creating a polished world of its own (as did MGM). Five stars.

3. Night Nurse (1931, 72 minutes, Warner, dir.: William Wellman, starring Barbara Stanwyck, co-starring Clark Gable, Joan Blondell): Thrilling sociocritical drama about nurses' lives under hard conditions, due to prohibition, depression, cynicism, and hypocrisy of some of the doctors. Finally, Stanwyck will need all her courage to prevent two little kids from being slowly murdered by underfeeding. She undoubtedly is the best actress to succeed, sometimes very energetic (but never overacting), sometimes just with a silent facial expression which tells both Gable (as the villain) and the public that this tough lady is just overwhelming. The best movie in the entire collection. Five stars.

4. A Free Soul (1931, Metro, 93 minutes, dir.: Clarence Brown, starring Norma Shearer, co-starring Lionel Barrymore, Clark Gable, Leslie Howard): Drama about a young woman between three men, two of them being potential love interests and one being her father who taught her to be ""A Free Soul"" - but who won't get along with her being in love with a gangster (Clark Gable). Interesting story, but spoiled by some absolutely silly goofs (such as a man not being killed by machine gun fire although sitting just behind a thin wooden wall) and many pathetic talking, static camerawork and exaggerated mannerisms by Shearer (sometimes) and Barrymore (ALWAYS - his performance is the worst overacting I've ever seen, making Robert De Niro a master of understatement). Three stars.

5. The Divorcee (1930, Metro, 82 minutes, dir.: Robert Z. Leonard, starring Norma Shearer): It's quite better than ""A Free Soul""! Shearer has, in some scenes, her mannerisms, obviously imported from the silent era, but she is touching and courageous in most scenes - and so is the script which even advocates sexual equality in adultery!!! Men, and particularly Shearer's husband, are shown as infantile machos, and Shearer clearly points it out, for which we may love her. The last ten minutes, however, are pure clich&eacute;, and the audio commentary is absolutely right in stating that the film is very well written and deserved its Oscar nomination for best script - but not because of the last scenes. Nevertheless, I'd give a four star rating.",1265155200,7,4491,5.047169811320755

The installation of sound cameras made the films less cinematic, but stronger in pace and plot.
The Divorcee, with Norma Shearer is a good example of exploring different roles, and displaying society with the flaws that did and still do exist in human relationships.
The moralists, usually Catholics, of the time would have hated such aberrations of the norm, and after they took hold when the economy recovered, art as daring as this took a nosedive, as the limits put on freedom of expression took hold.
Unfortunatley these self-appointed guardians are still out there.
The fact that this collection of gems are not rated reveals how purile their rantings were, and still are today.

3269684,5,B000YRY7VC,"There were a few years in movie making when sound was first introduced but the Production Codes had not yet been in force.  These codes would severely limit the ability of movies to depict the real world:  sex, violence and corruption were toned down - often to the point of sheer blandness.  Crime could never pay, authority figures were always forces of good and even married couples were confined to twin beds.  There were those few years, however, from the late-1920s to 1934 which was known as the pre-Code era, a period that offered films that would be much more daring than the movies of just a few years later.

TCM's set, Forbidden Hollywood Collection, Volume Two, showcases five such pre-Code movies.  On the first of three discs are a pair of Norma Shearer films.  In The Divorcee, she won an Oscar as a wife who discovers that her husband had an affair.  Although he assures her it means nothing, it is an obvious hypocrisy that's exposed when she balances the books with an affair of her own.  In A Free Soul, she defiantly has a fling with gangster Clark Gable, only to discover that the relationship will have unintended complications.  Lionel Barrymore, playing her alcoholic father, won an Oscar for his role and Gable's performance would help transform him from a supporting player into a star.

On Disc Two, there is Three on a Match and Female.  The former is a story of three schoolmates who meet in adulthood.  Joan Blondell is the bad girl turned good, Ann Dvorak is the good girl turned bad, and Bette Davis is somewhere in the middle.  This movie features an early gangster role by Humphrey Bogart.  Female has Ruth Chatterton as the driven owner of an auto company.  She works hard by day and chooses various male employees to be her playthings at night.  It's a fine arrangement until she meets George Brent as the one man who resists her charms.

Finally, on Disc Three, Barbara Stanwyck is the Night Nurse, a woman from the wrong side of the tracks who betters herself by becoming a nurse.  Unfortunately, the ethics of the profession compel her to look the other way when she sees malpractice, but she'll put what's right above what's required.  Clark Gable is in one of his most villainous roles as a thuggish chauffeur out to kill a couple children.  The resolution of this one would involve an act that would never be allowed under the Code.

Also on the third disc is a nice documentary called Thou Shalt Not:  Sex, Sin and Censorship in Pre-Code Hollywood.  This feature describes more fully what this era meant to film, and what it meant when it ended.  One thing that stands out is that this was a time where actresses could have juicy roles, a heyday for Blondell, Davis, Stanwyck and Shearer as well as folks like Crawford, Hepburn and Loy.  The Code with its ""family values"" agenda would pigeonhole the women into much more limited roles.

All these movies are well-made and relatively short: the longest (A Free Soul) runs 93 minutes and Female is just an hour.  With the documentary and a couple commentaries (on The Divorcee and Night Nurse), this is a wonderful set that will not only entertain, but serve as a reminder as to what the Production Code took away from movie making.",1219536000,12,3224,4.648409893992933

there are three additions to the collection, which is also accompanied by a nice new documentary titled 'thou shalt not' that make worth the price.  the first is 'three on a match', which stars the now-obscure ann dvorak as a bored socialite, and joan blondell and bette davis as her childhood friends.  dvorak's character has the life her friends aspire to--a rich powerful husband (warren william) and sumptuous digs on park avenue (or whereever rich white people lived in warners film of the 1930s).  but she doesn't appreciate any of it and abandons it all for a fling with a handsome loser (lyle talbot). blondell and davis acquire all dvorak leaves behind to pursue sexual escapades. and as they rise, dvorak sinks lower, until she winds up a cocaine addict that must sacrifice her life to save her little boy.

then, there's 'female', a true find!  'female' is way, way ahead of its 1933 release date.  allison, played by ruth chatterton, is a high-powered auto-plant exec with a sharp mind, a great orry-kelly wardrobe and a sexual rapaciousness equal only to hugh hefner's. she plucks her boy toys from the factory and when she tires of them, she transfers them to canada! canada in 1933 must have been a lonely place.

'female' shows its timelessness when allison plucks a handsome stud that would fain worship her as a goddess--in other words, he's gay as a ukelele! then, as she seduces another, successfully with chilled vodka and pillows in front of the fire, she wears a gown that is a dead ringer for the gown cate blanchett wore to the 1999 oscar ceremony. all it needs is a painted hummingbird on the back.

of course, allison must realize a woman is nothing without a strong man so the film sinks at the very end but that's minor.

third but not last, is the documentary 'thou shalt not', which examines pre-code hollywood film product.  the biggest revelation is to see jeanne eagels in a clip from the 1929 version of 'the letter'.  this is priceless.  eagels was more than intense--she was jennifer jason leigh at her most manic.  tcm must show this version in its entirety soon.",1211155200,6,2417,4.746411483253588

3269689,5,B000YRY7VC,"It may not have exactly been a time of innocence, but it was a time of some pretty good flicks that have, until now, been pretty much forgotten. Turner Classic Movies has changed that. Again. The five films in their second collection push the boundaries of morality---a sex, sin-filled orgy of flimsy nighties, politically incorrect situations, extraordinary frankness, nudity, adultery, premarital sex and prostitution. Some things never change. The best of the bunch is The Divorcee, the film that is considered the official kick-off of the pre-Code era. Norma Shearer won an Oscar for Best Actress as a woman who decides to match her cheating husband tryst for tryst after catching him husband in a compromising position. The phenomenal critical and financial success of the picture led other studios to try topping it, and soon almost every actress in Hollywood was required to sin. And repent. The sensational series of films that emerged helped Hollywood survive its economic crisis and moviegoers enjoy the vicarious thrills the films provided. The era came to an abrupt close beginning July 1, 1934, when Catholic watchdog groups threatened boycotts of all films and the Church established the Legion of Decency to monitor movies. Studio heads bowed to the pressure and the era of censorship began, lasting until the establishment of the industry's rating system in 1968.",1210118400,7,1379,5.216216216216216

3269691,3,B000YRY7VC,"This was an enjoyable set overall and an interesting look at the short films churned out by Hollywood in the heydey (meaning talkies) of its pre-code era. ""Three on a Match"" was the strongest of this set (though not without its problems), ""Night Nurse"" the weakest (I just never could figure out what the heck was going on), not to mention Clark Gable and George Brent look ridiculous without their moustaches (and I hate moustaches, but the absence of facial hair didn't hinder these early talkies).

CAUTION: SPOILERS AHEAD!

** The Divorcee (with Norma Shearer): I will never understand the stupidity of people who will get into a car with a drunk person. I felt terribly sorry for the woman whose face was disfigured from the accident (we only see her wearing a black hat that totally covers her face, how she sees where she`s going, I don`t know) and who the driver married out of duty and because he couldn't have Norma Shearer.

I didn't have any respect for Norma's cheating husband in this, who says it shouldn't matter [to his wife] because it didn't mean a thing, but when Norma sleeps with said admirer, her husband can't take it.

I say, she is better off without him, though I was disappointed in her that she slept with her admirer that night out of revenge. It made me less sympathetic to her character. She should have just let her husband believe she had let another man touch her--she would have gotten the same result without debasing herself.

One thing I hated (or rather three things) were the close-ups of Miss Shearer's and her various suitors' hands (not to mention the men had laughably bad foreign accents) to show how Miss Shearer was getting around after her divorce (though it is implied that she doesn't sleep with any of them because one of the men calls the ring he has just given her platonic--I get the impression these are rich old geezers who just want a young chick on their arm to take to shows, etc.).

Miss Shearer is a tease who cannot bring herself to have casual sex. Sleeping with the DUI guy was a mistake (for she did regret it the morning after) she made when she vulnerable and her sorrow was still raw.

Norma's husband did apologize at the end when she tracks him down in Paris (why she can't find someone else, I don't know--I say start fresh), realizing he is the only man she has ever really loved, and they get back together. I was annoyed when she said she should have fought harder for her marriage when he was the one who cheated on her. He was the one who should have bent down and begged for her forgiveness instead of saying she was being silly because ""it didn't mean a thing"".

But, these kinds of films were a product of the times and it's funny because this kind of thinking would never go over today. Unlike many people my age (I'm twenty-six), it's interesting to go back and watch these films and appreciate them, even if we do not agree with them. It's sickening most people today have probably not even watched a movie pre-dating the Hippie Movement and think all silent films are boring because they have to actually read something.

** A Free Soul (with Norma Shearer, Clark Gable and Lionel Barrymore): Either Norma Shearer's character had dual personalities or her part wasn't well written, but she acted like a totally different girl with Gable than she did around her father (and she did act pretty amorous toward her pop, calling him darling, dear, and ruffling his hair--Ick!).

Ashley Wilkes, I mean Leslie Howard, is given another thankless role (I would never kill anyone just to save some trollop's reputation, but then, his doing that finally made her love him, so I guess he got what he wanted in the end, not to mention his freedom...with Lionel's help).

I really don't think Miss Shearer was all that much in love with Gable if she was willing to give him up (her idea) to get her father to stop drinking, but then maybe my perception is skewed--perhaps that shows just how much she cared for her father.

""Free Soul"" is father/daughter love story until the end, and the moral of this story? Father really does know best.

*** Three on a Match (with Ann Dvorak, a dark, mysterious beauty, a pudgy Joan Blondell and platinum-haired (a la Jean Harlow) Bette Davis when she was still young and lovely; also Anne Shirley (billed as Dawn O'Day), who had not yet developed her understated beauty):

The three leading ladies were excellent, and though the little moppet playing Dvorak's son is cute as can be, he's just too cutesy (he's the little boy version of Shirley Temple) for this film. His talents would have been better suited to a movie like ""National Velvet"" playing one of Elizabeth Taylor's rambunctious brothers.

I also found indicating the passage of time using newspapers hackneyed. Sometimes just flashing the year in the next frame will suffice.

I never really understood Ann Dvorak's motivations (why did she want to take the kid along?)--I am guessing she was just one of those people who is never satisfied (and they`re usually the ones who have everything, as Dvorak did in this case). I didn't have any sympathy for her character till the end, and you'll see why when you see it. It would have made more sense for Bette Davis to have taken Dvorak's place than for Joan Blondell, as Bette was slim and youthful-looking whereas Joan looks worn-down and is slightly overweight, but then, I guess Dvorak's husband was looking for something different than his ex-wife.

The ending was totally unexpected and really quite shocking. The only thing I'll say is that Dvorak managed to redeem herself in the end, and it was only then I felt sympathetic to her character.

As for Bette Davis, she really isn't given much to do except show some leg (which she does well), but this is really Dvorak's vehicle, who really could have been Miss Anne Shirley all grown up.

*** Female (with Ruth Chatterton and George Brent): This was going good until Mrs. George Brent in real life (at least for a couple of years--Miss Chatterton divorced her first husband and married Brent the next day) decides she's just a woman. I could see her really falling in love with the one man who won't bed her at her whim, but to totally change character was jarring--to go from career woman who sleeps around to submissively sweet and wanting nine children shifted too suddenly, but then perhaps the moral of this story is that true love changes us.

* Night Nurse (with Barbara Stanwyck, Clark Gable and Joan Blondell): Watch the documentary on this disc instead, which is excellent, as it discusses each vice (people getting away with murder, homosexuality, etc.) with examples from those early films. (Though I do think post-code Hollywood went overboard at times--like in ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" when Cary Grant had to say he was the son of a sea cook instead of a bastard--I think it takes a much more creative person to work with subtlety rather than brashness, and better films are made. Look at the garbage Hollywood peddles now).

Anyway, had this extra not been included with this last film, I would say sell ""Night Nurse"" separately from the rest of the pack and keep the rest.",1208563200,,7160,4.657686212361331

****  The Divorcee, with Norma Shearer
****  A Free Soul, idem
***** Three on a Match, by Mervyn LeRoy
***** Female, by Curtiz
***** Night Nurse, by wellman with young Stanwyck

The first 2 films are show-off vehicle for Norma Shearer, which reduces a little the value of the film per se. But the other three are authentic cinematic gems. I loved them. Three great directors have total control over their work and are in their best and unbriddled. This is genuine filmmaking, where the story matters more than the stars, the special effects or whatever. It's the story, dude, could be the motto for this genre. They let the facts tell the story, no melodrama, no cynicism, just pure story-telling it.

The pace is so rapid that if you blink you lose. But you won't blink, it's that good.

""Three on a match"" is of mandatory view for social church-goers, the self-righteous liberals in general.

""Female"" puts feminists back in their place. Where? Watch for the end.

""Night Nurse"" is a social reality, tell-it-as-it-is story that utopians of both sides of the political spectrum will deplore.

No compromising. Pure down-to-earth reality film-making. Mandatory view today as yesterday. Classic 40's movies look fake compared to this older movies.",1206662400,7,1274,4.971698113207547
