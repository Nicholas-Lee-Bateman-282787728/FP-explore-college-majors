It boasts to be ""based on the true story of the Sawney Bean clan!"" but has little or no factual information about the infamous inbreds of Scotland. If you want to see a movie about inbred hillside cannibals stick with either version of The Hills Have Eyes.",1164499200,,326,4.360655737704918
2529525,4,B000EQ5V1S,"Well... Once again Mr GORYSSIMO got to stand for a cool litle flick that everybody and their mama want to trash, so here we go again GOREHOUNDS...

HILLSIDE CANNIBALS as you've probably guessed by now is not a "" chef d'oeuvre "" but it kicks butt none the less. It is what SAMHAIN should have been : cheap, sleazy and gory. No jokes and no damn MPAA (may they burn in hell) cuts. The plot ? Who needs one ? We just need stupid teens and inbred desert rednecks to torture and eat them and we get just that.

Production values ? If you look for those of a blockbuster, you should not even bother reading that damn review. That movie has probably been shot in less than one week with a few dollars and a camcorder, so what !? The bottom line is : if you are a NO BUDGET movies and a GORE lover, buy that wicked flick. It is not creative or even well done but it has balls and it is honest. we, GOREHOUNDS, should thank ASYLUM for that.",1153353600,3,931,4.081967213114754
2529526,1,B000EQ5V1S,"i only gave this movie one star because it was the lowest thing offered. i love horror movies both good and bad. i love the cheesey ones just as much as i love the gritty twisted ones but this was just a joke. it looked like some college kids got bored and played around with a camcorder, some ipods, and fake blood. seriously never waste your money on this movie by renting it or buying it. i wasted an hour and a half of my life on this film :(",1148774400,,446,3.966666666666667
2529527,1,B000EQ5V1S,"Another piece of deck from the Asylum film. God almighty, there is yet anything that comes out from these cheap, $50 budget, homemade with a camcorder. Blockbuster stocks tons of this horror junk and charges 4 bucks to rent this crapola. As a horror film nut, I cant believe anyone would rate anything Asylum unleaches to horror fans above 1 star(only because amazon doesn't have a 0 star ratings for these types of god awfull direct to dvd releases",1146528000,3,449,4.69620253164557
2529528,3,B000EQ5V1S,"Cannibalism is not the subject of idle chit-chat. Really liked the effects, set and bad guys in this Theasylum flick. Tom(Bill)Nagel is the only victim ,I had apathy for...Being a fomer carpal tunnel  patient, My hands hurt almost as much as Toms. Vaz(Callum) Andreas had the most scenes to emote in, If you could while munching on co-stars. Leigh(Sawney)Scott had the kewlest role as leader on stilts and why not when your also the director. Tom(Towart)Downey, Hey they didn't list you in IMDB& we interviewed before, Has the most fun as the Big Brother with a gimmick. Louis(Sherriff)Graham was even more disturbing then as the neighbor in When A Killer Calls, For shame on you sir. Erica(Rhian) Roby has the required T & A scene and is as pretty as she is hungry. The ending freaked me, And not in a good way...Whatever happened to happy endings &#61516;",1144886400,,857,4.79054054054054

If you have one guy raving about Asylum movies maybe he doesnt have your best interest at heart because he works for Asylum!",1143417600,8,297,4.418181818181818
8113166,1,B000EQ5V1S,"""Hillside Cannibals"" is a ripoff of the remake of ""The Hill Have Eyes"".  I like the original ""Hills Have Eyes"", but I didn't care for the remake much, and this is much worse than the remake due to the inferior acting and pathetic plot execution.",1492214400,,245,4.444444444444445

8113170,2,B000EQ5V1S,"A group of young wannabe spelunkers get captured and eaten by ugly cannibals. Cannibals show up at about 10 minutes into the film. More characters are brought along the way because most of the earlier ones got killed and eaten. No character introduction. Pretty boring stuff.

8113172,3,B000EQ5V1S,"Hillside Cannibals is definitely no stand out in the genre of horror films.  The biggest problem is that it wants to be like the Hills Have Eyes, except it lacks any kind of memorable storyline, interesting character development, or really graphic deaths (though there ARE a few really good ones).

What the film *does* have going for it however is a really good atmosphere.  The atmosphere is actually identical to that of the Hills Have Eyes, though because of the above factors (lack of quality all around) Hillside Cannibals is definitely not in the same league.

I appreciate how the story gets going the very second the film begins.  A bunch of teens unintentionally come across some people/monsters that really like the taste of human flesh.  Some really graphic scenes then take place (one of which is REALLY cool involving a teenage girl being cut in half and having her lower half dragged across the dirt).

However, a couple of the teens manage to escape the first attempt by the flesh-eating monsters, so the majority of the storyline shows the two teens trying to escape from the entire area and completely away from danger.

The atmosphere is definitely there, but the storytelling is not.

Other than that, this honestly isn't that bad of a movie.  I recommend it for a late night helping of blood and guts to satisfy your horror-loving needs.",1280448000,,1358,4.814655172413793
8113173,1,B000EQ5V1S,"Hillside Cannibals (Leigh Scott, 2006)

As good as The Dark Knight was (see above), Hillside Cannibals is bad. I'm always in the mood for a good Hills Have Eyes ripoff. I love the original as much as I hate the remake. I hated this more than I hate the remake. And that's saying a lot.

If you've seen, or read about, or even heard of, The Hills Have Eyes, you have the basic idea here-- a bunch of young-and-beautifuls, an isolated place, some inbred cave-dwellers, and a confrontation that ends in a great deal of bloodshed. Where Scott tried to take a right turn into originality land was that instead of the focus here being on the young-and-beautifuls, after the initial confrontation, he puts the focus on the cave-dwellers. And I admit that, if such a thing were actually done correctly, this would have been the most brilliant film of its type since Wes Craven's original. The problem is that it's not pulled off correctly. No, not at all.

It's pretty obvious that screenwriter Steve Bevilacqua (responsible for the similarly painful Supercroc) had some very good ideas of where to go here; a language of grunts and gestures that never comes close to being fully realized, internal warfare, that sort of thing. On a theoretical level, it's a fascinating concept, and one I'd really like to see taken to its natural conclusion. Instead, it seems to have been used for cheap thrills. Problem is, it doesn't provide many of those, either. The scenes where the cave-dwellers hunt, torture, or otherwise interact with the ""normal"" humans are at least kind of halfway watchable, but there are too few of those to carry the whole movie, as short as it is (eighty-two minutes). So much possibility, and none of it realized. (half)",1219104000,,1731,4.763333333333334
8113174,1,B000EQ5V1S,"But it SUCKED!  OK, it started out really cool, a group of like 6 friends go on a cave exploring trip, it QUICKLY turned ugly.  I think it turned ugly too quick.  Bad news is, it STAYED ugly.  The movie stunk.  It went in circles and was just poorly done.  The acting sucked and it was totally cheap.  Stay away...unless you need something to get you fast asleep.",1205193600,,363,4.25
8113175,1,B000EQ5V1S,"The way this film is edited is the most frustrating part. You see, each shot in the film goes like this: Wide shot of the interior of a cave or closeup of dirt or skulls in dirt, caveman looking hillbilly enters the frame, walks through the frame, now hold on image of cave, dirt, or skulls in dirt for up to 8 seconds, cut and repeat! While there were some really great kills and exciting special effects in this flick.... I was so annoyed with everything else that I came to the conclusion it still was not worth it. The Hillbilly chicks were kinda hot.",1165622400,,555,4.295238095238095
