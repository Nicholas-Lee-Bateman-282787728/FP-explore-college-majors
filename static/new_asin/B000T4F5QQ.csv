8207701,3,B000T4F5QQ,"This is a highly propaganda filled film on what we now know as PTSD. Before you resign it to the newsreel and archives section, consider this. From an historical point of view, you can teach your students how far we have evolved in the treatment of PTSD as well as how limited understanding was of the disorder in the 40's and 50's.  Interestingly enough, the strong psychodynamic point of view is highly prevalent and thus permeates the treatment demonstrations and vignettes. It is a good film for the historical aspects of diagnosis and assessment, and a good teaching tool.",1189036800,4,577,4.828282828282828
