3445588,5,B001A47Q3E,"I was honestly heartbroken when the good intentions of new found friends fall short of fullfillment.  But the result from this initial disappointment was very inspirational and heartwarming.  The two boys struggle to overcome differencies in childhood and expectations through initial rivalry, then concern, compassion, and a lasting friendship as they set their united goal to secure the only Christmas present a deformed but angelic sister desires. Tis tragic and heartwrenching but serves to illustrate how God and determination can transform a tragic event into an everlasting miracle.",1363564800,2,589,5.681818181818182
