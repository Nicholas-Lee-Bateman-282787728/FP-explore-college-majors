570773,5,6303144454,"When I reviewed this tape, I thought my train-obsessed three-year old grandson might find the technical talk boring. Not so! He sits fixated through every minute of this educational and entertaining video. He laughs at the silly things he sees as  Conductor, Brakeman, Waiter, Engineer Dave works on a real train. He now knows why trains had cabooses (so do I) and lots of other facts about his fascinating trains. It's a keeper, but be prepared to hear your little engineer say, ""One more time, one more time"" over and over.",1085616000,2,525,4.769230769230769
570774,4,6303144454,"We have three of the ""There Goes A ...."" videos with Dave Hood.  Our three-year old loves them all, though I would say this is not the best one.  If you don't own ""There Goes a Fire Truck"", that one is even better and I'd recommend that instead; if, however, you are blessed with a tiny train fiend, this should be very entertaining for them (and you too).
Engineer Dave does a very good job of entertaining children while he explains the workings of various locomotives, though the device of daydreaming and then messing up on the job is used too many times, and Dave is caught sleeping on the job too.  Also, as another reviewer said, there's a long segment in which Dave climbs along a moving train to alert the engineer to a car stalled on the track up ahead.  The bad safety example is second only to the atrocious acting!  It would have been better to have spent that time showing more of these fascinating vehicles.  When the film is on track (so to speak) it is excellent.",1031184000,10,980,4.386740331491713
570775,4,6303144454,"My son is the train nut.  We own a whole series of train videos ranging from highly specialized (e.g. ""Working Steam"", about trains used Post WWII to do industrial work.) to the highly popular ""There goes a train"".  There goes a train is a very entertaining and also quite educational.  However, if you want pure trains without all the ""acting"", I recommend ""There goes a Train I and II"" and ""Choo Choo Trains: Up close and personal"".",1028073600,7,434,4.6103896103896105
570776,4,6303144454,"My 2-year-old son is also a great fan of the ""There Goes A..."" series.  As with the other early videos in the series, this video features Dave Hood as ""engineer-for-a-day"", and he takes us through different trains.  As a parent, I like the video EXCEPT for the ending portion, wherein Dave rides the train at the San Deigo railroad museum and has to ""walk"" on the outside of the train (while it's moving!) to save the train from hitting a car on the tracks.  The sequence is long, does not have any of the educational components of the other parts of the video, and seems exactly contrary to the ""safety first"" message.  Other than that, the rest is a great children's introduction to trains and railroads.",1022716800,5,706,4.579365079365079
570777,5,6303144454,"Probably the best one in our opinion!  Kids age 2 up will watch this over and over.  My son is 3 and has been watching the whole line of ""There goes a"" videos over for a year with no signs things will change soon.  What did he ask Santa for?  A new ""There goes a"" video!  We now own 6 and have rented all the others multiple times.  Forget all the PC people who say Dave and Becky sometimes aren't PC enough - it's all obviously in fun and won't even be noticed by your kids much less affect them in any way.",1010361600,2,508,3.883495145631068
570778,5,6303144454,This is our two-year old's current favourite. He demands it morning noon and night. Luckily his dad quite likes it too! It achieves an almost perfect balance between being entertaining and informative. Dave's clowning adds to the enjoyment because he doesn't let it take over and become annoying.,1005436800,2,296,5.1875
570779,5,6303144454,"My 2 year old son (and I) are great fans of the 'There goes a...' video series.  There Goes a Train was his first video and is still one of his favorites.
In the video, the host 'Dave' gets to play at being an  engineer, brakeman, conductor etc. and ends up daydreaming and goofing up  his assignments.  Having purchased five tapes in the 'There Goes a ...'  series, the videos are entertaining and educational with simple  explantations about how things (trains) work.  My 2 year old son is still  captivated by the video after having watched it dozens of times.  The 30  minute video has a number of different mini-storylines and never seems to  get boring, even for adults.",951523200,19,676,4.5966386554621845
570780,5,6303144454,"This is a great entertaining movie about trains! It shows you different varieties of trains, how they run and good safety lessons. My 4 year old son can't watch it enough!",933033600,2,171,4.548387096774194
7838897,5,6303144454,"When I was a kid, I absolutely LOVED trains and I could not get enough of this video. I had it on VHS when I was little, but the tape eventually broke. I was successfully able to get a brand new copy thanks to Amazon and it works great.

""There Goes a Train"" is one of the episodes in the ""There Goes a..."" series (a.k.a. Live Action Video For Kids or Real Wheels). While I have seen other episodes, I would still say this is the best one. The host Dave Hood explains how diesel and steam locomotives work, shows us what it's like on an Amtrak train, and gets to drive an Amtrak genesis locomotive. The acting is good and there are funny moments where Dave messes up doing something after daydreaming when being instructed such as dropping the tickets, spilling a tray of food on a table in the dining car, and making the genesis locomotive go the wrong direction (Minor complaint but when Dave drops the tickets after a backpack falls on him, you can clearly tell he dropped the tickets on purpose). Around the end of the episode, Dave bravely makes it to the front of a moving train to warn the engineer that there's a car stuck on the tracks.

This video brings back lots of memories and is great for any train lover as it's both educational and entertaining.",1505692800,,1262,4.365957446808511

7838900,5,6303144454,"I watched this movie when I was a child and I had watched it so much that it had actually started to wear out so much that it was on the verge of being unwatchable, and also watched it to the point that my father hated engineer Dave and his love of trains with a passion and had taken the vhs tape out to the desert and used the tape as a clay pigeon, all in all it made a great birthday gift for him, I'll never forget the look on his face.",1483142400,,441,3.752688172043011

7838903,5,6303144454,"To my great joy and amazement this 18 year old video(released in 1994)is delighting yet another generation of train lovers.  That's right...this was my son's all time favorite train video with all the wackiness that only engineer Dave can serve up.  My son watched it endlessly from ages 2-4, or 1997-1999.  He's now 17 and soon off to college.  Now my sister's 2 1/2 year old twins are equally smitten with train love and on a whim I looked for this classic.  Though it has not been re-released in DVD format, my sister still had a VHS player kicking around so I ordered up a used copy of ""There Goes A Train.""  I have just heard from my sister that although she wishes to kill me for unleashing this on her, her boys are utterly delighted. She senses it is destined to be watched until the tape disintegrates. Kudos to the gang that made it.",1355270400,,843,4.406451612903226
7838904,5,6303144454,"This is great. My train lover three year old loves it. It is funny and yet it is educational. They even throw in the train safety comments about staying off of tracks and so on. I particularly like that they show women and men and people of all ethnicities doing a good job. These are normal people who are proud of their work. The humor is slapstick that young kids can relate to and enjoy. This video appeals to a wide range of ages and is something that parents can enjoy.

Well worth every penny.",1151798400,,500,4.2631578947368425
7838905,5,6303144454,"this series is our childrens favorite. We bought the dvd collection, though..and I think it's a better value.  Even adults love to watch them. Just be ready to see them over and over and over.",1094169600,3,192,4.485714285714286
7838906,3,6303144454,"My kids like ""There goes a dump truck"" much more than this one. This one doesn't have much train action, and there's lots of adults talking. A much better train series for kids is the ""I Love Toy Trains"" series, which can also be found on Amazon. See my review for them...",1088294400,,272,4.25
