234367,5,6300186180,"Yeah so I gave it 5 stars, but I am not treating this movie seriously.  I've been surfing for one third of my life and understand what a true surfing movie is.  This movie is not true. IT IS CLASSIC.  My friends and  cusins have been reciting lines from this movie since I don't know when.  Whenever we see Matt Adler in a movie someome would yell Rick Kane!  And  bust out some line off the movie such as ""He's out surfing...with  rick""  A classic humorous movie to an open minded movie watcher. So  watch it for that reason, and bust on all your hauli friends.  Because when  it comes down to it we are all a bunch of Rick Kanes.  ""when you are  ready, but first you must master all the rest""  WATCH IT OVER AND  OVER! THIS MOVIE ROCKS.",949449600,,738,4.127659574468085

This classic line spoken by Vince Mohaloka(Gerry Lopez), alone should have sealed an Oscar nomination, but mainstream society just does not comprehend the complexity  of his character.

234370,4,6300186180,THis is one of my all time favorite movies despite its inconsistancies (e.g. one minute the guy is riding facing the wave then later on that same wave he's riding backing the waves) and its improbabilities(e.g. from wave  tank to Waimea in one season...YEAH RIGHT!). Turtle makes this movie.  Iwould REALLY like for it ro be released on DVD since the surf in the movie  is KILLER!,923961600,2,380,4.641791044776119

I can appreciate this film and the awesome Hawaiian backdrop that it is set in.  From Rick Kane's start in wave tank  in Arizona, to his adventures around the North Shore of Ouahu, this trip is  one in a million.  I encourage anyone who enjoys the thrill of the ocean to  partake in this incredible wave sliding film.

234871,3,6300186180,"This movie would be great if you're not from Hawaii.  First, the locals boys are portrayed very poorly, so typical of mainland mentality.  2nd, a teenage surf champion from Arizona who learns to surf in a pool with man made waves, is going to Hawaii and surf, real waves, from the ocean and does it unexpectedly well enough for someone who has never been in the ocean.  I think one of the most authentic parts is when Gregory Harrison teaches him that true surfers, does it for the enjoyment, not for the fame and glory . . he also taught him how to study the water, how to watch for the low and high tides, the placement of the coral reef, etc, which is usually taught at a young age . .  I especially like the parts with Gerry Lopez, one of my favorites, but if you know your way around Hawaii, watch the surfing closely, you will notice, he surfing at  different locations, from the North Shore all the way to the West Side . . .  One minute he's surfing lefts, and then he switches and surfing rights . . . and no offense, but I hope you ""mainlanders"" do not watch this movie and think, oh yeah, I just need a few months in Hawaii with a surfing instructor and then I too can surf Waimea, Healeiwa, Sandy's, etc. etc.  because let me tell you, if you are not a surfer, there is no way in you can learn to surf perfectly by mastering the board and wave like that, not in a matter of weeks, even if you did surf every day, you could not master it like that.  Surfing, is s sport, like any other sport, you need the take the time to gain experience so you can really learn it, tweak it, perfect it.  If it was that easy, half the tourist coming to Hawaii, would al be professional surfers . . . . I think it was a pretty good movies for the younger children to learn valuable lessons about surfing. . .  LOL, yeah, almost like the Karate Kid, but on a board in the ocean . .",1435708800,3,1875,4.098360655737705

We were pleasantly surprised.  The acting wasn't great but was better than expected, the scenery, local shots and surfing footage were great and the plot was good as well.  The plot reminded us a bit of Soul Surfer, which we love.  In North Shore we got a good laugh over the hair styles, music, shorts and hideous high wasted bikinis.  All in all it is a good family flick and if you love all things surfing you will enjoy the surf filming.",1405728000,,590,4.416666666666667

It has some funny parts as well as some drama.  I showed this movie to some roommates and friends and they were clapping in the end they loved it so much.

235067,5,6300186180,"Definitely a corny mid-80's flick akin to ""Real Genius"" and the ""Goonies"" with C-grade acting, really cheap sets and a rough script but somehow pulls it together holistically in a memorable flick with some incredible scenic footage, earnest characters you can empathize with -both pro- and antagonist alike, and pretty cool music soundtrack. This movie has a powerful message about overcoming difficulties by not fighting adversity but rather bending to it and working on the inner-self to endure and adapt. This message is coupled with a good reflection by the protagonist in that the intrinsic motivation of something you enjoy is often reward enough, a good message for these jaded, materialistic times. Here the trial for Rick Kane to overcome is backdrop of surfing the North Shore's infamously large waves and fitting into local Hawaiian culture.
  Saw this on the U-channels (man, that dates me....) at during the midnight movie in the late 80's and enjoyed it a lot, in fact I credit it for helping to inspire me to make a different type of pilgrimmage, in this case a thru-hike of the AT, some half-dozen years later.

This movie tells the story of Rick Kane (Matt Adler), a surfer from Tempe, Arizona, who decides to travel to Hawaii to conquer the 'monster' waves of the North Shore (filmed on location in Hawaii) before he heads to art school in New York in the fall.  Rick thinks he has the skills to surf the North Shore after winning a surf contest in a simulated wave tank.  Unlilke the proverbial 'fish out of water,' Rick soons finds that he is an unwelcome fish in water, and he's in over his head.

When he arrives in Hawaii, Rick meets a couple of surfers who teach him a few things- one of them being that he's not ready to surf the North Shore (great cinematography); however, Rick continues to insist he can surf with the best.  Instead, Rick learns that the waves of the North Shore are nothing like the simulated waves of Arizona.  After a run-in with the locals (the Hui), Rick learns that 'haoles' like him are not welcome in Hawaii and that he'd better stay out of the locals' way both on land and in the water.

Soon after, young Rick meets a local named Turtle, who introduces him to Chandler (Gregory Harrison), a local surfer and surfboard maker who has accepted the customs of the locals and their culture.  Under the guidance and tutelage of Chandler (kind of like Yoda training Luke Skywalker), Rick gradually learns to surf.  More importantly, though, Rick learns that true surfers are out on the waves because they love it out there, not because they seek fame and fortune.  Rick also happens to meet a local girl named Kiani (Nia Peeples- hot!) who is sympathetic to Rick and helps him feel more comfortable during his stay in Hawaii.

As Rick gets better, he captures the attention of a local surf photographer who convinces him to enter the Pipeline Classic.  This provides Rick the opportunity to compete with the world's best surfers even though entering the contest conflicts with Chandler's philosophy of being a 'Soul Surfer.'  Still, Rick enters the contest and soon finds himself in competition with Lance Burkhart, his one-time hero.

Will Rick have enough skill to beat Lance Burkhart and achieve his dream of surfing fame?  I guess you'll have to stay loose, barney, and watch the whole movie.",1166140800,2,2463,4.651270207852194

235376,5,6300186180,"""North Shore"" tells the story of Rick Kane (Matt Adler), a naive Arizona boy who dreams of competitive success surfing the big winter swells which thunder onto the North Shore of Oahu in beautiful Hawaii. What Rick lacks in experience (Arizona is not exactly an international surf Mecca), he makes up for in outright ignorance of the danger. In the words of one distinctly unimpressed Hawaiian kid, Rick is ""J.O.J."" - ""just off the jet!"" It seems Hawaii is not quite ready for Rick Kane and he is certainly unready for the challenge of the North Shore.

Thus, Rick embarks upon a struggle for self-knowledge and acceptance every bit as challenging as learning how to survive those magnificent waves that pound Waimea Bay and Sunset Beach. Nor is it just the water which threatens to rearrange his anatomy. The Hui, a local Hawaiian surf club and Vince, their laconic, tough guy leader (played by Hawaiian surf legend, Jerry Lopez) take a thorough dislike to him. This enmity is further intensified by Rick's (very understandable) interest in Vince's cousin, the lovely Kiani (Nia Peeples).

Kiani proves to be a good friend, as does the likeable Turtle (John Philbin), a local surfer whose heart is as big as his smile. And then there is Chandler (Gregory Harrison). As Obewan is to Luke Skywalker, Chandler is to young Rick. He mentors Rick into big wave surfing - a decision which, for a time, he lives to regret. Rick has his heart set on the competitive surfing Chandler hates because, as he says, it ""brings out the worst in the human animal."" Thus the stage is set for a ripping little surf drama, made on location at the splendid North Shore.

In this movie, the egotistical pursuit of material gain at any cost is represented for what it is: a game for professional losers like Lance Burkhart (played by giant wave rider and highly respected North Shore identity, Laird Hamilton). In a world immersed in materialism, superficiality and televised violence, a kid could do worse than take on board the true aloha spirit which pervades this engaging narrative.

If you already have the VHS version, get the DVD for your collection. The additional features (especially the interviews with the cast) are well worth it. And remember that you don't have to be a surfer to enjoy ""North Shore."" Ignore the cynical criticisms of the ignorant; see it for yourself.

Maybe, like this reviewer, it will cause you to go see the actual North Shore for yourself too. The old heiau (sacred site) where Kiani and Rick go walking is still there in all its ruined majesty and, down below in Waimea Bay, there are real surfers riding very real, incredibly powerful waves, just like in the film. As Kiani says in fond farewell, ""You [will] come back to the North Shore!"" Just press ""play"" and this cool DVD will take you there - again and again and again.",1113523200,22,2841,4.742914979757085

I don't even live anywhere near the ocean, and I'm not a guy either.  But I still love this movie.  I've never surfed, but I've always loved to watch it on TV.  It seems like such a blast.

This movie is majorly cheesy and a bit far-fetched, IMHO.  Like I said, I'm no surfer, but I would imagine that a guy who has never surfed on 'real' waves would never be able to master the Pipeline waves in just a few weeks.  Those waves have taken down great surfers so that part was a bit unbelievable.  But in the end, it doesn't really matter because this movie is so much darn fun.  Sure, it's cheesy and the acting is sub-par, but it's beautifully filmed and just a blast to watch...especially if you like to watch people ride the waves.

So even if you aren't a surfer, this movie could be for you...at least if you enjoy watching surfing.  If you don't like surfing and don't like watching it, then bypass this movie 'cause you won't like it.  But for a bit of fun, this movie rocks!",1110499200,4,1109,4.169811320754717

And while he tumbles, wipes-out, and is slammed into the reef both figuratively and literally, the movie never loses its meditative feel. At the films conclusion one feels a sense of loss-kind of like when a powerful wave diminishes-it was a great ride but we all know it must end. Perhaps this is as ""corny"" as the lei Chandler hangs on Rick at the end, but not to worry, everything fits calmly into the peaceful motion of this movie.",1103068800,,572,4.40566037735849

It's hard to say what it is, but this movie is an absolute classic! No vulgarity, nudity, or violence. Just an all-around great ""feel good movie."" With of course, so many memorable quotes. No doubt my favorite movie of all time!
Anyways, we found out that Philbin is now teaching surf lessons in Southern California. After finding this out, we jumped at the chance to have him teach us. We packed our stuff and flew out from the east coast to Cali. What a great experience! I loved this movie as a kid, and to be paddling out in the Pacific Ocean with Turtle was an absolute thrill! Philbin's a very cool guy and an excellent surf instructor. If you have the means and are going to be in So.

Almost all of the shots are of Pipeline, which is great for that, but I would have liked to have seen more shots of other areas (I would have liked a five-hour movie, too, but there wouldn't be many Hollywood viewers then).
The ""plot"" is very thin (think of a watered down ""Karate Kid""). Fortuntately, the ""romance"" is toned down although it is a factor. The ending seemed to go a little too fast, possibly due to budget constraints, but it works. Yes, the one-liners and names are great and really give a warm fuzzy feeling to the movie.
Although this was low-budget, it is still pretty good. There are a couple scenes with poor dubbing, but most of the other editing is very good. The water shots are great. The acting is very good, except for a few instances (they probably didn't have the budget for reshoots).
The transfer to DVD is excellent. I had seen it when it first came out and several times when it came out on video. The DVD version is excellent quality and could easily pass for a very good quality film today.
Definitely a feel-good movie, enjoyable alone, with a date or with family.",1043971200,9,1333,4.558333333333334

235494,5,6300186180,"I've long been a fan of this movie. It's the typical 'teen, summer, gotta win the contest and the girl' coming of age story, and yet, it somehow transends the genre.
The story, as you might have guessed from the other reviews is fairly standard,'boy comes to hawaii to surf the season before college..meets kooky characters, falls in love and enters the big surfing competition...but that is what the genius of the movie is built on..
on top of that basic premise, the movie offers
* charming memorable characters,
* more quotable lines than even 'swingers'..and that's saying alot..
* a cute love story...
* some of the best surfing footage ever shown in a theatrical release...including recent fare like 'blue crush'
now..this is a dvd review....
the new dvd release has some GREAT interviews with the cast. Not old file footage either, but new, as of last month type stuff...excellent interviews...you can see what the cast looks like today...and WOW...unbelievable how young they all still look....
very enjoyable extras like the interviews, deleted scenes...and my fave...a very awkward alternative ending with the original casted female lead...lets just say you can tell why she was let go...pretty, and most likely a good actress, but wow..ZERO chemistry with matt adler...and hey...for gods sakes..would someone cast him in a new movie?...i heard he's friends with george clooney...come ON george..get this dude a role!...
anyhow..this dvd is absolutely fantastic, and for all of you fans, this is a MUST OWN....the quality is first rate, the transfer and clean up really blows me away, the sound is crystal, and wow..seeing it finally in wide screen was worth the wait...absolute perfection...
a 10!

I taped it, wore that one out, bought it again, watched it a few hundred more times and now, just purchased the DVD. In short IT ROCKS! Features include an alternate ending, a few deleted scenes and, my personal fav, interviews with the cast and crew. It's interesting seeing what they look like now (Chandler and Kiani look exactly the same) and how the movie changed the courses of some of the stars' lives.

It has some of the greatest surfing footage every filmed for a movie and needs to be seen in a crisp clear widescreen format!  Some of the best surfers who ever lived get to act in this movie.

It captures the atmosphere of the North Shore perfectly from the Hawaiian  gangs (""the Hui"") to the local idiom (""Hey haole"",  ""howly to you too!"").  The inclusion of Mark Occhilupo in an  acting role perhaps wasn't the best casting decision.  As far as acting is  concerned Occy is a good surfer.
