3146887,5,B0015QT770,"The District was a uniquely insightful, intelligent and often amusing police drama set in Washington DC.  It starred among others: Craig T Nelson as a chief of police willing to shake things up to see things change for the better.  His supporting cast included the wonderful Lynne Thigpen, Jonathan La Paglia, Sean Patrick Thomas and quite a few other talented actors.

Why is it in this day and age of shallow, shlock reality drivel that a show this good remains unavailable on DVD?  Many inferior offerings are available, yet this show which is worth watching again and again is not.  I think that's a shame.

I hope this will be remedied soon...  Fans deserve better.",1237852800,13,670,4.773913043478261

Although the show had very strong storylines, it is remarkable the amount of ""family and or personal"" drama that was included for all the principal characters.

""Torchwood"" is great fun watching. ""The District"" is just plain boring. The actors look bored, too. Do the United States have the most boring federal capital in the world?

You know, on one of the episodes when the Chief was fighting for his job and he was moving into the not so nice area of DC, I was moved with how he was adapting to his community. So moved that if the show continued, especially after taking on the Mayor and getting his job back, I would have liked to see the show as Mannion runs for DC City Council. One season could be as she makes that run and the District would run with Mannion in the City Council, woking with new chief Nolan, still stepping up to the Deputy Mayors and Mr. Mayor(or Mrs. Mayor) itself. I think this show could have gone on. Sorry for being so long winded, but I miss that show. I am looking for the DVD set...where can I find it? I have done some searching...and to no avail.

3381405,1,B0015QT770,"I for one don't want ""The District"" released on DVD. It's shown on a Swedish channel immediately before ""Torchwood"" (a sci-fi series about a bisexual hit squad in Cardiff fighting aliens).

""Torchwood"" is great fun watching. ""The District"" is just plain boring. The actors look bored, too. Do the United States have the most boring federal capital in the world? A couple of UFOs might do the trick, though. Unless the UFO occupants die of sheer boredom, watching some congressional subcommittee taking a nap.",1268870400,,508,5.0476190476190474
3381406,5,B0015QT770,"After living in Washington DC and seeing a character doing something in DC that makes sense, I enjoyed The District! You know, on one of the episodes when the Chief was fighting for his job and he was moving into the not so nice area of DC, I was moved with how he was adapting to his community. So moved that if the show continued, especially after taking on the Mayor and getting his job back, I would have liked to see the show as Mannion runs for DC City Council. One season could be as she makes that run and the District would run with Mannion in the City Council, woking with new chief Nolan, still stepping up to the Deputy Mayors and Mr. Mayor(or Mrs. Mayor) itself. I think this show could have gone on. Sorry for being so long winded, but I miss that show. I am looking for the DVD set...where can I find it? I have done some searching...and to no avail. Maybe we can draw a petition letter to get out DVDs.",1263859200,2,918,4.162921348314606
3381407,5,B0015QT770,"I have searched everywhere for a boxed DVD set of The District to no avail. There are people advertising sets, but I assume they are ""boot leg"" copies. Buyers beware of boot leg copies made by copying off TV. (They are always inferior & obviously involve copyright infringment). Every year my wife puts this set on her Christmas list & sadly, I can't get it for her. Please bring The District to DVD!!",1260057600,8,401,4.506849315068493

I see there are many fans like myself waiting patiently and it has been at least 3 years since the last episode was broadcast on regular television so it is about time it became available.",1258588800,16,451,4.380952380952381

There were so many beautiful and poignant values and moments that made you think hard.  Please Hollywood/A&E put the seasons on DVD.  I have a friend who is a law enforcement officer who really would enjoy this material.

Hurry up. With all the modern technology we have maybe it could be ready by Christmas.",1253664000,19,467,4.8734177215189876
