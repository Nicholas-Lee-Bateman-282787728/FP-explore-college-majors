6452541,4,B00KWP6JGW,"This is a very different story for Greer Garson.  Probably the only  Western she ever made....  Good story line..
Dana Andrews  plays his role very well.  Gets a little competition  in his role as he only Doctor in town till
Garson shows up.",1414800000,,241,4.488372093023256
6452542,3,B00KWP6JGW,"Predictable film fare.  This is well mounted and nicely photographed in OK WarnerColor.  Again it has Greer Garson and she is fun to watch, but Lois Smith almost steals the film in a very light weight role that is totally different from what she has always done.  She should have had a better film career, but was successful and respected over the years with her many splendid Broadway performances.  This is an entertaining fifties film.",1408752000,4,438,4.8

6452545,5,B00KWP6JGW,"I watched this the other night and I really enjoyed it,because this is one of Greer Garsons movies that I had never seen before,but love all of the actors..Lois Smith,Dana Andrews,Greer Garson..and alot of times I don't watch westerns..but because Greer Garson and Dana Andrews was in it..that was the main reason...or sometimes I might buy..a John Wayne Western or war movie,or a might get a Clint Eastern movie for my husband if it his is B-Day..but I generally don't buy Westerns for myself,I like movies that are drama, or drama/romantic movies,mysteries..{like I like The Lady From Shangai w/Rita Hayworth and Orson Welles my husband doesn't},I also like some Science Finction,Bible epics and also some WW1 and WW2 movies and period movies..ones that are from the 18th and 19th century and early 20th century.... Like I am I really am enjoying Masterpiece Classic Mr. Selfridge right now..{the movies I really hate though are horror movies}...but I am really glad I got this one",1404086400,,983,5.03680981595092
8662216,4,B00KWP6JGW,"All hail Greer Garson, one of Hollywood's best ever. Even in her more obscure motion pictures, she shines with the potency of a hundred stars. Take STRANGE LADY IN TOWN, which released in 1955, when Garson was closer to being past her heyday. It's a western drama with its theme song sung by Frankie Laine.

It's 1880, and a new physician has arrived at the little town of Sante Fe, New Mexico. Except Dr. J.W. Garth isn't quite what's been advertised. J.W. - for Julie Winslow - is very much a woman, formerly of Boston until she beat feet, driven away by that city's show of rampant bigotry and intolerance. In Santa Fe, she hopes for a fair shake. Hahahaha!

Dr. Garth is staying with her brother (Cameron Mitchell), a troubled cavalier lieutenant, whom she hadn't seen in five years. You'll note that Lt. David Garth is stewing under a rumor of having sold a batch of stolen cattle to his Army. So, right away, there's something brewing from the home front. Never mind that David, all smiles and ease of comportment, keeps to his pretense of there's nothing wrong.

""First, do no harm"" is the sawbones' credo, but I guess, for local doctor Dr. Rourke O'Brien (Dana Andrews), it doesn't apply to his new colleague. Julie is warned on her very first night that Dr. O'Brien has it out for her, that surly misogynist. He's been heard to say, ""A woman's place is under a man's thumb.""

Conversely, Dr. O'Brien's teen daughter is right neighborly. Carlotte Isabel O'Brien - a.k.a. ""Spurs"" - is played by Lois Smith, and the great irony to me is that someone so delightful would have a name as humdrum as Lois Smith. It's not easy to steal thunder away from Greer Garson, but Lois Smith does it with ease and with frequency. She was a natural onscreen, and the camera doted on her. Too, she had a distinctive way of delivering her lines. Playing a tomboyish girl taking tentative steps towards womanhood, Smith is a fresh breeze that blows in on a sticky, sweltering day. I love everything about her interpretation of ""Spurs,"" from her go-to expletive - ""Holy Joe!"" - to her habit of calling her dad by his surname. Anyway, Spurs right away regards Dr. Garth as her role model. She champions her, even against - or especially against - her resentful father.

Julie Winslow Garth means to introduce new ways of treating patients. She waxes rhapsodic about Joseph Lister's pioneering methodology which includes his revolutionary antiseptic, the carbolic spray. She's invited by the priest to help out at the mission hospital. It's all too much for Dr. O'Brien who feels steadily diminished in her shadow. Heck, even Billy the Kid falls in her debt, what with her having treated his friend on her very first night in Santa Fe.

But Dr. O'Brien is also a widower, and he can't help but admire his green-eyed, red-headed adversary, and her spunk and her temper.

I will say that STRANGE LADY IN TOWN does go on a bit too long. We get it that O'Brien's judgy attitude, coupled with her brother's notoriety, conspire to eventually turn the town against Julia. Add to that the general attitude of folks living in that era, their belief that there's no call for a woman to be a professioanl doctor. As sucky as this world is right now, progress has been made. We don't nowadays think twice about what gender a doctor is, and this applies in most professions. But, circa 1880, a professional woman must've battled prejudice and resistance on a daily basis.

Speaking of battling, Greer Garson's professionalism almost cost her her life. She was fighting a case of appendicitis during the shoot in Santa Fe, and she refused to get an appendectomy lest the company be shut down. By the time the on-location shooting was done and the company had relocated to Hollywood for further lensing, Greer's condition had worsened. When she finally got her appendectomy, it was almost too late. I wonder if they used Lister's carbolic spray?

To me, it's a curious film in that I didn't care much for the romance that develops between the two leads. Dana Andrews did such a good job of being unlikable and mean to our heroine that I couldn't warm up to him. And I actually started judging Garson's character for falling for him. My favorite scenes, instead, became those that had Lois Smith in them. I IMDb'd her and learned that she wasn't much on the silver screen, having instead made career in theater and television. This sucks, as I would've liked to have seen more of her when she was younger, and a lot of those old television shows she guest-starred in aren't available anywhere. As it were, in her 20s, she was in EAST OF EDEN and in this one.",1533427200,,4627,4.653610771113831
