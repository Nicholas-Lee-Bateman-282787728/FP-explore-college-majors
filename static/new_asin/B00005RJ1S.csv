1655595,5,B00005RJ1S,"I'm a college student who was recently diagnosed with IBS.  A homeopath recommended Yoga to me, but with my busy lifestyle, I didn't know if I could fit an hour or so of Yoga into my life.  Then, I came across this DVD.  The two different 20 minute sessions are great and easy to integrate into a busy lifestyle.  The choice between morning ""prepping for the day"" and evening ""de-stress"" are excellent, as some days I have time in the morning and others time in the evening.  The instructors are overall great at cueing you.  They also offer moderated and more advanced forms of several of the poses, making it great for progression.  The background music is wonderful as well.  This the first exercise regimen I have maintained for months in my life.  It's been 4 months, and I am still doing it multiple times a week.  I've maintained it, not only because of the ease of integrating into my life, but also because it actually genuinely makes me feel better.  My IBS symptoms have greatly lessened.  I was suffering severely seven days a week, sometimes enough to have to miss some classes (I'm a very serious student).  However, now I generally only have one bad day of symptoms a week, and even then I can generally make it to class.  I highly recommend this DVD, and Yoga in general, to everyone, but especially to anyone else suffering from IBS.",1146873600,11,1350,4.570833333333334
1655596,5,B00005RJ1S,"Yoga Zone workouts are very basic with very clear instructions.

I enjoy their ""down to earth"" quality and their ""real people"" instructors. I spent some time in LA teaching yoga myself (Kripalu style) so I appreciate ""real"".

These two 20 minute sets are a good way to center your body at the start of the day and unwind at the end of it.",1146614400,6,338,4.349206349206349
1655597,5,B00005RJ1S,"I have been doing Yoga with the Yoga Zone DVD series for 7 weeks now.  I purchased this to add to the variety of my practices.  Given that I am newbie, this is a wonderful DVD to follow and I feel wonderful after I am done.  I believe I have become addicted to Yoga!  Better than being addicted to chocolate!!!  I recommend that you give this DVD and the other Yoga Zone DVD's a go. I find them rewarding and I am sure you will too.",1142726400,7,432,3.9767441860465116
1655598,5,B00005RJ1S,Love the 20 minute workouts from Yoga Zone. Great to pop in before going to work in the morning and a wonderful way to relax at night before going to bed.,1131408000,4,154,4.0
1655599,5,B00005RJ1S,"I love yoga zone, especially Al & Jen, so this tape was a great fit for me.  The 20 minute practices are perfect when you don't have a lot of time in the morning or evening (and if you do, you can combine it with other 20 minute practices from other yoga zone dvds to get a good workout).  The first session really 'wakes up' your back, which is a nice gentle reminder throughout the day to keep sitting tall.  The second is concentrated on legs and hips - but it's all worth it when you hit the final stretch and feel the release.",1128470400,11,531,4.086538461538462
1655600,5,B00005RJ1S,"Unlike most of the reviewers of Yoga Zone videos, I wasn't familiar with it. Never saw it on TV.  Now I wish I had bought one of the bigger collections. The people are real, down to earth, not perfect.  There are two 20-minute routines. It's very straight-forward, easy to follow and they go at a perfect pace. I've been doing yoga for several years but my flexibility is somewhat lmiited. The video takes place outside at a resort in Jamaica somewhere with Calypso-type music in the background. There are two instructors and one does the more advanced and the other does modified, so you can follow whichever you want.  Both of the routines make me break a sweat. For me, this is a great video that I can pop in either for 20 or 40 minutes. It goes by really fast!",1118361600,20,765,4.411347517730497
1655601,5,B00005RJ1S,"Sunrise and Sunset was one of the first Yoga Zone tapes I came across. I had already been doing yoga for many years when I first found it at my library and I had a pretty large collection at home at that point already (now numbering over 70 yoga programs).

 I was pleasently surprised by how well rounded the routines were and how much I enjoyed the vibe of the tapes. I soon ordered the Yoga Basics 5 tape set which I enjoy on the days when I don't have the energy or time to do a longer or more intense program.

 The instructors are easy to follow, enthusiastic without being obnoxious and knowledgeable. They keep a nice steady flow, give enough instruction without overdoing the details (which would inhibit the flow) and demonstrate everything beautifully.

 Alan Finger is basically the ""brains"" behind the series and his style of Yoga has some really interesting characteristics (see his book). An example would be a pose flow like Extended Cat Seal which moves from the extended position of a Cat pose (the backbend position with belly lower from a table position), then moving thru the hunched position (with the back rounded) and continuing into child's pose and then flowing in reverse order back to the extended Cat position.

 Many of the movements have similar type ""dynamic"" flows rather than just statically held postures. Of course more static postures are incorporated as well, but they are balanced with the more flowing ones.

 This particular program is of Moderate intensity, slightly more challenging than some of the Yoga Zone Basics programs (though there are some moderately challening one's there) but not as hard as some of the longer and more difficult Yoga Zone programs (and they have some tough one's out there).

 I HIGHLY recommend Sunrise and Sunset for those of you who want to get a slight sweat and a wonderful overall feeling throughout your body.

 Namaste.",1094342400,52,1899,4.820987654320987
1655602,4,B00005RJ1S,"The workouts are pretty good, with the first one being easier and gentle, so that you don't overwork yourself in the morning when you're stiff. The second is a little tougher, which is actually what you want for a PM workout.
As an aside, I noticed that a lot of people think that PM tapes are meant to be done right before bed. This is WRONG. I've read from several sources, including Yoga Journal, Patricia Walden, Gaiam, and Living Arts that ""AM/PM"" really means dawn and dusk.
Ancient yogis only (or really often, not certain about this) used to do their practices at dawn and dusk. Most of these titles operate on the assumption that everyone knows this. Everyone obviously does not. PM tapes are meant to de-stress you after work; they're ""supposed"" to be done around 3 hours before you plan to sleep.
I hope this information helps.",1032912000,107,838,4.630872483221476
1655603,5,B00005RJ1S,"I've always liked Yoga Zone routines. This one makes me feel so good afterwards. Relaxing, stretching but with a bit of a challenge for your muscles as well. The only thing I don't like about Yoga Zone is they are never quite 20 minutes. The 2 routines on this DVD are 18 minutes each. However, if you want a longer workout, just do both!",1363651200,,338,4.296875
1655604,4,B00005RJ1S,"This is the second Yoga Zone DVD I have used, the other being the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yoga-Zone-Introduction-to-Power-Yoga/dp/B00005A05Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yoga Zone - Introduction to Power Yoga</a>.  This DVD contains two 18 minute workouts.  The first is an easier morning workout.  Aside from one section in the middle in which you spend lots of time balancing in a lunge and in a warrior pose, the workout is not that strenuous.  The second workout is a lot more demanding, and is good for burning stress at the end of the day.  If I have any criticism, it is that the first workout isn't enough to get me really energized, and the second workout is too strenuous to do every day.  I honestly prefer the first workout on Intro to Power Yoga to either of these workouts, but these two workouts are useful for mixing things up here and there.  18 minutes of yoga a day for 8 weeks has produced some fantastic results for both my wife and me, so if you are looking for a good way to get in shape that won't take too much time out of your schedule, Yoga Zone is for you.",1305849600,3,1133,4.869791666666667
1655605,4,B00005RJ1S,"I love being able to squeeze 20 minutes of yoga in my busy life as a mom of 2 young kids and starting the day with the sunrise part is just wonderful! I feel energetic and ready for the day!
Same goes with the sunset part; it's not boring like so many other PM yoga DVDs, but yet it leaves you nicely relaxed afterward.
In my opinion,  you can't go wrong with any of the Yoga Zone DVDs!",1222992000,3,386,3.948717948717949
1655606,5,B00005RJ1S,I have many different yoga tapes and find this one very relaxing and invigorating. I have done it every morning before work and it starts my day off just right!,1222128000,,160,4.366666666666666
1655607,4,B00005RJ1S,"This is not a bad DVD for the time crunched. Twenty minutes each segment.
The only complaint I have is that the Sunset segment is not about winding down and relaxing.  It seems just as energetic as the Sunrise.  But they are both very good and together they make a nice practice.",1188777600,3,279,4.346153846153846
1655608,5,B00005RJ1S,"I've had several Yoga Zone DVDs in my collection for some time.  I love the 20-minute practice format, esp on busy weekdays when I simply cannot get to an evening class.  I've done both PM programs several times; they are challenging, but not so difficult that you can't do both, if time allows.  Recently, I opted for the first ""Sunrise"" practice (there are two of each) as an alternate to Rodney Yee/Patricia Walden AM/PM Yoga.  As I get older, I definitely notice a tendency to have a stiff back in the morning, and these practices work wonders.  They are gentle enough for the morning, but also energizing, a great start to the day.  The evening practices contain lots of hip openers etc, which are great after a long day of sitting at a desk.  As always, YZ instructors are thorough and engaging.  Will make a nice addition to your yoga DVD collection.",1175126400,10,857,4.592105263157895
1655609,4,B00005RJ1S,"This is a good DVD for me because I can't really make the excuse that I don't have 20 minutes to do a workout. I'm not sure that I necessarily feel more energized (Sunrise) or serene (Sunset) after doing these routines, but I'm still learning the routines and haven't gotten to the point where I'm probably focusing on the nuances of the poses.
These are more aerobic workouts than the Yoga Journal AM/PM. I'm not a total couch potato, but I'm starting to breathe hard by the middle of the practice, which makes it somewhat harder to flow with the poses. Still, I enjoy this disc enough that I plan to stick with it and see if I can get to the point where I can finish without getting out of breath. I like that they build up several of the sequences by adding 1 move at a time, and that once you get the sequence, you get to repeat it several times.",1173398400,4,850,4.220858895705521
1655610,3,B00005RJ1S,"I've practiced yoga for five years, and enjoyed this video.  However, I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who is just beginning, working on an injury, or attached to slow, intraspective practice.  The instruction is fast-paced, and the basics of posture, balance and alignment are not well-explained.",1170979200,11,299,5.478260869565218
1655611,1,B00005RJ1S,"I have a lot of yoga dvds and this is by far my least favorite.  Not at all what  I expected it to be. Don't see how they think one is for morning and one is for evening. I think the morning is a time when you should work gently on flexibility cause you are stiff. This dvd doesn't really work on flexibility at all.  The dvd is like an aerobic workout that uses yoga poses. If you are doing yoga for exercise alone this might be good for you. That is not what yoga is about for me. If you want a good one, try the Gaiam AM and PM yoga with Rodney Yee and Patricia Walden.",1159660800,7,572,3.830508474576271
1655612,5,B00005RJ1S,"I started doing yoga to help relieve my chronic lower back pain due to a herniated disk. I have tried many yoga methods and routines. Some have caused even greater pain! I like to excercise at home so I have lots of DVD's. Of all the Yoga Zone choices this one is my favorite. The first 20 minute workout focuses on stretching the spine. In the morning the warm ups feel so good before going further into the routine which continues to work the spine. After I'm done I feel stronger, my backache is gone and I'm ready to tackle my day.

The second routine I do in the evening which twists and stretches out the day's stiffness and stress. I highly recommend this DVD!",1153180800,8,667,4.336
