8020390,2,B000228SIW,"I was looking forward to this movie.  The problem is, the sound man was deaf, so he mixed everything ""up front"" throughout the film.  Great idea for a documentary.  But at the beginning, the silent clips had a background piano which was not bad.  However it also had a narrator who was mixed so far back that the music was louder than the announcer.  And so it continued throughout the film...the narrator was mixed so far under the music that he was useless.

I was really looking forward to this, but i had to skip through it.  About fifteen minutes of that loud music mix was all I could take. Useless unless you like attempting to hear the announcer over the loud piano music.

BAD, bad sound mix.",1330560000,,701,4.421875
8020391,2,B000228SIW,"""Slapstick Too"" is a brief (no special features) hour and a half overview of clips from various slapstick films highlighting these main actors.  Sadly, there are no film titles.  Although the film does compare the slapstick of the early century to clips from films of the late 30's, I was hoping for more car, plane, and train chases and even the Keystone Cops.  The final five minutes is worth watching because of the funny quick montage set to ""can can"" music.  Being a Laurel and Hardy fan, I was glad to see their moments, but this 1998 version lacks some of the funny sight gags set to turn-of-the century LA.

I know that I've seen another VHS from before the 90's that did highlight the Keystone Cops and that they are probably fading on VHS, too expensive to buy on DVD, or in a vault somewhere.  A great for young ones and the family to rent, but probably worth less to buy than the retail price.",1162512000,5,905,4.421686746987952
