8227122,4,B000X7SDY0,"Strange curio of dark side of the Depression, with dime-a-dance beauty (and she is a beauty) swindling bookie Armstrong out of his ""big bucks"" (about $22), who seeks revenge by duping her into backing a down-and-out Gilbert & Sullivan revival company in which she is to play a role.  Sad accidental insights into how bad the Depression must have been (""75 cents?  75 cents!?  For what?"" goes one piece of Armstrong's dialog at the dancehall) - and nice view into the future of the US, alas.  The G&S troupe are generally wonderful, with hammy but funny Sergeant (Penzance)/ Mikado, good Buttercup (Pinafore), great Three Little Maids (Mikado), and decent comic baritone Sir Joseph (Pinafore)/ Koko (Mikado);  exceptionally rich-voiced straightman bass/baritone.  Well worth a watch, and quite a creditable Mikado's entrance scene and finale from Mikado.",1324771200,,853,5.281481481481482
8227123,2,B000X7SDY0,"I enjoyed this film for what it was, but be warned that some ""genius"" had the idea to stretch the film, for dvd, to wide screen format (the old ""bigger is better"" nonsense). As a result, the actors appear some what squat and the distortion is apparant. Because of that problem, I gave the film 2 stars. If the film had been presented in its proper aspect ratio, I would have given it a 3 star rating.",1242086400,2,400,4.207792207792208
