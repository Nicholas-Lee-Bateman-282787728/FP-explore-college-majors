8428920,5,B004GOMMJ8,"I bought this dvd to research some places that i would like to dive around the world. It is a 'bucket list' of the absolute best diving spots in the world. If you are planning a dive trip and not sure of where to go then you must have this dvd. Also if you love the underwater world and have an interest in seeing many sea creatures, corals, underwater scenery and beautiful images then you will enjoy this film. A professional production, great camera work, editing..it will remind you of watching National Geographic and BBC films.",1399852800,,533,4.5625
