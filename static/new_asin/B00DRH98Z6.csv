My husband is hard of hearing and I'd have to hit pause and explain the dialog. In fact, I don't have a hearing problem, and I thought the sound was rather muffled.  So the sound quality was an issue that was distracting.  Another technical issue was that the DVD would get stuck in places.  I'd have to go back to the beginning of the episode and fast forward past the stuck place. Very annoying. The story lines were too formulaic--another problem. The main characters were never developed enough.  I rarely give British series just a 3-star, but this one was rather ""flat"".",1503964800,,691,4.677685950413223
