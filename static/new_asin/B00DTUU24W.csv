8597663,5,B00DTUU24W,"This is the second to last Mr. Moto film starring Peter Lorre. It was made in 1939. See my review of Mysterious Mr. Moto where I explain why the Peter Lorre films of Mr. Moto ceased in 1939 and explained that the film industry liked the Mr. Moto character but not how John P. Marquand portrayed him in his novels, as a Japanese spy. This film is not based on any Mr. Moto Marquand novels. The film makers only used the name Mr. Moto. This film is based on ideas taken from a novel by another writer who was not referring to Mr. Moto at all.
In this film, Mr. Moto is a private investigator who is working for the diamond industry. He was hired to discover who was heading a gang of criminals who were smuggling diamonds into Puerto Rico enriching themselves and causing the price of diamonds to be reduced. Mr. Moto performs a couple of tricks. Once he acts as if he has appendicitis and once as a criminal. There are quite a few instances where he shows his fighting abilities. The film has lots of humor and red herrings. It is very good.",1511913600,3,1040,4.284263959390863
