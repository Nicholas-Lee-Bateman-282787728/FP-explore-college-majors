8021866,3,B000244YT2,"Most of these cartoons have been issued before in the original 8 tape release of George of the Jungle. Unfortunately, this time it is only George.  The better cartoons, Super Chicken & Tom Slick have not been included.  I would suggest getting the original 8, the asking prices of the used copies reflects the popularity of those over these.

THE GOOD NEWS: This tape is recorded in the SP quality mode and is Closed Captioned!

Tape includes:
""Witch Doctor,"" (aka The Malady Lingers On from Vol. 1)
""Chi-Chi Dog,"" (from Vol. 2)
""Oo-oo Bird,"" (from Vol. 2)
""Monkey Business."" - THIS IS THE NEW-TO-VIDEO CARTOON - Kidnappers take George's Ape to sell him to a TV show producer who wants to make a jungle show.  But Ape would rather act like a human, just as he does around Groege.",1147478400,,779,4.575539568345324
