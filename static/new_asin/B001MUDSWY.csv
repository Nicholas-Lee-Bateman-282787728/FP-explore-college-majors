3700465,4,B001MUDSWY,"This black-and-white British thriller, made in 1950 and directed by the Boulting Brothers, John and Roy, is one of the best of its genre and era I have seen. Professor John Willington (Barry Jones) works at an atomic research laboratory in England. For some time he has become concerned about the consequences of the work he is doing - so much so that he has a breakdown, steals one of the small prototype atomic weapons, and sends a threatening letter to Prime Minister Arthur Lytton (Ronald Adam) indicating his intention to detonate the device in central London unless the country gives up its atomic weapons program. Superintendent Follard (Andre Morell) of Scotland Yard is put in charge of the case, but the authorities have only seven days to find Willington so they enlist the help of Willington's assistant, Stephen Lane (Hugh Cross). Lane is romantically involved with Willington's daughter. There is plenty of action in the movie, but there are also some well-drawn characters which add to the atmosphere of tension, particularly Joan Hickson and Olive Sloane as landladies with whom Willington stays while he is on-the-run. If you enjoy old b/w movies as I do, this is an entertaining example.",1369699200,,1205,5.0
3700466,4,B001MUDSWY,"This has only recently become available (for streaming at least), and should be seen, both for dramatic purposes and as an historical object -- for its treatment of the dangers of nuclear war at a time when the world was wrapping its mind about the state of affairs in which entire cities or civilizations could be destroyed.  Many splendid performances in this, and lovely cinematography.

[MAYBE SPOILER HEREAFTER:]  But the ""mad"" scientist who has stolen the atom bomb, and plans to destroy London as a demonstration if England doesn't give up such weapons, isn't given a really fair share of the argument.  In the end, he is portrayed as a little batty and innocently foolish and inarticulate.  It would have been a better movie (but had a different content) had he been allowed to make his argument more forcefully.  So maybe this should have been a 3 1/2 stars.",1366761600,2,867,4.785234899328859

3700468,5,B001MUDSWY,"This is not only a great example of post WW II British film making but the DVD transfer is top notch.  This is a movie that will never stop being great entertainment, and asking some important questions about post WW II western defense policy.",1341360000,3,243,4.5227272727272725
3700469,1,B001MUDSWY,"I was very disappointed with this item, if I would have known it was not playable on regular DVDs I would not have ordered it, being that it was an English film, I did not realize it was not campatible.  I wasted my money and will not order from Amazon.com, for not having this explained in the order.",1250726400,,301,4.189655172413793
3700470,5,B001MUDSWY,"I had not seen SEVEN DAYS TO NOON in more than three decades.  I remembered it as a powerful drama and I accepted it on that basis. Recently I saw it again and it was as stark as I recall but this time I could add to it an unsettling subtext that resounded uncomfortably in the post 9/11 era. Barry Jones is Professor Wallingford a British nuclear physicist who in 1950 decides that his government has misused the promise of nuclear energy.  Wallingford steals a briefcase-sized atomic bomb and writes a letter to the Prime Minister that if England does not immediately discontinue its stockpiling of nuclear devices, he will detonate his bomb in downtown London. The film is a straightforward plot driven ticking time bomb as the police and military seek to find him before he can detonate the bomb.

Much of the film must have rung true with a British audience that had just five years earlier ended an epic battle with Nazism. The grim scenes of black and white footage of evacuation and troops marching through deserted streets well suggest the grim yet upbeat attitude of the Average Tommy who yet again must cope with a new madness.  Except for a few scenes of looters, the evacuation went fairly smoothly.  What is of note was the philosophical subtext that clearly posited the danger that a single ideologicaly driven fanatic could wreak havoc with a large urban population.  In this case the fanatic was a deluded British scientist who had religion mixed in with his motivation.  Substituite Mohammed Atta for Wallingford, and you have the genesis of a fear of what could happen should a Western hating regime sell a bomb to one terrorist.  SEVEN DAYS TO NOON is a far too uncomfortable reminder that though God may have taken the seventh day as a day of rest, a single fanatic may use every day of that week to earn the right to meet his seventy one virgins in the next life.",1238889600,4,1885,4.622754491017964

8321800,4,B001MUDSWY,"PLOT: A British Scientist delivered an ultimatum .....stop making atomic bombs or he will use one in central London.

1950~ Britain......a letter is delivered to the Prime Minster with the promise of a atom bomb to be exploded in the middle of London.... He demands a halt to atomic production OR else......Atomic Scientist Professor Wellingdon has been slowing going crazy and steals a small football sized bomb. He is walking the streets of London eluding both the military and police.  Everyone takes him very seriously. He warns them......Seven Days to Noon he will set off the bomb....unless he gets his way.  Newspapers and Radio are helping aid the ""manhunt"". He is always just one step ahead of them. This is a docudrama. It shows the police efforts to find him and his simple changing his location every day that helps keep him hidden. Included a over night stay with a cat hoarding landlady who chain smokes her way though the stay with the nutty scientist. We see both the police and military efforts to find and stop the Professor. As well as Professor escapes several times but only by his own clever means. The script is very good and the suspense builds. I give it 4 out of 5 for very good movie.",1473465600,,1211,4.676056338028169
8321801,5,B001MUDSWY,"7 DAYS TO NOON  was one of the earliest post WW2 doomsday thrillers made (1950) and is an excellent, taut, suspenseful, and somewhat jolting film that I highly recommend to all and any who love thrillers of this nature.  I also can highly recommend this DVD-- a truly beautiful print and transfer.  Get this while you can, my dears, as I am sure it will not be around long.  Super classic that is rarely seen these days in a fine little package-- who could ask for more?  Enjoy!!!",1466985600,4,480,4.409090909090909

This is one of those movies. I would still like to see this one on Blu-ray, along with Sink the Bismark. Both  are very good British movies.",1378166400,7,291,4.490566037735849
8321804,5,B001MUDSWY,"Being a huge fan of the Boulting brothers for their comedies, I was a bit trepidatious about watching a thriller from the Boulting stable. I needn't have been. Barry Jones turns in a great performance as a nuclear scientist who steals one of his bombs and threatens to use it on London. Plenty of psychology, plenty of action, and a quiet terror run through this film. Well worth a watch for Boulting fans and for fans of classic thrillers and film noir alike.

Highly recommended!",1377648000,,481,4.658823529411765
