4518135,5,B0050TOVCE,"I had originally seen this program on PBS, and it was really superb.  Rudy Maxa is a wonderful host who goes far beyond the typical travel show narratives. He delves into the personal stories of the ordinary people who feature in his programs, sharing meals and music and other cultural delights.  Fantastic photography and interesting, off-the-beaten-track places abound, and Mr Maxa enthusiastically embraces different cultures with a relaxed, engaging manner that makes his shows a real pleasure to watch.  I bought this DVD as a gift for a friend who went to South Africa, and he told me it was wonderful to re-live his trip through this DVD.  If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.  Very highly recommended.",1331424000,5,720,4.868852459016393

8451837,1,B0050TOVCE,"We bought this before our trip to South Africa with hopes of seeing the country side, wildlife and some sites worth seeing.
