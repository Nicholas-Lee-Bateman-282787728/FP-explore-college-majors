3701241,5,B001MVYUSO,It's a great show! Can't wait for the next season to be available on DVD.,1238284800,3,73,3.933333333333333
3701242,5,B001MVYUSO,I am so glad this has been released. I hope the rest of the series comes out as well. What a great TV series this is! I'm very excited to revisit these episodes.,1235692800,10,161,3.909090909090909
3701243,5,B001MVYUSO,"This is one of the funniest shows ever. But frankly, a five year break beetween releases is absolutely inexcuseable. I'm not going to buy season three until I see that season four is ready to ship. I'm not going to buy another season and wait for five years for those morons to get their act together. A great show, but unfortunately in the hands of fools.",1232236800,5,356,4.409090909090909
3701244,5,B001MVYUSO,I guess Sony finally resolved whatever issues thay had and decided to release another season of Just Shoot Me. Hopefully this will begin the release of all the seasons on DVD and I can complete my collection.,1229817600,9,208,4.648648648648648
3701245,5,B001MVYUSO,"First of all, I'd like to thank the studio for releasing this excellent sitcom.  I say it's better late than never even though I had given up hope that the rest of the seasons would be released.  The first two seasons were released back in 2004 which pleased all us die hard 'Just Shoot Me' fans, but then no more releases came out and then the next release was cancelled for some unknown reason and we've been eagerly anticipating this moment ever since, even though it really didn't seem like it would happen.

Now onto the actual season, this is one of the funniest shows in the history of TV, and this offering showcases that perfectly.  It stars Enrico Colantoni as Elliot DiMauro, Blush magazine's photographer extraordinaire and classic playboy.  George Segal stars as Blush magazine's affable, obstinate and somewhat clueless owner and boss, Jack Gallo.  Laura San Giacomo is great as Jack's daughter Maya, who works as an editor for the magazine.  Then there's Dennis Finch portrayed by the actor/comedian David Spade of SNL fame, everybody's loveable troublemaker and smart alec who's always scheming to land dates or play a prank on his co-workers.  Last but not least we have Nina Van Horn as the effervescent, vapid, superficial yet kind fashion editor played by Wendie Malick of 'Baywatch' fame.  Together this ensemble cast provides uproarious moments of laughter on a consistent basis.  This season has one of the best episodes out of the entire series, which is episode 10 entitled 'How the Finch Stole Christmas'.  It's perfect for the holidays so it's too bad that this is not being released until February, but at least it will be there for next year's Christmas.  The third season has the following episodes:

Season 3, Episode 1: What the Teddy Bear Saw:  Great episode.  Finch commits a serious faux pas by sleeping with Jack's nanny, and Maya joins a cult after being neglected by Elliot.

Season 3, Episode 2: Steamed:  Jack Gallo decides to take over the office upstairs in order to turn it into a day-care center.

Season 3, Episode 3: The Mask:  Finch tricks Maya into wearing a ridiculous costume to the office Halloween party.

Season 3, Episode 6: The Withholder:  Elliot plots to help out Finch whose girlfriend hasn't been very kind to him.

Season 3, Episode 7: Puppetmaster:  Maya's new boyfriend is the seemingly kind host of a children's TV show, but as she watches his show she realizes that he may not be quite as wonderful as she initially thought.

Season 3, Episode 8: The List:  Jack is disappointed that he's not featured in a prominent magazine listing that's soon to be published, which beckons him to harass Maya to make sure he's included.  Meanwhile, Finch is pestering his idol Mark Hamill of Star Wars fame.

Season 3, Episode 9: How Nina Got Her Groove Back:  Nina develops a growing rivalry with a competing fashion expert after their catfight hits the newspapers.

Season 3, Episode 10: How the Finch Stole Christmas:  Finch turns into the Christmas grinch and decides to ruin Christmas around the office after he finds out that his co-workers' presents to him were less than stellar.

Season 3, Episode 11: Slow Donnie:  One of the best episodes.  Maya suspects that Elliot's younger brother isn't really mentally challenged.

Season 3, Episode 12: A Spy in the House of Me:  Maya's ex-boyfriend comes into town to sweep her off her feet, but Jack is less than impressed and tries to break up their relationship.

Season 3, Episode 15: Nina Sees Red: Part 2:  Finch's dad and Nina decide to get married, despite Dennis' objections.

Season 3, Episode 16: Hostess to Murder:  Maya hosts a murder-mystery party similar to the board game 'Clue', unfortunately her neighbor meets his untimely demise while confronting Maya at this party and problems ensue.

Season 3, Episode 17: Toy Story:  Finch decides to be a prankster by switching Elliot's birthday presents given to him by Maya and a male co-worker, which leads to hilarious confusion.

Season 3, Episode 18: Miss Pretty:  Elliot disrespects an important client of Asian descent and the new advice columnist creates quite the shock to the Blush staff.

Season 3, Episode 19: Maya's Nude Photos:  Maya's photography teacher asks her to take some nude shots of herself, which leads to Elliot convincing Maya that her teacher only wants her nude pictures for his own personal gain.

Season 3, Episode 20: And the Femmy Goes To...:  The annual fashion awards show causes the staff to become upset with Jack who is only interested in beating the magazine's rival.

Season 3, Episode 21: Softball:  The staff plays softball against rival company softball teams and they discover that Maya is their best player.

Season 3, Episode 22: Shaking Private Trainer:  Jack hires a personal trainer to get into shape, but finds that he can't deal with the constant pressure to diet and exercise so he finds a way to end his training prematurely.

Season 3, Episode 25: The Odd Couple: Part 2:  Finch gets engaged to the supermodel while Maya grows suspicious of the relationship.  The super-model's ex causes problems for Finch.

I highly recommend this show to newcomers as well, especially if you enjoy zany, goofy and at times serious sitcoms, then this show will not disappoint.  For all of us longtime fans, we can look forward to enjoying those moments of levity that spanned the entire run of this series.  There's no other show quite like it, hence I've been sorely missing it since it went off the air, so I am overjoyed that at least one more season is making its debut on DVD.",1229644800,39,6556,4.797140303842717
3701246,5,B001MVYUSO,I so glad that they finally decided to release the next season.  It has been so long since the 1st & 2nd Season Box Set was released.  I had almost given up hope.,1229385600,7,162,3.878787878787879
3701247,5,B001MVYUSO,"Midway through Season 2, Just Shoot Me had found its stride. And then with a full Season 2 under its belt, the JSM rhythm of repartee reached a peak and leveled out in Season 3. The cast looks comfortable in their roles, and the writers are firing on all cylinders with metaphoric dialog, impeccable timing and New York attitude that jumped off each page. I really liked Seasons 1 and 2, but Season 3 made this show an adult comedy classic. This is a great show that was ultimately assassinated by its network programmers that kept moving it up and down the schedule. But the comedy has held up with time.",1472169600,,605,4.45945945945946

3701273,5,B001MVYUSO,"I forgot just how funny this show is.  The writing is not just clever, it is inspired, and the ensemble cast are all hilarious.  Perfect vehicle for David Spade, but everyone carries their weight.  They push all the way to the edge of good taste (and sometimes past).  There is not much in the way of character development or poignant moments -- the point of this show is to make people laugh, and it delivers.  I read that in later seasons David Spade becomes the main character -- I hope that is not true, because as great as he is here, it is the balanced ensemble that makes it all work.",1436140800,,591,4.288288288288288

I hope at some point soon the other seasons will be released on dvd, but then again that would only make sense now wouldn't it? I used to watch this show as a teenager, and I still enjoy it. I recommend you check out this show if you have not. David Spade was never better, and the famous guest stars seem to have a blast making appearances on the show.

3701310,5,B001MVYUSO,"Just Shoot Me is one of my favorite sitcoms of all time. During a dark period in my life where I was holed up in my room due to severe depression, Just Shoot Me brought laughter into my life. It was my lifeline to a world where I could smile and laugh. I looked forward to Dennis Finch's fiascos. I loved the zingers and wisecracks that Nina and Dennis hurled at each other and Maya's attempts in holding onto her journalistic integrity and ideals while working at Blush; a place where ethics and business etiquette  are as welcomed as a sunburn. The characters are quirky and memorable.

 The show is graced with a stellar cast, superb acting, great premise, and hilarious one-liners. Today's sitcoms don't have the same caliber and witticism as Just Shoot Me; they're few and far between. The witty writing gets better with each following season. You'll undoubtedly find yourself howling with laughter. Don't miss out on this fantastic show. I own seasons 1-3 and have re-watched them numerous times.

 Like many of the fans, I am eagerly and impatiently awaiting the release of seasons 4,5,6, and 7. The Nanny is another great show from the 90s whose remaining season haven't been released yet. I am immensely frustrated and angry to say the least by the needless and protracted delay by Sony! The fanbase is huge and demanding the release of these great shows! I would buy them in a heartbeat if they were released, as I'm sure the other fans would, too! It ticks me off that mediocre shows that haven't had the same success as Just Shoot Me or The Nanny are being released, whereas these shows that DESERVE to be released on DVD and OWNED by the fans and anyone who loves a good laugh are a no show! I don't want to wait till 2020 for their release! The wait was long enough!",1362355200,3,1780,4.55

This is such a funny series and alot of people will order and buy it ,if it is ever released. If they are worried about making alot of dvd's with not enough people buying them, could they produce dvd's as the orders come in?
  Anyway we am looking forward to the rest of the seasons being released as soon as possible. Thanks.",1359763200,2,448,4.258823529411765

3701313,5,B001MVYUSO,"David Spade as Dennis Finch. Need I say more? Spade is great on every show he's been part of, and JSM couldn't have done without him.  George Segal is brilliant and Laura SanGiacomo needs to be on another show already.  This is one of the best sitcoms from the past 25 years, and should be recognized for it more. Enrico Colantoni is also terrific as usual and wish he could be part of another comedy in the future due to his subtleties and comedic chops that we don't get to see on his drama series. Wendy Malick is perfect.  All fans of this show would like to see the rest of this series released on DVD ASAP.",1356134400,,612,4.213675213675214
3701314,3,B001MVYUSO,"When this series was on TV, I loved it but somehow owning it has taken the something away.  The jokes did not quite crack me up as they use to.  Maybe it is me but owning the package has turned me off buying TV series, maybe it is because I over saturate myself with the episodes.  This holds true for another TV series I purchased, therefore I have vowed not to buy anymore TV series.  For me TV series are best metered out in small doses and not in lump-sums. But that is just my opinion, maybe the reverse is true for you.",1345161600,2,525,4.067961165048544

3701317,5,B001MVYUSO,"This sitcom pulls the schtick out of the Fashion Industry, and reveals why we shouldn't take it too seriously.

Love this show. Too bad the Network Industry still got a schtick stuck somewhere. Even though the last season

Conclusion: definitely 'One to watch' - and worth the wait.",1301011200,,370,4.590909090909091

3701320,5,B001MVYUSO,"What is truly surprising about this set isn't that Sony finally resumed releasing season DVDs of Just Shoot Me! (after a five year hiatus due to low sales of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/previous-set/dp/B0001Z3I0S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">previous set</a>) with the release of The Complete Third Season, but that the studio has again done the show and the fans proud by releasing it as yet another quality DVD release. All 25 wickedly witty Season 3 episodes are digitally remastered and unedited. The restored footage never ceases to amaze. The packaging is solid with especially nice and inspired artwork: two slimcases each designed like Blush Magazine covers featuring the cast and episode titles on the front all inside a slim outer box with cast photoshoot style cover art. On the back of each slimcase is a list of the episodes followed by a brief plot description. Discs 1 & 2 contain: Episodes 1-17 and Disc 3 contains: Episodes 18-25. The 3-disc (551 min.) set features Full Frame (1.33:1) video, English Dolby Surround audio, Closed Captioning for the hearing impaired.

Guest stars include: Ana Gasteyer (""Saturday Night Live""), J.P. Manoux (""ER""), Steve Carell (""The Office""), French Stewart (""3rd Rock From The Sun""), Mark Hamill (""Star Wars Trilogy""), David Cross (""Mr. Show""), Brian Dennehy (""Cocoon""), Tyra Banks (""The Fresh Prince of Bel Air""), Willie Garson (""Sex and the City""), David Clennon (""Thirtysomething""), Neal McDonough (""Boomtown""), Jere Burns (""Dear John""), Rebecca Romijn (""X-Men Trilogy""), Kenny Johnson (""The Shield"") and more.

No doubt Sony debated long and hard over the release of Just Shoot Me! - The Complete Third Season. Fans will delight in the first-rate treatment the studio has given this release, despite the lack of extras. If sales are good for JSM! - Season Three, then Sony should release subsequent seasons (with the same quality care as the first two sets) with a better release timeframe between sets. Until then, enjoy yet another quality JSM! season set filled with brilliantly funny episodes.

Highly Recommended!",1271635200,7,2122,5.5030674846625764
3701321,5,B001MVYUSO,"In the time it took between the release of Seasons 1 & 2 and Season 3, I could have constructed these DVDs myself.  I don't know what the problem was, and frankly, I don't care.  I finally have another installment of Just Shoot Me to watch.  Season 3 starts off with Finch (Spade) getting caught romping with Jack's daughter's nanny on a Nanny Cam hidden in a teddy bear.  Hysterical. Over-the-top.  There are so many great episodes in this season.  Slow Donnie, where Elliott's brother Donnie is pretending to be retarded but keeps trying to pick up on Maya.  The episode where Maya is convinced her new boyfriend (French Stewart, Harry from 3rd Rock) is sending her messages from his children's show through the puppets he uses.  The one where Mark Hamill follows Finch around the office for a few days, bugging him to death about what he does, just to prove a psycho-fan point.  And the two-part season ender where Finch toys with an emotially-vulnerable supermodel (Rebeca Romijn) to impress on old high school acquaintance and ends up marrying her when he realizes this is the best his ife could ever get.  I could go through every one, but I won't.  It is hysterical.  Hilarious.  Cutting humor and quick dialogue. Still fresh as the day it was shot.  Now hopefully Season 4 will be here before I have to use bifocals to watch it.  Awesome TV!  Cannot go wrong.

3701322,5,B001MVYUSO,This was a great TV series. It is guaranteed to make you laugh. Lots of great on-liners. Every character in this series carries their own weight and contributes a lot of humor and entertainment to the entirety of the show.,1261872000,3,222,4.575
3701323,3,B001MVYUSO,"has several good episodes including the puppet master and the christmas and halloween episodes. unlike season one and two, quite a few episodes in season three are simply not funny at all. still in all i am looking forward to season four being released.",1257465600,6,253,4.7727272727272725
3701324,5,B001MVYUSO,"This is one of the most underrated television shows! When I watch these Season 3 episodes at home, family members that were just passing through the living room always ended up staying to finish out the episodes.  It's because the one-liners are witty enough to catch your attention and each joke is more outrageous than the last with stories that are ridiculously funny. I have turned people who were just familiar with the show into Just Shoot Me fanatics who quote the show now as often as I do.  Please buy so Sony will continue to release the following seasons for everyone's enjoyment.

My favs of this season.

-Two Girls for Every Boy
-Puppetmaster
-Slow Donnie
-Nina Sees Red Parts 1&2

3701326,5,B001MVYUSO,"So, Universal Studios (the copyright holders) and whomever else is financially involved with ""Just Shoot Me,"" finally got around to releasing the third season of the show on DVD.  But hey, what's almost 5 years among friends, right?

My first instinct was to not buy this, in order to punish the studios behind the boneheaded decisions to stop production and publishing of the show on DVD.  But, in the end that would only hurt me, and the fans of the series. The mental giants behind these DVDs are not going to keep producing them, if they don't sell in the numbers they expect.

The show itself is great.  I have been waiting for it for years, and it doesn't disappoint.  It is a worthy comedy series to add to anyone's DVD collection.  The third season is just as quirky, brilliant, and entertaining as the first and second seasons.  Buy it, please, and maybe the studios who own the series won't make us wait another 4-5 years for season 4.",1240099200,10,945,4.550295857988166
8322076,4,B001MVYUSO,"""Just Shoot Me!,"" was a smart sitcom but never got the recognition or accolades like other network sitcoms. The sitcom premise stars Academy Award nominated actor, George Segal, as Jack Gallo, a New York City magazine publisher of Blush, who reconnects with his adult daughter, Maya (Laura San Giacomo). The supporting cast include David Spade as Dennis Finch, Jack's assistant; Wendie Malick as Nina Van Horn, former fashion model; and Elliott DiMauro, a fashion photographer.

This season is set on three DVDs with 25 episodes. Guest stars include Rebecca Romjin; Bob Odenkirk; Willie Garson; Ana Gasteyer; French Stewart; Christine Ebersole; Brian Dennehy; Fred Williard; Jere Burns; Steve Garvey and more. This season was just as good as the first two seasons. The cast seemed like they had a great time together. You can see how the cast and crew worked well together with top notch writing. The characters never really changed much this season but a growing chemistry between Maya and Elliott.

I wished there were more features on this DVD set. There are no commentaries or behind the scenes.",1526515200,,1099,5.1
