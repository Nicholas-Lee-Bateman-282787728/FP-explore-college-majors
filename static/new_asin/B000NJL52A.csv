2769624,3,B000NJL52A,"I've never taken drugs, but I enjoy watching movies that I feel are like the equivalent of tripping on acid or some other such thing.  Even though this movie bored me to tears, I was still fascinated by the bizarre sense of creativity that went into it.  Movies are supposed to entertain but movies are also art, a canvas for the filmmakers to do with as they please.  This movie is art.  An Andy Warholesque art nightmare.  Frankensteins Bloody Nightmare.

I feel that the filmmaker was attempting to make ERASERHEAD but wound up making THE JAR instead.  That's okay.  I enjoyed THE JAR.",1209945600,5,588,4.640776699029126
8178360,1,B000NJL52A,"FRANKENSTEIN'S BLOODY NIGHTMARE begins w/ a stroll through some rustic junkyard. Suddenly, a seemingly radioactive woman appears, strolling along in her psychedelic shoes. No! A pitchfork arrives, impaling her, psychedelically! Blood flows in artistic fashion... Flows eerily, creepily. A man awakens, his three plastic men stand guard. A woman awakens, her pasty face in extreme, unnecessary closeup! Mouths move. Dialogue occurs. A helicopter turns day to night! A woman! A car! A big knife! All accompanied by apparent whale sounds! A hippie van in the woods, the driver, haunted by his destiny! A room... in darkness... more unnecessary closeups... of dirt! The music, it sets a man's head a bobbling! Bob-bl-ing! All reasoning power leaves our heads now! More mouths move, causing sounds. Objects are in motion. Men talk. Telephones and chimes ring out their song. By all the gods! This is art! ART! A graveyard! Garbled voice-over! Our brains are soup now! Chowder! Beef stew! Artistic beef stew! A man walks through the wilderness. Magic tree! Magic powder! More radioactive / psychedelic murder, while numbers flash by! Noises! A monster is born! Or, perhaps a burnt pot-roast? Scenery soars past, psychedelically, radioactively! Endlessly! Art! Art I Say! Some sort of action happens. A brain, in pulsating dirt! The man embraces his burnt pot-roast monster. A white mask is unearthed. My mind has disappeared! My brain ooze-eth from my skull! And... the... art... continues... Artistically... radioactively... Eternally... Echoes... oes... oes... FIN...",1498867200,,1563,5.4896265560165975
8178361,1,B000NJL52A,This movie is the worst thing we've ever seen. Self-indulgent filmmaking completely lacking in narrative.,1497657600,,105,6.066666666666666
8178362,1,B000NJL52A,"I have watched many really bad movies on Prime...but I must say THIS one is the worst! I could only take this mess of no plot but alot of different swirls of color and no dialog I could even understand about 15 minutes. Using ""Frankenstein"" in the title I felt was a ploy to have you watch this mess....just don't. It really was like watching another person's bad acid trip on film. Even worse is it was boring! I can't see ANYBODY liking this unless they have friends/family involved.",1490745600,2,485,4.46067415730337
8178363,1,B000NJL52A,"Camera work, effects and editing are about as artistic as a poop stain and less fun to look at.",1486771200,2,95,4.052631578947368

8178365,1,B000NJL52A,"Obviously someone (or more than one) involved in making this film was high at the time on heroin or crack
I really couldn't believe it !  Minus 100 stars !",1483488000,,155,4.166666666666667
8178366,1,B000NJL52A,"Watched for 30 minutes and had no idea what was going on AT ALL.  Perhaps something pulls it together at the end, but 30 minutes of what appears to be an Acid trip is more than anyone should be asked to bear.
Comparisons to eraserhead?  Pullleeease.",1483488000,,249,4.391304347826087
8178367,1,B000NJL52A,"I have a rule in horror watching ""if nothing interesting happens in the first 10 I stop watching"" I stopped watching.",1483401600,,117,4.619047619047619
8178368,5,B000NJL52A,"A really awful movie, but I bought this because my friend was one of the actors.  It might be worth a look for fans of bloody awful B horror movies.",1472601600,,148,3.933333333333333
8178369,5,B000NJL52A,"If you like Eraserhead, you may well love this movie! Filmed all grainy with psychedelic special effects, this $2,000 movie is a masterpiece of weirdness. Dr. Karlstein is an unstable genius, and the movie perfectly catches his descent into madness from the inside. The only flaw is that the (incredible) score by the Greys sometimes overpowers the dialogue.",1397088000,2,358,5.189655172413793
