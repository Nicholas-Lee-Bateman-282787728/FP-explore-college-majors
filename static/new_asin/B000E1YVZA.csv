2483645,5,B000E1YVZA,"I really cant say much that the other reviewers haven't said already. Mr. Littrell said it best with this line: ""Malle, more than almost any film maker I can think of, keeps sex in perspective and does not over react to sexual differences."" I concur wholeheartedly. Sex, even taboo, never looked so inviting.

I saw it once when I was fourteen myself and then just recently I picked it up on sale used, and I cherish it now as much as I did as a youth. The strong, tender relationship that Benoit Ferreux and Lea Massari share on screen is simply ravishing, sensual, brilliant and stunning. Malle does such an exceptional job in creating this funny, but believable world. The relationship reminds me somewhat of Marcel's with his mother in Yves Robert's 'My Father's Glory' and 'My Mother's Castle', another French masterpiece.

Lea Massari simply steals the show with sexy, sultry and tender scenes.

One of my favorite films of all time.",1195084800,,939,4.783950617283951
2483646,5,B000E1YVZA,"Criticized in 1971 for daring to deal with the theme of incest, Malle's ""Murmur"" is actually a sparkling French comedy notable for its wit, sensitivity, and energetic jazz soundtrack. Writer-director Malle approaches the awkwardness of adolescence with honesty and cheeky humor--as when Laurent drinks, smokes, and attempts to quench his carnal desires on an outing with his older brothers--but also subtlety, especially in the film's trickiest turn of events. Ferreux and Massari have an undeniable chemistry that feels genuine rather than manipulative or shocking, letting Malle put an unusually fresh spin on the sexual coming-of-age drama. For a fond, funny take on teen innocence, ""Murmur of the Heart"" is made to order.",1183507200,,725,5.482142857142857

2483658,5,B000E1YVZA,"Le souffle au coeur (Louis Malle, 1971, 118`)

Le souffle au coeur tells a coming of age story about a 14-year-old boy growing up in bourgeois surroundings in post-World War II Dijon. The film was a hit across Europe, gaining 2.7 million admissions in France alone, and was also a modest hit in the United States. The film starts by showing the adventures of the boy in school and his first sexual experience at a brothel. When the boy is found to have a heart murmur after a bout of scarlet fever, he goes with his mother (Lea Massari) to a sanatorium, where a series of events  lead to a sexual encounter with his mother. Jazz music by Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, along with books by Bataille, Proust and Camus, feature prominently in the film.

Louis Malle '(1932-1995) was an award-winning French film director, screenwriter, and producer. His film, Le monde du silence, won the Palme d'Or and Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1956. He was also nominated multiple times for Academy Awards later in his career. Malle was born into a wealthy industrialist family in Thumeries, Nord, France. He initially studied political science at the Sciences-Po before turning to film studies at IDHEC instead. He worked in both French cinema and Hollywood, and he produced both French and English language films.

His feature films were: Ascenseur pour l'chafaud (1958), Les Amants (1958), Zazie dans le mtro (1960), Vie prive (1962), Le feu follet (1963), Viva Maria! (1965), Le voleur (1967), Histoires extraordinaires (1968), Le souffle au coeur (1971), Lacombe Lucien (1974), Black Moon (1975), Pretty Baby (1978), Atlantic City (1981), My Dinner with Andre (1981), Crackers (1984), Alamo Bay (1985), Au revoir, les enfants (1987), Milou en Mai (1989), Damage (1992), Vanya on 42nd Street (1994).

Malle is sometimes considered to be ""nouvelle vague"", though his work does not directly fit their auteurist theory and he had nothing to do with the Cahiers du Cinma; yet, he exemplified many characteristics of the movement, including using natural light, and shooting on location. His film Zazie dans le mtro, after Raymond Queneau's novel, made Truffaut write him an enthusiastic letter. Many of Malle's films also tackled taboo subjects: Les amants both adultery and nudity, Le feu follet suicide, Le souffle au coeur incest, and Lacombe Lucien collaboration with the Nazis in Vichy France during WWII.

In the case of Le souffle au coeur, apart from Malle's ease and elegance in dealing with censor-prone subjects, Lea Massari (the young woman Anna going missing in Antonioni's L'avventura) and pre-modern urban destruction Dijon are the true stars of the film: Mlle Massari by her warm personality and brilliant dynamics, the city of Dijon by its noble statics.

2483659,5,B000E1YVZA,"Murmur of the Heart, Louis Malles ode to youth and carelessness centers in on a young fourteen year old boy named Laurent. He smokes, drinks, masturbates, has sex with a whore, and even shares some crude moments with his older brothers, who are the influence that makes Laurent who he is. In short, he is a typical fourteen year old boy, especially growing up in France at the time. Malle doesn't try to candy coat his portrayel of youth, although Louis Malle doesn't necessarily candy coat any of his movies. Yet this one is real, to the point where the audience is almost left blushing at the shere akwardness of the moment. However, the movie shares its main character with mother of Laurent, who is as equally interesting as Laurent. Malles displays the relationship between Laurent and his mother so well, that in the end, when the last scene comes, it doesn't seem out of place at all, but natural and almost sad. The movie is definitely a gem for Louis Malle, and in my opinion, one of his best.",1337904000,4,1002,4.572222222222222

2483661,2,B000E1YVZA,"I love a lot of Malle's films but this isn't one of them.  I guess if you find a really awkward, ugly, rude, kid who does everything he can to be obnoxious, charming, then you'll love this movie. We first meet Laurent begging money for the wounded soldiers in Indochina, but keeping the money for himself, then ripping off a record store, then trying to imitate his older brothers who are way ahead of him in crass behavior.  Let's see what mischief they can conjure up--eating communion wafers is too below him, save that for his fellow altar boy, drinking, smoking, having sex, stealing from their parents, being rude to the servant, the father and everyone else....If all of this strikes you as terribly charming...then this is your film.  Oh yeah, a pedophile priest is in it, too.

Top it off with incest and there you have it.  In the last scene everyone has a good laugh.  Tres charmant, non?  Non!",1255996800,5,905,4.583850931677019
2483662,5,B000E1YVZA,"There are few films that can get away with the outlandish and taboo behavior found within `Le Souffle au Coeur'.  I've been a fan of director Louis Malle's for a while now, having seen two other masterpieces by him, and so this was a film I was dying to actually see.  From the films very beginning I could feel it was something special.  The jovial talk between two young boys of jazz music was sweet, concise and appropriate.  It set the right mood for this unique look at `growing pains' so-to-speak.

The film is a wildly entertaining look at adolescence from the eyes of fifteen-year-old virgin Laurent Chevalier.  Growing up in 1950's France, Laurent is your typical teenager.  His older brothers are flamboyant playboys who talk of their exploits and teasing their younger brother.  Laurent's father is uninterested in him entirely, and his mother Clara is maybe overly interested; doing her best to compensate.  Laurent drinks and smokes and pursues relations (not relationships) with other girls hoping to walk into adulthood.  When a bout of scarlet fever sends him to the spa he finds himself reaching at the opportunity to lose his virginity.

`Le Souffle au Coeur' is a comedy in pure French fashion.  It's vibrant and carries an almost bouncy vibe.  It's a film that is determined to make you smile.

What I admire about this film is that it takes a very realistic approach to the teenager's idea of sex.  There is no over dramatization here or forced tragedy, but everything is seen through the eyes of the nave and inexperienced.  This way the film can grace the stages of adolescence with an almost fearlessness, giving everything the light appeal of a children's story.  As Laurent explores his own sexuality we are never offended or put off or even really concerned (although it is apparent that we should be somewhat concerned) because through the eyes of a child this is something grand and exciting.  Sure, it's scary and nerve-racking, but in the end it is yet another experience that brings you closer to adulthood.

Malle superbly directs this film, allowing each frame to slink right into the next with a sensual fluidity that captures the very heart of this story.

The acting is also sublime; Benoit Ferreux nailing every ounce of childlike curiosity that makes his character so human and raw.  The real star here though is Lea Massari, who plays Clara, Laurent's mother.  She captures the very essence of motherhood and just sucks in the viewer.  Her relationship with Laurent (while surely distasteful) is almost understandable, and the films development of the characters and plot make it easy for us to completely adore her.  She loves her son and wants to help her son, and that genuine paternal feeling is never lost amidst her poor decisions.

In the end I highly recommend this film.  It is a genuine classic and a brilliantly crafted coming-of-age comedy.  Yes, the subject matter does get a bit risqu and could offend some, but when placed into context it is far from an offensive film.",1244592000,2,3024,4.844054580896686
2483663,5,B000E1YVZA,"One of the most delightful films ever made, this is a feast of fluid, elegant filmmaking.  The erotic, rebellious content thus is elevated to something sacred-- think of Titian's painting of Ariadne and Bacchus, or the courting of Papageno and Papagena in The Magic Flute.  In Malle's hands, life is too exquisite to be wasted on the squeamish, on the people with small souls.  This is an inspired, civilized, and absolutely moral film, on a par with Bunuel's The Milky Way and Renoir's Rules of the Game.  Nobody who hasn't seen this film should ever be allowed to vote!",1236211200,7,571,4.737373737373737
2483664,4,B000E1YVZA,"The Bottom Line:

Just about the most fun and charming movie you'll ever see about incest, Murmur of the Heart is a wonderful coming of age story that made me laugh out loud and turn off the DVD player with a smile; if you want an enjoyable 100 minutes you could hardly do better.",1235260800,,280,4.185185185185185
2483665,4,B000E1YVZA,"15-year-old Laurent (Benoit Ferreux) wants to grow up, but doesn't like the examples of manhood in his family. His two older brothers are raucous-plying him with booze, drugs, hookers and rough play. His gynecologist father, who performs exams in his house, is too clinical and disengaged. He has a gentle connection with his sweet and sexy mother who indulges his every whim. But it isn't until a week away at a clinic that his drunk mother indulges his greatest desire-to loose his virginity under terms which will be neither crude nor humiliating. Once he looses his virginity with his mother, Laurent immediately assumes his manhood and connects with a girl his age.

As creepy as this plot sounds, Murmurs of the Heart is very sweet. Laurent is your typical boy and the energy he exudes on film is as exhuberent as the jazz he listens to. The acting is good and Malle does an excellent job of directing. The family scenes seem so intimate and real that you'll sometimes forget you're watching a film.

Coincidentally, I've seen three films in a row which deal with incest-&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Damage/dp/630516195X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Damage</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Savage-Grace/dp/B001F0TM4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Savage Grace</a>&nbsp;and Murmurs of the Heart. Murmurs of the Heart is lighter and more innocent than the other two films in my incestual trilogy, which paradoxically makes it easier to watch, but harder to come to terms with morally. I don't know anyone who has survived incest, but I get the feeling that they wouldn't like it dealt with through laughter and a gentle snuggle from Mummy. Damage and Savage Grace ended with main characters dying-which may just be wishful thinking on the part of survivors. It may be that Murmur of the Heart presents a more realistic scenario of incest. In any case, the Oedipus Complex is alive and well in modern films.

I agreed with both the good and bad reviews of this movie. Murmurs of the Heart is sticky sweet and can be annoying. But it is also charming.  I liked Murmurs of the Heart for it's excellent direction and seemingly real peek at the intimate details of a boy's life. But the movie can be a little slow and redundant-it's more of a ""slice of life"" piece. It's hard to say which way this movie will go for the viewer.",1232236800,2,2409,5.249350649350649

2483667,3,B000E1YVZA,"A movie about sexual taboo and the needs of a 14 year old boy surrounded with a dysfunctional family.  Although the movie is provocative, most of us know the needs and wants of a 14 year old boy, (we were all 14 at one time) but I guess sex education wasn't taught in France in 1971.  One reviewer explained that the movie is very unrealistic and I agree.  Laurent Chevalier is a seriously disturbed person who does unusual things.  Never mind the fact that he lusts his own mother; Luarent is rude, obnoxious, and just flat out stupid just like the rest of his family.  Not only do I consider that offensive but unrealistic as well, and the movie doesn't have to be realistic, it just has to make sense.  This is just my opinion but if a movie doesn't make sense than I consider that a major turn off.  On the positive side though the acting is decent, it's somewhat entertaining, and his mother (Lea Massari) is absolutely stunning.",1219017600,4,934,4.458823529411765

This would be considered child abuse by many in the US. The parents do not seem to understand teaching your child respect for themselves or others. It is all about feeling good for the moment.

8104383,5,B000E1YVZA,"Louis Malle is both producer and director of a Masterpiece in this movie, Murmur of the Heart.  The viewer has to remember the time and place of this DVD movie occurs when many Western European Nations had endured the ravages of World War II, in some of those nations rationing did not end until the 1950s, and some were loosing their colonial empires.  This movie begins with young adolescent Roman Catholic School boys collecting contributions in the public for French Soldiers in combat as the French downfall in Indochina, exemplified by the battle Dien Bien Phu, Vietnam that was about to be lost.  Malle brings focus on his 14 year old hero, Laurent (played by Benoit Ferreux who gives the performance par excellence).  Laurent is a perfect example of a gangling, typical growing14-year-old's anatomy with out-of-place long legs and an oversized head marching towards maturity.  His immature youth is illustrated by typical mood swings from rage to mischief who is determined to embrace his above average intelligence and qualities (a 14 year-old interested in the books by Albert Camus?  Remarkable!).  However, Malle keeps Laurentwithin the pervue of other boys in his class who are captivated by his penchant to be tempted and aware with a magnetic charisma laced with shrewdness and observance of his surroundings.  Even a young blond boy appears to have an innocent ""puppy love""  for Laurent which is common for an older maturing youth. He is the youngest Son in a pretentious family of economic and social privilege (complete with servants, a cosmopolitan Italian Mother, A Father who is a gynecologist Doctor and two older romping Brothers with relentless irritations).  Murmur of the Heart has multiple definitions for Laurent.  His Brothers escort Laurent to their favorite Brothel for him to have his ""first love.""  Then, he develops a physical heart murmur during his Boy Scout Summer encampment and has to be confined to bed rest, no attendance at school and sent to a Spa.  At the Spa Laurent wrenches at the treatments which require him to disrobe to be nude before women.  In France, the public display of affection is startling by other standards. For example, the scene where the Catholic Priest in the Parochial School counsels Laurent's interests, and compliments the boys growth by putting his hands around the thigh of the Lad's leg.  In that culture it is not a sexual pass, but no different than a complimentary hand on the shoulder of the youth.  When the Priest grants Laurent's request to end the counseling session it ended with no advance on the boy that could be inappropriate. Boys who hug and kiss on the cheek or holding hands while walking down a street; some men display these public behaviors also.  Daily customs and social mores differ in European cultures.  Of course, Laurent is taunted by Medical Technicians about his maturing appearance. Then, Laurent challenges his own Mother about probable liaisons with other men, which leads to incest between both of them.  Nevertheless, at the end all of them mesh as a family with Laurent as the lead - character through all of the vignettes.  This DVD film is a superb presentation of a culture in which people are recovering from a horrid World War,changes of political position of France in world affairs, and the young like Laurent who attempts to make sense of all surroundings around him who  is determined to carry on in life and grow up as a maturing person.",1419206400,3,3455,4.942906574394463
8104384,1,B000E1YVZA,"French for ""disgusting"".  Unpleasant at the outset, it becomes far worse toward the end.

What is this about?  Taking place in early 1950's France, it stars an adolescent boy and his brothers who live with their bourgeois parents.  The father is ridiculous, the mother is goofy, and the children are aggressive and unlikable.  When the boy finds his sexual feelings, his brothers take him to a prostitute, and when he pursues girls of his own accord, he makes no attempt to charm them, but aggressively hits up on them in a way they dislike.  Mid-story, the boy is found to have the heart condition described in the movie's title, and he moves to a country hotel for a rest cure, his mother accompanying him.

The mother has an interesting history, being an Italian immigrant who had been involved with revolutionaries in her youth, but this avenue goes unexplored.  The other characters could have been made interesting, but instead we find them repulsive.  But things get even worse-the boy and his mother get drunk...and I had no desire to see what was about to happen.

The movie clearly goes for cheap shock value.  Even in Europe, certainly they must have found the events in the movie as shocking as I did.",1394841600,3,1213,4.728571428571429
8104385,4,B000E1YVZA,"This film was well made and is easy to follow. I will note here that close to halfway through the movie Laurent's scout patrol presents a skit acting out Goethe's ""The Erlking"". ""The Erlking"" is about the death of childhood when a boy loses his innocents. It is very symbolic as is common in poetry but it is no accident that it is quoted in this movie. This is also the theme of the movie, but goes about it in a different way than any other movie I have ever seen. Laurent is not involved with a girl, (or a boy) nor does he even really have a girlfriend during the movie. Instead he is almost bombarded by situations where he could give in to sexual temptation. A priest who has a reputation for liking boys seems to be flirting with him, an older girl at his brothers' party teaches him to French kiss, a younger scout idolizes him and wants to sleep next to him (this actually seemed quite innocent to me, I only bring it up because the general theme of the movie seems to suggest there is more to it), his brothers take him to a brothel, and this is all just in the first half of the movie. Thrown in with this, he discovers his mother is having an affair, he seeks out hidden books in the house and masturbates while reading them, and once early in the movie he measures his brothers penises to settle an argument between them. None of the boys are seen nude by the movie audience in any of this, but the prostitute is seen topless and Laurent is seen in his underwear while with her. To say when and how he finally has sex would be giving away too much, but by the end of the movie ""the child is dead"". (That, by the way, is a quote from ""The Elking"" in case you have not read it.)
There is some nudity in the last half of the movie. On his first visit to the clinic Laurent is seen fully nude, both front and rear. Later at the hotel his mother is seen nude from the rear getting out of the bath tub and still later he is seen nude from the rear while getting out of the bath tub.
There are a couple of sex scenes in the movie both of which show the actors from about the shoulders up during sex.
Another movie inspired by ""The Erlking"" is ""Burning Secret"" which was made in 1988 in the UK and West Germany. It has a lot in common with this movie, even the mother and son traveling to a remote hotel to get treatment for the son. But at the same time goes in a totally different direction when it comes to him loosing his innocents.",1386288000,,2441,4.119496855345912

The French subtitles, the language, the stupid little ""skits"" all are bad to the nth degree. The story is lacking is to many way to list and the thieving little brats and other strange characters never establish any empathy for the characters they portray.
