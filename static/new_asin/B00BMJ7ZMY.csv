5647648,5,B00BMJ7ZMY,"I bought this for a Christmas gift for an elderly family member. He says that he has watched the movies and gave it a rave review. So, on his behalf, this gets a 5-star rating.",1390435200,,176,4.057142857142857
5647649,4,B00BMJ7ZMY,"Henry Fonda and his daughter Jane have been heroes for me.  Jane did slip up for a while, but she got her feet back on the ground and is a model for getting up and starting over.  I have been partly in her shoes, with similar life experiences.  Henry Fonda was always one of my favorite actors and I enjoy watching him again.",1388620800,,325,4.126984126984127

He seemed to get better as years went by.  Highly recomment this collection.",1380931200,3,193,4.333333333333333
5647651,5,B00BMJ7ZMY,"This is a great Fonda collection of some of his best with Fox.

5647652,5,B00BMJ7ZMY,"Henry Fonda. Best known for portraying the quiet, contemplative everyman, Fonda shines in these 10 films that include Jesse James (1939/106 min.), Drums Along the Mohawk (1939/104 min.),  The Grapes of Wrath (1940/129 min.), The Return of Frank James (1940/92 min.), Immortal Sergeant (1943/91 min.), The Ox-Bow Incident (1943/75 min.), My Darling Clementine (1946/97 min.), Daisy Kenyon (1947/99 min.), The Longest Day(1962/178 min.) and The Boston Strangler(1968/116 min.)
I rate this set 5 stars for the movies, 1 star for packaging, and the package design. I bought this new set of dvds that had all the discs jammed into cardboard pockets that are not lined with anything to protect the data side of the disc, and all discs had some sort of scratches or scuff marks on them. The DVD box set is made cheaply and caused scratches on all discs data side where they come in contact with the cardboard material. Three of my DVDs had adhesive or glue like sticky substances on the outer edge of the read side of the disc, all were covered with what looked like cardboard residue, maybe from cutting the slits in the cardboard for the dvds to slide into.

 I took all the disc out and cleaned them the best i could and put them in my own paper sleeves.
 My Darling Clementine (1946/97 min.)and The Grapes of Wrath (1940/129 min.) are dual sided disc. The other 8 are single sided. My Darling Clementine  has 2 versions , 1 on each side , the preside version and the final version. The preside is John Fords version and the final is Daryl Zanecks , head of the studios cut down version which is the version shown on television.

All they had to do was put the disc into paper sleeves and then cut the slits just a hair wider and put the paper sleeves with the disc in them, they would of been protected, but some highly paid professional decided to slide the  bare disc into the cardboard slit holders. a real genius.

Ps. The John Wayne 10 disc collection has the exact same cardboard packaging, they both say 20TH CENTURY FOX on them.",1370304000,65,2033,4.61218836565097
8570851,5,B00BMJ7ZMY,Good collection,1484438400,,15,7.0
8570852,3,B00BMJ7ZMY,"Ridiculously cheap packaging. Half the DVDs were falling out of the cardboard slip case upon opening and most have smudges and marks on them. I put them all in to see if they will play and they did, but I don't have time to sit and watch them all the way through to see if they will play for the entire film. I don't recommend buying this as a gift set. Too cheap looking and the condition of the DVDs is suspect.",1480896000,,413,4.048780487804878

8570855,5,B00BMJ7ZMY,This arrived quickly.  I love Henry Fonda movies.  I've watched two of them and they are in very good condition.  This is a great collection.,1440201600,,141,4.56
8570856,5,B00BMJ7ZMY,"I know all these films so there are no surprises.  In some cases, like in My Darling Clementine, some details in the productions seem to be even more exceptional on second sight considering the lack of technology of their time.  Seems Mr. Fonda had excellent support from actors that were no slouches either.  The Grapes of Wrath is a classic that should be shown in theatres at some point when great films are brought back for one reason or another.  The youngsters among us should see what greatness was before that word lost its real meaning and became a replacement for glitter, sumptuousness and pizazz.",1435363200,3,608,4.761904761904762

8570860,3,B00BMJ7ZMY,"Worst DVD pack I have ever seen in my life, All discs were damaged on they were placed on cardboard without any protection, all have some degree of scratch, Imagine prepare Such a perfect collection than placed them  on cardboard ?
It is like you make a very tall building without using steel and iron just use brick or cement
Why 20 century fox ? charge additional few Dollars, place them inside nice 10 way DVD cover in that way you 20 century fox  will get only 5 stars and Thanks from Customers and no complaints",1421625600,11,516,4.364583333333333
