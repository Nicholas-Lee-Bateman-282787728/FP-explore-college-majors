1246510,5,B00001W0FF,This was the best Sinbad movie I've ever seen! Looked everywhere for it and so happy to find it at Amazon.com. My 90 year old uncle had me looking for this a long time. So happy to have found it! Thank you so much for helping us collect these kinds of old classic movies!!! Amazonis number 1 in our book!,1212624000,2,304,4.083333333333333
1246511,3,B00001W0FF,"I have to give this kind of a low rating due to the poor quality of this

VHS tape. ( used VHS movies are a gamble anyway). Don't get me wrong!  this is a terrific movie. I originally watched this on TV, recorded some of it and the Technicolor is superb. I recomend anyone interested in some of the better Maureen Ohara movies to obtain THIS MOVIE when it is avalable as a DVD.",1180656000,,377,4.081081081081081
1246512,4,B00001W0FF,"So I finally found another Sinbad movie and got it.  I don't think I have them all yet.  I have five or six, there might be seven or eight.  By the way, at the end of the movie the caption read ""...and this is the end of his eight voyage.""

So I figure I've got a couple more to go at least.

Anyway, I never saw a Sinbad (Sindbadd?) movie I didn't like.  It has all the classic charm of those epic movie days when writers could write and though everybody was still learning how to do it--how to act and direct.  Too bad they got rid of them all and put lesser talents in their place.  Now we have to suffer through another seventy five years of the learning process.  So here it is.

1.  Living color, nice and bright.

2.  Douglas Fairbanks Jr. stars with Maureen O'Hara, and The Anthony Quinn.  There are others you will reconize.

3.  The model ships are well done and one is a warship with oars.  I noticed when one of Sinbad's men shot the oarsman and the model turned about, you could actually see model men onboard including the one looking like Anthony Quinn...not bad.

4.  The sails on both ships filled out nicely as they caught the wind so both models must have been pretty big.

5.  Classicly done, I think most sceens are on a sound stage with lots of force scaling.  Done well enough not to detract from the taste of the movie.

six.  I didn't know Sinbad supposed to have been abandoned by his father!  It's been a long time since I read the 1001 ARABIAN NIGHTS, but according to this storyline he is actually a prince of the island where Alexander the Great took all his treasure--to tell you the truth, I don't remember if that is where the legend say it is or not.

7.  Great storyline.  Little bits of it are hinted at throughout the movie until it reaches its' conclusion and you hear the beginning story of Sinbad.  I'm glad I've seen this...I don't remember his story much, too bad.

8.  Fine acting by Quinn and the assassin.  (You ever notice the word assassin calls you the first three letters of that word twice?)

CONS:

1.  If you like these 'real' movies add this one to you collection like I did.  Especially if you like Sinbad.  In this case there is no down side.  For those of you who don't like at least a fine storyline, special effects, no naked females, and some class...well you might learn something of modeling and forcescaling.  Otherwise I would have liked a longer movie.  All movies worth watching should be longer.

This movie is a little bit above just popcorn.  It should require a salad bowl of popcorn and half a hot dog, and of course a drink.  A perfect movie is the popcorn, two dogs, a big drink.  At least that is the grading system I've started using tonight.  Why give it four or five stars and only half a dog.  The movie requires attention because the writer can write but everything is laid out there for you to watch without having to focus hard on it. Bye.",1176595200,8,2919,4.312384473197782
1246513,4,B00001W0FF,"Sinbad (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr) chances upon a map he believes will lead him to Deryabar, Alexander the Great's fabled island of riches. Sinbad sets off on his treasure hunt and, along the way, romances the beautiful but avaricious Shireen (Maureen O'Hara) and draws the ire of the Emir of Daibul (Anthony Quinn). Plenty of derring-do here, and high seas excitement, exotic settings and best of all - a brash, mellifluous Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. I first saw this Arabian Nights adventure when I was a kid a lazy Saturday afternoon ago. I tremendouly enjoyed Sinbad the Sailor then and it hasn't lost its luster over the years, with repeated viewings.

This was a watershed film for Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.  He was ever struggling to get out from under the shadow of  his more famous father, who practically invented swashbuckling. He had just finished a 5-year active-duty stint in the Navy during WW2 and wasn't certain if he still had a movie career. But RKO studios offered him Sinbad the Sailor, a film bigger or as big as anything he had done before. The result is one of Fairbanks, Jr's best vehicles, as he instills his Sinbad with a boyish swagger and flamboyance, proving to any doubters that he could buckle his swash with the best of them.

Be advised that, in this film, Fairbanks Jr. arches his eyebrows liberally, fingers his beard theatrically, laughs his truimphant ""ha-ha's"" overtly, and gesticulates broadly. But his emoting fits the exaggerated persona of his character. Fairbanks Jr, in this role, has a twinkle in his eye and a tongue in his cheek, seemingly having the time of his life. As done in 1947, I rate it a very good performance. Maureen O'Hara is as feisty and gorgeous as ever, with nary a trace of her Irish accent  (with her glorious red hair and vivid personality, she was dubbed ""the Queen of Technicolor""). Anthony Quinn and Walter Slezak enhance the goings-on with their villainy.

Two favorite scenes of mine:  Sinbad, covetous of a certain baggala (ship) under auction, ostensibly lauds the merits of  the ship to the bidders but ends up discouraging them. The other scene is much later on, as Sinbad performs a magic trick in front of Shireen, the Emir and his guards.",1150416000,36,2207,4.804749340369393
1246514,1,B00001W0FF,"Upon watching this movie, I was disappointed at the quality of the image. The image was very poor and fuzzy. I returned it and Amazon refunded only half of what I paid.

The action sequences are worth the price of admission, particularly Doug Jr.'s acrobatic escape from villain Anthony Quinn (who meets a rather fiery end). Fairbanks is perfect in the title role, with Quinn, Maureen O'Hara and Walter Slezak rounding out an excellent cast. Terrific fun for viewers of all ages!",1082592000,25,484,5.466666666666667

1246525,5,B00001W0FF,"I saw this movie as a kid and was thrilled and spellbound: the flaming technicolor, the endless mystique, the ongoing intrigue, the acrobatic prowess of Douglas Fairbanks, the sights of those mysterious faraway places straight out of the Arabian Nights despite having been shot on Hollywood back-lots which, in the long run, imbued them with more surrealistic flare than the real thing. I was therefore apprehensive when I prepared to view it again a few years ago lest it would lose its initial impact now that I'm no longer young. But I was pleased and surprised to find out that it lost none of its charm because, among other things as reviewer J. Aycock notes, ""actors today just don't compare to the real thing from...years back"". Add to it that movies nowadays mostly deal with battered bodies, spilled blood and senseless violence.

1246560,5,B00001W0FF,"This was, according to TCM channel Robert Osborn, a movie that Jr Douglas Fairbanks took VERY VERY SERIOUSLY!!!  So to anyone in the low star range let this be known, he has just returned home after 1. the depression, where people could not find a job often and 2. he was serving in WW2 and had just gotten out of the military thinking he was ""all washed up"" and his film career gone.  He plays the part in a whimsical and playful style (not that Sinbad is not serious), but was akin to the prince of thieves as in the movie (Kismet Ronald Colman version (and yes both versions and different stories the other with Howard Keel are excellent).  Sinbad has to fool the people around himself yet at the same time search for his destiny all ""flying by the seat of his sails so to speak"".  So I feel the acting and the rich color both along with the magical story of his ship and his mysterious background are a fun adventure.  This is a movie also that at 7 years old my parents back then would let me watch without being afraid of content.  Maureen O'Hara is as always excellent in her red hair and flashing green eyes in this rich technicolor version.  It is a classic.  Fairbanks Jr also later (since this movie at the time was a huge smash hit) got many more contracts!  He played it the best way he could after 5 years of war and the studio gave him a shot!  It was his 1 shot (if it was your 1 shot after WW2 you would try hard too).  It worked out for him and saved his career catapulting him into super stardom as well as delighted audiences of every age for years.",1405382400,,1569,4.196666666666666

This my favourite of all Fantasy/Adventure films which were plenty in this era, and had all the things to please, The then most beautiful lady in the world, Maureen O' Hara,( look at her now, ) still beautiful. Douglas Fairbanks Jr, any lady would want someone like this hero to run off with. The tongue in cheek dialogue, is not as poo poo as some reviews have it, just carefully listen to it....it' s beautiful. Every actor is superb, even the minor ones. Roy Webbs beautiful music carries it along with gusto and romance, and of course, some sumptuious Technicolor, look at the beautiful color shots of the young Jane Greer.
The finale, even now lifts me out of the seat, where Sinbad tells the the greedy merchants they don' t get his message, and then grabs his Shareen and the ship sails out to sea, a lovely shadow shot behind the sails as the end title comes up and Roy Webb' s music closes the curtains....
This films hasn' t had too good a print over the years, but Warner has excelled themselves in this one, pristine transfer in sound and vision and color. No need for a Blu Ray. This excells.

Oh!, just one other thing, If anyone nowadays think this is old fashioned to the new fantasy films, just remember, that Douglas Fairbanks Jr. flew in the air first, after being caught by a ROC bird, as he mentions to the merchants, indicating a previous Sinbad adventure.
Thanks to all concerned for a lifetime of a wonderful film.

1246575,5,B00001W0FF,"This is one of those movies from my early youth which captivated me. It has been over 45 years since I saw it last and I have been waiting for a studio to transfer it to DVD. This is one outstanding transfer! The Technicolor restoration and transfer is as good as opening night at the theatre.

Watching it through the lens of years, I noted the dialogue is somewhat more sophisticated than is generally found in films today. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.'s performance is the very definition of over-the-top but he makes it work. Maureen O'Hara's character is no shrinking violet or damsel in distress; she is a player right along with big boys Anthony Quinn and Walter Slezak!

The story tells of Sinbad's previously unheralded eighth voyage - only seven fantastic voyages were chronicled in the Arabian Nights. This last voyage reveals his origins as Prince Ahmed of Deryabar, the legendary island containing Alexander the Great's fabulous treasure, and his perilous adventure to re-claim that birthright.

I love Fairbanks's adventure pictures, especially his swashbucklers, because he has his father's joy and energy, joined with his own good-looks and humor.  While not generally a big fan of sword-and-sandal swashbucklers, or of fantasy Arabian pictures, this ""Sinbad the Sailor"" is a great success.

Fairbanks is endless fun as Sinbad, Marleen O'Hara is lovely and troublesome as the Princess, and Walter Slezak is his usual success as a villain one loves to boo.

The film has sumptuous costumes and sets and is a wonderful escape for some 90-minutes.  The picture and sound on this WB Archive Collection DVD-R are fine.  Recommended for fans of Sinbad, classic fantasy, and swashbucklers.",1366070400,,742,5.19327731092437

I always told my kids and grandkids to watch it when it plays on tv again.  Sad to say it never played again.  Then on a whim I tired Amazon to see if they had it.  Bingo!  I ordered it and what fun!  An extra added bonus was that it was in color.  I had never seen it in color.  My wife enjoyed it as did my two oldest.  Douglas Jr., Maureen, and Anthony were just great.  This is fun escapist viewing at its best.",1359763200,13,527,3.743119266055046
1246579,5,B00001W0FF,"As of this date, almost all of the negative Amazon reviews of this film relate to the picture quality of those dvd a/o vhs copies available prior to the Warner Archives 2012 release.  They should now be discounted. The Warner release has crisp images, technicolor so brilliant that it hurts the eyes, and, wonder of wonders for an Archives release, optional subtitles. As for the story itself, it has more holes than a sieve but is still fun, especially when listening to (or reading: Ah! Those subtitles!) the flamboyant dialogue and/or watching Fairbanks channel his father's over-the-top performances from the 1920s. Highly recommended for, as per another reviewer, young children and sophisticated grown-ups.",1358294400,30,712,5.300884955752212

1246582,5,B00001W0FF,"Nothing except the shine of polyester can be as explosive on the retina than Tecnicolor blue. This is the first color we see in this swashbuckling adventure movie all over the expanse of the sea, like a saphire-acid rug. It really is a very appropriate hallucinogenic coloring for this totally mindless fantasy that stars Douglas Fairbanks Jr fresh from a real war and making a comeback to movieland. It worked very well as he has a wonderful gust of energy in every scene, his smile is always flawless and he looks good in Arabian garb as Sinbad the legendary sailor. Except for a few elaborate gestures that come from the silent movie tradition, his performance is very enjoyable.

The entire film is told as a flashback by Sinbad, recounting to a willing audience in a language that is overwrought and sometimes silly, his unknown latest adventure as an ""Eighth"" voyage. He starts off by finding a great looking ship that is about to crash into the rocks, and dives right in with his sidekick to recoup it fro himself. Later on, when forced to offer it at auction, his hints about plague to potential buyers of the ship, causes no one to buy the vessel except himself, of course, while stealing the money like a pro from the auctioneer's own bag. The easy purchase is stalled by a beautiful odalisque, with the divine name of Shireen and played by Maureen O'Hara,  who wants, what else? to marry a prince and also wants to acquire the vessel, so she bids up the price from inside her covered litter that appropriately has a bunch of colorful feathers in each corner.  Her peculiar hair style which extends a generous reddish mane down her back stays perfect through thick and thin as well as her coral-red lipstick. She also wears a series of gorgeous gowns that are Holywood's harem fare: heavily embroidered tops, a weird hipped-camisole with train combination, thoroghly transparent veils  and lovely pointy shoes.
Sinbad is also  trying to solve a riddle, involving  an amulet that had been found about his neck since he was found as a lost baby. Unfortunately we do not get to see it dangling from his naked torso, as he never takes the shirt off so we are left in doubt as to how good he looked compared to his father in ""The Thief of Baghdad"" where he is thankfully shirtless and shows off a wonderful physique.  This trinket looks so fake we can not possibly believe it could have lasted till he grew up, but it has a map that comes in handy. The image in the amulet (which is also reproduced in the glass window of the ship) is  a map of an island which also re-appears exactly the same on a real map, pinned to the wall in the cabin, (This repetition is done so we realize how important this treasure was) showing the route to a  fabled island where the treasure of Alexander the Great is buried. This map later mysteriously disappears from the vessel, but it does not stop Sinbad or the Emir from furiously sailing ahead.
Some of the most delightful scenes are where Shireen is being romanced by the Emir, a young and sexy Anthony  Quinn in a thin moustache; who is inmaculately dressed in white and wears a huge cabochon ruby that glows in his also white turban with the incandescence of a Christmas ornament.
Shireen believes Sinbad can lead her to the treasure island, and she is confident she can swap him for the Emir if he wins the treasure, with her female guile and the allure of her Colgate teeth, while the Emir wants both the gold and the girl badly. What follows is Arabian Nights adventure : Ship chases, lashings of the slave crew in the Emir's ship that recall 'Ben-Hur', wild escapes, catty arguments between Shireen and the Emir, the revelation that Melik, a Mongolian-looking creature, a man with 'evil' eyes and obsessed with finding the treasure and who has sailed with Sinbad, is the poisoner of the crew of the ship Sinbad had found. This all makes up for tension amongst all when they finally land at the mysterious island of Derryabar. The island has a conveniently Grecian palace that looks ruined, yet has an extremely well lit hall where all the action, and the discovery of the treasure will take place. Sinbad, in a typical ""Arabian Night"" tale-fashion is discovered to be the ruler-philosopher's long-lost son. The treasure is revealed and does not disappoint in its amount, glittery shine  or splendor, however Sinbad must save it from the greedy Emir, who wants to use it for his own 'evil' ends. Luckily this will not happen and we will get a happy ending with delightful destruction of all evil characters.
This is the type of movie that is ideal for escape-entertainment. It takes you away with all its color and energy into a fantasy land that would have delighted, and surprised Sinbad himself. Perfect for the summer with good air conditioning.",1249948800,11,4796,4.650531286894923

1246584,1,B00001W0FF,"Dear Amazon,
Recently I have purcahsed the video tape of Sibab The Sailor starring Douglas Fairbanks and Maureen O 'Hara. Iam very disappoimnted this time as the quality of this video tape is not good at all. I have purchased a ne w video tape but unfortunely the color of the film is no longer clear and almost has become black & white instead of a color film. I will not purchase any classic video tape any longer in the near future. I presume all quality of these classic film on VHS are too old to be purchased.

1246585,1,B00001W0FF,"I purchased this VHS tape because of the bad reviews of the DVD available on Amazon.

But this VHS is an awful rip-off with very poor video quality. It even uses a cheap color xerox of the original VIC box artwork used as a slide in sheet for the cover of the box. The artwork on the front of the box even cuts off some of the VIC logo and the back has unreadable grainy text.

Distributor on box front = Video International Corp., [...] on back, but the tape plays as Video Entertainment Corp. as distributor.

Amazon lists this as the January 1st, 1985 release, VHS tape. However it says on the back of the box, artwork copyright 2007.

It played like a copy of a copy of a copied tape. I returned it to Amazon.

Later I bought a used copy of the original 1986 RKO release and the 1986 Turner release on VHS. Both are excellent! (The RKO version seemed a little sharper and brighter of these two fine VHS tapes.)",1219449600,,914,4.2298850574712645

Even though it was made in 1947 its still plays well today with just a bit of classic Campinas.. The quality of the movie And cast is suburb, special-effects and staging is fabulous for its time and even today considering theres no computer effects. If you like great fantasy movies and adventure movies that are not all computer graphics and people this is a movie for you!  Its a classic for all time.",1524873600,,486,4.5227272727272725
7914855,1,B00001W0FF,"I waited 6 decades (yes, 60 years) for Sinbad the Sailor to be available, but the DVD would not download. I immediately checked 2 other DVDs to see if it was my player, but everything worked fine. I returned it to Amazon for an exchange, thinking a second copy would work. It did download after a long wait then froze at Chapter 8. I removed it and checked if there was dust or a scar on the play side. Nothing. I put it back in the player and it wouldn't download at all, as with the first DVD. I'm crushed.  This was one of my favorite movies when I was a little girl, and I can't believe that Warner Bros. would allow this amazing, delicious and beautiful classic with a killer cast to be so poorly transferred, and probably by some clumsy, uncaring person. To add insult to my utter disappointment, the second DVD case arrived cracked and splintered on the top edge, proving that cheap materials are being used in the packaging. I don't blame Amazon at all, just their manufacturer and distributor of this DVD. And Amazon should raise hell with that manufacturer/distributor.",1524614400,,1079,4.533333333333333
