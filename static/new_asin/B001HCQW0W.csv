3630252,4,B001HCQW0W,"If you ever watch Death Note, then watching the series you will get the ""The main character Lelouch is acting pretty similar to Yagami Light"" vibe. Yes they both want to change the world, but Lelouch wants to change the world so his sister can live a better life. Yagami wants to become a god of the new world he creates.
  It's been four years but I remember the basics of the show. Lelouch Lamperouge, real name is Lelouch vi Britannia is an exiled prince of the Royal Family of Britinnia. After speaking out against his father during the aftermath of his mother's murder, him and his disabled sister Nunnally (who was injured during the assasination of her mother) was sent to Japan as political hostages. There they meet Suzaku, Japan's late prime minister's son. During this time Japan and Britannia get into a war because the Royal family is interest in a strange material called Sakuradite which Japan has plenty of. Britannia wins and names Japan Area 11 and refer the Japanese as Elevens or Numbers. Suzaku doesn't get along with Lelouch at first but soon they become best friends. Then Lelouch and Nunnally have to leave so they can meet up with one of their mother's allies.
  They won't meet again until seven years later when Lelouch gets caught up in a terroist attack. Soliders sent to the scene decided to get rid of any witnesses including Lelouch and then a strange girl with green hair touches him and gives him a strange power called Geass. She makes a contract with him, she will give him a great power and in return he must grant her wish. He accepts and with Geass, within eye contact Lelouch can command anyone do whatever he wants them to do. With this power he can create the world his sister deserves but would he be ready for the consequences and sacrifices that follow?",1355529600,,1798,4.59190031152648

Overall im glad i bought this and i plan on buying Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion, Part 3 (Limited Edition) so i can finish the series.",1275868800,,593,4.120689655172414
3630255,2,B001HCQW0W,"I have an order placed in 2009-Dec and the package received was attaching Manga vol 5 instead of the correct vol 2..
Anyone experienced the same problem ?
The problem re-occur even Amazon arranged a replacement, so guess it is manufacturer's packing problem..
Of course, the DVD itself should be good.. (I already watched the TV version on local TV before)",1263427200,,356,4.852459016393443
3630256,5,B001HCQW0W,"if your a fan of the series, the special edition is great.  realize that the manga however is just a manga of one episode, and not a side story or anything.",1259020800,,156,4.032258064516129
3630257,5,B001HCQW0W,"Part two of ""Code Geass"" gets even more maliciously violent, with terrorist attacks, plot twists and a sadistic arch-nemesis.

This set of DVDs shows LeLouch having a tough time balancing his school life and the terrorist work with the Black Knights. In episodes 9-10, Zero and the Knights set up a massive landslide against the Brittanian forces in Narita. However, his landslide destroys the city of Narita, leaving him with the guilt of murdering thousands of people, including people related to his friends.

The true kicker of this box set, however, are the episodes in which LeLouch confronts the madman, Mao. This teenager, madly in love with the green-haired C.C., has an incredible Geass power. LeLouch and Mao are forced to confront each other in a deadly battle of wits.

Admittedly, this series will test the limits of even longtime shonen fans. There's plenty of violence and even a frightening scene involving a chainsaw and a pistol that may keep parents from purchasing this DVD. However, the stakes are raised in this anime for the heartbreaking, tragic end to season one in part three. This is a brutal, but exciting anime to watch.",1252800000,3,1150,4.948186528497409
3630258,5,B001HCQW0W,"Code Geass is the best anime I've seen to date.  It has a bit of everything:  mecha, strategy, romance, politics, comedy.  The characters are interesting and engaging, and the English dubbing is pretty good.  Curve balls come out of left field at any moment making you desperate to see the next episode.  My jaw hit the floor more often in this series than all the other anime I've seen combined.  Can't recommend this series strongly enough.  WARNING: don't search for info on the show online as you'll probably find HUGE SPOILERS!!",1244505600,3,533,4.791208791208791
3630259,5,B001HCQW0W,"Excellent!  ""CODE GEASS: Lelouch of the Rebellion"" is just excellent!

I literally raved about how much I enjoyed Part I and how ""CODE GEASS: Lelouch of the Rebellion"" is just an amazing series and one of the best to come from Japan in awhile.

And so far, the popularity has led to another series, the first anime album to reach #1 on the Oricon music album charts and many of the drama series breaking into the Oricon album charts top 10.

The series is just well written, the CLAMP-based characters are just cool and the mecha and art designs are just fantastic to look at.

Vol. 3 consists of episodes 10-13 and Vol. 4 consists of episodes 14-17.  The storyline primarily focuses on the introduction of MAO, who has a Geass of reading people's thoughts and of course, more revelations on Suzaku and how it will impact his relationship with Lelouch.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""CODE OF GEASS: Lelouch of the Rebellion"" is featured 1:78:1 Anamorphic Widescreen.  The animation and video quality is colorful and digitally modern since it is a newer anime television release.  What I love about the video quality is the sheer amount of people involved.  Everyone with detail, buildings, mecha and the destruction has detail.  The character designs based from CLAMP's character design concepts are just fresh and cool to look at.  One of the coolest looking character designs in an anime mecha series without being a full-on mecha series.  Very cool!

As expected from a recent anime series, video quality was just great.  From the character animation to the backgrounds, everything was colorful and vibrant.  And because this series features so many scenes throughout Japan, this series really featured so much background art and characters.  Everything looked awesome!  Again, I'm very impressed with how much went in creating a single episode.

As for the audio, the audio is English and Japanese stereo.  For a television series, I was sort of expecting stereo sound but knowing some television series including Dolby Digital 5.1 on the DVD soundtracks,  I was hoping that there may have been a Dolby Digital 5.1 track for Code Geass but the audio is stereo.  Dialogue is clear and you can understand what the characters are saying.  Both the English and Japanese voice acting are well done.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

You can find really cool special features on both volumes.  Let's start with the volume 3 DVD:

  1. Picture Drama Episode Episode #4 (Stage 9.75) - In this episode, Lelouche cooks Nunnally a meal and spends time with his sister.
  2. Picture Drama Episode Episode #6 (Stage 4.33) - In this episode, Jeremiah talks to Mao about being a failure of not being their to prevent the deaths of Lady Marianne (Lelouche's mother) and Lord Clovis.
  3. Audio Commentary Stage #11 - In this audio commentary, the voice actors for Lelouche (Jun Fukuyama), C.C. (Yukana) are joined by Yuriko Chiba (Character Animation Director), Eiji Nakada (designer of Knightmares and Mecha Animation Director) and Kazuya Murata  (Assistant Director) and discuss episode 11. Another fun and lively commentary thanks to the commentary direction by Lelouche voice actor Jun Fukuyama.  In this commentary, we learn how the animation process works and the communication between writers and directors.  Also, the ideas passed by the designers to the director.
  4. Textless Opening (2nd Version of ""Colors"")

With the fourth volume, the special features are:

  * Picture Drama Episode #6 (Stage 8.75) - Princess Euphemia talks to Princess Cornelia into wearing a bathing suit and everyone heads to the beach.  Meanwhile, Shirley is concerned by Lelouche and Nunnaly's closeness.

  * Textless Ending for ""Mosaic Kakera""
  * Textless Opening for the 1st version of ""Kaidokufunou""

JUDGMENT CALL:

I really enjoyed this latest Part II of ""CODE GEASS: Lelouch of the Rebellion"".  Enjoying the strategy, the wit, the action sequences and how everything plays out, is just wonderful.

With Part II, you can tell how the series is setting things up between Lelouche versus Suzaku.  Both are best friends, having grown up with each other but when Lelouche finds out that Suzaku is a thorn in his side, you just wonder how far Lelouche will go to destroy Britannia.

What's more shocking is to watch him go through the doldrums of knowing he killed Shirley's father but sacrifices are needed.  But more shocking what he had to do to Shirley in order to ensure that his identity as Zero is not blown.

Both volumes were just as action-packed, gripping and addictive as the previous two volumes.  And there were a lot of revealing moments for Suzaku and C.C.'s characters.  So, suffice to say, these two volumes are quite important as it's definitely setting things up for probably more explosive and action-packed episodes.

With everything so positive, the only negative, and it's really not a negative but more or less I enjoying hearing the action all around me via Dolby Digital 5.1 (especially in DTS-HD or Dolby TrueHD ala Blu-ray) is that I wished that audio was presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 but still dialogue is quite clear and easy to understand in stereo and the music as well.  But I really hope this series gets the Blu-ray treatment soon.

""CODE GEASS: Lelouch of the Rebellion"" is a fantastic anime series that doesn't come along too frequently in Japan. Beautiful character designs, art direction, voice acting, mecha designs and a wonderful plot, this anime is definitely special and worth watching.

Like Part I, everything about Part II of ""CODE GEASS: Lelouch of the Rebellion"" so far has been excellent and I can't wait for Part III.  I highly recommend this DVD set!",1235001600,19,6024,5.001007049345418
