7951056,2,B00005QW5U,"The credits for this film should tell you what kind of movie you're in for.  Laurence Avenet-Bradley plays the doomed corpse and was also the cinematographer; Brian Avenet Bradley wrote and directed; John L. Altom plays John, the redneck and also is the horse wrangler and gaffer.  Not that there's anything wrong in double dipping, but in this case, it shows.

While the direction is properly atmospheric at times, there's nothing new--you can see what's coming.

The movie opens with JM bashing his wife's head in with a baseball bat because he caught her with his best friend in bed.  For some inexplicable reason, he wants to freeze her, hence the title.  They've only been married for a year!  Anyway, he puts her on ice and takes her to his sister's farm where their wedding took place.  Boyfriend of course will follow later on.  At the farm, JM puts his wife in a discarded freezer.  He later meets John and his cousin Bud, and soon he encounters John's abused wife, Julie.  John is the caretaker for the farm, but you know he's a slimeball.  JM keeps having ghostly apparitions of his dead wife, and soon people start finding out what JM did, and so...no spoiler here.

Suffice to say, FREEZ'ER has the worst acting I've seen in some time.  Barnes Walker III plays JM like a zombie, turning on his required emotions like a well worn faucet.  Carrie Waldron as Julie is equally bad, reminiscent of a teenager in their first community theatre role; and John L. Altom is totally laughable in his role as John.

I'm all for indies, and have truly enjoyed some of them like ANGELS CREST and HOBBS END, but this movie is so bad it's funny, but not funny enough to recommend.",1091059200,2,1677,4.595959595959596

It not only held my interest, but it had great thrilling action that keeps you on your toes and a great story, with the ability to grab those scary emotions. The acting was good, the cinematography excellent and the music wonderful. This is a movie that I have added to my video collection and that everyone should go and see. I have to say that some people have more bad luck. Buy and watch the movie you'll love it.
Thanks Brian for the great movie. Hope to see more in the future.

Freezer features a strong cast, good sound and image quality developed from a tight script that is true to its characters. You could call this a low cost film; I prefer to call it priceless. I saw this film at a festival and am delighted to see it is out now on DVD. By the way, they actually call this film Freez'er. If you have seen it, you can figure out the title.",1009584000,3,431,4.142857142857143
7951059,5,B00005QW5U,"I am a big fan of this Genre and This is one of the better directed Suspense Thrillers I've seen. It defies a low budget production to deliver that rarest of things in film - atmosphere. And this film reeks of atmosphere, the whole production just weaves its magic spell - music - location- cinematography and direction all combine into a masterpiece. With a subtle amount of foreshadowing the story is one of real people in a real situation and was a joy to watch. Don't miss this one.",1007164800,8,486,4.47191011235955
