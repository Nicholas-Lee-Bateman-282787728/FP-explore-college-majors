8015676,3,B0001OGUTU,"Well, This DVD is not that bad. It is more like an instruction video teacher will play in the PE class rather than a interesting workout routine you can do at home. Content is a little bit boring. However, I believe if you really study the exercise in the DVD, you will benefit from it. By the way, the DVD is only 40 minuets long, not a hour like it says on the package.",1199750400,,371,4.027027027027027
8015677,1,B0001OGUTU,"If this is the same DVD, Essential Pilates for Athletes taught by Allan Menezes, then do not buy it.  The movements are rushed, in order to do the workout properly you would have to repeatedly start and stop the DVD.  I bought the disc hoping to be able to do the routine at home or in a hotel room but the boxes, straps, supports and weights he says to use prevent one from doing the assigned exercises effectively.  Also, as a triathlete I was looking for more sport specific stretching and focus, there was nothing in this DVD that was specific to endurance athletes.",1117670400,,570,4.461538461538462
