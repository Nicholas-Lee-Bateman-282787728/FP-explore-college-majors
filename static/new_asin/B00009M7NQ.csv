7991322,5,B00009M7NQ,Wonderful primer on basic housekeeping. Ms. Laurie does it all with very few tools and no exotic products. Good hints on how to manage one's time while getting it all done.,1433376000,,172,4.580645161290323
7991323,1,B00009M7NQ,"I was hoping to see a sort of speed clean type video for doing your own house effectively, and got this. It has nothing to do with a regular person. This is designed for professional maids and especially, staffs of large homes where there are multiple maids and service workers!  There are tips on things like dress code, on carrying around a basket of supplies at all times (probably marginally helpful if your house has a normal amount of space), behaving ethically on the job, etc. The only randomly useful thing I got out of it is that the woman says if you are about to run the dishwasher you should turn on the hot water in the sink for a while first...did not realize that affected dishwasher water temperature.",1382486400,2,718,4.523076923076923
7991324,5,B00009M7NQ,"This DVD caught my attention because I am in the mode of organizating my whole house, but needed a little more motivation to get it all started.  This was a delightful DVD.  Although I know how to clean, it was reflreshing to see what she does and I also learned a few new tips!",1372809600,,278,4.12962962962963
7991325,3,B00009M7NQ,It's better to watch people clean than to read a book about how to clean. The video shows some basics and tips but is way too short. It runs only 30 minutes.,1298246400,,157,3.9375
7991326,5,B00009M7NQ,"This video is a great teaching tool for teaching home cleaning.  I used it with cognitively impaired young adults and it is very imformative, with details on what is needed for household cleaning.  This is a great video for anyone who needs information on living or cleaning on your own.",1270512000,2,287,4.72
7991327,5,B00009M7NQ,"Upon watching Miss Laurie's video on house cleaning, I not only became a more efficient housekeeper, it helped me to organize my time and tools to work more quickly. I also turned it over to my bi-monthly cleaning woman and saved myself alot of explanations. I particularly liked the little tidbits of info on how to clean cutting boards, shower stalls and laundry. I highly recommend it as a gift idea as well.",1075248000,11,411,4.6438356164383565
7991328,5,B00009M7NQ,"Dear Miss Laurie, I can't thank you enough! Your cleaning video is fantastic.  Along with teaching a child how to manage their money, this is a must for kids out on their own for the first time. I don't usually give testimonials but this time I had to say something.
 I have always been something of a perfectionist when it comes to a clean and orderly home - unfortunately I did not instill the same values in my son - I cleaned up after him. Well, in early August we moved him into his first apartment. When we visited over Labor Day, I was horrified at the condition of his home - I told him that if he wanted to be messy that was his choice - but unsanitary, no way. Rather than do the work for him, I looked for a guide to help him. I was so glad to find your video, because I knew he would never read a book. This past weekend we visited again and this time, though I couldn't believe my eyes, it was a joy to see his apartment. It was clean and neat! Your tips for working smart meant that he didn't have to put long hours into cleaning - so he keeps it up. He was actually proud of his home and his efforts. Thank you Miss Laurie! I am sharing this with all my friends who have children.",1064793600,14,1195,4.016806722689076
7991329,1,B00009M7NQ,"I wanted help on how I could more efficiently clean my house. This was not the right video for that. It appears to be designed as instruction for a maid, including tips on closing the shower door so things look nice. If you want a more organized approach to house cleaning, complete with a list of tools and products you will need, you would be better off if you can find an old copy at your local library of ""How to Clean Your House in Two Hours."" That video lays out a cleaning strategy for each room and aggressive tips for cleaning well and quickly.",1064620800,22,553,4.276190476190476
7991330,5,B00009M7NQ,"As a neat freak, I thought I knew everything about cleaning.  Miss Laurie prooved me wrong.  I learned that I didn't even have the right tools to properly clean my home.  I really got this video to constructively help my housekeeper to fine tune her cleaning skills.  I thought this would be a neutral way for me to explain my cleaning standards without me having to follow her around and point things out as she is working.  As a bonus I learned a lot too, which raised my cleaning standards.  So now things are being cleaned that have been unknowingly neglected for a long time.  This video is well done, very methodical, easy to follow and packs a lot of information into each segment.  It's worth every penny...a clean home is priceless.",1056931200,15,741,4.5606060606060606
7991331,5,B00009M7NQ,This video is great!  You can learn so much more about how to clean smarter.  Better results in less time. Martha Stewart better watch out for Miss Laurie.  The production value is right up there.  A helpful tool that is fun to watch!  I can't wait for her next one on cooking.  A great investment.  I bought one for each of my daughters.,1056412800,6,338,4.26984126984127
