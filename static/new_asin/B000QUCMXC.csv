2840666,1,B000QUCMXC,"I bought this just a couple of days ago,This novela was one of the best when it came out but this particular DVD is horrible. The original opening song is non existent and the background music originally used has been changed. Also the DVD has been edited to the point that there is one long segment of just images with no sound. Just music with images.  HORRIBLE!!!!! I don't know what Televisa was thinking in creating this piece of junk.",1197072000,16,440,4.5

2840710,1,B000QUCMXC,"I had never seen this novela before, but I was very interested, and so I bought the DVD without reading the reviews.

The plot is impossible to follow - actors change without reason, for example, Leonella was played by two different actresses and it was confusing, especially since Rogelio had two different nurses without the first one leaving, or getting fired - just changed, for no reason whatsoever.

At times, the dialogue couldn't even be heard some times over the weird dramatic music that sounded like a bunch of kids in band practice. There's one scene, that's outdoors, where all you hear is the wind blowing and the dramatic music. Their mouths are moving, but all you hear are incoherent murmurs.

As for the story - ladies prepare to be disappointed, unless you're into domestic abuse. Rosa's ""prince charming"" is an IDIOT. Half the time he's calling her a stupid savage, the other half he's manhandling her for trying to be an independent woman. Now, I'm not ultra-feminist, but JEEEEEEEEZ this guy is a JERK, to put it nicely! And you'd think it would change, but he stays the same, throughout the whole novela, to the very end! Seriously - half the time he's accusing her of cheating, he's cheating on her. The other half, when he's calling her a savage for calling him out on his flirty ""friendship"" with Leonella, he's actually doing things that would lose him a TON of credibility in divorce court.

About halfway through, I wanted to kill every single person except for Rosa, Tomasina, and Paulette. Rogelio was like his brother, except with a softer temperament. Dulcina was screaming the WHOLE entire novela. NO JOKE. Half the people were clueless, and the other half were stupid. In short, the intelligence and soul of this novela amount to that of a moldy bat.

By the end of the novela, I felt so cheated I wanted my money back. I felt like this novela slapped every woman in the face and said, ""get back in the kitchen, fool, and forget about love and women's rights - they just don't exist."" Thankfully, I am also the proud owner of Pasion de Gavilanes and Soy Tu Duena (the best of my collection, thus far, as I'd never seen that one either and understood the plot line easily from watching the DVD - and at least the guy 1) was hot, 2) was faithful 3) was INTELLIGENT, and more importantly, 4) APOLOGIZED for manhandling Valentina). A few episodes of those two, and I was hearing wedding bells in my sleep, and all was right in the world once more.

In short - don't waste your time. I'm sure this was a wonderful novela when it came out. But this DVD was depressing.",1342656000,2,2597,4.598272138228942
2840711,5,B000QUCMXC,"Rosa es una adaptacin de Los Ricos tambin lloran, tambin con Vernica Castro. Y fue bien hecha, con los mismos elementos de la histria original.

2840714,3,B000QUCMXC,"I don't know what a product link is but I have purchased 8 telenovelas to date and it is very disheartening to witness all the cuts made on them. Can you please advise Univision or Televisa or whoever is in charge of taping these movies about this? Want to buy many more but am discouraged because of this. What is wrong with these people? They can charge more if they want but please DON'T CUT ANYMAORE! Stories are incomplete and scenes are not connected.  Really BAD.  Please help!!!

2840716,2,B000QUCMXC,"Beware if you purchase this item.  The soundtrack has been dubbed over with new music.  It is a hack job, it appears half the show is re-edited and cut out.  It's not the same classic, regurgitated as a run-of-the-mill, everyday novela.

Usted tenga pendiente si compra este video.  La musica esta cambiada, la novela esta cortada, y ahora parece como qualquier novela.  No es la misma clasica que era antes.",1200787200,15,408,4.757142857142857
8197532,5,B000QUCMXC,"A 5 star review ONLY because I saw the original and loved it.  If you have seen this in its entirety on TV you will NOT want to buy this chopped up version.  So disappointed when I received this.  I did read it was only a  few discs but I was hoping (haha) that by some miracle it would a soap opera that took a year to air.  Joke was on me.  If you haven't seen it before, I don't know how you could follow the story with so much of it missing.  Trust me do not order this.",1498176000,,474,3.727272727272727

Until then, i won't bother with purchasing this no matter how much i want it in my collection.",1469923200,,409,4.324675324675325
