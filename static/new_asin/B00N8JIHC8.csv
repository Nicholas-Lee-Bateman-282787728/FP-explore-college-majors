6614575,3,B00N8JIHC8,"Tyler Perry's at it again with another play.  What I appreciated the most about this turn is that it was based on something that could happen to anyone out there, but this wasn't anything to write home about.  Here's my review on different areas.

PLOT

The synopsis is about a successful woman who is manless but who finds a man through an online dating site.  From there, it goes downhill for her.  As I said before, I appreciated that Tyler presented something that actually happens:  online dating gone awry.  The rest of the plot can be described by the title:  a woman scorned.

One contention that I take with this play but also with other plays is that Tyler seems to believe that being a successful woman and being emotionally satisfied is a zero-sum proposition.  He's stated this in plays such as ""Madea Goes to Jail"" and ""Madea's Class Reunion"".  Essentially, he's stating that the more successful a woman is, the more likely she is to be manless or lacking in the romance department.  It's generally never suggested that a successful woman, like Cheryl Pepsii Riley's six-figure character in this play, can lead a fulfilling life without a man.  This is one of the reasons why I rated down the play.

ACTING

Acting in Tyler's plays has never been a strong point, but most people on stage turn out a passable performance.  The best actor -- keeping in mind that we're dealing with unskilled or mediocre actors -- is Cheryl Pepsii Riley.  She plays a strong but lonely woman.  At times, her performance is not as credible as I would have liked, but she does an overall decent job.

The other actors are pretty forgettable for a number of reasons:

*They play into stereotypes about black people, which don't require a lot of skill.
*They are just poor actors that are struggling to keep up with the flow.
*They are actors who are trying too hard to be credible, so much so that it comes off as someone desperate for attention.

I believe Tyler's addressed these criticisms before by asserting that he's interested in giving roles to people who would normally have been rejected by Hollywood.  I suppose that's acceptable for a play, but it doesn't do the audience that pays good money any good.

SCENERY

It's a play, so you can imagine the scenery is amateurish, with not much thought put into it.  This is another reason why I voted down the play.  I'm not suggesting that Tyler replicate the set of ""Phantom of the Opera"", but with how affluent he is, you'd think he could have done something better.

SUMMARY

Overall, it's a decent play that relies on safety to make it watchable.  There are some over-the-top characters but also some decent ones.  This isn't the most riveting turn for Tyler, but if you're looking for something to keep you entertained with a bit of mindlessness, you'll like this play.",1503878400,,2821,4.6727642276422765

6614851,1,B00N8JIHC8,"Rent it, don't buy it, or just don't watch it. The underlying message is okay. It is not a new concept or new idea though so don't expect some great innovative play. It takes over an hour to get to anything remotely enjoyable (enjoyable is used relatively here in comparison the the body of the play). The entire time I struggled between turning it off and simply watching because I rented it. Within 5 mins I was over it and wanted it off. I finally feel asleep near the end and have no desire to watch the last 10-15 minutes. There are too many outlandish characters for this to work, The grandma is crazy, the best friend is extremely ""ghetto"" and the pastor is over the top in a weird way that is not believable and just does not work.  These variables make for a lot of overacting and a bad play. The actors themselves are not bad it may just be that the direction was given for them to play the characters in that way, which was ultimately a bad decision.

The musical selections are horrible from the arrangement to the lyrics. I had a little ""HA A!"" humor only once and did not find any of the retold or new jokes funny (a lot of the jokes are repeats).  It just seems like the entire thing was an after thought. The story development felt predictable, fake and forced even given that it is a play so things progress quickly. Additionally some of the incidents that occurred in reference to legal matters were not actually correct which further annoyed me.  It felt like punishment. One motivational conversation near the end from a wise old lady was not enough to save this play. The pearls of wisdom blended with a Christian/God centered message near the end does not over shadow or save this work.  Extremely disappointed.",1421884800,,1733,4.4715189873417724

Except Patrice Lovely (Mama Hattie) that girl is just great. Can't no one praise dance like Hattie. Other than that
it just wasn't there. I realize that Tyler is trying to give people a chance and to help open the door for more actors
but on this play the only one that could sing was the bride, the actors could not deliver there acting. They seemed
mechanical in everything say said and did.  Cheryl she's ok at times. Sometimes she on it and then other times she's
not. When she sings she winces.",1421625600,,609,4.389380530973451

6614879,5,B00N8JIHC8,"Very typical of Tyler Perry's plays, everything is so true.  As a single woman that have sheltered her heart against loving another man because she was left at the altar, listens to a friend that encourages her to start dating again but by finding a man online.  The years of sheltering her heart have left her financially in good shape.  But now she finds herself without any money after giving her heart away again.  A lot goes on in this woman's life and the first thing was turning her back o God and doing her own thing, but by the grace of God and the Pastor she realizes her mistake.  I recommend this to anyone that feel that they are alone in a situation that they can't handle just to see how God can turn your life around when you learn to forgive yourself and the person that hurt you.",1421020800,7,797,4.286666666666667

Long ago I started buying Tyler Perry plays without having rented or even seeing it live, just because I knew it was good. This was the case for me on this one, and I have to say that I was highly disappointed in this play. The set was...mediocre (for lack of a better word) as apposed to what Tyler Perry's sets normally look like. The cast, is amazing of course, but I feel like he's really just starting to use the same type of characters in different settings, as well as the same type of story...
I love Tyler Perry but I have to admit that this play was not one of my favorites at all and I don't even know if I want to keep it in my collection. I would recommend renting this before purchasing like I did.",1420070400,20,799,4.063291139240507

6614966,3,B00N8JIHC8,"It was ok which is why I'm only giving it three stars.  It seems like Tyler Perry is so busy that he really doesn't put his heart into his plays like he used to.  On another note, he's killing it with ""The Haves and Have Nots"" and "" If Loving You is Wrong""  I love those shows and can't wait for them to come back!!!",1418083200,3,316,3.830769230769231

6614991,4,B00N8JIHC8,"Bias Alert! I have over 35 Tyler Perry films and plays on DVD. This play addresses the all to familiar problem of how most people respond when something really negative happens in their life. They question God, even atheist use it as a reason why they do not believe in God. This especially happens when people see themselves as being good people, who believe they are so underserving of this really bad event. One of the major reasons I always enjoy Tyler Perry's plays are the original songs written and performed in them and there is no exception with this one. Patrice Lovely as Grandma is an absolute riot of nonstop laughs and Cheryl ""Pepsi"" Riley is a regular favorite in many Tyler Perry plays. As usual Tyler presents another family friendly project that everyone can learn something from.",1417824000,,798,4.748201438848921
6614992,5,B00N8JIHC8,This is one of Mr. Perry's best plays. The acting was good. The play had a few laughs. I really thought the writing was realistic because many people make bad decisions when they date. I felt for the characters. I highly recommend this play for fans of family drama/comedy. A must see for fans of Mr. Perry's work.,1417737600,10,314,4.431034482758621
6614993,5,B00N8JIHC8,"God has a plan for you he has blessed you with an extraordinary talent.  Or should I say talents.  Tyler I really enjoyed the play because it deals with true life experiences and as you said at the end of the play if you keep ending up with same results from a relationship, then it is time to look at yourself.  I have been blessed to find my first and true love when I was 17 years, now I have been married for 40 years.  Marriage is not something to take likely.  Continue to do what you are doing, this will help assist people in their daily lives.  May God bless continue to bless.",1417651200,,586,4.0964912280701755

6614995,5,B00N8JIHC8,"Saw this play in person at the Beacon Theatre in NY with some friends. We laughed and teared up a bit too. I was sorry that Madea was not in this play, but It was still excellent. Mr. Perry is wonderful and so are his plays and movies. So glad I can just watch it again and again on DVD! The message is things aren't always what they seem, but even when you mess up, there is always a new beginning.",1417478400,10,399,3.9382716049382718

6615016,5,B00N8JIHC8,"Tyler Perry's Hell Hath No Fury Like A Woman Scorned was hilarious and touching all at the same time. This play features awesome actors and singers especially Cheryl Pepsii Riley, Patrice Lovely and Zubulon Ellis. The play has beautiful comedic moments, touching moments and beautiful songs. The play is a like a better, funnier, updated version of Diary of A Mad Black Woman the Play. Will recommend this to any Tyler Perry fan, anybody looking for a good time.
