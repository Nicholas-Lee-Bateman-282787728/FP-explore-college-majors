8485444,4,B005STGM3W,"Released in 2010 and written/directed by Justin Head, Night Drive is a South African action/adventure with horror elements about an evening safari drive with a group of six tourists, two guides and the son of the head guide. They run afoul of violent poachers and their mad witchdoctor.

This is a stylish and violent flick with gore galore and a cool, unconventional opening. It eventually settles into a survival situation in the night wilderness. I don't know what the budget was, but the movie doesnt come across as low-budget; its expertly made. Unfortunately, we don't really get to know the tourists, except for an unbelievably hostile dude, whos a turn-off. As such, its hard to care about them and their outcome. The main protagonist is good (the son of the head guide), but the filmmakers drop the ball with the women. I suppose the white woman wouldve worked out, but they don't do enough with her. I did like the unexpected revelation about the witchdoctor at the end, but the second half shouldve been better considering the quality set-up. The script needed spruced-up to make the most of the situation, increase suspense, etc. Still, this is a very worthwhile jungle adventure with a side of horror.

The film runs 103 minutes and was shot Johannesburg and Broederstroom, North West, South Africa.

8485445,4,B005STGM3W,Surprisingly well done thriller with tropes that actually turn out to be well drawn characters. Well done and entertaining as hell.,1442361600,,131,5.285714285714286
8485446,1,B005STGM3W,"Jack (Greg Melvill-Smith) works at a game preserve chasing poachers and guiding tourists. His son Sean (Christopher Beasley) is a recently dismissed police officer. He joins his estranged father on a night time tourist safari. It is reported that refugees are being hunted by paramilitary men and that there is a ""Hyena Man"" leading the group.

Much of the action is shot at night. Most of the hacking is done by listening to screams in the dark. There are some hyena eyes that show up near the end. but for the most part, this could have been filmed anywhere as scenery was seldom shown. I got bored shortly after the opening scenes.

Parental Guide: F-bombs. Male rear nudity.",1404864000,,678,4.737288135593221
8485447,5,B005STGM3W,"This is an excellent horror/suspense movie, with strong acting, great camera work, and a very well-written plot, complete with a sudden plot twist in the last several minutes that will impel  you utterly to  the edge of your seat. An ex-SF soldier, turned game ranger, who makes Captain Ahab seem like a teddy bear, by comparison. His estranged son, an ex-cop with severe PTSD. The three married couples who go on the night drive. Such are a few of the characters on offer. the acting by all is first rate; the viewer comes to really care for all of them. Which makes the application of the splatter movie rule, ""anyone can die, at any time"", keep you completely involved, shouting advice at the screen to try and save a character, often to no avail.

Now, the negative. This is not a movie for the squeamish. Though the extreme violence is not gratuitous, it is realistic and core to the plot. In the real world, these kind of events happen in South Africa, or to a much lesser degree, in Detroit or the like, all the time. The director does not have the camera's eye linger on the wounds/mutilations, nor does he sugarcoat the violence. For example: a shot woman graphically dies in the arms of one of the horrified protagonists; her terror and agony clearly show, as does his sense of helplessness. On the gore scale (1-5; 5=Cannibal Ferox), this movie is a 3.

Oddly, this movie also works as a ""survival movie"", with the stranded tourists trying to figure out how to survive the night in the bush when they know that savage poachers and hyenas, with a taste for human flesh, are somewhere out there beyond the guttering flames of their campfire. Ultimately, it is also an inspiring story of how people can survive against terrible odds.",1350000000,3,1741,4.624595469255663
8485448,5,B005STGM3W,"I bought this movie and didn't expect it to be so good.  I was very surprised at how well produced it was and how talented the actors were.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes suspense, gore, and action.  I will watch it again and again.  I would love to express to the cast and crew how much I enjoyed it and what a great job they did!!! It was just fantastic, in my book.",1329177600,2,379,3.9473684210526314
