8186480,4,B000OSLBZQ,"I ran across this movie while looking up Native American movie titles, and ordered it immediately since it was clearly an ""independent"" movie made by Native Americans.  While ""Naturally Native"" is a delightful story, it could have been much more.  And while Floyd 'Red Crow' Westerman--a wonderful man and excellent actor--plays Connecticut's Mashantucket tribal Chairman Pico, the ""tribes"" casino interests clearly influenced the nature of the film.  Indeed, IMDb states ""...this film is the first to be totally financed by an Indian tribe, Connecticut's Mashantucket tribe.""  Apparently, Valerie Red-Horse, who plays the sister Vickie Lewis Bighawk, tried desperately to get this film made, and angry at the film industry, turned to the tribe for funding.  If this was the case, it really is too bad, because there should be no reasons why a film with such an important story line should not be funded by more traditional sources.

""Naturally Native,"" the name of the cosmetic line the three sisters--Vickie Lewis Bighawk, Tanya Lewis (played by Irene Bedard), and Karen Lewis (played by Kimberly Norris Guerrero)--give to their cosmetic products that they are making and attempting to market.  While the ""credits"" and the movie hint at the fact that each sister is dealing with ""her own identity issues"" and career paths, this is NOT flushed out in the film or story line.  Furthermore, even though the film suggests that the three sisters were adopted by a non-Indian women and raised essentially without knowledge of their tribal customs, ""Naturally Native"" does not delve into this ""issue"" as much as it should have to help the story line.

The story line is essentially this: the older sister, Karen, ""remembers"" some of the herbs that were used when she was still with their family and Vickie and Tanya ""see"" a way to start their own business--""the American Dream"" their adoptive mother apparently instilled into the two younger sisters.  Again, greater depth here would have helped immensely.  Instead, the film spends much of its time addressing the hardships encountered by Native Americans trying to start a business; hardships from both the ""white"" and ""Indian"" communities.  The sisters are confronted by other tribal members--protective of their lucrative casino income--but ultimately turn to the tribe for help.  Help both in reassuring themselves that they are indeed tribal members and with financial assistance and an agreement to sell their ""Naturally Native"" products in the casino.  While the sisters are waiting to see the tribal chairman, there is a very brief look at ""artifacts"" of their culture and traditional ways.  But it is way too brief, and the viewer does not truly sense the emotional impact that such a ""return"" usually has on someone.  I guess they were in a hurry to demonstrate that the sisters could achieve ""success!""

There are other scenes of American Indians living the ""American"" or city way of life--some quite fun--but, again without the depth I would have liked to seen.  If ""Naturally Native"" had spent more time examining the effects of being adopted and raised outside their Native culture and the way that ""modern"" Indians interact within the context of the larger non-Native society, and shown the sisters making it without relying on casino money (albeit, said money can be interpreted as part of the tribal communities help), then, I feel, ""Naturally Native"" would have been a five star movie: meaningful depth before commercialism!

8186481,5,B000OSLBZQ,Yip I didn't know what to expect at first but this movie was great. The Native women were beautiful.,1214784000,4,100,4.315789473684211
8186482,5,B000OSLBZQ,"Still fighting the white mans wars, these determined sisters work through all kinds of trials and turmoil to put together a business. Irene Benard is fantastic as usual, playing the youngest sister in this movie. Knowing full well that they are American Indian, but being adopted by a white woman as youths, they stuggle in the white man's world. They also have huge obstacles to go through to try to get funding for this business. This is a fantasic movie and I highly reccommend it. The movie shows what still goes on today for the American Indian.",1204588800,11,550,4.680412371134021
