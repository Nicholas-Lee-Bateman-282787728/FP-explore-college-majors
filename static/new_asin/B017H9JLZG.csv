7505127,1,B017H9JLZG,"Horrible.  We rented this will be for my six-year-old son who loves the Army.  No Army action. The story line is about a man who is an Army vet and his Army dog returning from war and bonding with his teenage daughter.  Very slow plot, did not keep my kids' interest.",1453075200,,267,4.196078431372549
7505128,5,B017H9JLZG,Good clean family movie that teaches working together.  Highly recommended.,1452902400,3,75,6.5
7505129,4,B017H9JLZG,"An enjoyable film that the whole family can watch.  I think younger viewers especially will enjoy this, but I'm an adult and it kept my attention, too. And who can resist that dog?",1452729600,4,180,4.454545454545454
7505130,5,B017H9JLZG,Terrific family film.  Casper Van Dien and his daughter Grace clearly have a special bond.  It shines through in the film.  The star though is certainly the dog!  Beautiful with those big eyes.  Thoroughly enjoyed the film.,1448064000,5,223,4.918918918918919

7505132,1,B017H9JLZG,"Tried to watch this with my 4 year old and turned it off in the first 5 minutes. Come on, this is not PG or family friendly. Realistic war scenes from Afghanistan, life-like weaponry, and adult scenarios in the first 5 minutes as the soldier has a dream his dog is detonated by an IED? Pass. It wasn't worth the tantrum my toddler threw over turning it off as his dad is active duty military and he was fascinated by the uniforms, just like daddy wears. NOT child friendly nor adult entertainment. BIG PASS.",1482192000,,507,4.404255319148936

7505138,5,B017H9JLZG,"That scene where Army Dog has to kill his master to save the rest of the team was just too real...

If that doesn't get you then the one where Army Dog has to comfort his fellow dog friend while he bleeds out will definitely jerk a few tears.",1474588800,3,242,3.938775510204082
7505139,1,B017H9JLZG,"The dog was cute, but way inappropriate ""bedroom talk"" between husband and wife, plus too much skin in the bedroom scene.  Why include that?  What does it add?  Clearly, this film is marketed to children.  I am so tired of so-called Christian movies joining the agenda of the world to defile.  Vague references to God, but missed the mark.  The family agrees... thumbs down!",1468972800,,374,4.765625

7505147,5,B017H9JLZG,Excellent family movie to watch with the kids. Good story that many veterans could relate to. Connor the dog was amazing as well. Great flick!,1455321600,2,142,4.72
7505148,1,B017H9JLZG,"low budget movie, what do you expect?",1454371200,,37,4.428571428571429
7505149,1,B017H9JLZG,Very slow plot. It is PG for a reason-The dad has flashbacks of his time serving in the army which could be frightful.  This is comparable to a bad hallmark movie. The cover looks like it would be a cute movie about a dog but it's more about a dad and daughter repairing a relationship since his time away from her in service. The plot to repair the relationship doesn't even make much sense.,1453852800,2,392,4.297297297297297

8739212,3,B017H9JLZG,"I think this movie would have been much better if it were less corny. First, they are being stalked by a big bad wolf. Real wolves do not act like this. It would have been more realistic if they were being stalked by a mountain lion, especially the teen girl since mountain lions have been known to attack small women and children. Wolves do not do this in real life, only in Hollywood. And the dad sure doesn't act much like a well trained soldier. Even my 8 and 10 year old boys couldn't believe some of the things they were doing and were asking obvious questions like why did they do that?! Why didn't they do this instead?!",1515974400,,628,4.285714285714286

8739218,1,B017H9JLZG,"Terrible movie. Why was the daughter such a b*tch? her personality would change every 5 minutes like they couldn't decide what kind of character they wanted her to be. One moment she's acting all sweet and caring then randomly she's insulting and treating the dog like it's nothing. Bad acting, slow plot, horriblyou written characters.",1485302400,,336,5.127272727272727
