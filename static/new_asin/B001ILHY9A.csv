8311123,5,B001ILHY9A,"One never tires of the Jules Romains play, as fresh today as when it was written nearly a century ago. A light-hearted and always humorous perspective on the effect on both society and the individual of a compulsive personality, it raises very serious questions even while it entertains: what good--or harm--can be attributed to human obsessiveness? What would we be as a species were we all to accept our lot with neither questions nor complaints? How, and at what cost, do social delusions arise? Knock is as hard driving and obsessed as any detective in a crime novel, but he is also intensely human; we recognize that he is one of us. Romains artlessly takes care to remind us to hold off judging whether Knock's patients should be thought beneficiaries of his method, but we are assured that if they are, perhaps, more victims than beneficiaries, then Knock is himself one with them. A great moment in the last act is Knock's admission that he is afraid to look at himself in the mirror, lest he find....

Louis Jouvet's performance as Dr. Knock is a fine legacy from a justly renowned actor. It should be noted that the director of the 1951 film chose to do little to adapt the play to the screen. If its fidelity to Romains's original cannot be faulted, its lack of cinematographic originality may perhaps be. This edition is valuable in making this classic available to a North American NTSC Region 1 audience; anglophones will need to search the internet for free subtitles that can be downloaded and overlaid on the screen with the help of a good media player, such as VLN.",1370390400,,1583,4.694244604316546
8311124,5,B001ILHY9A,"This is the best play describing social aspects of medicine. Very apt for our time! Louis Jouvet is one of the great actors of La Comdie Franaise!
A classic piece of French comedy. Can't say enough about this play! Get the book as well. Study it. Entertaining and social analysis so good.",1365724800,,288,4.5576923076923075
8311125,2,B001ILHY9A,"I hate to give it one star because this movie is great. I have watched it over one hundred times. But this picture is terrible. It looks like a VHS picture on LP setting, barely watchable. This is not DVD quality. However, if you have never seen this movie, I suppose it is better than not watching it at all.",1309996800,,309,4.166666666666667
