645535,5,630344427X,"this is a beautiful film.  i saw this film in the summer of 1975 in a small theatre in the steamy,banana port of La Ceiba, Honduras. i've been looking for it for years, and been unable to find any reference to it.  for  years it almost seemed as if i had imagined the entire film, sitting in a  hot, humid, crowded little theatre in that pulsing latin port so many years  ago. i  finally found reference to it on the internet.  the version i saw  was in spanish and was titled ""the ultimo train"" (the last  train"").  it is a french film set in the south of france at the advent  of world war II.  it is a beautiful and profound love story that deals with  destiny and choices made along the road of love.  a gorgeous, mature romy  schneider is a jewish woman travelling aboard a train of french citizens  fleeing to the south of france to avoid the nazi invasion.  jean-luis  trintagnant is a henpecked, bookish everyman travelling with his wife and  children.  they have a passionate, brief interlude on the train and fall in  love.  their escalating passion for each other is abruptly ended when they  are separated in a mad, crowd of refugees during a bomb attack.  they  meet again several years later near the  end of the war at the height of  the nazi's desperate retreat from france.  their meeting again is one of  pure serendipity and under the most trying of circumstances.  will the meek  jean-luis choose the woman he loves or settle for a life of cautious  regret?  it portrays the classic decision we must all make in our lives-to  live or to die.  i would never be so cruel as to tell you how it all  turns out, but it's surprising, beautiful, and deeply evocative.  please  see this film.",934416000,22,1704,4.429967426710098
7847017,2,630344427X,"Buyer beware... The first disappointment is the quality of the transfer: blurry, jittery, with bad colors where the whitest is either yellow, green or pink,  and color aberration to boot.  It looks like a transfer from VHS --there are better quality DVDs with movies from 1950.  The second disappointment is that contrary to the description, the film is NOT in French --it is dubbed in English, without the possibility of subtitles.
There is another version, in French, on the Amazon.fr website, but it is in PAL and encoded for Region 2. The French version includes an interview with director Pierre Granier-Deferre and is probably better quality.  Will review when I get it.",1459209600,,676,5.008928571428571
7847018,2,630344427X,Even after reading  that it was about I had a different point of view. However the story was crap that I certainly didn't enjoy at all. So this movie will end up being donate to one of our area's thrift stores. Don't waste your money. I wish I hadn't.,1426636800,,251,4.122448979591836
7847019,2,630344427X,"Sadly I was disappointed with the quality of the color in the movie as it was very yellowy and poor quality in clarity and focus, with the color being very unstable for the whole movie. I had the original on VHS a few years ago and I certainly didn't experience this problem.  As it was one of my favorite movies it was unfortunately not up to expectations. However, your promptness in sending it was much appreciated. I guess it is just one of those cases of a bad quality DVD production which would not be your fault.",1389571200,,519,4.350515463917525
7847020,5,630344427X,This beautifully acted film is touching and challenges beliefs held dear by humanity.  It is poignant and deeply touching.  I even tolerated that it was dubbed.  I hope it is reissued with subtitles.,1358035200,,199,4.96969696969697
7847021,3,630344427X,"This movie is fine if you are a Romy Schneider fan. As always, she looks wonderful in almost every shot. However, the story is not well fleshed out and the characters lack depth, at least to me. The color is not very good, but this is the case in just a few scenes.",1341964800,,265,4.018867924528302
7847022,1,630344427X,I was very disappointed to find out this video was dubbed in English.  It wasn't at all what I expected.  I am returning it and hope the seller will give me credit although it was opened.  I didn't even watch more than 2 minutes of the movie.  I'd seen The Last Train before but it wasn't in English.  I expected it to be in the original French language.,1258761600,2,354,4.147058823529412
7847023,2,630344427X,"Romy Schneider was not only a stunningly beautiful and charismatic woman, but also one of the deepest, most sensitive and touching actresses the world has ever known. She is great as ever in this movie, esp. the latter half. Unfortunately the DVD is very bad quality,taken from an old dusty print with badly dubbed English. But thank god for the dvd remote, way too much time is spent on long shots of the train,etc and old newsreel footage instead of on Romy and Jean Louis Trinignant. I guess they didn't have enough of a plot to sustain a whole film. Too bad the movie and the dvd aren't good,but Romy is Romy, truly a one of a kind star. This dvd is  strictly for Romy fans.",1121212800,3,678,4.380952380952381
7847024,5,630344427X,"This poignant story is told between the WW2 hell . Two strangers who meet casually in a train in the middle of the hopeless , the uncertainess and the agony of an unending war .
I really expect the producers and headquarter who made it possible this transfer , watch carefully the enormous meaning and talent of this french director , who made several important films such as The Chat (Medal silver for best actor to Jaen Gabin 1973) , A etrange affair (Medal silver for best actor to Michel Piccoli 1981) , The veuve Clouderc (Simone Signoret and Alain Delon).
He really deserves this honor .
 It's a question of fairness for a worthable career .
Superb performances of Rommy Schneider and Jean Louis Trigtinant .",1093478400,3,714,4.622047244094488
7847025,1,630344427X,"I bought this DVD, after seeing Corbucci's ""The Great Silence"" starring Trintignon, and having head of Romy Scheider, wanted to get it as well...
The one star I gave this movie is not pertaining to the movie itself, but the poor video quality. It was as if I was watching someone's home video, old and yellowed, grainy and the sound was terrible.
In retrospect I see how it's merely 4.99, but sadly I bought it anyway, hoping for a refreshing new (rediscovered) european movie....
bottom line, probably a good movie but I couldn't get through it with such poor dvd transfer.... beware, or wait until it comes out restored later.",1061251200,11,628,4.718181818181818
7847026,3,630344427X,"A while back, I was searching for a Romy Schneider film as a birthday present for my mother, and I decided to purchase this film, The Last Train.  I had read good reviews about this forgotten film, and felt that it was a  worthwhile purchase.  Indeed, the film is quite powerful and rather moving.  It is set in WW2 and concerns the plight of a group of people as they  attempt to flee from the advancing German troops. They board the last train  leaving the town (hence the title).  The film is not a suspense thriller,  however, and concerns itself more with the relationships that develop  between the various individuals on the train.  Romy Schneider plays one  such emigrant, a German girl with a secret.  While the film contains brief  periods of humour, it is for the most part a serious film with a somewhat  melancholy conclusion.  One sees in this film some of the themes that would  later show up in more recent films such as Schindler's List, which equals  the dramatic effect of The Last Train.
I would rate this film a strong  5 stars, however, there are some problems with the VHS version.  First,  although this is a French film, the tape is dubbed.  Some people prefer  dubbing to subtitles, but I prefer to hear foreign films as originally  recorded.  Besides, we always tend to lose some nuances of the vocal  performances after dubbing.  The second problem with the tape is that it  has a rather poor video transfer, looking like it was recorded from film  stock that had deteriorated from too many viewings. Same thing goes for the  sound quality.  It's pretty bad. It essentially looks like a budget VHS  tape.  Perhaps a better version exists somewhere in France, but not in the  States.  Bottom line - the VHS version looks like an excellent film that  was recorded off a television set with so-so reception.  If you're willing  to overlook this problems, you will be rewarded with a strong cinematic  experience.  The choice is yours, but as I've said, the film is quite good.",963360000,21,2001,4.640804597701149
