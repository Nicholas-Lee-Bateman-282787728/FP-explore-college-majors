1408754,5,B000059MQ4,"Although this doesn't star the Affleck I have grown to like so much, the Kevin Smith Affleck(which I do prefer), and a usually annoying Paltrow, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  I guess you could say it's a Romance movie, the one thing I generally try to avoid, I loved this.  Affleck certainly is a great actor, this is one great acting job, just below ""Chasing Amy"" and ""the part he was born to play"" in ""Boiler Room"".
One thing I liked so much in this movie is the storyline.  It's not a bull-$h! t story like most romance movies, it's actually got a good story that might actually happen as opposed to the crappy romance stories about horses and bridges in madison county.  The start of the movie is very good.  It starts off with Buddy(Affleck) and he's in an airport where he meets a ""Foxy"" blonde who fits perfectly into the one-night stand category.  Along the way he meets a struggling play-write who joins them at a bar when their plane gets cancelled.  After a few drinks, the three get talking, and Buddy takes out his video camera(the Sony DCR-PC100, which I have) and gets him and Greg, the play writer.  When Greg tells Buddy his story about his family back home, and missing the holidays, Buddy gives him his ticket to another plane so he can be with his family.  Buddy not only sees this as an act of kindness, but rather an easy way for that one night stand.  So, off Greg goes, and Buddy takes his ""lady"" to the airport hotel... In the middle of the night, Buddy wakes up to loud sirens, and turns on the T.V. ...And the plane HE was supposed to be on crashed, and took all the passengers with it.  Buddy goes into a slump, and becomes an alcholic after this mess, and when he eventually gets out of rehab, he goes to check up on Greg's wife... Abby.  They get to talking, and he decides she should handle his company's office-hunting.  The two find they have a lot in common, and Buddy not only falls in love with her, but her kids as well.  Then one day, Abby gets a video(think Blonde, and video-camera).  Guess what's on the tape?  You got it.  Buddy and Greg.  The news crushes Abby, but she doesn't know what to think... have Greg and Buddy never have met, and have Buddy(a stranger to Abby) die, and never being able to meet and fall in love with Abby, or have it turn out the way it did...
Although just by watching, you can tell that a significant amount of footage was cut-out, it's still a well-rounded movie with good acting to boot.  If your looking for a good date movie, or feeling miserable about your own love life, this is definitely one to check out.  I really liked this.",982022400,2,2611,4.366459627329193
1408755,2,B000059MQ4,"This really isn't a bad movie at all.  It's actually very touching at a lot of points.  The plot comes full circle and leaves you with that warm fuzzy ""love conquers all"" message.
Affleck and Paltrow work very well together.  Their off-screen romance seems to penetrate into the acting.
Not bad.  Good one to see with the girlfriend/wife.",975283200,,338,4.775862068965517
1408756,4,B000059MQ4,"A tragic brush with fate sets a man on a road to self awareness and discovery that drastically alters his perception of himself and the world in which he lives, in ""Bounce,"" directed by Don Roos and starring Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow.  In  Chicago on business, waiting at the airport for a flight back to L.A. just before Christmas, Advertising Exec/salesman Buddy Amaral (Affleck) gives his ticket to a man he's met that evening in the lounge, Greg Janello (Tony Goldwyn), who's just been bumped from his flight.  A writer, in Chicago for the opening (and sadly, the closing) of one of his plays, Janello has a wife, Abby (Gwyneth Paltrow), and two kids waiting for him at home, and is grateful for Buddy's apparent random act of kindness.  Far from being a benevolent gesture, however, Buddy's motives are purely self-serving, and have to do with another passenger, Mimi (Natasha Henstridge), who's also been bumped and who has been given accommodations for the night by the airline.  It seems that everything has worked out well for all concerned, until later that night, when the news breaks that the plane carrying Janello has crashed somewhere in Kansas, and that there are no survivors.  For Buddy, who should have been on that plane, it's an awakening; and for probably the first time in his life he is forced to look inward.  And he doesn't like what he finds.  His confrontation with the demons within ultimately leads him to Abby Janello, and another unexpected turn in his life.  Director Roos has created a richly textured drama that is both captivating and credible; the story is well written (by Roos), developed with precision and expertly paced, which makes it all entirely believable.  Much more than a simple love story, it's about a man forced to confront what he sees in the mirror, and how he must cope with what he finds there; and about a young woman with two children, suddenly widowed, who must come to grips with an unsure future while dealing with such a devastating loss.  What follows is an examination of a relationship forged by fate and born of need; a fragile, precarious situation at best.  And what makes this film so good is the gradual way the relationship between Buddy and Abby is formed, neither hurried nor forced, with a couple of truly poignant moments along the way.  And it all rings true, courtesy of a great script, Roos directing and the engaging performances of the stars.  Affleck brings real depth to his character, and most importantly, a sense of true sincerity that makes him real; he illuminates Buddy's imperfections to perfection.  And Paltrow is absolutely disarming as Abby; gentle and vulnerable to a fault, winsomely charming, and beautifully played.  Also, there is a definite chemistry between Paltrow and Affleck that cannot be denied.  The supporting cast includes Jennifer Grey (Mrs. Guererro), Joe Morton (Jim), David Paymer (Prosecution Lawyer), Alex D. Linz (Scott) and Johnny Galecki.  A touching, memorable movie, ""Bounce"" is a reflection on the journey of life we all must take; and it makes you realize that it's something you have to work at.  It's a film that makes you stop to reconsider choices made in the past, while recognizing that in the end, perhaps love and happiness is the bonus for doing it right.",974851200,18,3291,4.865591397849462
1408757,4,B000059MQ4,"First a concession, I only went to see this movie to score brownie poits with my fiance. However, I was pleasantly surprised with the film and the perfromances within.
Ben Affleck is a successful ad agency salesman and partner. A storm during the Christmas season has many of the commuters at the Chicago airport stranded. Affleck has a ticket on the last flight to leave for L.A. before the weather gets worse, he gives it up to a fellow traveler.  The plane goes down and Affleck has to deal with the guilt, eventually leading him to alcohol.  A year later he looks up the widow of the man to whom he gave the ticket. He helps her out with her business dealings and then plans to fade away, but a relationship ensues and the rest is an emotional roller coaster with the underlying secret.
First, Affleck is exceptional in this role. I have never been a great fan of his acting abilities but he is strong and moving as Buddy. He convincingly shows his character's weaknesses and guilt. Paltrow is as always solid as a berieved widow cautiously wading into a new relationship.  And although the actor's name escapes me, the character of Affleck's assistant adds necessary humor and sarcasm. (He was the boyfriend of the youngest Connor girl on the T.V. show Roseanne).
Despite the fact that the previews for this film gave you the entire plot, the movie still holds interest throughout. You sit in nervous anticipation wondering ""when will she find out and how?"". Good acting, good script, good actors make this a good movie and not just a chick flick.",974592000,3,1552,4.656934306569343

I'm glad we stuck it out, because about halfway through, when Buddy (Affleck) shows up on Abby's doorstep (Paltrow), it kicks into high gear and from that point forward, it's totally awesome.

Paltrow does an AMAZING job portraying Abby, and you cannot help but fall madly and totally in love with her.

It goes without saying that Gwyneth Paltrow did a perfect job acting the part of a bereaved and confused widow.  Her acting ability always astounds me.
It is a story of a man who exchanges tickets with another man who wants to get home quickly to his family, while he sees an opportunity to have a one-night stand with a pretty girl.  He learns the next morning what could have been his outcome had he taken the ticket and boarded the plane.
He keeps tabs on the dead man's widow, and finds a way to offer this bereaved mother of two a real chance to make some money for her children.  In other words, he has a conscience and a good heart.",1414454400,,779,4.26530612244898

Four and a half FASCINATING Stars! Oscar-winners Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Affleck, an off-again, on-again real-life Hollywood couple at the time, are magical as Abby and Buddy. Through self-directed circumstance, Buddy avoids death and, coming out of a period of guilt and booze, is drawn into checking up on the widow and kids of the man who literally took his seat on an airplane and died. The movie has a very attractive 'made for TV'-type ambience that rushes towards a hopeful conclusion and it is nice watching some inevitable things unfold, but are they inevitable? Aside from the irresistible Paltrow and the likable Affleck, the movie cast includes Edward Edwards, Jennifer Grey (Dirty Dancing), Tony Goldwyn (Scandal), Natasha Henstridge (Species), Mary Ellen Lyon, and Joe Morton (Scandal). Directed by Don Roos. Highly Recommended. Four a half ENCHANTING Stars! (Amazon Instant Video. Time: 1:47. Note: Gwyneth Paltrow talked Ben Affleck into doing this movie after they had broken up in real life, the movie drew them back into the relationship for a while. ""Bounce"" was made for an astounding budget of $35 Million and it made a nice profit of $53 Million total worldwide as a date movie.)",1410307200,,1305,5.069767441860465

1408829,3,B000059MQ4,"I've had this movie in my collection for years and just got it out now to watch it in its entirety. The first time it was too slow-moving for me and I gave up on it. I love Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow so I figured that I'd better give it another try. I'm really glad that I did because their kisses and lovemaking were so real--isn't this when they started going together? Or were they already going together? I would have preferred a romantic comedy, but the connection between these two delightful stars made up for the ill-fated plane crash. I agree with something Roger Ebert said--that the timing was off--that we had to wait too long for Affleck's character to reveal his secret. He felt that these two made him want to see them become lovers, as did I. So although the movie doesn't have perfect execution, it certainly has a tantalizing love match.

I've been thinking this over and I think it's unfair to give this four stars just because the kissing and lovemaking was enjoyable to watch--there wasn't enough of it to make up for all the angst. I certainly don't mind a good drama when it's well done, but this seems a bit contrived. They would have been so much better in a romantic comedy (straight comedy). So I've changed my rating to three stars. I was desperate for something to watch when I pulled it off my shelf, but it could have stayed there and I wouldn't have been that much worse off.",1406851200,,1412,4.4517374517374515

But both Paltrow and Ben Affleck draw you into the story whose title has nothing whatsoever to do with basketball, rubber products or even the game of jacks.  The plot takes a tragic event, an airplane crash, early in the story and makes it the starting point from which these two fine actors evolve.  Paltrow is so totally genuinely likeable and guilessly sincere one can easily see how Affleck ultimately falls in love with the widow she portrays, even with the baggage of her two fatherless little boys.  The truth that Affleck's character is peripherally responsible for her husband's death and how that revelation may destroy their new relationship is the tension that keeps the audience enthralled.",1353456000,3,894,4.900662251655629

1408853,4,B000059MQ4,"I know that I kind of shouldn't, but I kind of like this movie.  Granted, I haven't seen it in some time, but my memories of it are fond.  I can admit that not a lot about this movie makes sense outside of movie-world-make-believe, but the packaging is well wrapped and what is inside has enough going for it to make it forgivable even if it isn't believable.

That's called good acting.

The film follows a selfish and arrogant (albeit successful) ad exec that trades places with a beat down family man venturing home.  I don't mean they `trade places', I mean that they literally `trade places'.  Wanting to stay behind and get some tail, Buddy (our self centered executive) lets Greg (our family man) have his seat on the next flight back home.  When that said plane crashes and Greg dies, Buddy goes a little crazy.  What happens next is a tad odd yet strangely understandable.  Buddy, after going in and then getting out of rehab, decides to place himself inside Greg's widow's life.  He feels so guilty for Greg's death that he wants to shred away his selfishness and do something right, although his actions could be considered selfish as well (a theme I really wish had a little more depth here).

Here's why I understand despite the fact that it essentially doesn't make sense.  Having met Greg, heard his story and had that personal connection to him, I can see why Buddy feels responsible.  He had a face to go with the name.  His actions (giving Greg the ticket) were selfish (if he didn't want the tail he would have never given Greg the ticket) and so he wanted to find some peace.  That said, if he had gotten on the plane he would have died at the hands of his own selfishness anyways, so it's a tad lose-lose here.

At the heart of this preposterous yet surprisingly touching film is a gloriously tapered performance by the beautiful Gwyneth Paltrow.  With a complete understanding of her character (inside and out), Paltrow delivers the type of performance that elevates an entire film.  While the character itself is rather clichd (grieving widow) there is a lot that can be done with this character in order to make it breathe, and Gwyneth does that.  Sadly, the ending of the film kind of disregards Abby's credibility, but that's how things go with films of this nature.  Ben Affleck is also rather well suited for this film.  He plays arrogance well, and shockingly he also plays conflicted and tormented well.  We all know he is a charming leading man so he kind of nails every layer of Buddy (even if the layers don't all make sense).

In the end, it is the films sentimental charm that makes it a must see.  Like I've mentioned, there are a lot of things here that shouldn't work, but for some reason they all do.  I'd watch this film again and again and enjoy it every time.",1274140800,4,2801,4.542914171656687
1408854,3,B000059MQ4,"Probably the biggest problem with Bounce is that the first 40 minutes of film are very very boring.

The part where Ben's character meets the people at the airport, and the entire storyline that focused on his business and the meetings... this was downright horrible.  Usually such scenes serve as nice, innocent filler which leads to the main point of the story- but in this movies case, this was filler that felt even more pointless than usual.

In fact, the pacing of this movie is quite bad too.  Not only does nothing really interesting happen leading up to the airplane accident, but you're constantly wondering if the writers even knew which way they wanted to approach the introduction and build-up to the main plot.

For the first 40 minutes, every mildly interesting scene would lead straight into an unnecessary one.  VERY awkwardly paced movie this one is for the first half.

The second half -when Ben's character eventually makes contact with the widow- is when the storyline picks up a LOT more.  The nerve of Ben's character though, to actually get into a relationship with the woman after she lost her husband in an airplane accident.  Oh you don't think that's bad?  Get THIS-

Ben's character switched planes with the same guy at the airport that was married to the widow, so Ben's character was supposed to be on the airplane that went down.  Ben's character went to contact the widow to do the right thing and explain what happened because switching plane tickets with the guy that died was something that was seriously bothering him... but instead he falls in love with the guys wife!  Insane.

Interesting how the introduction of the widows children didn't even enter the picture until much later.  I thought this was a good idea and a nice break from the typical ""child hates mom or dads girlfriend/boyfriend"" storyline that's so popular in many other dramas that eventually becomes a focal point later on.  None of that here.

It WAS quite offensive to me that Ben's character would mock the people who died in airplane accidents.  Maybe he wasn't necessarily mocking the people- just the presentation and the memories people would share with those they recently lost, Ben's character would find a way to make fun of it in one scene early on.  Surely had this movie been released after 9/11, a scene like this wouldn't have made it into the final version.

1408855,4,B000059MQ4,"I've read a few reviews of this film that said it was creepy and really not all that good.  I disagree completely.  I loved it.  I thought it was a very good character study of 2 people in recovery from trauma, each from a different type.  The performances were very good, the movie was not too long, it made its point and got on with it, and it was believable to me.  There was one situation that seemed a bit off, but all in all I highly recommend this movie.

UPDATE:  December 11, 2014.  I watched this movie again recently.  While I still enjoyed it, especially Affleck's character and development, I was much less impressed by Paltrow's performance.  She is both a bit wooden and too hystrionic.  She's not bad, she's just not real good.",1218499200,,743,4.42962962962963
1408856,1,B000059MQ4,"I had to give it at least one star in order to do a review.

Ben Affleck's character is a horrible person.  He only gives up his plane ticket in order to get laid, he stalks and lies to Gwyneth Paltrow's character.  He sleeps with her before even telling her that he knew her husband, yet alone mentioning that he gave her husband the ticket on the crashed plane.  Then-I think the worst part-he lies to her son saying that the deceased father did not express any desire to be with his son.  He denys that the father said he wanted to fly home to spend time with his son selling Christmas trees.  The son is obviously hurt and this lie in no way benefits anyone.  Affleck's character does it out of pure malice.
SPOILER:::  In the end poor Gwyneth ends up with this psycho and we can assume that the poor boys have to deal with this manipulative stalker, pathological lier and selfish #@$^#&%#.  Do not see this movie.  It is horrible!!!",1213401600,8,937,4.364161849710983
1408857,2,B000059MQ4,"Why not just go ahead and call it ""Crash and Burn Air""?  That would fit right in with the general quality of the plot and the writing (not to mention the male lead's acting).

Plot and writing.  Look, as I've mentioned before in a different context, one coincidence is a great plot device: a young man sees a woman about to throw herself into the ocean and saves her; a cop sees a murder suspect walking down the street; an Army private who later becomes an officer finds out his first sergeant is his old drill instructor.  Great.  Pile on the coincidences though, and what you have is nothing more than lazy and unfocused writing.  Such is the case here.  SPOILER ALERT.  Affleck's Buddy Amaral not only switches places with Gwyneth Paltrow's loving husband* on a flight that crashes, but he's involved in the airline's business AND there just happens to be a video of Amaral with the loving husband that just happens to appear at a crucial moment.

This movie does not do service to the ""from airplane disaster to romance"" genre.  About the only thing to its credit is the unlikely achievement of making ""Random Hearts"" look good.

1408858,5,B000059MQ4,"This film was a surprise to me. As the blurb on the DVD case said, this was a romantic movie with great chemistry between the two co-stars, I expected to see a cute movie about two beautiful people falling in love. but I was pleasantly suprised by the depth of the movie.

The basic plotline is this:  Ben Affleck plays a vibrant, young man with a promising career named Buddy who gives up his plane ticket to a man he meets at the airport for a night with a beautiful blond.  As fate would have it, the plane has a deadly crash killing all the passengers on board including Buddy's acquaintance.  To make up for the guilt, Buddy seeks out the widow of this acquaintance, played by Gwyneth Paltrow.  Although, Buddy's intentions were merely to help the family and disappear, in the midst of his guilt, he sees past the grief and falls in love with this beautiful woman.

I believe the script, the directing, and the acting were all very successful in this film.  Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Affleck were very believable and the gradual growth in their relationship was very real.  Gwyneth's performance was quite amazing.  Peronally this is one of my favorite performances by her.  She allows Abby to be vulnerable and emotional yet her strength and virtues are consistent throughout the movie.  The credit goes to both Gwyneth and the write/director, Don Roos for this.  The director seemed to have paid much attention to the details, especially with the two characters in their behavior.

Ben Affleck - a few too many tears perhaps, but a well thought-out role with finely developed feeling. I sense Americans want more one-liners and laughs and this film didn't play that comedic line. Not a great film by any means, it is solid and a worthwhile watch. I gave it five stars for the four-star quality and the effort to do something different.",1172361600,,648,4.547008547008547

1408863,3,B000059MQ4,"Ben is one of my favorite actors...but this film was not one of his best...but it was not terrible...I have to give him that!  The plot was interesting, but very unbelievable to say the least!! I found Gwenyth's character to be just a down right bleep!! I have a problem with the fact that Buddy decides he is going to do whatever he can to find this poor widow, and tracks her down...STALKER!!  Falls in love??? Please!!  But I have to say that Ben's character (Buddy) poured his heart out to this ungreatful Abby!!

Abby lies about her husband death...claims they got divorced...just cause it sounds better...and ""everyone is divorced"".  BLAH!!  Save it baby!! But when Buddy tells her something...the story changes!!  I am not saying that this picture is a waste of time to watch...but just be aware that the script is not consistent.  Good actors...with little to work on...have to agree with other reviews (for the most part).",1115856000,2,931,4.775
1408864,2,B000059MQ4,"On a very basic level, this movie is just...wrong.  ""Bounce"" has interesting characters and ideas floating around in it, but this is one of those movies whose plot would be over with in about fifteen minutes if the characters just behaved with some common sense and reacted appropriately to the given situations. Instead we get a script by Don Roos which tries to manufacture drama where there is none.  The setup for the relationship between Ben Affleck's Buddy and Gwyneth Paltrow's Abby is somewhat involved, but intriguing: Buddy gives his plane ticket to a stranger named Greg, so Greg can get home a little earlier to his family for Christmas and Buddy can stay in Chicago with his lovely new acquaintance Mimi and her overnight room voucher. The next morning Buddy is horrified to learn that the plane crashed and Greg, who was in Buddy's intended seat, was killed.  Buddy's survivor guilt makes sense, but his subsequent alcoholism and rehab are never given the weight they should have been given in the story - when was the last time you saw a movie character's descent into alcoholism depicted by a few shots of that character holding a glass? And in a completely ludicrous plot development, the script also has the airline company employing Buddy's ad firm to design a series of spots which actually CALL ATTENTION to the crash. Reality check, please!!!

When he decides to visit Greg's widow (Abby) a year later, to make amends as part of his 12 step program, Buddy doesn't tell her who he is, and this for me doesn't wash: there is no reason for him not to tell her, and the characters could still have entered into a romance from a different (and more interesting) perspective.  But instead they're playing ""I've Got A Secret"".  Abby later overreacts melodramatically when she learns about Buddy's connection to Greg's death, because he LIED to her.  Of course she lied too - she first tells Buddy she's divorced, and when she later owns up to being a widow, the reason she gives for lying is pretty lame.  The keeping-secrets aspect of the plot is illogical - these people are looking for closure of some sort, after all - and it makes the movie seem very formulaic and contrived. There was a good story to be had with these characters, but sadly Don Roos never found it.  If he had spent more time showing us the intervening year after the crash, from both characters' POV's, and then let Buddy and Abby cut to the emotional chase when they finally do meet, the movie would have had more of an interesting and substantial arc - instead it's obviously been designed primarily to keep Affleck and Paltrow onscreen together as much as possible.

A little relief from them would have been a nice thing.  This is born out by the DVD edition's disc two, which contains deleted scenes fleshing out some of the supporting characters and clarifying some of the plot - it also includes two alternate endings, both of which are better than the one finally chosen for the theatrical release.  I'm not sure whether Roos or Miramax made the cutting room decisions, but the deleted scenes contain much better dialogue than a lot of the scenes that did make it into the final cut.  This is partially because almost all the scenes involve Affleck or Paltrow talking with supporting characters, rather than to each other - the movie really suffers by the exclusion of these scenes, and it was almost a mistake for Miramax to include them on the disk, since they left this viewer thinking ""there was a much better movie here and they blew it!""  The supporting characters are played by great actors who are edited down or essentially wasted. Joe Morton, Jennifer Grey (whose character really deserved more screen time), Natasha Henstridge, Caroline Aaron, and David Paymer all do well with the bones they're thrown.  Tony Goldwyn does make a very likeable impression as Greg, and Johnny Galecki is a real standout as Buddy's assistant Seth, who is also a member of AA: the deleted scenes involving this character reinforce how exceptionally good Galecki is in the role, but they also confirm that Roos had no idea how to use him in the film.  The subject of AA is brought up several times: It would have been cool to see Buddy confronting some of his demons at a meeting, but although this carrot is waved at the audience, we never do get it -- the whole AA angle is just another plot device, as is the airline lawsuit trial, which could really have provided a jolt of dramatic interest if it had been handled better.

As for the stars' performances: well I've never been a Ben Affleck fan, but he actually gives this a valiant effort and has some good moments - if he's not totally convincing in his more emotional scenes, it's at least partially due to the weak writing.  Paltrow is excellent, fighting the easy cliche of her role and bringing lots of original shadings to it.  She's also much better than Affleck at transcending the clunky dialogue - both of their characters are given stuff to say that I can't imagine anyone in this situation in real life actually saying.

Roos does contribute some nice directorial touches: the plane crash, for instance, is handled in a refreshingly minimalist way, as is the bedroom scene between the leads - it really plays as a love scene for the characters, rather than as a voyeuristic opportunity for the audience.  On the technical side, the movie is beautifully shot, as was Roos' previous ""The Opposite Of Sex"" - I'm not sure if it's the same cinematographer, but whatever else you say about the movie, ""Bounce"" looks great. The melancholy sound track is unoriginal and bland, with the occasional dreary alternative-folk-rock song thrown in for good measure.  Dreary is a good word to describe this flick - it's very earnest, and very dreary.  It's hard to categorize it in one or two words (which is not necessarily a bad thing) - ""Bounce"" is certainly not a romantic comedy, but calling it a drama only belies how basically UN-dramatic it is.  I know a lot of people really like this movie, but if you haven't seen it, rent it first to make sure you're one of them, before you buy it.",1097884800,9,6132,4.688081936685289
1408865,3,B000059MQ4,"That's my opinion anyway. It's never gonna work. Didn't work for these two, J-Lo & Benny, Tom & Nicole, I could go on, but I won't. (There probably are many more) This movie probably wouldn't have caught my eye before, except I got it for dead cheap - ?1.20. Plus, it's got two discs to watch - albeit, not terrific extras, but still, cheap is cheap!

 As well as Ben & Gwyn, this has a great supporting cast, well, apart from Alex D. Linz, who is as big a brat in this as he is in Home Alone 22. The rest of the supporting cast are great: a strange looking Jennifer Grey, Joe Morton, the 'bad' guy from Ghost, and probably many other faces that I don't recognise, but you will. I felt Jennifer Grey's role kinda got pushed to one side, even though it was an important storyline.

 When the film started, it came across as very much a Final Destination storyline. With the plane and everything. To be honest, the film kinda dragged in the scenes between the plane crashing, and Ben meeting Gwyn. (By the way, who calls their child BUDDY?!)

 As with all rom-coms, this was very predictable - it just took a while for Benny to get round to telling Gwynnie that he knew her now deceased hubby. You keep rooting for him to tell her, knowing exactly what her reaction was gonna be.

 I didn't think Ben & Gwyn were exactly miscast in this movie - but it didn't last between them. And how BAD was her wig/hair extentions at times? I thought my hair was bad for looking like a birds nest half the time - I've now seen the light.

 The DVD has your usual batch of extras here: commentary, making-of, deleted Footage with commentary, gag reel (normally, the only worthwhile one for me to watch), ""Need to Be Next to You"" music video, featurette: Ben and Gwyneth Go Behind the Scenes, and additional scene-specific commentary with director Don Roos and actors Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow.

If you've read enough reviews, you know by now Ben visits and ends up courting a widow whose husband's death he is indirectly responsible for. After about an hour of this yawnfest you'll wish you had a night out with the boys instead of cuddling on the couch.

1408870,2,B000059MQ4,"There's not much to recommend this movie.  There's no real chemistry between Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow, which is a shame because they're both talented actors, and they've both proven they can do romance.  They just don't do it here.  In fact, there's so little connection it's obvious they're just reading scripted lines.  In the end, it's neither their fault, nor the writers: the lines are all right, and they're read well, but there's just no chemistry.
There are only two major failures with this movie, but they're doozies: the characters and the plot concept.  The characters fail to grow on viewers despite all the standard awkward situations they're put into to create sympathy.  Affleck's guilt over Paltrow's husband seems contrived, rather than genuine or understandable.  He is a sterotypical villain, ready, even eager, to prey on others.  Even his career is sterotypical: he an ad exec; of course he's a horrible human being.  His character fails: a flat-character bad guy that almost, but not quite, becomes a likeable guy.  His guilt and self-loathing seem contrived.  Paltrow's character fails as well: you sometimes feel sorry for her, but never really sympathize.
The other major failure is the plot twist.  The only redeeming factor is the that-could-have-been-me factor, which is given away in the trailers and not developed in the movie.  If they had spent more time developing his character around that, and not forcing him to persue Paltrow's character, this movie might have been saved.  Instead, they use it as a cheap plot device, and throw it away.
There's not even anything to qualify it as a decent chick-flick- there's nothing to sigh about at the end, you never say ""just say yes, you twit!  Can't you see he loves you?"".

i have watched her in Bounce for the first time ever,and boy was i surprised!
This is here best performance ever!
She plays Abby,a widow and a single mother of two kids,who lost her husband  1 year ago in a plane crash.
she meets Buddy(Played by Ben Affleck) a self centered successful young executive who exchanged plain tickets with her husband before the crash,he feels responsible for what happened so he decides to look for her after he spent 1 year in A.A. rehab clinic. But he didn't expect to fallin love with her.
This is a beautiful love story based on a tragedy.
This movie shows us how tough and unfair life can be sometimes,
but we must be brave enough top go on,also,in this movie Abby helps Buddy to go deep,and discover the whole new side of him
that he didn't even know he has.it shows us how to make the most out of the difficult situation.
The movie also tells us that it's not all in being a successful hot shot,you if you don't have someone by your side who loves you.
The only thing i regret is that i didn't get to see the movie when it was playing in theaters,and maybe if there was a little more time to develop a relationship between Buddy and Abby's sons.

1408877,1,B000059MQ4,"Bounce is a movie that should have never been made.  Director Dan Roos never had a chance to salvage this project.  The screen writing is far below par, and the story line borders on the absurd.  Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow probably agreed to do this film because of its challenging roles.  There are admittedly a wide range of emotions required to portray two lovers brought together by unusual and tragic circumstances.  Buddy Amaral (Ben Affleck) means well when giving his ticket to another guy anxious to get home in time for Christmas, but has no way of knowing that the plane is doomed to crash.  Buddy responds by abusing alcohol and soon is unable to function as a top advertising agent.  Normal people simply do not respond in this manner. A sense of moral guilt is not rational in this particular situation.
Buddy eventually searches for the victim's wife to see if he can aid her in some way.  Alas, Abby Janello (Gwyneth Paltrow) is floundering as a widow with two children to support.  She earns money as a business real estate agent, but comes across as someone totally unqualified for the job.  Buddy essentially hands Abby a lucrative sale on a silver platter.  One thing leads to another, and they fall in love with each other.  Buddy has yet to tell her about his inadvertent role in her husband's death.  The dialogue is verbose, tiring, and utterly incomprehensible.  Even amateur film makers rarely fail to this degree.  I spent the whole time wondering why a major movie studio gave its approval.  It would seem to me that the danger signs should have been blatantly obvious.
It is extremely rare for me to award a film with such talented actors only one star.  As matter of fact, this is the very first time that I've ever done so!  More often than not, there is enough on the screen to justify three or four stars.  Regrettably, in this case my advice is to avoid Bounce.  Any of its possible saving graces do not justify such a waste of your precious entertainment dollar and time.",1021766400,6,2011,4.627118644067797

Bounce is the first movie I saw her in a starring role.  I can't take my eyes off her.  In it she showed real acting chops in portraying a mother, a widow, and a SoCal woman living in San Fernando Valley.  Any wrong move can make her look/sound like a whiney and privileged Westside yuppy studio/ad agency executive or a jaded, cultured Manhattanite.
Ben Afleck is also well casted in his role of a selfish and self-centered high achiever.  I don't want to believe that he's like this in real life but he seems to be at his best being a spoiled and egotistic playboy.  :)

1408893,3,B000059MQ4,"Romantic comedies and dramas are still the kinds of movies girls tend to drag guys to, although I suspect the guys enjoy them more than they let on. I know my Dad and his buddies did. They never admitted they did, but it wasn't that hard to persuade them to go and they always seemed to be in a good mood afterwards. I've always liked them, because the best ones take us to a special place where Cinderellas and Prince Charmings are everywhere and where the worst disagreements are quickly and happily resolved.
Sadly, Bounce is not an especially good romantic film, which is too bad because it is likable enough. The problem is in the plot structure. It is utterly predictable, one of those stories where you know exactly how it will end thirty minutes into the picture.
Ben Affleck plays Buddy, an amiable guy whose small California advertising agency has just won a major account with Infinity Airlines. We find Ben in a Chicago airport hoping that his plane will depart before a big snowstorm halts all the flights. Waiting in an airport bar, he meets two other Californians. One is a beautiful woman, and the other is a man named Greg, who is eager to get home to his wife and two kids. The three talk until Buddy's flight departure is announced. It's the last flight out. He almost goes, but then decides to spend the night with the woman. He gives his ticket to Greg, who boards the plane in his place. The flight never arrives. Instead, it crashes, killing everyone on board. Months later, Buddy, who has been plagued with guilt, decides to look up Greg's widow, Abby [Gwyneth Paltrow]. He simply want to see if she needs anything. You can probably guess where the story goes from there.
Affleck and Paltrow work well together, and why not? They used to be an item in real life. Paltrow has no problem with her role, which requires her to lose her glamour queen image. She is completely believable as a struggling young widow. Affleck is pleasant to watch, but he has trouble with his two or three big emotional scenes. I think he is more comfortable when he isn't playing the nice guy. Alex B. Linz and David Dorfman do good jobs playing Abby's two small sons. Johnny Galecki has the best small part. He plays Buddy's wisecracking, no nonsense gay assistant. He's very funny and, by far, the wisest character in the movie.
Director Don Roos, who has done splendid work on ironic comedies such as The Opposite of Sex, seems a bit lost dealing with such a mainstream story, which ironically he also wrote. As a result, Bounce makes for a pleasant diversion, the kind you more or less enjoy and then promptly forget.",1016236800,,2622,4.580851063829787
1408894,5,B000059MQ4,"In Mirimax Picture's 'Bounce,' an admittedly extraordinary circumstance becomes the catalyst for a story about ordinary people living ordinary lives and being all the more extraordinary for that. Far from being yet another 'chick-flick' romance, 'Bounce' is a movie that explores how guilt and love and friendship and kindness and dishonesty and fear can all intertwine and how average people respond to the randomness of life and chance. It is, in short, an outstanding movie that is refreshingly free of the cliches that normally burden romances of this type.
The story revolves around Buddy Amaral (Ben Affleck), a jet setting ad executive who, in order to get a one night stand with fellow passenger Mimi Praeger (Natasha Henstridge), gives his airplane ticket to Greg Janello, a TV writer and failed playwrite who is anxious to get home to his wife, Abby (Gweneth Paltro) and sons Joey and Scott, played by David Dorfmann and Alex Linz. When the plane on which Buddy was supposed to fly subsequently crashes, killing all including Greg, Buddy is overwhelmed with guilt and descends into alcoholism. After spending time in rehab, Buddy decides that he must make amends to Greg's family and arranges for Abby, now working as a struggling real estate agent, to sell Buddy's advertising agency new offices. Buddy and Abby fall in love, but he cannot bring himself to tell her the truth. At that point, Mimi has a chance meeting with Abby who discovers Buddy's secret.
Notwithstanding a somewhat contrived situation, 'Bounce' succeeds because its characters are multidimensional and very human. Buddy and Abby are attractive people because they are real people that the audience wants to get to know. Buddy is a hot shot at the start of the movie, but he is also vulnerable and lonely and desperate to be liked. Abbey is the grieving widow, but she is also an attentive mother, a suburban housewife and a working woman who has to support two young children but is not sure, even a year after her husband's death, that she can do it. What is more, both are wracked by guilt caused by a situation that they could not predict or control, but that has radically changed their lives.
Make no mistake, Abby and Buddy are not the traditional Hollywood romantic movie heroes. These are not characters who start out flawed and whose romance redeems them from their sins. Rather, both of these characters are striving to overcome their flaws. Not in the typical 'run away to find yourself' soul searching Hollywood way, but rather in the little every day ways of their growing love.
This is powerful stuff because screenwriter/director Don Roos has avoided the snappy dialogue and corny speeches that make most Hollywood romantic characters seem inauthentic. Rather, Roos makes them human and therefore sympathetic. When Abby fails to understand a joke that Buddy makes, the audience can laugh with her because they've been the ones who have missed the joke. When Buddy struggles to tell his secret, the audience can sympathize with his struggle because they have sometimes had trouble telling the truth.
As for the acting, Paltrow puts in an absolutely riveting performance. She deftly avoids the cliche of the happy widow or the tough mom. She makes Abby a totally believable character whose pain is real to the audience, but whose understated courage calls for admiration. In this movie, Paltrow masters a character that could easily have become a one dimensional caricature, but instead takes on real flesh and blood characteristics.
Typically, Ben Affleck's performance does not get quite the rave reviews that his co-star and former real life girlfriend gets. However, this is unfair. For while Paltrow avoids the pitfall of making her character into a cliche, Affleck has the harder job because his character's motivations are less straightforward. Buddy vulnerabilities are harder to define, harder to see and his guilt is more complex than Abby's. For where she feels guilty because her last words to her husband were made in hasty argument, Buddy's guilt is strictly speaking unwarranted. He did a man a favor and random chance saved Buddy's life. Yet Buddy's guilt is real, and is perhaps more rooted in the emptiness he feels in his life and in his sense that the frivolousness of his actions were repaid in tragedy for another.
Affleck conveys this brilliantly and in subtle ways. When a flight attendant spurns Buddy's advances, he looks both amused and baffled and genuinely hurt. When Abby mentions Greg's name after having just clinched the real estate deal that Buddy threw her way, Buddy looks hurt and disappointed in spite of himself. When Abby finally confronts Buddy about his secret, the pain is palpable but restrained. He tears up, his voice cracks as he says good bye and asks for forgiveness, but he does not gush or create the emotional scene that is normally requisite in a Hollywood romance. This is emotionally complex stuff and Affleck deserves credit for what is surely the best performance of his entire career.
As to the rest of the cast, their work is stupendous. Johnny Galecki as Seth, Buddy's gay assistant, is brilliant, more than compensating for the fact that his character is a sort of glorified Jimminy Cricket. Tony Goldwyn is instantly likeable as Greg, as is Natasha Henstridge as Mimi. David Dorfman and Alex Linz are also quite good as Abby's sons. One only wishes that there had been more time to develop the relationship between Buddy and the boys. Fortunately, what the audience does see is both believable and touching.
'Bounce' is emotionally compelling without bludgeoning its audience. Although there are a few plot contrivances that do not quite ring true, this is more than compensated for by characters that are real, sympathetic and engaging. At the start of the film Buddy asks, 'Am I that much of a cliche?' No he is not, and that is what makes 'Bounce' such a moving and human story.",1012435200,3,5937,4.9678391959798995

1408896,1,B000059MQ4,"I had higher expectations for this film, being a big fan of director Roos's previous film ""The Opposite of Sex"".  Unfortunately, ""Bounce"" plays like a reject from the Lifetime channel or WE.
What was most surprising and disappointing was the lack of chemistry between Paltrow and Affleck.  This was like sitting through an awkward conversation with strangers during a wedding reception when you suddenly realize the people you're speaking with are dim light bulbs.  They won't go away, following you and saying things of little or no substance and won't shut up.  It's sad, such people with no bounce.  Where's the ""Bounce"" in this film?
Paltrow is always good, but I give credit for sinking this film to Affleck, as well as disappointing, tired writing by Roos.  Affleck seems to have somehow sucked the life out of Paltrow the actress.  There simply is no payoff anywhere in this film.  You walk out thinking ""So what?  Why did I just spend 90 minutes of my life watching dull characters have dull conversation?""  No bounce!
And, sorry Affleck fans, loving close-ups of pondering stares do not an actor make.  Affleck should stick to the blue collar roles or the brain dead action flicks where he doesn't have to speak much (he spoke WAY TOO MUCH in ""Pearl Harbor"", the only film you can walk in 90 minutes late and not miss anything of substance).  It's annoying when actors put on suits and ""Presto!  I've become somebody else!""  It's like the brat pack of the '80's putting on wire rim glasses and saying ""Look at me, I'm now intelligent!""  And may the movie gods help us when Affleck attempts the role of Jack Ryan replacing HARRISON FORD!?!?  What were the null sets at Parmount thinking?  It will spell the end of the only adult action franchise being produced.  Who will play his wife, the intelligent eye surgeon?  Tori Spelling?  Anne Archer could be Affleck's mother (but what a fine actress!!)  I can picture the groans from the existing, fine supporting cast of the Jack Ryan films when the press releases went out.  Definitely no bounce!  More like ""CRASH and BURN!!""
Then there's Roos's writing (heavy sigh and long groan)... with none of the satire and fun of his first film.  Okay, maybe it's not entirely fair to compare this to the excellent Christina Ricci starrer...but Roos has shown he can nail a script and characters, and has a deft eye for casting.  We have a right to have expectations from a filmmaker.  Wha'happened???  It feels like Roos sleptwalk through the first of a 3 picture deal with this script.  I hope he wakes up for his next film, cause we sure won't based on this ('kay, I sure won't.  I won't speak for everyone, being aware of the Affleck fans out there).  The ""sophomore jinx"" was alive and struck visciously with ""Bounce.""  No bounce!
Wake up, Roos!  You're a good filmmaker!  Make another one, but have some coffee or something before you approach your word processor (or typewriter, or legal pad, whatever the case is).  Just push a bit farther than the back of a cocktail napkin with the next script.  Give it some bounce!

While it starts out well enough (it begins so well that I decided to take a break from writing reviews on here), it somehow made me begin to lose interest after the first 40 minutes. The final half-hour was especially hard to sit through. I think that it's because of director Don Roos's lack of a cohesive narrative style. In the end, it just seems that the whole idea of this movie was to get Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow (who were famous for their on-again-off-again romance in real life) back together on the big screen. (...)
The crucial scene where Buddy (Affleck) and Abby (Paltrow) first meet is done so awkwardly: he arrives at her place of business, stands back to watch her take her Rottweiler out of the car to go inside her office, then approaches the front door and knocks, she comes out to greet him as a potential client, he interests her with a business offer, the dog who's locked in the bathroom barks loudly, she apologizes for that, he then makes a comment about Rottweilers, she freaks out because she hadn't mentioned that she had a Rottweiler (although the volume of the barking alone would've given that fact away), so now she things he's a stalker and as he tries to explain that he's not, she threatens to sic the dog after him, then accidentally opens the bathroom door a bit too much, the Rott then burts out and attacks him, tearing his suit-jacket and dress pants, after which he threatens to sue her till she apologizes profusely, and then they both spend the rest of the day talking outside the tailor's with the dog, who by now for some reason is totally docile.  This isn't a Meet Cute: it's a Meet Ridiculous!
So many similar opportunities for intelligent dialogue are missed throughout the movie. I'm not going to go into any further detail, as other reviewers have already done so, but I just wanted to express my disappoinment with the results of a system that greenlights sensationalism over substance.  Anybody who seriously thinks that this film would have been made without Ben & Gwyneth is seriously fooling themselves!
Ben Affleck has already proven himself to be a very good, natural actor (especially in SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE and GOOD WILL HUNTING) and Gwyneth Paltrow is nothing short of the Meryl Streep of her generation--but let's hope that if they ever co-headline another movie, they both carefully read the script first, as well as make sure they work with a director with more than a one-film resume` to his credit.",1007510400,3,2500,4.677272727272728

If you're into the 'light-romance/comedy-romance' kind of stuff, this film is not for you.  It takes an older or a matured audience to understand & appreciate the difficulties (both internal & external) the characters were undergoing.
Ben Affleck's portrayal of Buddy as a guilt-laden person trying to make amends & later on falling in love is quite believable; & Gwyneth's acting of Abby as a striving single-mom living in an illusion of being divorced rather than widowed is painful but real.
At a closer look & putting aside the brewing love story between the two, the story has more meat than it meets the eye.  It deals with one's loneliness & emptiness even with a very successful career in contrast with the happiness of a complete family despite living in the midst of financial difficulties.  It shows us how people try to pick things up & start again from where they have fallen.  It shows how death of a loved one affects each & everyone (especially kids).  Also, it makes us realize how unbelievably strong a woman can be when you least expect it.  More importantly, it speaks of humility & forgiveness, for it is only with these virtues one can fully recover & go on with his life.",1004313600,,1480,4.735408560311284

1408905,4,B000059MQ4,"Bounce is an utterly winning romantic drama, replete with an intriguing storyline, believable characters and honest emotions.
Ben Affleck stars as Buddy Amaral, an arrogant hotshot advertising exec, who, in a rare moment of kindness, offers his seat on an airplane to a young writer desperate to get home to his wife and kids for the holidays.  When the man dies in a plane crash, Buddy is suddenly sent on a mission of soul-searching, trying to sort out the complex emotions he is now forced to deal with.  When drinking provides no solution, he feels himself compelled to seek out the mans widow, Abby, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, and their two young boys.  Buddy keeps his connection with them a secret as he begins to fall in love with Abby and to become a part of their wounded family.
In its bare-boned detailing, the plot may smack a bit of incredibility and contrivance.  But thanks to expert writing and directing by Don Ross, every detail in the film feels just right.  Take the opening scene, for instance.  Ross gives the chance encounter between the two strangers who will be forever tied together by fate the loose, casual, and offhanded quality one finds in real life.  Nothing in this film ever seems forced, least of all the romantic feelings these two hurt, vulnerable and attractive people feel for one another.  In fact, it is the complexity of the characters that helps Bounce to rise above the superficiality of most films in this genre.  In addition to Buddys character-building, we see Abby trying desperately to overcome the bewildering tragedy that has befallen her, unsure of how to deal with her own feelings of loss, guilt and anger that inevitable arise from such a situation.
Affleck and Paltrow bring such an air of thoughtfulness and maturity to their roles that we find ourselves genuinely caught up in their predicament and rooting them on all the way.  Its nice for a change to see a romantic film truly centered on a pair of likable grownups as opposed to the superannuated adolescents we usually find in films of this type.  Here are flawed, often weak, individuals who nevertheless contain cores of genuine goodness and innate warmheartedness.
The movie also achieves additional depth and weight in its exploration of the vagaries of fate as many of the characters examine the what if scenarios that haunt anyone caught up in a situation like this one.

So he waits a year, gets himself straightened out, and goes to apologize to her--only to find himself falling in love.
Will they or won't they end up together?  The ending doesn't provide much suspense--the only real question is when Gwyneth is going to find out what happened.  To the filmmakers' credit, the scene is later than would be expected, which allows some tension to build.
The major problem with this movie is that Ben Affleck never quite musters the dramatic intensity that is required of him in a few scenes.  There is one particularly uncomfortable moment when you want him to stop talking about his feelings--because he just isn't believable.  This is especially obvious when contrasted with Gwyneth's seemingly effortless performance.

Consequently, I came to expect a somewhat offbeat movie infused with depth AND wit.  Instead, we get the standard-issue, banal boy-meets-girl, boy-gets-girl, boy-loses-girl, etc... movie.
No further comment needs to be made about Ben Affleck -- except that he/his character is SO obnoxious at the beginning of the movie that the one-night-stand (with the radiant Natasha Henstridge) that sets up the plot seems highly improbable.  Gwyneth Paltrow tries very hard to create another of her intelligent, graceful characters, but is ultimately doomed to failure because there is nothing she can do to elevate her character above the mediocrity of the film.  (Or perhaps she flounders because she can't even believe her character is in love with Ben Affleck's because she can't believe she was ever in love with him.)  The only shining light in the picture comes from Johnny Galecki's understated but hilarious performance in a small part that, strangely, seems to be the most three-dimensional characte in this movie.

1408912,2,B000059MQ4,"""Bounce"" is a strange film. It is a dark romance that really has no satisfactory ending. The two leads suffer through unpleasant situations that can not lead to a happy solution as they are written. For some unexplained reason, the Ben Affleck character never comes right out and tells the Gweneth Paltrow character that he switched plane tickets with her husband on the ill fated flight. It is a fatal flaw. A viewer would think that after having gone through a year of therapy, he could face what had happened. Instead, the script is padded with silly evasions and outfight lies. The leads are very attractive with obvious chemistry that could have produced a wonderful romantic film, but it never happens.
One of the major faults with the DVD package is that the director and the cast promise in voice over narrations to show a number of deleted scenes on the DVD plus three alternate endings, but they are NOT included. Since there is is second disk just for the bonus materials, these omissions could not be because of lack of disk space. This is a really unfortunate situation. Once it was decided to not use those scenes, the mentions should have been edited out of the voice over tracks.
With the poor story line and the features left out of the bonus materials, this is not one of the better offerings on DVD.",992304000,,1318,4.636752136752137
1408913,3,B000059MQ4,"The movie starts off promisingly enough. Successful businessman, Buddy Amaral, played by Ben Affleck, leads a shallow, sophomoric existence. Failed playwright, Greg Gennello, played by Tony Goldwyn, is happily married and has a rich family life. Their worlds collide when they meet in an airport and get to talking. Both headed to the same destination, Greg wants to get home to his family but is bumped from his flight, while Buddy wants to miss that very same flight so that he can have a one night stand with a beautiful fellow traveler.
In a moment of wild abandon, Buddy gives his ticket to Greg who then boards the plane in his stead. Unfortunately, this act of seeming generosity by Buddy has dire consequences, as the plane crashes and Greg is killed. When Buddy later discovers this turn of events, it is a moment of reckoning for him, and he goes into a personal downward spiral.
A year later, after a stint in rehab to get his drinking under control, he seeks out Greg's widow, Abby, played by Gwyneth Paltrow. Still feeling guilty over Greg's death, Buddy seeks redemption by doing something nice for Greg's widow, who, as the single parent of two young boys, is now trying to make ends meet as a real estate agent. He gives her a sizable real estate commission to handle, though she is unqualified, and soon they begin dating and fall in love. At this juncture, Buddy has still not told her that their meeting was not kismet.
To make a long story short, Abby discovers, in a rather unpleasant way, the part that Buddy played in Greg having been on that fatal flight. The movie then goes south. What had started out promisingly enough, takes a strange twist. While there is, undeniably, chemistry between the two stars, which explains their off screen romance, their sizzle is not enough to keep this movie on even keel, and the movie begins to flatline. Notwithstanding the eleventh hour fizzle, however, it is still a moderately enjoyable movie.",992044800,11,1959,4.747800586510264

It tells the tale from both perspectives of Abby Janello and Buddy Amaral so you get in touch with both sides of the story and not just one.  Buddy trades his plane ticket with Abby's husband Greg on a snowy night so he can use his arrogant charm to seduce an attractive blonde he met in the bar that night.  I won't spoil the movie but Buddy finds himself not only trading a ticket, but lives with Greg.  This movie is about self discovery and recovery after disaster pulls these two people together.

For its credit, I saw it twice in a row, repeating several times certain particular parts of it. And found out a beautiful message hidden in it. Simple things of life like fate, destiny and our personal attitude when confronting them. Living life in the fast lane, just to find out what a waste it could lead to. ""A last call of the day"". How important it is to have someone who makes you a last call of the day, someone to whom you can say ""good night"".
This movie for sure is not for the critics' delight.
Those who didn't like this movie most probably never missed these ""last calls"" or ""good nights"" and have no idea how life is not having them.
This movie is not to be seen lightly, there is a lot of thinking that needs to be done on the hidden message it contains.

The storyline, a man seeking redemption for an act he feels  he committed, trying to mend the lives destroyed, and trying to find meaning in his own life.  It also is the story of a young mother trying to keep a family together following her husband's death.  Somehow, you get the feeling Affleck and Paltrow are sleepwalking through the whole thing(when you think of Afflecks's SNL spoof of the MTV show, Fanatic as a higher point then this movie, you know you're in trouble).  Bright spots are David Galecki as Afflecks's post trauma assistant, very dry, very acerbic, and seeing Tony Goldwyn in a good guy role(although, I kept expecting him to do something evil).  Very disconcerting, Jennifer Grey, post nose job, you know you know her from somewhere...... No Bounce, just a thud.",990230400,4,896,4.933333333333334
1408918,4,B000059MQ4,"I did not expect to like this movie. The biggest reason is that I've only seen Ben Affleck in one movie where I liked his acting, ""Good Will Hunting.""  He surprised me in this movie by doing a very good acting job and holding his own with Gwyneth Paltrow, his romantic lead.  The gist of the story is easy to follow. Affleck plays Buddy Amaral, a successful ad executive with substance abuse and commitment problems to anything but getting ahead.  He gives his airline ticket to another passenger when he sees the opportunity to have a one night stand by staying on the ground in Chicago where a snow storm is ongoing.  The plane crashes and the other guy dies instead of Buddy.  Unable to handle the guilt from this situation, he eventually seeks out the dead man's widow and starts to help her in business without telling her who he is.

The romantic complications flow from this basic setup. Affleck and Paltrow are very good as a couple together, which maybe was helped by their being a real life couple for a time during and after the movie. The costuming, makeup and hair designers must have knocked themselves out trying to make Paltrow as plain as possible.  I almost didn't recognize her when she came onscreen.  I think her plainness  was a bit overdone.  Hubby even liked this movie despite his usually avoiding this type of movie.  He even went so far as to say he thought Affleck was terrific.  I'm not willing to go quite that far but, all in all, it is very good.

My reviews are mainly concerned with the disc not the story, i let everyone else do that bit. So, disc 1, the video transfer is as usual a very nice clean effort from Beauna Vista/Miramax, presented in Anamorphic Widescreen at 1.85:1, the original theatre format. Sound is good and clear, a mainly dialogue driven film , but a few surround moments in airports etc help to fill where required. Audio commentary with Don Roos(Director)&Bob Cohen(Prod), kinda dry and lifeless, technical aspects as well as acting choices, and basic plot structure are the focus. Disc 2...OK..now u get 8 scenes from the movie with commentary by Ben,Gwen & Don, this is more entertaining thanks to Bens sense of humour. Gag reel(5.30mins) standard fluffed lines etc,Deleted scenes (14)totaling 45 mins with or without Comm, presented in original form non anamorphic, most dumped during extensive test audience reviews, some would have changed the ultimate feel of the film. 2 features, one a Making of..type doco(22mins) one a more relaxed behind the scenes with Ben & Gwen(22mins). Standard Trailer and a music video. A pretty good damned Special Edition package for a movie that did ""so so"" at the box office.

1408921,2,B000059MQ4,"Chalk up some of my disappointment to thinking this movie might have a healthy dose of lighthearted humor and romance and a sense of playfulness about the rematching of this former real life pairing. Still Bounce simply was dull and I am kind of stunned that this film failed to piece together an engaging bond. All the tension in the story rests on Ben Afflecks character looking for the right moment to reveal his secret. Part of the problem is its not even a very good secret. Neither is the secret a deal breaker so the waiting for the shoe to drop loses most all of its interest after the first hour and twenty minutes. This delay has the cumulative effect of making Affleck seem increasingly unworthy of Gwyneth Paltrow's sweet vulnerable character that you sort of wish he would realize he isn't good enough to be with her and go home. Eventually I was worn out and simply wanted him to get it over with so the movie would end. The film reminds me of a Reds Dodgers game I attended. There was no score til the bottom of the ninth inning, two men out two strikes, two balls and one man who walked to first base. Finally the reds make a hit! The first baseman makes it home, the batter was tagged out and the game suddenly ended. Bounce is a little like that. Too little payoff after a very long wait for something to happen. I am even being generous because the game was really exciting at that last moment. Bounce was merely predictable. Its really a shame because when you have two well matched slices of tasty bread, all you need is a little filler in the middle to make a really good sandwich. If you want to see a pairing of Ben Affleck and Gwyneth, your time would be better spent picking up a copy of Shakespeare in Love, even if you have already seen it.",988761600,,1768,4.3444108761329305
1408922,3,B000059MQ4,"BOUNCE is a DVD that's too good for its film.  The expansive 2-disc format gives viewers really much more information than its mediocre subject deserves.  Indeed, all that bonus material just gives mounting evidence that there was nothing at any stage of the development of this project that was really intriguing.  I'd like to think that the film was somehow shortchanged by the studio's advertising department, or that there was some explanation for a concept film that's all concept and no character.  But given the huge amount of materials on the DVD, it's fairly easy to say that once you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie.
Worse, the trailer oversells the movie.  It has some scenes which were blatantly cut from the final print, and tends to feature the comic side of the movie far too strongly.  The movie doesn't even really deliver on its trailer's subtextual selling point: the on-screen reunion of real-life exes.  Instead, Paltrow and Affleck's characters spend less time falling in love and more time agonizing about the secrets they're hiding from each other.  Too bad for these fine actors that it's hard for an audience to stay interested in two hours worth of guilt.  Inexplicably, one starts the movie basically to watch on-screen chemistry of off-screen lovers, only to end the movie not caring about them OR their characters.  Somehow, they're just not FUN together, and that's what we hope they will be.  If you want a better film about airplane tragedy guilt, see RANDOM HEARTS.  If you want a better film about either Affleck or Paltrow falling in love, pick almost any other movie they've made.
What might possess you to buy this DVD are those extra features.  There's more here than on most other films to help you judge the worth of the project in full.  Deleted scenes, outtakes, and a behind-the-scenes featurette await.  But maybe the most useful bit is an enlightening set of crew interviews, conducted mostly by Affleck and Paltrow.  You'll find out a lot about what different people do on the set of a film, from gaffers to production assistants.  Teachers, particularly, might want to buy this film for this particular feature.  Equally, fans of Affleck and Paltrow will like to see how easily the actors get along with their crew.  It's also one of the few filmed moments that sheds light onto how one makes a career behind the camera as a best boy or sound engineer.",988243200,4,2411,4.836585365853659

1408926,3,B000059MQ4,"This is a decent (but not great) romantic drama/comedy about Buddy (Ben Affleck), an advertising executive who gives his airplane ticket to Greg (Tony Goldwyn), a stranger he meets during a flight delay.  The plane crashes and Buddy is wracked with guilt, wanting to make amends to Greg's family.  Upon meeting Greg's wife Abby (Gwyneth Paltrow), he falls in love with her, but keeps the switch a secret.  To no one's surprise, the secret comes out and Abby doesn't take it well.  This is standard romantic fare, boy meets girl; they fall madly in love and seem perfect for one another; a big blowup drives a wedge between them; he tries to win her back.
The plot uses a variation on the device used in ""Random Hearts"" where Harrison Ford's wife dies in a plane crash and he seeks out the wife of the man she was sitting next to, ultimately falling in love with her.  Though somewhat contrived, it is an interesting device, however the two films arrived on the market too closely in time for it to be a coincidence.
This film tries to do too much.  Writer/Director Don Roos (The Opposite of Sex) doesn't seem quite sure whether this is a serious drama or a lighthearted romantic comedy and he keeps flitting back and forth incongruously.  Buddy is an alcoholic with intimacy problems, a cavalier attitude and a gigantic guilt complex.  He is far too flawed to be believable in this relationship and Ben Affleck's devil-may-care demeanor on screen is a mismatch for the tortured soul he is portraying.  Roos has trouble keeping the film on course making unnecessary plot digressions that bog the film down in spots.
Gwyneth Paltrow is terrific in the romantic scenes, but she is overly melodramatic in the serious scenes.  Oddly, although Affleck and Paltrow dated for a while, they don't seem to have very good chemistry onscreen (perhaps that's why they broke up).
The DVD has a second disk devoted to special features, but much of that is taken up by a series of dreadfully bad impromptu interviews by Affleck and Paltrow with members of the production crew (like best boy, boom operator, hair stylist, etc.).
This is a fair story with good actors who are cast poorly, and a director who meanders too much.  I rated it a 6/10.",987724800,,2228,4.701799485861183
1408927,4,B000059MQ4,"Bounce's director and writer, Don Roos, has an interesting history. He's the writer of the 5 star Boys On the Side, and writer/director of the oddly warm-hearted (for a film supposedly meant to be cynical) The Opposite Of Sex. And Bounce feels like Mr Roos continuing his restless search for whatever it is that he really, really, wants to say.
Bounce is a - well, it's hard to say. Tragedy? Rom com? Rehab drama? It has all these elements, and the genre switches as you change focus. Follow the Gwyneth Paltrow character and you could be watching a Sandra Bullock produced woman-getting-back-out-there film. Follow the Ben Affleck character and it's like Gus Van Sant was given a budget. Follow Paltrow's kids and its a drama about fathers. Follow the airline and it's a courtroom drama.
Perhaps it should have been a trilogy. I don't know.
But even though it doesn't have the world's strongest throughline, or indeed a consistent tone, there is a great deal to like. Gwyneth does grief - and it's necessary hesitation at getting back 'out there' on the dating scene - very well. The kids are good. Johnny Galecki steals all the scenes he is in, as Affleck's ex-alcoholic gay assistant. And there is very strong support in relatively tiny roles - Natasha Henstridge as an unblousy one night stand and Jennifer Grey as an ex are both good. I confess the appeal of Affleck largely passes me by, but he is passable in this.
At the end of the film, and for a few days after, I found myself wondering what Don Roos intended, and whether he felt it had worked. I don't know.
But it's nice that he's pushing himself in different styles and genres. Roll on his circus/Martian/kick-boxing/love movie, or whatever it is that he's dreaming of.",987724800,2,1733,4.703947368421052

1408929,3,B000059MQ4,"You can enjoy ""Bounce"" as a by-the-numbers romance that goes through the motions of most other films of the genre, but that doesn't stop it from appearing cliched. The story of man-meets-woman (at least it's not boy-meets-girl) comes from an interesting twist in the beginning, but it all seems to paint itself into a corner without really breaking any new ground in the second two thirds. The performances from the two leads, as well as some of the supporting cast, make the movie worth watching, but the story really doesn't shine as much as it should.
That interesting twist comes in the beginning of the movie. Buddy Amaral is a successful ad executive who has just won over the campaign for Infinity Airlines, on which he is about to fly to Los Angeles. His flight is delayed because of inclimate weather, and soon he is chatting in the bar with Greg Janello, who is traveling back to L.A. to his family. When he discovers he has bumped from the flight, Janello phones his family to let them know he is taking a later flight, but Buddy gives him his ticket and tells him to get on the plane.
The twist occurs when Buddy learns that the plane crashed in flight, killing everyone aboard, and his guilt over the death of Janello leads him down a path of alcoholism and depression, from which he later recovers in A.A. After a year of getting back on his feet, he decides to pay a visit to Janello's wife, Abby, whom Janello had mentioned in their conversation along with his two small boys. As it turns out, Abby is a real-estate agent who is able to get Buddy's ad firm a nice piece of property, thereby causing them to become better acquainted with one another, and eventually falling in love.
It all looks and sounds good, but this is where the movie takes its originality and turns it into formula. What couple in any relationship doesn't go through some sort of hardship? None, but the hardships of this film are just a bit played out by now. We know that Buddy wants to come clean with Abby about knowing her deceased husband, and the movie's predictability lets us know that, even before it happens, she is going to reject him for not telling her. I'm not going to completely give away the ending of this movie for you, so I'll put it into not-so-certain terms: if you can guess what is going to happen scene-by-scene, then you're probably correct about your predictions.
Which is what really hinders this movie's potential as an original romance: it starts out originally and then settles for a second half that follows the same pattern as any other romance you'll see. They meet each other, play the game of shy looks and modesty with one another, soon become enamored with one another, and then meet hardship which they may or may not overcome. That hardship plays out like more of a script inclusion than something convincing. It comes off looking like Abby has to separate from Buddy, instead of like a decision that her character makes based on her experiences. The movie never gives any breathing room for its characters: they never appear to be making their own decisions, but ones that are made for them.
The chemistry between Buddy and Abby is mediocre at best, with a tug-of-war between believability and plot requirement taking them down different paths in their relationship. Ben Affleck, who plays Buddy, is convincing as being both arrogant and emotional in his role, at different times, of course. Abby is played by Gwyneth Paltrow, who nicely puts her fashionable looks aside and is able to play the part of a grieving widow with a convincing demeanor. The chemistry between these two acting talents is there, but the same cannot be said for their characters due to the aforementioned story pitfalls which keep us from fully liking the characters.
""Bounce"" gathers up momentum, but never takes off. The characters of the movie hve so many places to go, but the story keeps them trapped in a web of contrivance and formula. The plot needs work in its second half, as does the way it treats the actors. I did enjoy ""Bounce,"" but I also had my reservations about its spontaneity.",987552000,,4102,4.6593103448275865

The pleasant shock about this movie is the emotional range displayed by Gwyneth Paltrow. I recall reviews of her past movies (where one critic noted her crying scenes were tearless with a scrunched-up face, for example).
As Paltrow has matured, she is able to bring to her characters and the screen fully-fleshed emotional characters, like Abby in Bounce...ranging from daft and ditzy to utterly destroyed onscreen. Paltrow is a marvel and I predict without hesitation that when her career is done, she will be remembered as one of the most outstanding in her generation.
In another vein, it should be pointed out that the DVD package is a 2-disk set, the second has one of the most complete set of 'bonuses' I've seen in a DVD.
The deleted scenes alone seem like an additional movie: among these were a poignant scene where Paltrow can't sleep and she ends up reading in the garage in the front seat of her late husband's covertible; several scenes with the kids which would have answered the critics who said they weren't convinced by  Paltrow as a Valley mother; and an incredible outtake - the pivotal scene where Mimi (the girl in the airport lounge) and Abby view the video tape together. The changes in Paltrow's face during this scene are astonishing.

Gwyneth Paltrow plays Abby, who grapples with the agony of losing her husband Greg to a fateful aircrash. Never she expected that her husband had exchanged plane tickets with Buddy (played by Ben Affleck) who wanted a one-night stand with a newfound attraction Mimi (Natasha Henstridge). The romance aside, BOUNCE delves deeply into the characters' psyche - the isolation of Abby and how she saves a woman from her embarrassment with the toilet roll; Buddy recovering from guilt to bounce back with courage and direction to steer clear of his aimless life as a advertising executive.
Among the cast, Paltrow shines luminously. She portrays Abby with grief and angst and her vulnerability is conveyed with her fragile frame. Affleck still needs polishing in his expression though. The bittersweet romance is tinged with genuine sadness and forgiveness and their chemistry is bolstered, perhaps from real life to reel life.
BOUNCE is a movie that is more laudable for its honest and unpretentious take on demise and departure; its romance element is secondary. Finely acted by Paltrow, it is a movie that is worth your time even though some parts may be a little slow-moving.",986428800,5,1350,5.004444444444444

Buddy, scheming to have a one-night-stand with Mimi (Natasha Henstridge), also hanging around the airport, decides to be a ""nice"" guy, and give his plane ticket to Greg.
Buddy is stirred out of sleep by sirens, he quickly turns on the television to find out the plane he was supposed to be on has crashed, killing all the passengers.
Tormented by what has happened, Buddy turns to booze, eventually landing him in rehab.  Once sober, Buddy sets out to meet Abby (Gwyneth Paltrow), the wife of Greg.  After a brief stalking period, the two actually talk and begin falling in love. But all is not so perfect for this couple, as a videotape of Buddy and Greg at the airport surfaces, throwing Abby into a state of wonder, and confusion.
""Bounce"" is not the cute movie the trailer's depicted, but actually a dark love story, that is somewhat creepy.  Affleck, and Paltrow are likable in their roles, and they do work well together, but it isn't enough to carry the whole movie.
If there is nothing else to watch, ""Bounce"" will pass the time, but many will come away from the film disappointed.

7933982,5,B000059MQ4,"This review refers to the special two-disc DVD release of ""Bounce"".

Bounce is quite a charmer of a movie.  I was not prepared for how quietly effective and stunning the movie would be.  I usually use my own ""12 hour rule"" when it comes to rating movies, good or bad.  ""12 hour rule"" means if the movie is still on my mind half a day later, in a good way or bad.  Generally with today's sad crop of pics, you tend to forget it the minute you walk out the cineplex.  So I was aplenty surprised how I was still thinking about the movie and its characters even a few days later.

I am neither a Gwyneth and definitely not a Ben Affleck fan.  In fact, of the few movies I've seen Affleck in, he always struck me as a childish prick who can't act!  Well, not here. A lot of the credit should go to director Don Roos for dialing down Affleck's A-Hole personality and getting into character to  play a recovering alcoholic.  An episode early in the movie shows just how troublesome and out-of-hand Ben's character can get when he's drunk.  Ben's surprising good at not over playing a recovering AA member.

Gwyneth's character is about as low-key as we'll ever see her.  This is also one of the very few times we see her as a brunette since she dyed her hair for the role.  I'm not sure here if Gwyneth's acting is up to snuff, not exactly sure what it is.  Maybe her role isn't quite as ""showy"" as Affleck's or maybe she didn't do quite enough with her role.  In the one big emotional scene near the end of the movie where she confronts Affleck, Paltrow comes up surprising flat.  Bounce is one movie where her acting is outshined by her co-star.  This movie was Gwyneth's first role after winning the Oscar for ""Shakespeare In Love"" in 1999.

Great supporting performances too---Tony Goldwyn (the guy in ""Ghost"" and TV's ""Scandal""), Gwyneth's neighbor, Donna, and an all-too-brief appearance by Natasha Hentridge, who makes the most of the few scenes she's in.  She reminds me of a young Cameron Diaz but with hotter looks.  Natasha's a knockout !  Director Don Roos certainly knows how to extract great performances from his actors.

The two-disc DVD set is generous in the number of special features they give.  For a movie that didn't do big box office when it came out, they certainly put a lot into the two-disc set.  I'm grateful for the chance to see ""Bounce"" on DVD.  It certainly deserves a second chance.  For Ben Affleck fans, you're gonna Love how he looks in this movie.  This is about as HOT as you'll ever see him.  He looks absolutely gorgeous here.  There's a line by Affleck's character that sticks with me when he says to Gwyneth:  ""You're my last call of the day. Well, I don't have a last call"".  You'll have to find out what he means.  Charmer of a movie.  Highly recommended.",1476921600,,2793,4.441814595660749
