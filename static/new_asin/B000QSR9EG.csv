2840143,5,B000QSR9EG,"Show #1: From 1974...legendary horror actor Vincent Price & ""Cabaret"" actor Joel Grey. Grey appears in a ""domestic"" sketch as Vicki's date, who isn't what he appears to be. Others include: Price giving a speech about Abraham Lincoln's sense of humor on his birthday; Carol as a hotel operator listening in to the busy chatter of four parties (Price, Grey, Vicki & Lyle); and a musical climax about puppet shows.
Show #2: From 1976...The Jackson 5 & legendary clown Emmett Kelly. A wacky sketch about a governor's aide (Tim) who must contend with the governor's mentally unstable wife (Carol) kicks off the show; the Jackson 5 perform (by themselves & with Vicki as they teach her to ""groove""); a movie parody of an old Bette Davis film in which Carol plays twin sisters (a tragic boating accident has one sister pretending to be the other); and Carol reprises her ""cleaning lady"" role in a part-pantomime/part-musical climax with Kelly.
Considering the recent loss of Michael Jackson, Volume 17 is a definite keeper!",1250294400,4,1016,4.947368421052632

Wonderful cast and guest stars, superb musical numbers, fun & silly comedy sketches and great costumes. I own all the current collections of The Carol Burnett Show and hope more become available.",1481414400,,217,5.411764705882353
2840153,5,B000QSR9EG,"""The Carol Burnett Show"" was one of the greats of television.  I can't think of anyone that doesn't like the performances her show brought to us in the form of entertainment.  Oh, that the television programs today were more like the ones I grew up with.  Clean, fun entertainment.  There will never be another.  Great entertainment.",1480723200,,333,4.875
8197247,5,B000QSR9EG,"It's a shame that variety shows have to have so much of the music deleted because of those damned
COPYRIGHT LAWYERS! Just think all of Jimi Hendrix's blood-relatives have been sucking the vaults,
and our wallets, for years. I guess I'm jealous because I couldn't carry a tune in a bucket.
I love the show... when the series went into reruns, remember it went from 50 minutes to 25... after most
of the music was cut out. Most---but not all---of the episodes will, now, be missing at least 1 or 2 songs...
to protect old/dead singers' FAMILIES into p-e-r-p-e-t-u-i-t-y.

What remains is what yo CAN get... ""legally"".",1525219200,,615,4.747663551401869

8197249,1,B000QSR9EG,I loved the Carol Burnett show. These are probably the worst episodes of all. Spend a little more money and get a better compilation. This was a big let down.,1508025600,,158,4.3
8197250,5,B000QSR9EG,Came on time and was just how described. Very happy with purchase.,1505001600,,66,4.583333333333333
8197251,2,B000QSR9EG,Very disappointed that the October 1971 episode was shortened by 10 minutes. Two musical numbers were cut from the original show. A Love Melody duet with Mama Cass and Carol and a musical number with Ken Berry. Why bother including it! And less episodes on this set as on others,1503360000,,278,4.58
