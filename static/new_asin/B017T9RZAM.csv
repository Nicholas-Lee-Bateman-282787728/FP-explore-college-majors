7533604,5,B017T9RZAM,"Wonderful DVD, complements the DVD Mastering Krav Maga number 1. I will definitely buy others DVD by David Kahn",1458086400,,111,4.894736842105263
7533605,5,B017T9RZAM,"Simply put: David Kahn is a first rate instructor and an overall class act. The quality and quantity of material on his DVDs are unparalleled. I've studied Krav Maga for 7 years and while these moves are familiar Kahn's approach to teaching allows me to see my KM and martial arts thru a different and illuminating new lens. His stuff makes you THINK about what you do, how/why you do it, and how to teach it. There are many KM organizations out there. They have the same or similar techniques. What's different about them is what they emphasize as being especially important  and why. Kahn's IKMA emphasizes explosive dynamic combatives and aggressive weapon control grappling. His emphasis on RETSEV makes sense. Like Teddy Roosevelt said:""Never hit softly."" I've invested in ALL of David Kahn's publications. And I've not regretted a single red cent of it. Five stars? Absolutely well deserved!!!!",1454284800,14,900,5.0
7533606,5,B017T9RZAM,"The video is very good, he shows you both the proper and improper movements. I look forward to taking classes and I feel this video set has given me a good jump start towards learning Krav Maga. I highly recommend this video if you are interested in learning  the basics of Krav Maga.",1453852800,2,284,4.3584905660377355
7533607,5,B017T9RZAM,"I found the dvd's very informative and to be very practical for self defense. I purchased these dvd's for my daughter  to teach her self defense . I watched all of the dvd's in this volume and have to say they are very good. I've had lessons in ju jitsu , Okinawa kenpo, and aikido . These techniques  in this course is better for a street fight than my traditional  martial arts. This is what I was looking for something  easy to learn and effective  for my daughter so she will have a way to fight off someone if she is attacked. This is an excellent course and you can't really beat the price. Customer service  is absolutely  amazing!  David contacted me himself and invited me to be a guest in his dojo. Wow!",1452297600,11,713,4.268656716417911
7533608,5,B017T9RZAM,"I can't speak more highly of David Kahn's DVD set. It truly shows Krav Maga's practicality and effectiveness through correct techniques and variations. The filming and explanations provided by David clearly demonstrate the methods and create a layered understanding of the material, which enables you to practice the methods with more comfort. Furthermore the amount of dynamic situations presented creates a realistic background for the methods shown. Multiple variations account for the activity of the attacker, whether it be his movement or resistance all scenarios are covered in the dvd set. It is safe to say that no gaps were left in the creation of this DVD set and that the safety of those performing these techniques is kept at a priority at all times.",1451088000,2,763,5.112

7533610,5,B017T9RZAM,"This clear instruction set provides eleven hours of world-class krav maga training that people of any age or level of physical skill can profit from. Its companion to the forthcoming book of a similar name.
While the title centers on defending common street attacks, there is a huge amount of other instructive material. For example, Kahn throws in many bonus techniques, and toward the end of disk #4 there is a significant section on dealing with violence and hostile situations in general.
David Kahn is one of the most skilled practitioners and trainers around. Checking his website shows that he has extensive experience training federal, state and local law enforcement, along with civilians and all branches of the military. Just do a search on krav kahn to reach his sites and get information for yourself.

General features

The DVD set has excellent HD video. Almost all of it was shot in an actual training facility, showing the use of essential equipment such as punching/kicking bags and floor mats for absorbing the shock of falls. There are many close-ups of footworkessential for learning how to position the body for maximum defensive effectiveness. Frequent slow-motion shots help the viewer grasp the flow of techniques.

Teaching methodology and presentation

With Kahns intensity and enthusiasm its natural for the viewer to get fully engaged. Even though I have trained in krav maga, I found myself engrossed in the explanations and demonstrations. He doesnt go too fast and lets the techniques soak in, breaking them down into small parts. This contributes significantly to a viewers ability to train on his own. Especially helpful is Kahns demonstration of both the right way to do a technique and common errors of execution. Almost very technique is recorded using an active partner, with movements shown from several angles. Frequent reviews help with remembering the techniques. All of this helps the viewer to be able to use these videos on his or her own. But I think that the greatest success in using these DVDs would come from working with a partner, with one person comparing what the partner is doing with the steps shown in the video. In addition, learning most of the techniques requires defending against an attacker. Partners could easily follow the movements of the attacker/defender on the videos.  If you are not close to one of Kahns training facilities, this set can give you the next-best thing in terms of mastering techniques.

Krav maga techniques

This is by far the strongest feature of this DVD set. Kahn continually emphasizes the key elements of krav maga that make it the most effective personal self-defense system in existence. Some of these are 1) instantaneous transition from defense to offense, with many defensive moves actually being offensive at the same time, 2) retzev, or continuous combat motion, 3) immediately attacking the attacker and 4) effective footwork to position the body for defense and offense.
Krav maga is intended for real-world personal self-defense. While you can have fun following these videos and learning the techniques, ultimately what you learn is designed to keep you safe in just about any imaginable situation where you are physically threatened, whether your attacker is bare-handed or has a weapon of some kind. Kahn presents techniques that above all are designed to enable you to survive. Unlike many videos and books on the market, where the presenter doesnt have enough knowledge to tell the difference, Kahn is able to show you both what will save you and what will get you in trouble. He emphasizes that not all krav maga is the same. Train with these videos and you will come to agree.

To summarize: This is krav maga at its best. It forms a treasure house of techniques, instruction and motivation. If you want to learn krav maga or just want a review, buy this set. You won't regret it.",1450483200,8,3890,5.001545595054096

7533613,4,B017T9RZAM,This DVD offers many practical self defense techniques. For someone to really benefit from these teaching training with a partner would be required.

7533620,5,B017T9RZAM,"David Kahn's approach to the Krav Maga system and renewed mindset towards instructing this community is one of the best that I ever have seen!  David undoubtedly holds Imi's mindset that ""one may walk in peace""...

Having personally attended several courses and been exposed to many systems throughout my military and law enforcement career, I can truly say David is the only instructor to show a 100% common sense mentality in all that he does.  Every demonstration from David and his team included multiple angles, multiple speeds, and multiple explanations... Phenomenal work!

It is well known that nothing beats force on force training in a structured facility; however, this product is without a doubt the BEST product available if you're looking to familiarize yourself with the basic Krav Maga curriculum or if you're just looking to refine your skills and drills until the next time you're on the mat (or Heaven forbid in a violent encounter).

I fully support this product, David's instruction, and the Israeli Krav Maga Association Gidon System... Because not all Krav Maga is the same!",1461024000,7,1097,5.106145251396648
8740586,5,B017T9RZAM,"Bottom line up front.  David Kahn and his team are, by far, the best there is, and teach the best version of the best system there is.  If you want to arm yourself with the best tools to survive any encounter (Civilian, Law Enforcement (LE), or Military Combat) David Kahn, and the IKMA (GS), are your best option.

Historically, development of Self-defense systems and martial arts occurred from the necessities of the existing time-period and social norms concerning violence.  For example, Karate for the Samurai or Kali for villagers of the Philippines (whose conflicts were tribal and weapons of choice where whatever they had laying around).  Societies developed these systems and martial arts in order to, quickly and efficiently, train Soldiers. This was so they would possess the capabilities to close with and destroy their adversaries in hand-to-hand combat if and when necessary.  Imi Lichtenfeld designed Israeli Krav Maga in the 1940s in order to address the modern combatant.  Whether dealing with a mugger on the streets, or a foreign adversary on the battlefield. No other system is as modern or effective as Krav Maga.

The IKMA (GS) is the only true Krav Maga system under Grand Master Haim Gidon (successor to Imi Lichtenfeld).  It is, by far, any agencies best option for training its Soldiers and/or LE officers.  A single ten-hour seminar with David Kahn, and his team, proved to be worth a year of training in any other dojo I have attended.  I have trained on several forms of martial arts and self-defense systems.  I always shop around for the best instructor with the most practical training.  David and his team are undeniably the best there is.  I have driven fourteen hours at a time, on several occasions, to attend training with him.  I always leave the seminars absolutely motivated to come back to base and share what I learned with my Soldiers.

Krav Maga has grown in popularity in the west in recent decades.  There are several different interpretations of the system available in the US (e.g. Warrior Krav Maga /Krav Maga World Wide).  Most of them teach substandard techniques, with the addition of cardiovascular endurance training, in order to appeal to those more susceptible to advertising and marketing.  The idea being, Get fit and learn to defend yourself overnight.  While Krav Maga is designed to be simple to understand.  There still needs to be much emphasis on the subtle fine points that make any technique effective.  Far removed from the source, these schools often sacrifice proper technique for mass production.  This can have fatal consequences when someone uses those techniques for actual self-defense.  I have also frequented several introductory courses where the facility told me they strictly focus on civilian self-defense.  There are three tiers to Krav Maga (Military, Civilian, and Law Enforcement).  Any master of the system should know and be able to instruct them all.  As a Law Enforcement Officer, I also have a firm understanding of the Use of Force (UOF) continuum.  I also understand the legal ramifications for not understanding the UOF continuum.  David Kahn and the IKMA (GS) are true masters of the system. They will ensure that the student gets every detail and piece of knowledge they require for the techniques they are taught to be effective.

Israeli Krav Maga under the IKMA (GS) is also a great plug and play system. If your agency has an existing system where you believe there are gaps in its current techniques, or dilemmas which your system does not address, Krav Maga will fill those gaps easily.  I have personally found this to be applicable for LE systems, military combatives, and other martial arts/self-defense systems alike.

Additionally, if you attend the seminars to get hands on training, and a professional instructors critique on your form (which I highly recommend), the DVDs and books hold nothing back in terms of helping you to refresh your memory.  The five books (approximately 1000 pages worth of instructional material) are extremely well articulated and literally spell out every detail you need to know from a strategic approach.  They articulate all the subtle nuances, which make a technique work.  The four DVD volumes (approximately 27 hours of instructional material) do an excellent job of using a by the numbers approach to teaching and demonstrating the technique, as well as elaborating on key points.  For those who have served in an instructor position, in either the military or law enforcement, the previously mentioned materials more than portray a Training Support Package (TSP) or Program of Instruction (POI).  In addition, the materials previously mentioned will entirely refresh your techniques acquired by any seminar attended in person with David.

Once again, bottom line up front.  David Kahn and the IKMA (GS) are by far the best there is, teaching the best version of the best system there is.  If you want to arm yourself with the best tools to survive any encounter (Civilian, Law Enforcement, or Military Combat) David Kahn, and the IKMA (GS), are your best option.",1526169600,6,5108,5.056152927120669
8740587,5,B017T9RZAM,"David Kahn, he is the best at explaining through books and video the techniques and tactics of Krav Maga. I am a 2nd-degree black belt in judo and have been in judo for decades, and all his courses have added to my toolbox of self-defense techniques.",1521331200,,250,4.456521739130435
8740588,5,B017T9RZAM,Because  not all the krav maga is the same. In my opinion is the best tutorial and video you can find. David is a really good instructor and explain everything very clearly and from different angle. I like the way his teach. A must for a km lover.,1516579200,,247,4.145833333333333
8740589,5,B017T9RZAM,"I bought this and the #1 series and while I love them BOTH  this one is definitely my favorite of the two.( I'm buying the remaining two sets after Christmas)

I'm 51 years old, 260  lbs. and have trained off & on in martial arts my whole life and after my latest break I was wanting to get back into ONLY the self defense aspect. After reading one of David Kahn's books I saw in a book store I knew I wanted to try his dvd programs. I was very impressed. David really cuts the fluff and deals with easy to use strategies to stop an attacker and does not spend time with just filler talk, it is real instruction.

Watching him actually reminded me of one of my former no nonsense instructors from my past, except with the DVD's you get to watch & re watch which is a huge advantage. If you have a martial arts background and already have the concepts down, in my opinion it's as good if not better than live instruction because of being able to re watch.

If you are not formerly trained, this set is EXCELLENT for a beginner in self defense as well. The first DVD alone has information that could save your life

There is a bonus section on this program on takedowns and my girlfriend who weighs 130lbs was stunned when I had her try a takedown on me and she was able to do it.",1512432000,3,1278,4.153846153846154
8740590,5,B017T9RZAM,Really good practical material. I expected this to be good but the level of instruction was better than expected. The techniques are explained carefully no bull crap simple techniques that have chance of working in the event of a real aderaline heart pumping assault. Practice the moves well watching  and or practice with friend/ training partner to get true benefit from this material.,1509926400,,387,5.142857142857143
8740591,5,B017T9RZAM,"I have got all 4 volumes of David's DVD. Nothing I can say but great and highly efficiency.  The most important is ,what David said in his demonstrations about modified techniques from traditional skills ; I totally agreed. Yes, Because not all Krav maga is the same ,even though I have been marginalized by the traditional trainer . I am looking forward to vol 5.",1502323200,,364,4.6
8740592,5,B017T9RZAM,really really good tuition in self defence against the most common form of attacks. highly recommended,1499990400,,102,5.4375
8740593,4,B017T9RZAM,"This a is great companion guide for all of you Kravist. Knocked of one star, because David could take more time to explain the footwork involved in some of the moves. In some cases it is not explained. These are the best videos to supplement with classroom instruction.",1492819200,,269,4.625
8740594,5,B017T9RZAM,"These DVDs are beyond awesome... I've learned so many fantastic techniques while watching.

If you're looking for the best self-defense instructional DVDs out there, I think you've found them right here. HIGHLY recommended!",1491264000,,325,5.150943396226415
8740595,5,B017T9RZAM,"Fast and packaged !!! Enjoying watching these dvds and learning! Don't just watch them get up and do the moves as it playing! Great workout plus, your learning to defend your self and it might save your life one day!
