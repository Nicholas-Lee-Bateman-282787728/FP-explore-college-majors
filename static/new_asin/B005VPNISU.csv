4897342,4,B005VPNISU,"My grandson (almost 4) was browsing through videos on my kindle.  This one came up and he said, ""That's for girls"", and then accidently brought it up.  Turns out he sat still and watched the whole thing.  If he sat still that long, it has to mean he liked it.  And because he liked it, so did grandma!",1360800000,,301,4.137931034482759
4897343,5,B005VPNISU,My grandson picked this one and I was glad to be able to let him see some different than what I already had taped.,1360454400,,114,3.7916666666666665
4897344,5,B005VPNISU,"Made up of 5 episodes from the PBS series, games and a music video.

The first of the five episodes deals with Angelina finding a secret valentine on her door step and takes off with her younger sister Polly to discover who gave it to her one friend at a time.  The 2nd story is a case of misunderstanding as Marco thinks Angelina had arrange for him to play in the professional hockey game when in reality she wants him to ice skate in the half time Valentine show.  The third story has the student listening in on their teacher Miss Mimi's news and hearing wrong out all their heart into the surprise party they have planned to show how much they care.  The Four story has some great musical numbers to it as Angelina become a part of a all girls club that makes Marco and AZ feel left out and Angelina bad about excluding friends she cares for.  The final episode on the disk each student in Miss Mimi class has to act out their section of a poem but Alice's part is a sad one and she has the giggles that she's having trouble getting rid of.",1339891200,7,1045,4.205
4897345,5,B005VPNISU,"Just when I thought Angelina Ballerina was as good as it gets they came up one that really tops them.  Sweet hearts not only has more diversity in dancing, the meaning of friendship,and many more of the perplexing circumstances Angelina and her friends go through.  Polly has a stronger and more dominant role in these videos.  All of the episodes deal with, in one way and another, the complexity of good, clear communication, respect and all the usual values that this little group strives for.  Polly wants to know what marriage is and in my opinion I thought Mrs. Mousling handled the answer with a neutral explanation.  Gender emerges as an important part of life in several of the episodes on how to solve problems and learn from experience.  My 3.5 year old grand daughter loves Angelina and has learned and been motivated to explore ballet and classical music. Enjoy!",1326499200,,875,4.8
