6583116,5,B00MIA0FJ6,"I LOVE this MOVIE!!!  I am so excited that it is FINALLY available for HOME VIEWING!  I first saw this AMAZING film a few years ago as a scratchy bootleg.  I was delighted that it was actually featured at the TRIBECA FILM FESTIVAL in the SPRING OF 2013!  I was surprised that they were showing a movie that was 25 years old as if it were just being released for the first time. Seeing it on a big screen (fully restored and enhanced with 21st century capabilities), was like seeing a brand new movie and it blew me away!  I loved Chaplin's ""The Kid"" as well as the more recent film, ""The Artist"".  IMO, ""Sidewalk Stories"" is right in THAT mix of what I think are the three all-time greatest films in the silent genre.  What makes it MOST unique for me, is that virtually ALL of the ""dialog"" is done with music and action, not titles!  It's sweeping and haunting and funny and completely captivating, start to finish!  I did manage to catch the film a few more times since Tribeca in theaters around NYC and Philly. With each viewing I saw and/or heard something new and different!

Now, at long last, I can watch it at home with a big screen tv and great sound system, and see and hear things I never caught in my previous viewings!! (No people chatting, munching popcorn or sending texts to distract me!!)  I can't WAIT to get my copy! (I actually ordered the Blu-Ray version from Barnes on Nobles today!) I look forward to all the ""special features"" on the DVD. ""SWS"" is by far one of my all-time favorite films and one of those obscure gems in film making that was for sure way ahead of its time! Lane's unique ""updated"" ""Chaplinesque"" ""artist/tramp"" composite is on point and the film, en total, is gritty, warm, funny and endearing.  I don't ""do"" reviews very often, but I am just SO HAPPY about this release that I simply had to share my two cents!  Thanks to AMAZON, I can now doing some early Christmas shopping!!",1412899200,3,1921,4.407932011331445
6583117,5,B00MIA0FJ6,"So, I decided to give this film a chance as a way to ""switch it up"" and try something new (for me); I'm glad I did. There is a subtle magic in the film score and the scenes. I would describe it, but instead I encourage you to watch it. With an open mind and heart, I think most people will come to enjoy and appreciate this film as much as I do. I also hope you laugh like I did! Enjoy!",1412899200,,386,3.7195121951219514
6583118,5,B00MIA0FJ6,"Dear Sidewalk Stories past, present & futur admirers,

My Love affair with  Sidewalk Stories  started sometime in the early 90s after seeing it on CANAL+ a French premium cable television channel.
I fell in love with the movie at first sight. I saw it several time back then with the replays & I videotaped it.
I watched the videotape which I still have today so many times...

Then Internet was here and sometime in the 2K I bought a legal German home videotape which I watched many times.
Circa 2009 I paid an illegal legal laboratory to transfer the videotape onto a bootleg DVD which I still own.
All those 2K years I searched in vain on the web for a DVD edition of the movie worldwide, emailed Carlotta Films who owned the movie exploitation rights in France with no feedbacks, got few contacts on MySpace (Mr Joe Dixon), tried but failed to get in Ecole & Cinema school program screenings with lucky kids...

Then Facebook was here. One day in 2011 I decided to create my own page about the movie : Charles Lane's ""Sidewalk Stories"".
On the 2d of June 2011 I posted few pictures I had collected, a YouTube snippet of the movie & I wrote my first post on this wall :
... Hello to everyone who's fond of this movie & desperate there's no DVD of this Gem available worldwide. Let's change this !!! Who knows why ?!!! Charles Lane where you at ?!!! What happended to you ?!!... Any help would be really appreciated. ...
Since then so many things happened on this page, so many posts, pictures, so many contributors, so many people liking the page beginning with my entourage to reach 5450 Likers/Followers today...

Then in 2013 it all speed up with a message from Charles Lane himself on the 1st of January (I will always remember this moment) letting me know about the resurrection/renaissance/rebirth of ""Sidewalk Stories that will be coming back to theatres worldwide.

Then February 2013 Charles Lane again concluded a deal with Carlotta Films by which ""Sidewalk Stories"" will be theatrically re-released worldwide beginning with the 2013 TRIBECA Film Festival.
Before TRIBECA there was the free screening event on April 16 2013 at the Dobbs Ferry Public Library with Mr Joe Dixon joining the screening to interview Mr Lane on my behalf  Thanks Joe & thanks Peggy Mechmann. I think this is the event I wish I could have join the most... Around 100 people liking the page by then.
Few weeks before the TRIBECA event Carlotta got in touch with me to ask me if they could administrate the page  I refused - no regrets.

Then on the 2d of July 2013 I attended for the first time a Sidewalk Stories screening. This was in Paris @ le Grand Action Cinema during The Paris Cin&eacute;ma Festival. This is the First time I met Mr Marc Marder.

Then again, another screening on the 07th of July 2013 @ le Cin&eacute;ma Etoile Lilas with Mr Marc Marder, my lady, my kidz, my mum, my gran.

Then, the official rereleased of the movie was on the 9th of October 2013 in France  4.7K page Likers/Followers by then.
Ive seen the movie on the big screen 3 times in 2013 & 1 time on 2014  I will go again if I can...

Then, one year after the official rereleased I bought the Blu-ray edition of Sidewalk Stories...
La boucle est boucl&eacute;e as I would say in French, this is the end of something, what used to be my dream is now true. It has been so tremendous all those years. Thanks to Mr Charles Lane, Thanks to Carlotta & to yall !!! Now enjoy & let's hope the DVD/Blu-ray edition of the movie will allow ""Sidewalk Stories"" to receive the success it deserves...",1412899200,2,3558,4.520249221183801
6583119,5,B00MIA0FJ6,"Sidewalk Stories is, in my view, the great lost masterpiece of its era. I saw it at Cannes in 1989 where it was shown in the (by memory) 'Un certain regard' official section. The screening was packed with film aficionados and journalists - mainly a fairly cynical bunch.
I truly resent the tendency of some young film-makers to try to elevate their work with spurious sociological relevance and an uncritical sympathy with the poor. Having read the festival blurb, I went into the screening ready to give the film twenty minutes of my valuable time and then to beat a swift exit to look for a 'real film'.
I could not have been more wrong. The first sequence presents us with an expressionist vision of New York as a kind of aggressive unfeeling hell. The score is cool and evocative. I am hooked. Gradually, gently and effortlessly, we are introduced to the main characters in the first of a dozen sequences that are as funny as they are touching.
Equally gradually and gently, we become aware of Charles Lane's artistic sensibility: he is making the film with the exquisite cinematic awareness of no less than Charles Chaplin.
Great cinema can come from works of extraordinary philosophical profundity - 'Au Hasard Balthazar', for example, or 'Last Tango in Paris'. But there is another thread of greatness in the cinema and that is in the works that, basically, illuminate the cinema itself. Here we find 'Citizen Kane', 'The Birth of a Nation' and, maybe at not quite such an exalted level, this little gem.
Totally wordlessly through mime, structure and great screen-craft, Lane fashions a moderately complex tale of a lost little girl (You are probably already, correctly, thinking 'The Kid'). There is room for a love story and some dastardly villains and some tragedy. But most of all there is an ever-present and pervasive sense of the helplessness of the poor.
It is true that, about two thirds of the way through, the film veers into territory that some may find tasteless, but that is a small problem beside its extraordinary expressive qualities.
And, my drear readers the whole film is, ultimately, a magnificent preamble to a final minute when the characters discover their voices with an effect that is like being emotionally crushed by a 50 ton truck. There may be a more emotionally devastating end to a film, but in a career in cultural cinema that lasted forty years, I never saw it.
And when this screening came to an end the auditorium Debussy's full house of about a thousand cynics rose in a great wave and applauded, and cheered. They did not just applaud and cheer - they (some of them) stood on their seats and applauded and cheered. In the twenty years that I went to Cannes, the only other occasion thing anything like it was the first screening of 'Paris, Texas'.

There is just one caveat that I would like to add. The Cannes version and the UK release version had a most excellent score by Marc Marder that fitted the action perfectly and provided a counterpoint to Lane's skilful montage. Then I bought a German VHS of the film a decade later and the music had changed (I can't remember if the change was itemised on the VHS credits).  It is very much to be hoped that this version restores the original soundtrack.",1408406400,3,3248,4.716549295774648
8672572,4,B00MIA0FJ6,"A homeless street artist in New York witnesses the murder of a man in an alley. He takes the murdered mans toddler daughter, who was still nearby, and cares for her. He also attracts the attention of a beautiful and wealthy young woman. This silent movie is filmed in classic black and white with a jazzy/funky soundtrack that adds amusementa unique, contemporary film. It is similar to Chaplins The Kid, but even without The Kids pathos and Chaplins artistry, it is still well worth watching.",1512000000,,493,4.811764705882353
8672573,5,B00MIA0FJ6,"Sidewalk Stories is an amazing film. It is one of two films in cinema history that is truly silent (The other film is F. W. Murnau's The Last Laugh).  It isn't interrupted by subtitles. The acting is so expressive, you swear you can hear the dialogue. It's a charming Chaplinesque story of a homeless street artist who adopts a child. At the end real homeless people are shown and the sound slowly comes up and you find yourself listening to people you might have ignored on the street. Director and star Charles Lane makes a statement about society and the nature of film itself in an entertaining way. What's more he made the film for $5000, $2000 cheaper than Robert Rodriguez made his breakthrough feature El Mariachi.",1485820800,,722,4.68503937007874

8672576,5,B00MIA0FJ6,This is a truly genuine and captivating silent film set in NYC in the late 80's. I don't know why Charles Lane didn't get a MacArthur for this. A total classic.,1474588800,,160,4.193548387096774
8672577,5,B00MIA0FJ6,This is one of the most ingenious movies I have ever seen. When I first saw it they compared Charles Lane to Charlie Chaplin. I first saw it when it was released in theaters and I continued to look for it and am so grateful to be able to stream and watch it.,1454457600,,258,3.8867924528301887
8672578,5,B00MIA0FJ6,"I loved the silent movie concept.
 The story, plot, climax were pitch perfect.
There were several scenes in homage to the Silent Greats such as Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd.
 Then there was the most exquisite twist  with adding sound to the last scenes of the film.
 The reality expressed in this film was the same story of income inequality that exists and has existed  between the very rich and the very poor.
  But the precious thing about it is the love that springs from feared circumstance, blends often with love that has no fear.
This  has been present since the beginning of training ourselves to be part of a society.

The last scene is haunting, especially in retrospect, the reality that there are homeless ever present is a theme throughout, but when the pleas of hunger, loneliness, and despair are actually voiced after an hour of silent presentational storytelling of silence it is haunting.",1440633600,,904,4.818181818181818
