5015032,1,B006RXBPXU,"I have been practicing barre discipline for over 4 years now at least 4 times a week and have over 20 videos as well as taking studio classes. I REALLY like the lower body workout video but this one has WAY too much shoulder workout and no bicep workout in the entire video. If you have any wrist issues at all, skip this one. Lower body video is well worth it though!",1333670400,8,368,4.125
5015033,5,B006RXBPXU,"I purchased all three of the DVDs in the series. Got them a week go,and I've used them all a few times now. These are the workouts that my ""gut"" tells me will transform my body.
These are the workouts that challenge me in a way my body hasn't been challenged before. I can't wait to see what I'll be looking like this summer.

Leah's strength and grace is an inspiration, and incredibly motivating...I want to have that range of motion, that elegance in motion and strength.
I did not know of Leah prior to the purchase of these DVDs and bought them based on the excellent reviews.
I can see (and feel) why they've been so highly rated...you will work muscles you didn't know you had,with some unique techniques.
My hope is she adds a 4th DVD to this collection focusing on range of motion and flexibility.

I'm pleased that here is a ""ballet workout"" that devotes as much time and effort to upper body strength as to the core and the lower body. (yes I know exhale did arms and abs..I have it)
When I finish the core workout I'm sure I'm taller and longer in the spine.
When I complete the lower body workout my butt feels higher and tighter.
And when the upper body workout spits me out on the other side I feel my chest, arms and shoulders ""singing"" and getting stronger.

To give you a sense of who is writing this review I'll include the following about myself...52 yr old female, have been doing some combination of cardio and strength for 30+ years, yoga about 15.
(in my mid twenties weighing 127 @5'7"", I was a 'gym rat...5-6 days/wk "" with a personal best of 135# bench press, and 2-3 days/week of 35-55 mile bicycle rides.)
I'm still in shape, though not as strong as I once was, the scale now reads 132, and I workout 4-6 days/week and have a job that can be physically demanding.

Life has changed a bit and I haven't worked out in a gym in many years, ...I've been using DVDs, books etc as  the basis of my workouts. I have a large collection of workout DVDs that are in ""rotation"" including Jillian Michaels, Jackie Warner, Jari Love, Bob Harper, XTrain and others, as well as ballet and pilates inspired DVDs, Brooke Stiller, Kari Anderson,Kathy Smith, exhale, Tracy Effinger... they are all good, and I benefit from all of them, and enjoy them all.
However....
When I had completed Leah's workouts and the workouts were done with me,I knew these would give my body the shape and the edge I've been striving for.
With these DVDs there is no need to search for another workout....I'll keep using the rest,but for me,Leah's are the best.

April 24, 2012
It's been well over a month that I've been using these videos. And I wanted to add these results and realizations to my orginal review. First, on the physical and ""vain"". My butt is higher, rounder and tighter. My abs are tighter, stronger and YES!!!! getting ripped!!!!! My upper body hasn't looked this good in MANY years...maybe I'll be looking as good as I did at my ""peak"" 25 years ago...my shoulders and biceps are lean and muscular, my triceps and inner arms are firmer, longer and more defined than they've been in more years than I care to admit.
BUT(T) there is a whole aspect to all of these workouts that had alluded me and my fitness efforts for quite some time...I am stronger. And I don't mean how many pounds of weight I can curl or lift. These workouts have made me more functionally fit and strong.  As I stated above my job can be physically demanding, not just for a woman, but for a man as well. These workouts have given me functional strength and length and presence to do things on the job I've not done previously. I am now a bodyweight workout/BalletBody workout convert.
A few other oberservations to add. My posture is better, yesterday while twisting, I put my hand on my waist and was amazed to feel the core muscles moving and working for me (And YES!!!! I could FEEL those MUSCLES under my hand!!!!)
As for the workouts body weight movements as Leah ""teaches"" in these workouts are terrfic because you progress with your body and your ability... for the most part it's not the size of the weights you own that make a difference, it's your fortitude, awareness and ""courage"" to go beyond your expectations and your range of motion.
I'd also like to add these are ""intelligent"" workouts in that though there is no ""typical"" warmup ...Leah starts you right out in the ""workout"" you do warmup and your heart right does increase. She does incorporate flexibility, and mine has improved considerably in this short period of time. And finally there is a sense of grounding and serenity that I find when I've completed the workout that is similar to the serenity of a yoga session.
I've checked out her website and will be subscribing to her downloads...and waiting, for, what  I hope will be a  4th DVD on flexibility and range of motion.
Can you tell I'm hooked?

August 10,2012.
As I closed my first review I commented on how eager I was to see how I'd look this summer. Well, I'm here to tell you. I have lost a ""whopping"" 4 pounds, down to 128. It's not the weight lost that tells anyone anything...it's the following realities. People are suddenly noticing I've lost weight (funny they didn't notice the 17 pounds that came off prior). My legs look amazing, my torso loooks amazing, I have rips and cuts I didn't think I'd ever see. Men in their 30s (I am 52) are going on about how fantastic I look (and wondering if I'd like to have dinner). My legs  in heels have seriously never looked better, men have pointed them out to their friends as they walk or drive by.
These workouts out...if you do them.
AS for the upper body, my shoulders, triceps and biceps are leaner and meaner looking than ever. And stronger. Don't doubt your biceps are being worked...push yourself with good form and you'll feel it, and see it. Don't be fooled into thinking ""full body"" or body weight workouts don't work biceps...they do.
How good are these workouts? Good enough that Im stronger than I have ever been (in a very functional way). How good are they? I haven't gotten so many compliments since my mid 20's. How good are they? I'm stronger than ever....These workouts will give you the body you want...The body you want to commit to, and work for with intention. Never in my life did I dream I would look as good(or better) and be stronger in my 50s than in my 20s. It is possible. Can't wait to see what is waiting for me as I get stronger and more flexible.",1331251200,75,6446,4.491467576791809
5015034,5,B006RXBPXU,"I had never done any of Leah Sarago's workouts before getting the three Signature Series DVDs.  I had heard such raves about her downloads and these DVDs on the Video Fitness forum, though, that I decided to give them a try.  Although I have done similar workouts in the past, I had been worried before ordering these that the Ballet Body workouts would be too advanced for a Ballet Body newbie like me.  While each of the three workouts is definitely challenging, they are fun and tough -- and I'm excited to start seeing the changes that they'll make.

This workout begins with about 25 minutes of mat/plank work, followed by 20 minutes of weighted arm work; it concludes with a wonderful five-minute stretch that really gets into all the tight spaces. It's the only one of the three workouts that requires lighter (two- to five-pound) weights.  I usually use 10- or 12-pound dumbbells for weighted arm work, but I used 2-pound weights for this, and my arms were shaking the entire time. For the weighted portion, she includes many unique moves that really seem to work all areas of not only your arms, but also your back and chest.  There is a definite emphasis on the shoulders and triceps, but I feel like my entire upper body was thoroughly worked.  Before doing this workout, my favorite upper body barre workout was the arms portion of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tracey-Mallett-s-The-Booty-Barre-Plus-Abs-Arms/dp/B004V6F94Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tracey Mallett's The Booty Barre Plus Abs & Arms</a>, but I really like this one better and love the rhythmic, graceful movements that Leah uses.

Of the three DVDs, this one was definitely the hardest for me since I struggle with planks and don't have the upper body strength to really hold myself up.  I had to modify a lot of the moves by doing them on my knees or taking breaks. I'm hoping that by doing this DVD twice a week, I can build up more of my upper body strength.

Since I struggle with tendonitis in my right shoulder and have bad posture, I'm always a bit hesitant to try a new workout program for fear that it will aggravate those problem areas.  I can tell, though, that Leah's emphasis on posture and form will make my shoulders stronger and my posture better.

If your wrists bother you with plank work, you might find them to be a bit sore or tight afterwards, but Leah changes things up enough to keep the wrists limber and she also did a nice wrist stretch, so my wrists aren't too sore.  (If you've ever done Tracy Anderson's Hipcentric workout, this is nowhere near as hard on your wrists; I had to stop doing Hipcentric after 47 days since my wrists and low back were bothering me so much.)

On her website, Leah also has posted various rotations for using the DVDs. (I would include the link here, but usually Amazon won't allow you to include links in reviews; if you look at the product description above, though, you'll see it.)  She suggests you follow each rotation for four weeks, before moving on to the next level.

Here is a basic rundown of some of the rotations:

BEGINNER/INTERMEDIATE:
Day 1 Lower Body
Day 2 Cardio for 30-40 mins.
Day 3 Core
Day 4 Cardio for 30-40 mins.
Day 5 Upper Body
Day 6 Cardio for 30-40 mins.
Day 7 Rest day

INTERMEDIATE:
Day 1 Lower Body
Day 2 Core + Cardio for 30-45 mins.
Day 3 Upper Body + Cardio for 30-45 mins.
Day 4 Rest day
Day 5 Lower Body
Day 6 Core + Cardio for 30-45 mins.
Day 7 Upper Body

ADVANCED:
Day 1 Lower Body + Cardio for 30 mins.
Day 2 Core + Upper Body
Day 3 Lower Body + Cardio for 30 mins.
Day 4 Rest day
Day 5 Core + Upper Body
Day 6 Lower Body + Cardio for 30 mins.
Day 7 Core + Upper Body

For cardio, Leah suggests that you do things like dance workouts, cycling, or swimming -- activities that won't ""bulk"" you up.

I'm just starting a six- or eight-week rotation using these, so I'll be sure to update my reviews of each DVD as I continue with this program.

Overall, though, each workout is very unique, and I'll post back on changes I notice.

UPDATE AFTER THREE WEEKS:  I did the Intermediate rotation using all three DVDs for three weeks (after which time I had to stop working out for a few weeks due to some stitches), and loved the results I was getting!  My abs and arms were noticeably tighter, and I could see more muscle definition.  My legs seemed to lag behind a bit, and I felt like my saddlebags were a little more prominent, but perhaps that is because I needed to add in a bit more cardio. These are great workouts, and I look forward to starting back up with them!  The next time, I will take measurements to track my results better.

UPDATE ON 5/27/12:  I still love this workout, but had thought it was odd that there were no exercises in it for the biceps.  I just came across a post on Leah's blog from 4/9/12 where she explains why.  According to Leah, ""if your goal is sleek and feminine arms (which is my assumption if you are purchasing something called 'Ballet Body'), then repetitive concentric bicep curls is exactly what you should NOT be doing - my workouts are designed to strengthen the biceps through isometrics and stability.  If, however, your goal is bicep-specific strength and/or increased muscle girth (size) of the upper arm, then bicep curls should be included in your training regimen (but again, this is 'Ballet Body', not 'Leah's Hour of He-Man Arms').""

She goes on to say that everyday tasks, such as carrying bags of groceries, doing laundry, picking up children, etc., should be all you need to shape the biceps, and that all the planks and triceps dips in this DVD will thoroughly work the arms.

Anyway, her blog post helped me understand why there are no biceps exercises on this DVD, and I thought it might help others, too.  :-)",1330560000,84,5785,4.5780795344325895
5015035,5,B006RXBPXU,"Leah is the plank queen. I always find myself struggling with her upper body downloads, and it's always a nice challenge. For her Signature Series DVD she hand-picked an amazing series of moves that leave me shaking and cursing at my TV. As hard as it is right now I don't dread it at all, and that's the best part. I look forward to my hour with Leah every day. In about 10 days following her suggested intermediate rotation I've lost 1/4"" in my arms and about that much around my torso.

Of all three DVDs this one has the best music. I like the selection for the other two, but this one seems to be more ""in tune"" with the moves.",1328140800,5,632,4.180327868852459
5015036,5,B006RXBPXU,"I am a subscriber to Ballet Body downloads since June 2010. I have all of Ballet Body downloads and the Periodization System. I love everything Leah Sarago has put out and I have been anxiously waiting for the Ballet Body Signature Series to be released. The wait was worth it!

Ballet Body Signature Series Upper Body dvd works your upper body with various intensity, angles, and exercises. The first part of the workout is on the mat. Leah utilizes planks to target your back, shoulders, delts, chest, biceps and triceps. Your upper body will be worked to a point of failure with various holds and pulses. The next part of the workout is using 3lbs weights. Again, Leah has you doing different arm exercises using the weights. 3lbs weights doesn't seem like a lot of weight, but your arms will be worked to a point that they are burning and fatiguing with every lift, extension, hold, and pulse. Leah completes the workout with specific stretches to release any tension that has built in your upper body. Afterwards, you will feel amazing!

Get this dvd...you won't be disappointed",1327881600,4,1083,4.786096256684492
5015037,5,B006RXBPXU,"This DVD is truly one-of-a-kind.  I absolutely LOVE this DVD.  I love the intensity, the sequencing of the exercises, but most of all I love how I feel when I am done.  After doing this DVD just one time, my shoulders and chest felt stretched and my posture was improved.  This DVD is not for the faint of heart.  The endless plank and pushup variations are super challenging!  But it is so rewarding to feel yourself get stronger and make improvements each time you do the DVD.  Leah's upper body matwork makes you feel like a warrior.

After the pushup/plank series, the workout moves to upper body weight work, which is wonderfully choreographed.  You definitely feel the burn, but I also felt elongated and stretched when done.  I don't know how she does this!  The upper body stretch at the end is particularly wonderful.

I can't say enough how much I love this DVD and how great I feel when I'm done.  Strong, but graceful.  well-worked, but relaxed.  I can't imagine how you could NOT see results if you are consistent with this DVD!",1327881600,4,1041,4.581521739130435
5015038,5,B006RXBPXU,"Note: I am not a waify person. I do not need to lose 10-20 lbs, so doing anything would make me look good. I am really picky in my workouts, and I demand the very best for the little time that I have it.

So therefore when I say: these are the bestest things in the face of the planet - I am not lying. I lost almost 100 lbs using Leah Sarago's Ballet Body downloads - just type in Leah Sarago Ballet Body in google and you'll be able to sign up for her weekly downloads - and I've been waiting for these dvds for months. And now they are here and they are fantastic.

Leah works your body incredibly crazy hard. You will build strength almost instantly (the first week, you are like whoa - can I really do this? second week, you're amazed that you can hold that plank, third week, look at me, I'm balancing and so forth). These are perfectly sequenced in their flow, so you get your heart rate up, your breath going and a hard work out.

20 minutes of planks in every possible position. [side, front, downward dog style, and reverse], hitting your triceps, delts, lats, and shoulders]. Then a stretch. then get up and do weight work, once again hitting every single muscle in your upper body. When you are done, you are worked, and tingly all over, and you just want to do it again.

It moves quickly(45 minutes FLIES by) and Leah has expert, crystal clear instructions. If you are a beginner - you can do this, if you are really, really [50+ heavy] you can do this, if you are advanced - you can do this, because Leah has modifications for everyone and she will kick your butt.

Most ""barre""/""ballet"" people say they can give you a dancer's body.

5015039,5,B006RXBPXU,"Leah's work is just phenomenal!!  Lots of ballet inspired workouts gloss over the upper body with some light work and if you are lucky, some push ups and planks.  This workout has it all!!  Plank work, weight work.  All of it looking seemingly innocent until you actually get into it.  I promise, you will feel a profound openness in your chest and shoulders when you are done.  Her work is tough, (especially the plank work, you might need breaks in the beginning) I won't kid you about that but it is super effective and in useful in creating better body mechanics.  Some upper body workouts cause you to be tighter and stiffer but not this work.  To boot, you will not get a bulky upper body but clean, lean lines.  Thankfully she has downloads or I'd be impatiently waiting for her next release.",1327708800,5,799,4.531468531468532
5015040,5,B006RXBPXU,This is a really good workout.  The first 20 minutes are various plank variations with straight and bent arms. The exercises also work the core heavily.  The second part is upper body weight work which really burns!  The music is motivating and upbeat and she changes up the exercises so it doesn't get boring.,1327104000,6,310,4.703703703703703

5015042,5,B006RXBPXU,"Amazing. . . well thought out. . . fantastic instruction. I purchased this in hopes of finding some type of routine to help align my back/hips and help with my neck and back pain.  I know it is not intended too or nor does it claim to help with back pain but I have finally found the answer with this.  I purchased the Lower Body and Core workouts.  All are excellent!  My back and neck feel stronger, after having gone through therapy both times with pregnancies I still struggled with pain, but this helps realign my back and hips and the pain is gone!!!!!  Thank you, thank you, thank you!",1452470400,2,592,4.345454545454546
5015043,4,B006RXBPXU,"Oh my goodness, the first 20 minutes are just different variations of planks and they are KILLER.  The 15 minutes of weights afterwards is a relief.

5015044,5,B006RXBPXU,"Intrigued with long library waiting list for this Leah Sarago DVD, I tried it and was surprised when my triceps felt 'steelier' in the first few days after, because I enjoy a Karen Voight DVD for upper body strength (which I MUST work since a shoulder injury from a decade-old auto accident). Then I saw results in just under two weeks, and had to buy. Yay (!) Amazon - my Thurs. order arrived Mon, when I returned library copy. The first chapter plank work REALLY challenges, as a lot of core strength is required to support  - but the other chapters' dance forms are pleasant, and perseverance pays off with more ease and graceful movement (I practice using soft wristband weights) to sculpt leaner arm muscles. I started eating more Greek yogurt for the calcium, but shoulder straps and clothing layers stay in place on stronger frame and posture.",1443225600,,850,4.704697986577181

I love the combination of graceful ballet movements with pilates and yoga as well. The first 2o mins or so is spent working without weights on the floor. Then a nice stretch in between the second part which uses small weights for another 20 mins. The final stretching feels so good and reaches all the right places.

She DOES acknowledge this, but maybe certain sequences could have been mixed up better to avoid that, I think.  I will keep the dvd because there are tons of cool, new and challenging exercises that are different from anything I have done, and I really appreciate that!!! Many  exercises in the video are more graceful than traditional gym or exercise class exercises which is fun to explore for me, the music matches what she is doing, the set is nice, and the workout is challenging.

5015051,4,B006RXBPXU,"I have had this DVD for a couple of years, and after falling off the fitness wagon for quite awhile, I am making strides in getting back into shape. As I'm sure many women do, I have poor upper body strength. My fitness goal is always focused on leaning out my arms and getting more definition, which is so difficult to achieve (I haven't succeeded quite yet). This workout is NO JOKE. Many (most?) of the mat work/plank work is almost impossible for me. It involves a lot of supporting your own body weight, and a ton of coordination and balance. However, Leah does offer suggestions to modify most of the moves which I definitely took advantage of. My favorite part is the free weights portion at the end of the video. The moves are small and controlled, and really do exhaust your arms. I have no doubts if you did this regularly, you would be well on your way to sculpted arms. Overall breakdown:

PROS:
- Very difficult; would be good for an ""advanced"" exerciser who craves challenge
- Visually pleasing
- Cueing is straightforward and not annoying
- Low-impact

CONS:
- Leah is not a perky or even a motivating instructor (Brooke Burke) or ruthless (Jillian Michaels) -- they are my favorite gals to ""work out"" with. If you -need motivation or a push to keep you going through a 45 minute workout, this is not the DVD for you. Leah ""assumes"" you're doing the work and doesn't put a lot of personality into her cueing.
- Voice-over instruction/cueing. I strongly prefer live cueing. I think that's one of the things that causes me to not reach for this DVD that often. Not only does she not live cue, but Leah also doesn't look at the camera (at all!) which makes it very impersonal feeling. I really like workouts where the instructor is WITH you and talking TO you.
- Not ideal for beginners--which is not a con per se, but this workout is not for people who are really overweight, don't have good coordination/balance and can't put their entire body weight on their arms/shoulders/wrists.
- Hurts wrists. Although Leah does say that wrists will strengthen over time, this workout will strain them for sure.

This work out kicked my butt, the moves she does are ones I have never seen or done before and you're working hard throughout the entire video.

The music is upbeat and her direction is perfect. Its a voice over, so when you watch her she is not talking but you hear a voice provide direction in-sync with the moves she does. I would classify this as a strength training class that moves so quickly you also get some good cardio in.

Granted I was not able to keep up the entire time. You will also need to have had some form of exercise before; do not attempt the routine completely nor all if you have just started.

5015061,5,B006RXBPXU,"I am a fitness fanatic and was so happy to find this DVD.  I find it difficult to find good upper body only based workouts.  I run 5 days a week and often don't want workouts with leg and arm combo strength training so I often reach for this as an upper body+ core workout.  There is a lot of plank work- almost 25 minutes of mat + planks but it makes me feel so limber and stretched out afterwards.  The light weight work after is about 15 minutes and I can really feel the burn after completing the mat series.  Sometimes I just do the weighted portion.  it does take a few times to build up strength in the wrists but stick with it- the results will come and you will get beautiful lightly defined arms, shoulders and back.",1402876800,,726,4.15
5015062,4,B006RXBPXU,"I just started taking a weekly barre class at the local gym and although I love it the upper body portion was lacking.  Even a total body sculpt didn't do the trick and pilates only focused on my core.  Well, this DVD makes up for the difference and more!  I've been doing Jessica Smith's Better Body Blast and her online upper body workouts and felt like I was starting to bulk so I was looking for something that would slim my arms down and not make me look like a Hulk.

This DVD is VERY challenging.  I have no problems with planks (and boy, Leah is a plank devotee!) but I was not used to staying in various plank positions for as long as she has you do in the video.  My shoulders were literally burning.  It's great that the core is getting a good workout along with the arms but I admit I can't complete the entire mat portion yet without collapsing and swearing at the TV.  The weighted section was slightly easier but still not a walk in the park.  My 10 and 5 pounds weights went out the window and I had to reduce to a humble 3 pounds.

My main issue was the lack of bicep work.  I understand Leah's reasoning that doing curls would go against creating sleeker arms but also feel that the biceps need to balance out the extreme tricep work to some extent.  It's possible that I haven't done the DVD long enough to not see results in the biceps due to the isometric moves but I had hoped for something that focused on them a little bit more.

I also was a bit turned off by the voice over.  It doesn't bother me, I'm just used to Jessica Smith's bubbly personality while she works out with you and this felt distant.  However, I find the time flies by and that the unique moves are worth the time and effort.  It's hard to find something that focuses entirely on your upper body (the core is an added bonus!) and this does the trick.  Hopefully this will banish the bat wings for good (my arms love to hang onto flab)!  :)",1400630400,,1933,4.206521739130435

Since my arms are my trouble area, (and who doesnt want looooong, lean beautiful arms that don't flap when you say bye?) I knew I needed to get this video. I got it on Christmas along with other videos and finally decided to try it for the first time last night. They were right this video is absolutely tough. It is my first time venturing into the ballet territory, so this exercises were very new to me, even the stretches, I had to really pay attention. I am a fan of Jillian Michaels videos, T25, pilates, but i feel like all those videos don't give the arms/shoulders the attention they need. This morning I woke up sore, which is a great feeling, hopefully with more practice this will become easier and I won't dread doing it. This video is very deceiving, it looks easy but when you try the exercises it burns and you feel like your arms are melting.

5015065,5,B006RXBPXU,"I'm on a ballet/barre kick these days.  My usual routines were training and intense cardio.  I've done Beachbody's P90X, X2 and X3, as well as Insanity and Asylum.  I have all of Cathe Friedrich's workouts.  In an effort to mix things, up I decided to try ballet/barre workouts.  I have been disappointed in the upper body routines for most barre workouts.

This is one tough workout!  As I started, I thought that 2 - 5 pound weights would be too easy.  Boy was I wrong! A few minutes into the workout, I was switching to my teeny tiny 1 pound weights and my arms still burned!

Why I love this workout:

* It burns!  My arm muscles were screaming right from the start.  To me, that means my muscles were really being worked.

* The focus on the core.  I'll admit it, I don't like doing planks and pushups and the like, but they do great things for my upper body, especially for my core.  To take some of the pressure off my wrists, I place my hands on hexagonal dumbbells while in plank etc.

* The workout flow.  I love that the planks and push ups are at the beginning of the workout.  I am much stronger at the beginning of a workout.  When planks etc. are at the end, I can't do as many since my arms are already fatigued from prior exercises.

* The feel of the workout.  With just Leah instructing, I feel like I am having a private lesson with Leah.  It really keeps me focused.

* The minimal equipment needed.  All you need are 2-5 pound weights and a mat.

Some things to note about this workout.  I don't consider them to be negatives since I enjoyed this workout so much.  The things:

* The set is an empty, plain ballet studio.  To me, it looks like it was filmed in a YMCA room.  I didn't mind this since this meant no distractions from the workout.

* It's just Leah working out and instructing with a voice over.  It's intense, but somewhat low key.  This wouldn't be the workout I would choose on a day that I was feeling tired or low on energy.  On those days I need a more lively instructor like Tanya Becker of Physique 57.

* Your triceps, shoulders and core are mainly worked.  I didn't feel that my back or biceps were worked at all.  I realize that a workout can't be all things to all people, so I plan to use other workouts to hit those muscle groups.

5015071,2,B006RXBPXU,"This workout is so hard. I am not super out of shape or anything, I run and do Pilates 4-6 days a week, and I'm not overweight, but there were so many exercises and sequences that I could not get through and that were so hard that I never came to enjoy the video. And I really enjoy exercising generally, even when it's hard.

I guess it just has to be the right level of difficulty so as to not be completely discouraging. And I like to feel that I can still follow along with the flow of the video by modifying the exercise, but with this video there weren't modification options on a lot of the exercises that I felt were super difficult (it was just recommended to go back to a simple plank, which isn't much fun). Overall it's very ""plank"" based, which can be less than enjoyable in excess I think.

I kept trying for about 9 months, with some months where I did this Upper Body workout two times a week (and her other videos each two times a week) and then there were some months were I fell out of it a little bit, because it was so hard I had trouble motivating myself to do it. So I'm sure if I'd been able to be more consistent, eventually I would have been able to do the workout, but it was too frustrating along the way for me. I thought this workout should be named ""Insanity- Ballet Edition,"" just like the ""Insanity"" workout you always see on TV, because I felt like it was 'insanity' for me to be expected to be able to do these exercises.

I'm sure the difficulty level would be good for other people who are either really in shape (I'm sure it's hard to find a video challenging enough for people who are super fit, so this would be perfect for them), or for people who like their workouts to be really tough. I have come to realize that I want to enjoy my workouts more, and not dread them; I don't want to have to force myself to do them, so I am going back to Pilates. I realized that the Ballet-based exercise world is not for me.

But again, this is just my personal preference, I can totally see how this would be perfect for other people. But I found it so hard as to be frustrating and not enjoyable, so I want other people who are at my level of fitness or below, and who have similar preferences to be aware of the difficulty level.",1381708800,12,2261,4.155251141552512

I have been doing strength training for several years (Chalean Extreme) but wanted a longer, leaner, more feminine look because I was becoming a bit too muscular in my opinion. I didn't order the total body workout because I like to do cardio 3 days a week and alternate with strength training for 3 days so I like it to be a good 45 min workout. These are perfect. They are extremely challenging but in a good way. I have to modify some of the exercises to be able to get through it. Toward the end of the workout I have to put down my weights and just go through the motions with just my body resistance and that is still effective (for now). I wake up sore for the next two days afterward! Eventually I will be able to keep the weights for the whole routine and as that gets easier (IF it does) I can go up in weight- I like that will not ""outgrow"" this workout quickly, if ever.
The voice over might bother some people and since music is very much a matter of personal taste not everyone is going to love any music that is playing but its not an issue for me because I am too focused on the intense burning in my muscles!

5015085,5,B006RXBPXU,"I bought the entire Ballet Body 3-DVD series.  For me, the Upper Body workout was the most intense of the three.  Admittedly, I am not real strong in my upper body, but I was surprised how much I was sweating and shaking to get through the first half of the upper body workout which consists of bodyweight-only movements.  The second half uses light weights but this too felt tough and super effective, especially since your muscles are pre-fatigued from the floor work.  I don't see how regular use of Ultra Sleek Definition cannot produce great arms.  However, I have to spread out my use of Leah Sarago's upper body signature workout among my other barre workouts since it is very hard on the wrists.  If you have chronic wrist problems, this might not be the workout for you.

The production quality is simple but lovely.  Leah is in a lovely ballet studio with violet lighting creating a unique look.  Leah also carefully chose special music, which is a relief next to the mass producers who usually use generic, elevator sounding music.  There are no background exercisers and Leah does voiceover rather than live cueing.",1360195200,2,1127,4.762886597938144

I am always sore after I do this workout and find that because it is a lot of plank work, if I have my core engaged, I get an ab work out as well. I know some people have complained about wrist pain, but I haven't found this to be an issue. As someone who has completed p90x using 20+lb weights for upper body work, it is humbling to find yourself almost needing a break using 3lb weights, but it burns in such a good way!

I do like the emphasis on shoulder stability, however, as I could see I needed some more work I this area. Buyer beware, however, if you aren't use to barre or Pilates type workouts, ease into this series with other DVDs (Ive done Physique 57 for over a year, Pure Barre, Tracey Mallett, Core Fusion (great for beginners), etc.) Overall, I'll have to give it another try but first impressions weren't terrific.",1356912000,14,730,4.488721804511278

5015092,5,B006RXBPXU,"Leah Sargo's Ballet Body Signature Series is tough. I thought it would be easy since I have 6 years experience of dance in the style of ballet, jazz, and modern. However, it has been a few years since I danced with a group. I chose this series to help me get my dancer's body back. I wanted the long lean muscles that dancing and ballet give you.
I own all three DVDs from her series. I thought the lower body workout would the easiest for me since I have strong legs and the core workout would be the hardest since I'm weak there. NO. They are all challenging, in a good way. Actually, the core workout turned out to be the easiest and most enjoyable DVD.

I love that she has 3 DVDs as it makes it easier to stay with the program. Even though I've done them all quite a few times, they're long enough and spread out enough throughout the week that I forget what's coming next. So I don't get board as easily with these DVDs.

As for the upper body workout, wow. I had no idea it would be so challenging to me. I'm used to using weights to build arm strength but I mostly suck at plank, which she does for the first half of the DVD. With enough repetition of the DVD, I have built up some arm strength and can hold plank a little longer than before. My wrists still get sore but not nearly as bad as they did the first time I used this DVD. I have not made it all the way through the program(the 4 week schedule she provides you on her website) as I struggle with staying with the schedule. I have finished all the DVDs and enjoyed each one.

Leah suggests you do cardio on the off days, but not cardio that would build muscle like kickboxing DVDs and the like, as they can reverse the effects of her elongation techniques and exercises. Instead she suggests running, swimming or dancing. Well, I used to run in our old neighborhood but since we've moved I haven't felt safe enough to run outside again. Our apartment doesn't have a swimming pool and I don't care for swimming so that was not an option. The final option is dancing, which I love and have experience with. However, I struggled to dance on my own for a long enough period of time. (I don't like traveling to exercise) So I bought an xbox 360 kinect and the Zumba rush game to help me add more cardio to my routine. It worked! It is so much fun and so exhausting at the same time! Now cardio doesn't feel like a hassle but a fun game.

Overall, I'm working hard to be more consistent with the DVDs. So far, I love them and they always leave my muscles burning in a good way. I'll try to remember to post later after I've followed the program more consitantly and I begin to see major changes. I have seen minor ones like my wrists getting stronger and my abs and legs feeling tighter.

5015098,5,B006RXBPXU,"I have been using Leah Sarago's Ballet Body method workouts (via download from her website and now on DVD) for a couple of years.  Without a doubt, this has been the best program I have ever done for creating a lean physique.  I am particularly fond of her upper body workouts, which are a blend of unique plank and side plank variations and yoga-ish moves, along with light weight work for the upper body.  I do a lot of DVD workouts, and there is really nothing quite like Leah Sarago.  She is a certified instructor with a degree in exercise science, so she really knows her stuff.  The Upper Body DVD begins with about 25 minutes of mat work, alternating between forearm and extended arm plank work, side planks with forearm and extended arms, and tricep work along with some backbend/reverse plank/tabletop work, with lots of unique variations to add difficulty, balance challenges, and interest to the work.  After a short stretch, there is about 20 minutes of work with light weights that strengthen and elongate the arms, followed by additional stretching at the end of the workout.  I would advise for those new to Leah or this type of work in general, to start by doing one mat segment and one weight segment at a time and adding a segment once you are strong enough not to need breaks.  This DVD is quite challenging.  Leah offers modifications regularly, but the workout is still difficult even if you do not do the advanced variations demonstrated.  The DVD is not chaptered on the menu, but it is easy to use the skip button to move from segment to segment.  At the end of each mat segment she takes a short break in child's pose, so if you are just starting out, that is a good stopping point.

This upper body one one is the most difficult of all three in my opinion, or I guess I wasn't as strong as I thought! By sticking to it using the modifications, I am amazing myself at how quickly I'm building strength, as I was thinking I'd never come close to executing these difficult exercises. I realize now how important her coaching is which teaches you how to develop the strength, and I glean a new understanding of what she saying with every session. Focus is paramount as it is with the other 2 DVDs. I'm soaked by the end of the workout from the sheer exertion of it. Make sure to modify at first and to keep your weight out of the shoulder as she says or risk injury. This series is blowing me away.",1334448000,,787,4.218543046357616
8503664,5,B006RXBPXU,"Hard and challenging.  Has been difficult to do, but has alternative moves to work up to more challenging moves",1514937600,,111,4.842105263157895
8503665,5,B006RXBPXU,"A great workout! I am intermediate/advanced and this is such a different workout! I do Jillian Michaels, Bob Harper, run and other challenging exercises. I am always afraid trying new workouts for fear of being too easy. This workout starts with floor exercises all body weight.  Your arms will be shaking. Then for the second portion you move on to standing work with weights. I thought I could go heavier but was mistaken. I used 3's & 5's. She recommends 2-5 lbs you won't be able to use more. Your arms will be shaking!",1509235200,,523,4.5638297872340425
8503666,5,B006RXBPXU,Holy macaroni - tough stuff.  Ive recently switched from CrossFit to lower impact workouts.  Dont let the lightweights fool you.  You will feel the burn.,1509235200,,153,5.04
8503667,4,B006RXBPXU,Wow- great workout.  Very different and challenging from everything else I've ever done.,1489276800,,88,5.769230769230769
8503668,4,B006RXBPXU,"This is a good varied workout focusing on arms, shoulders and some abs too. Variations are some kind of innovative and reps and sets never get to bore you. Despite her lovely voice, I find Leah's workounts a bit robotic and music does not convince me, but I would not take stars off because of my taste. I do not follow her periodization, but I workout 14-16h a week on ballet, barre and toning and I am happy to keep this workout as regular complement of my arms routine.",1482105600,,472,4.314606741573034
8503669,5,B006RXBPXU,Great workout. REALLY challenging so go into it slowly. WORK into it slowly. It's not a marathon and form is everything. I have had this DVD for a while (at least 2 years). Wasn't able to adequately get through it till now. I built up strength to be able to do 30 + minutes in good form. I started with 10 min segments.  #Challenging but worth every bit of effort for me to do this-- and I am still working at it!,1479686400,,413,4.036585365853658
8503670,4,B006RXBPXU,"The video instructional is out dated. But, I modified some points in video.  Overall.  Great work out.",1478736000,,102,4.9411764705882355
8503671,5,B006RXBPXU,"I love the Ballet Body series videos. I am not a barre beginner and this is a good video for all levels. I was worried about getting something too easy or not challenging, and I was happily surprised by the contents, format and routine.",1475107200,,236,4.386363636363637
8503672,5,B006RXBPXU,"I love this Upper Body workout. It is about 45 minutes. The exercises are difficult but doable. Tiny movements that really work the arm muscles and good old fashioned push-ups with a new twist, make this the best of Sarago's Ballet Body DVD set.  Nice set, pink color scheme and terrific music make this really enjoyable. She also uses voice over, which I really appreciate.",1471910400,,374,4.753846153846154
