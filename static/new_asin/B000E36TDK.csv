2485144,5,B000E36TDK,I own dozens of bellydance dvd's and this is by far my favourite. It has so much talent and so many really unusual dances ..it's just amazing value. It would really encourage a dancer to forget all the traditional rules of bellydance and be creative and get out there and do something different. It's so artistic and the entertainment value alone is excellent not to mention costumes that are out of this world. I recommend you all to go out and buy this one.,1144195200,8,459,4.476190476190476
2485145,5,B000E36TDK,"If you want something out of the norm this is it! This is one hypnotic piece! Fighting gypsies, snake women, gargoyles, Isis...if you love fantasy and magic look no further!!",1143676800,13,174,4.833333333333333
2485146,3,B000E36TDK,"This video would have a much higher rating was it not ruined in many places by over zealous editors and camera operators who seem to have a very poor idea of how to define gothic bellydance.  Tribal fusion could be in itself, essentially gothic.  This is where the main problem with the video lies... Because tribal fusion is already something that can fit easily under the gothic banner, the video's producers/editors felt they needed to add a bunch of extra junk to make the dances appear apart from typical tribal fusion.  This means that many of the perfectly fine dances are marred by effects and stock photography imagery added after the fact.  Cheap looking images of broken windows, statues, scary trees and what not take away from the beauty of the dances and look like a horrible attempt by a non-goth to define goth.  Sometimes parts of the dancer are even covered up by huge images of statues stuck over them.  They also seem to think that hardly casting any light on the dancers would add to the gothic effect...  well, yes and no, blackness does not necessarily gothic make... It just makes it harder to see the dancers' movements, which is why you are watching the video!  Less (and I don't mean less light) would be so much more in this case.  And worst of all, they felt they needed to make some of the dances into music videos... yikes!  Imagine swirly black paint all over faces, bondage gear, candles, knives, flashes of brass knuckles (what?!!! brass knuckles are gothic?), pieces of bad poetry flashing across the screen, girls running through deserted skyscrapers, and the list goes on.  I thought I was supposed to be watching a showcase of bellydance, not bad music videos.

People complaining that the dances are bad, that they are not really bellydance or that they are weird/gross, or that the dancers themselves are not usually gothic are going a bit overboard.  Remember that tribal fusion is experimental and draws elements from all over.  So why does it surprise some people that they made a dance that mimics a knife fight or one that begins as the dancer inside a body sock imitating a worm/serpent?  I actually think the knife fight dance is pretty interesting, but if I was devoid of humor or had higher expectations of this video, I might take offense at some of the other dances like the ones that have elements of self harm and suicide in them.  In that respect, this video does nothing to add to the gothic image but rather just supports cliches and popular myths about it.  Better editing and production would have gone a long way towards earning this video the respect the dancers in it deserve.

It is worth buying if you are willing to look beyond the bad editing and silly attempts to add gothness to the dances.  The dancers and the costumes are worth seeing, but maybe only for the lowest price you can find.  Just keep in mind that you are watching tribal fusion, not traditional bellydance, and, if you are goth, try not to be too insulted by it all.  Don't stop after the first few dances either.  Sadly, the opening dances are some of the least interesting and most marred with excess junk.  There are plenty of dances on here that they left largely alone which deserve an audience.  Lots of the dances are to Solace (an artist who makes dark sounding middle eastern influenced music) stuck in with some more ethereal goth type music and other stuff.",1250812800,6,3401,4.648829431438127
2485147,3,B000E36TDK,"I find that when this DVD came out a lot of Tribal Belly Dance fans and teachers went haywire to practice the moves they saw on this DVD, and incorporate it into their choreography (at least in South Florida).  I watched the DVD and it is great for viewing purposes.  It is great that a new fusion of Belly Dance has come out.  It just shows that the dance is expanding and ever growing.  This DVD is great to refer to and to teach yourself while watching it.  Namaste.",1239840000,,469,4.224719101123595

2485149,1,B000E36TDK,"I am bummed, and honestly offended at this video. I am no prude. But the knife scene....ugh... What's next actual animal or human sacrifces??

I really like Jehan, and her other 2 DVD's, The Temple of Jehan, and Sacred Bellydance, but this was too much. The Lesbian S& M scene? Porno or Bellydance.....mmmmm, gonna go with Porno. Hey if that's what you're into, it's your business, but I'm bummed this is listed under Bellydance DVD.....It is misleading. I also love Neon's stuff usually, so i was just surprised all around. yikes! Ladies, i love you all, but what were you thinking??

The blood on the lip scene, eeewww, gross.
I have been dancing 9 years, and I have never danced with blood on my lip.

I am hoping for another Jehan video though....just not one like this!

I wish I had read reviews and spent more time researching this product because as I watch it now, I discovered that it's a cheesy celebration of the gothic pop culture insulting the art of belly dance. The effects were cheesy and the choreography took no thought nor talent; total waste of my time and money.",1206230400,11,449,4.487804878048781
2485152,2,B000E36TDK,"Darker Side of Fusion was again, like I said for Revelations, not bad but not great. There were some dances that were entertaining, and the dancers did well, but the feel of the Dvd was lacking somehow. It just didn't give off that Gothic feel and some of the music didn't flow with the scenes. I'd say, if you could, rent this instead.",1200096000,5,336,4.349206349206349
2485153,1,B000E36TDK,"This dvd has been watched once, and I am literally trying to GIVE it away it's so bad.

Neon isn't normally a tribal or gothic dancer-she is really out of her element on this one. Jehan doesn't dance in this, but does a big S&M sideshow where she is using whips, chains, exposing her buttocks, and having lesbian scenes with another woman. How is this belly dancing?????

The dance with the daggars/knives was silly...all in all I hated this dvd. I have no problem with fusion, gothic, or anything like that-but you can't put black lipstick on anyone and market it as goth. Also, just because something is goth in style, doesn't mean that it is okay for the dance routines to be subpar. The choreographies were uninteresting, and the Jehan S&M piece was absurd. (Don't view this dvd with your children around.)

VERY disappointed...",1194825600,18,832,4.724137931034483
2485154,2,B000E36TDK,"I was so excited to get this dvd.  What a let down.  The dancing, for the most part, was just not up to par.  The S&M bit involved very little dance, mostly just wondering around the ""dungeon"" caressing various items, WHATEVER!  My 2 stars go to some of the interesting costuming and concepts.",1186531200,9,293,4.471698113207547
2485155,2,B000E36TDK,"Good try but this entire video is less bellydance and more like open stage at a local goth club.  I expected quite a bit more.  It's not an instructional video, not a bellydance video, just one dancer at a time performing very slow and uninteresting routines.",1183766400,11,259,4.608695652173913
2485156,4,B000E36TDK,"I was interested in the DVD because I'm a bellydancer.  My main style is ""Egyptian cabaret"" but I have an appreciation and interest in ALL types of bellydancing.  I enjoyed this DVD.  The imagery, costumes, and the dancing were, to me, interesting and different.  I was feeling the whole ""welcome to our dark realm"" vibe.  I would have given it five stars except for that S&M piece.  Believe me, I am no prude.  However, as a bellydancer, I am constantly working on educating the public that this dance is a respectful art form, appropriate as family style entertainment.  Respectful bellydancers can perform their art at summer festivals and parades, not dark smokey rooms with a stage with a pole in the middle of it.  Shame on whoever thought the S&M piece was a great idea!  Other than that, I really, really liked it.  Too bad I couldn't give it five stars.",1182556800,7,862,4.642384105960265
2485157,5,B000E36TDK,"This intriguing collection of dances and imagery will delight anyone who likes to feast on beauty and wonder at the great mystery in dance of controlled flexibility, when a dancer has such impeccable technique that the most difficult movement is made to look easy, as in the slow melting choreography in Asharah's exquisite ""Exiled,"" the fascintaing dancing of Ariellah, who sometimes seems not to possess bones in her liquid arms, the stunning mastery of Neon's isolations, and Tempest's sumptuous ""Homage to Theda."" There are many other gorgeous dances in this DVD, among them Ya Meena and Raven's ""Shawaza,"" where they are so well coordinated that even the folds of their jewel toned blue and red costumes have a synchronized flow, and the teaming of Ariellah and Tempest in ""Ritual Means."" There is hardly a moment in ""Gothic Bellydance"" that is not visually rewarding, and though Jehan's ""Goddessence"" is my least favorite because of its theme and its minimum dance content, Jehan is a bellydance diva, not only as a dancer who is always interesting to watch, but also as musician, and some of the lovely pieces heard on this DVD are her compositions.

The production is superb, with outstanding camera work and lighting, and most of all, incredibly skillful editing, which keeps one's eye interested, but never overpowers or interferes with the dance itself. The costumes are glorious, and some with such richness and texture they look like butterfly wings or the imaginary wardrobe of Scheherazade; the fabulous ""wings"" in Ayshe's ""Kali/Isis"" are breathtaking. One has the option of seeing entire program of 20 dances in sequence under the ""Enter"" tab, or by performer in alphabetical order under the ""Visions"" tab, which includes a biography and other material on the artists. For bellydance enthusiasts who want to watch something unique, ""Gothic Bellydance"" is a treat with a touch of the edgy and odd in it.",1179446400,7,1918,5.088888888888889
2485158,1,B000E36TDK,"I was thrilled to see a style of dance that I don't have access to made available to me via DVD and went ahead and gave it a go.

While I admire all of the performers for getting in front of the camera, which takes a lot of courage for some, I couldn't help noticing that the worse the dancer, the more special effects I was bombarded with. The best dancers performed on a bare stage with a plain backdrop so that all you could focus on was them - there was no need to disguise their lack of technical skill with computer generated overlays of CHEESY headstones, iron crosses, and gothic cathedral windows, peat bogs, or swamps (Give me a break!). Other performers projected the attitude of ""Ooooh, look at me, I can do figure eights and I'm wearing a black corset!"" (So what. Take off the corset, put on a choli and attend a few dance workshops and then show me what you can do.)

Overall I came out feeling like I'd witnessed a Jr. High talent show where the ""popular"" girl and her synchphants got up and flopped and swished their way through a choreography to the latest Black Eyed Peas song that they threw together the night before over pizza and M&Ms with everyone applauding when the music stopped because it was the nice thing to do. (You know, like in ""Napoleon Dynamite"") Either that or I'd just witnessed a lot of first year Film Student's final project videos.

As a dance movement, Racks Gothique is pretty legit, and I think that with a little more effort, a better representation of could be produced than this one.",1175731200,21,1530,4.437722419928826
2485159,2,B000E36TDK,"I have been bellydancing professionally for nearly 30 years and have watched the trends come and go, so gothic bellydance doesn't really surprise me.

When I got the video, I was impressed by the production quality - they have put together a really nice product and I was anxious to take a look. After rehearsal one morning, I put it on in my studio and the troupe sat and watched it. A lot of it really drags and is not interesting. A lot of it may just not be my thing, but the other girls are into more of the edgy stuff and they were also not impressed.

We really liked Ariellah's dancing - I've known her from Rachel Brice's classes and my entertainment company has hired her for a professional winery gig, so I knew she was good, and her performance didn't disappoint. It was, however, almost the only dancing that held my attention.

I did also like the Isis Wings dance, although it was way too long. The idea was creative, the execution beautiful, but it just went on and on, so instead of being left wanting more, I hit the FastForward button.

The sado-masochistic domination stuff at the end really didn't work for me, and I wish I'd never found it. Sorry, it's not that I'm closed-minded - it's just not what I consider appropriate for a bellydance DVD.

Overall, here's what I came away with: Ariellah is a beautiful dancer, and a couple of the other performances were worth watching (it was hard to identify other dancers), but I found most of it not what I would like to see out there representing the world of bellydance, even in the tribal/fusion categories. In the realm of experimental, it was well produced but with several of us watching, all various ages, no one else would buy it, and none were interested in seeing it again.

2485160,1,B000E36TDK,"First of all I was expecting more. I am a bellydance and I've been following many of the tribal fusion movement. I have seen gothic bellydance before and liked it,  but it does not compare to what I saw on this DVD. Was not impressed. Maybe 3-4 performances I actually liked.

The dancers I believe lack a lot of technical ability in their dance and need to practice more or change teachers. There was a lot of poor posture, bad arms, bad technique and unimpressive choreography. A lot of these dances would have been stronger had they just interpreted the music better. Instead what I am left in my mind is what the heck was that girl thinking, instead of a dance with decent skills. There wasn't much bellydancing in this video. Also there was a lot of bad acting during some of these dances. It came off more goofy and I wanted to laugh. Goth is not something you act, its something you feel. I think many of these girls were orginally cabaret dancers and and making the switch over to tribal fusion and I don't think its a good fit for them. I know Neon is not trbal dancer and in my opinion it shows. I also thought there was a lack of feminity and smooth flow in moves, some where really jerky and I think it just boils down to bad technique. I noticed a bunch of the bios said they followed the Suhaila Shalimpour format or studied from someone who did and I clearly don't see it. Suhaila is a phenomenal dancer that pushes technique.

Enough with that. One word of caution if you are watching this with a child or young person, please do not watch the jehan part. There is a lot of lesbianism, dominatrix, and I really didn't need to see her thong pulled up over her pants. That part was almost adult video store. And the singing is horrible and there was no dancing besides a few seconds, but you forget about that when you see the rest of it and the bad acting. I'm sorry as a performer that was just absolute rubbish and almost insulting to the rest of us bellydancers who work so hard to promote bellydancing as something for women in a nonsexual manner.

As for the prodution of the video, I found some of the performances a little too dark, you really miss out on some of the dancers moves. And I agree with a few of the previous reviews it looks like they worked more on the editing of the video with the visual effects then on the dances. and the switching of the backgrounds was a little much and detracts from the dancer

Overall I would have given this video no stars but there was some performances that I actually like so i will give credit to some of the dancers. If you are curious then buy this video. If you are questioning purchasing I would advise against it. Spend your money else on something more worthwhile.",1172448000,24,2738,4.33984375
2485161,1,B000E36TDK,"This performance DVD left a lot to be desired for me.  Most of the performances were poorly choreographed and displayed little actual bellydancing.  They were more like odd dream sequences which consisted primarily of individuals writhing around in place. It seems that more attention was paid to the sets, props and effects than to the choreography itself.  The only saving grace was that there were a couple of actual *good* performances.  Dancers who were truly talented and had decent choreography.  I wish they had listed which dancers did which performances so I would know which dancers to follow and which to avoid in the future.",1170720000,17,637,5.0285714285714285
2485162,3,B000E36TDK,I found this to be very intresting. I don't know if I will learn anything from it. But I enjoyed watching it.,1169251200,3,109,4.0
2485163,3,B000E36TDK,"Recently purchased this dvd.  Actually, I couldn't wait to see who was in.  After reviewing the first performer, I wasn't happy. I really can't say why but there were few performers where I didn't like the use knives.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for experiental dance but using small daggers is a no-no.  Anyway, the rest of the dvd really threw me off. A few dances reminded me of an 80s metal music video.

Overall don't purchase this dvd.  It is not worth it. I don't really think that this dvd captured gothic bellydance the way it should be.",1169078400,4,547,4.42
2485164,3,B000E36TDK,"I was so dissapointed with this DVD.Costuming was great but the quality of dance was poor. Sure the S&M by Jehan was a shocker but she's always unusual. Her awesome skill as a bellydancer allows her to explore. Sloppy moves from others, you kept waiting for something to move you,to mesmerize you & it just didn't happen. Neon isn't a tribal dancer or into Goth?!?!What was that all about?Beautiful music,but too much use of the fast forward button!!",1167436800,6,450,4.782051282051282
2485165,4,B000E36TDK,"I previously wrote a review for this and only gave it 3 stars. But after watching it again, I realized I liked it better (I do agree with the reviewer below me in that it does grow on you). I do not consider all of the performances goth. Martiya Possesion are more tribal than anything(at least on this video) and I really dislike the expression, or lack thereof, on their faces while they are dancing. They either look completely bored, pissed off, or smug. I skip right over it.

I also did not care for Asharah's dance to the drum solo by Solace (""Opaque""). The dance mood does not match the mood of the music at all. The music is saying ""fast, big, upbeat"" and she's doing taxim moves and small quick moves.

And of course, we all love the S&M piece...excuse me, S&M is NOT part of the Goth subculture, and has no place on a bellydance video. Jehan may be a great and accomplished dancer, but she didn't dance much on this and I didn't want to see what WAS on her part.

Another thing I would have liked to see is more GOTH music. I like Solace and all, but there were a lot of songs by them on this video and it would have been nice to see some more pieces done to music from the Goth genre. There were a few, but not enough for my liking.

My favorites on this video were Tempest, Ariellah, Jeniviva and Ayshe (for wierdness factor). For all of its faults, this is a good video to be inspired by and I will use it for that purpose.",1166486400,6,1437,4.158273381294964
2485166,4,B000E36TDK,"I consider myself Goth, even though I generally have to keep it hidden.  I only mention this because I expected to Really LOVE this immediately!  I was disappointed when I didn't fall for it right off the bat, but I did myself a supreme favor by watching it again. This is a jewel and has a lot to offer, but the caveat is that it might not be instantly accessible.  That's good, though, right?? Who wants the same rehashed stuff over and over?

My initial disappointments were, first, that the music wasn't ""belly dance traditional"" and in some cases not even belly dance at all, but it was just an expectations problem.  The music on this DVD ranges from modern Arabic percussion/synth/vocal and modern ethnic/ modern bellydance to modern urban/ modern urban bellydance and Techno.

My second disappointment was that the dancers' movements were unexpectedly slow, so that after the first 2 or 3 pieces I was so bored that I started fast-forwarding and then gave up completely. It turned out I needed a bit of time to ""recalibrate"" myself! When I purchased this DVD, I had never seen Rachel Brice or Sharon Kihara perform yet, and did not know anything about the Tribal style or what to expect from Goth bellydancing.

If you are looking for strictly bellydancing, you should know that I would label 10 of the 20 pieces such.  I would label 6 as a blend of belly and modern, 3 as strictly modern, and 1 as a pretty worthless music video trashy piece.

Some specifics:

Ariellah is very engaging and talented, very enjoyable to watch, with excellent taste in costuming.  Her pieces are my favorites.  I also enjoyed Asharah's dances and costumes.  She is talented and only slightly less engaging than Ariellah.  Ayshe's work to me is heavy on atmospherics and drama, with more gymnastics, jazz, and ballet than bellydance.  Blanca exudes confidence but her dancing ability was hard to gauge because most of what dancing there is reminds me of what would be done in a go-go cage.  The piece, which cuts between 2 locations and outfits, is visually a pretty piece nonetheless.  Jehan's piece is too overtly sexual and, frankly, silly to me.  Her buttocks are barely hidden behind filmy fabric in some shots, and she writhes on the floor in others.  More like a music video than anything else.  Neon's piece ""Deja Vu"" at least has bellydancing in it, but is also very MTV.  Her costume is very cool, as is her Nordic queen look and extensive tribal tattooing.  There are 3 duets.  One I have labeled ""Goth Bellydance Meets Riverdance"" with a touch of martial arts. It is very charmingly performed and entertaining, even funny at first, and the costumes are very pretty. This duet and one solo have knives in them, and one other duet begins as a mock execution with one of the women wielding a large sword.  It took a couple views to begin warming up to that one.

All this said, I strongly recommend this DVD.  The women are mostly talented, many of the dances are creative and different, and the costuming is interesting and lovely in almost all cases.  In addition, as someone herself learning bellydancing, I feel the camera work is very good. I was never annoyed by it, nor did I ever have trouble understanding what the dancers were doing.  My only complaint is that I would wish to see the costumes in even greater detail because I am working on designing one or two for myself, but more light would, of course, have ruined the atmospherics. :)

In summary, I'd venture that only the very jaded or very midwestern will be disappointed if you give this an honest chance.  Blink your eyes. Rub them. Walk away. Come back another day and watch it again.  This DVD seems glacially slow the first time you see it, compared to the usual, more frenetic belly dancing we've all seen. As inexpensive as it is, I strongly suggest taking a chance on it if you like Goth fashion/ colors/ atmospherics and various bellydance forms, such as the Tribal style and other modern styles. I'm very happy with it.",1165276800,9,3995,4.664285714285715
2485167,2,B000E36TDK,"I bought this DVD because of the enthusiastic reviews and have to say that I was rather disappointed. There was only one piece that I found really inspiring that was the Kali/Isis Dance by Ayshe. Some of the other dances are nice but some of them are rather boring, especially when you have seen the same dancer pretending she is Rachel Brice doing the same movements during the third piece she dances without any ideas from her own. Yes, I love Rachel Brice too, but I think a dancer should do more than just mimic another and develop her own style.

I found the S&M piece rather disgusting and was glad that I did not come across this one, when my children were still around. Fortunately I had got bored with the DVD then and watched the rest in the evening when they had gone to bed.

I had to use the fast forward a lot to get through this DVD. In my opinion it is too much of the same in a row. One solo like this in a show might be very interesting to watch, but one solo like this after the other gets boring very quickly.

The dancers are good, but they did not touch me - if you know what I mean. Good dance technique is only half of the art. The other half I was painfully missing during most performances.",1165276800,6,1216,4.165957446808511

Jehan is really a good dancer and I love her instructional video ""Scared Dance"". It's really didn't have any worthwhile qualities to that dance but the other dances were thought provoking and interesting to see. I enjoyed the video for what it was worth.  Having someone say that this video is not bellydancing it incorrect.  There is really no wrong or right way to bellydance. Cabaret dancing isn't like Folk dancing where in the Middle East women tend to dance fully covered. Everyone should have a way to express themselves in the dance form that they have chosen.  Even an expert can't declare something invalid based on their belief of ""what is true bellydancing"". To the girls from New York. . . Shimmy-Rock-Goth on!!!",1163721600,6,822,4.694444444444445

2485171,1,B000E36TDK,"This DVD looked promising to a friend of mine and she bought it hoping to see some cool intergration

between bellydance and the goth style. She had not watched it and I was over her house, so we popped it into the

DVD player and watched it together.

There is only one dancer on this DVD who seems to have any bellydance training at all - Tanna.

She is stiff and not very sultry, but her veil work is VERY good and obviously authentic. Her costume

is okay. At least she is in the ""bellydance"" catagory.

There is an interesting dedication to Isis on here (the Goddess, not the famous dancer

from Dallas), but it looks more like a temple ritual than a bellydance.

Other than those two, the rest was horrible. There were women dancing with what looked like

kitchen steak knives, motioning slitting their own throats. Meanwhile, they were NOT

bellydancing or anything like bellydancing.

Most of the DVD featured women who were doing stuff that was NOT bellydance. I'd have been okay

with this if it had been catagorized as an ""alternative"" or ""experimental"" dance

theater, and they could have said on the back cover that there was an influence from bellydance  on

one or two of the acts, but to call it bellydance is a disgrace to the name and to our profession!

As a retired cabaret style dancer, I am fine with people who have styles other than

cabaret, but at least let them be true bellydancers. On this DVD there is a sick segment of

S&M that has NOTHING to do with bellydance in any way at all! This segment is utterly inappropriate and has no place

being called ""bellydance""! We're talking leather and whips and nobody was dancing! I'm not a prude in any way, but I am sick of people who are not

bellydancers pretending they are while cheapening the art and turning it into a side show act.

The women on this DVD are not real bellydancers and if they are, they should shoot themselves

in the foot for appearing on this monstrosity!

I can't give this a rating of -1 stars, so I am giving one and that is TOO kind!",1162512000,12,2036,4.428571428571429

She loved it, I loved it too, and if you're interested in belly dance and don't mind a walk on the wild side this is a very interesting offering. I had to chuckle at the S&M bit but it didn't put me off an otherwise good rendition of skilled dancing. Not sure if I'll have it playing when male visitors are about but we had great fun watching and it's inspired my daughter to take her dancing further as it shows how individual you can be and that belly dancing is a dance form that allows for individuality. I only wish other belly dance videos/DVD's had such good production values. Cool!",1156118400,11,685,4.276923076923077

I personally found this DVD to be a mesmerizing mix of dance styles, choreographies and immprovisations, and an overall great display of many different talents.  Most dancers here are well known artists, stars of GBD or cabaret belly dance, although there were a couple dancers who were new to me, so I was pleased to discover the new names together with the new belly dance styles. I agree with the reviewer who said none of the dancers here are anybody's clone. They are all wonderfully unique! If you ever tried to do a GBD dance yourself you know it's a challenge to avoid cliches because Goth culture uses cliches as a form of protest against mundane uniformity. I was really impressed with the thought these ladies applied to their presentations.  They have created a work of superb taste.

Ariellah is AMAZING! i love ashara, and jeniviva... the rest were ok but i think it was because they didn't strike me as really ""feeling"" the gothic vibe.. just my 2 cents",1154476800,8,923,4.28

Don't buy this expecting  ATS/FatChanceBellydance style dance cause it's not on here. I'd call this stuff ""experimental"" bellydance.",1154390400,13,720,5.486486486486487

Ariellah is stunning with her every move so refined and perfectionned. Her Siren is my absolutely favorite track - a gorgeous example of American Tribal style. Asharah is also OK but not as controlled and her moves seem to be not sharp enough. Neon's dances are beautiful. A friend of mine also liked Jeniviva's second performance. The rest was simply boring. Jehan's video was disturbing if not even disgusting. Brrr.

In other words, they do not do into any dark places with the emotion of the pieces, just with the fashions. Being a true dark-of-heart, I find myself not feeling very compelled by the video overall, except for costuming ideas. The ""knife fight"" duet had so much potential, but the dancers managed to have almost no expression on their faces. Yawn.

 I'm glad somebody finally did this. Raks Gothique deserves recognition! Still, this one is a little too much like ""Charmed"" for bellydancers.",1152662400,12,658,4.866071428571429

The other half?  Ugh.  Neon is a good dancer but I've seen her in all her other videos and I can't take her seriously in this one -(she's the cute pretty blond caberet dancer).  A few 'performance art/dance' pieces left me smacking my head... THIS IS WHY BELLYDANCE HAS A BAD REP IN SOME PLACES!  A S&M dance set?  Come on!

2485182,5,B000E36TDK,"I love this dance DVD and highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in belly dance performances that rise above the cliches and infuse belly dance with a contemporary feel. I guess if you are looking for regular standard belly dance you won't find it here because every performance bends the norm in some way and each and every performance is far more creative than regular belly dance. I disagree with the reviewer who said you may be disappointed because you won't find here simple routines to imitate. Even a beginner dancer needs to develop her individual style, nobody wants to see `just belly dance', and therefore even beginner dancers will benefit from seeing really creative performances, and understanding that they too can take the same old same old and turn it into their own unique really different style. When I started learning belly dance I was also confuseed about so many dance styles, what is bellydance ( I also thought Tribal was not belly dance because it was invented here) but the more I  studied and the more dancers I saw I  started appreciating really creative dancing. Everybody is telling you you should develop your own style, don't be this or that dancer's clone but so much of what you see looks similar or the same.

the dances in ""Gothic Bellydance"" are all so diverse and every dancer puts her heart and soul into her dance. Just from watching it once I learned a lot about creating your own style and being genuine in dance. I don't understand the reviews that say some dancers are good and some dancers are bad. All belly dancing here is top professional quality and more, and some of the dancers are real stars. I have my favorites, but I really enjoyed all the performances and the whole visual style. You can seee that a lot of love and respect was put into this production.  Every dance is a jewel in its own setting.",1152403200,8,1864,4.622356495468278
2485183,1,B000E36TDK,"Like many people have noted, Ariellah and Asharah did a phenomenal job overall. Unfortunately for them though, the other performers make it impossible to recommend this DVD. It's hard to find bellydance moves, and in some instances ANY dance moves in... whatever they are trying to do. In those rare cases that they do bellydance, it comes out rather mediocre.

It's also unclear why this is claimed to be Gothic. The duets by Raven and Ya Meena may be considered to be in medieval style, if you keep in mind that not all the dances were sophisticated and romantic even at that time. Other than that, the performers could only rely on costuming and music to convey the vintage atmosphere. What's more, they don't even manage to stick to the good music and costumes, and for some bizarre reason include numbers that are nothing more than average MTV-like videos.",1151884800,13,861,4.778523489932886
2485184,4,B000E36TDK,"So many confrontational reviews, so many clashing views of what is bellydance and what is Goth...

This DVD is worthy of owning. It is one of the best bellydance performance videos I've seen, with a good lineup and over 20 numbers, all presented with respect and with passion for our dance.

I am a bellydancer with old school roots and training. Was I as quick to judge what is and what isn't bellydance as some reviewers here, I would have said that 'only traditional and Amercian Cabaret bellydance is bellydance. The tribal techno fusion so popular nowadays is hip hop, not bellydance.' But however hard it may be to accept the change, the truth is, popping- locking techno urban bellydance  (the style made popular by Rachel Brice and performed on the ""Gothic Bellydance"" DVD by Ariellah)  **is** also bellydance! It's just not the bellydance we knew in the seventies, eighties and nineties.

I get students who believe that ""Tribal"" bellydance is THE TRADITIONAL  bellydance. Their previous teachers failed to tell them that ""Tribal"" is an American invention. And I also get students who believe that techno-urban bellydance is the real bellydance, because they started their dance education with Tribal fusion bellydance instructors. Time marches on, bellydance changes. ""Pure bellydance"" does not exist and never existed, it's different in every country and in every generation.

GOTH as I know it, is Victorian, Romantic, old world.  It's mystery and maybe horror, but old-fashioned horror (vampyre or fallen angel, NOT anime or robotic alien). Therefore the dancers on the Gothic Bellydance DVD who held to more traditional bellydance styling, Tempest, Tanna and Jeniviva, looked more ""Goth"" to me. The performances in the DVD that I think convey the Gothic spirit best are all American Cabaret. Veil and wings numbers by Tempest, both performances by Jeniviva, both performances by Tanna, and the dance entitled ""Delete All"" by Neon (minus the music video included in it).

I enjoyed the techno-urban numbers by Ariellah and Neon (her second dance). However, to me they represent the industrial trend more than the ""Gothic.' But even these numbers are using the vocabulary of bellydance throughout, no matter how many pops, locks and breakdance accents the dancers layer over it. Both are excellent dancers.

While Neon's style is vacillating between American Cabaret and techno urban bellydance, Asharah's style is somewhere between American Cabaret and American Tribal bellydance. She performs a beautiful drum solo, I'd say it's American Cabaret, although she is wearing a Tribal outfit. There is nothing Gothic about this particular number, but it's very well done.  Her slow dance (""Exiled"") includes AmCab floorwork and American Tribal upper body moves.

The duo ""Martia Possession"" do a form of Tribal bellydance with a gypsy flavor, not the urban techno Tribal. I love both performances. Both duet choreographies are very clean and well executed. ""Martia Possession"" dancers wear Goth makeup. Their spirit is Goth even though they don't evoke any typical Gothic images.

Performances by Ayshe are bellydance and modern dance fusion. Ayshe is a master of dancing with the Wings of Isis. Her first dance (with the wings) has elements of ritual and ""pharaonic"" dance.

Despite the storm of protest caused by the inclusion of music videos in this DVD, I really liked them. The music videos are ""Goddessence"" by Jehan, ""Lovers of Teruel"" (Blanca), and music video clips from ""Delete All"" . The music videos are very well produced! If you expect this DVD to contain ""routines"" to study, the music videos will disappoint you, but if you expect to be entertained, you will appreciate them.

A few moments from the DVD blend dance, acting and visual effects so well, that over time they may become icons of Gothic Bellydance, surviving the WHAT IS GOTH and WHAT IS BELLYDANCE debates.",1151107200,22,3894,5.148969889064976
2485185,1,B000E36TDK,"I'm a fan of BellyDancing, and I know many Bellydancers and one of them is actually in this DVD. But here is the problem. I think they should have called it 'Gothic Interpiative Dancing"" or ""Gothic Fusion-Dancing"" ..

 Litterally only 2 out of all the dancers on this DVD actually BellyDanced..all the others were not. I was very disapionted, because I was expecting Bellydancing, not a half hour of a woman trapped in human sized peice of cloth trying to get out 'Cacoon / transformation' that is not Bellydancing, that is interpative dancing..completely different.

Also, there is a very sleezy S&M music video that has NOTHING to do with BellyDancing what so ever...what's up with that?

I suggest find a friend who has it & watch it just for kicks (and maybe laughs), but don't waist your money.",1151020800,16,799,4.768115942028985
2485186,2,B000E36TDK,I bought this DVD out of curiosity.  Boy was I surprised that so much of it did not seem to be bellydance at all.  Jahad's video (yes most of these were videos...not routines)was only there to push her singing career...it was just her doing lip sync and spreading her legs while a couple of chicks were making out.  Let's see...any of us could do that!  I thought Neon's performances were lacking but interesting enough to watch once.  There were a few girls that were truly horrendous!  There was one dancer that shone...I think it was Ariellah.  On her first dance she did a robot type bellydance moves within the routine.  It was so cool looking!  To me she is what gothic bellydancing should be.  She alone was worth getting the DVD.,1150761600,13,737,4.557251908396947
2485187,2,B000E36TDK,"Maybe my expectations were too high for this DVD. I was so excited when it came in the mail, but very dissappointed after I watched it. With the exception of Ariellah, Asharah, and Jeniviva, it was a big let down. Quite a few of the numbers were barely classifiable as bellydance, and one number in patricular bothered me because all the 'dancer' did was roll around on the ground. I'm all about fusion in bellydance, but when there is no recongnizable bellydancing in a number, it shouldn't be on a bellydancing video. The concept of combining bellydance with gothic subculture is an ideal fit, both of which I adore, but this video was mostly a poor representation in my opinion. I wouldn't reccomend it.",1149897600,13,706,4.701612903225806
2485188,3,B000E36TDK,"As a novice bellydancer and a lover of dark aesthetics, I was positively thrilled to discover that a DVD such as this was available. I pre-ordered it and awaited its arrival with baited breath. In retrospect, I worry that my eager anticipation for this DVD may have raised my expectations unrealistically high. Like virtually every other existing thing in the universe, this DVD has its high and low points.

In contrast to performance DVDs, for instance the original Bellydance Superstars video, the camera angles utilized in Gothic Bellydance allow for a better appreciation of the dancers and their choreographies as a whole. It did not include lengthy belly and chest close-ups which result in the cropping out of a significant part of the dance. For instance, I think that in order to really appreciate even isolation movements, one needs to see them presented in the context of the entire body to view the controlled motion in contrast to the stillness of the rest of the figure. And, of course, if you focus the camera on the abdomen or chest for too long, you completely miss the complementary arm movements, etc. in the shot! In this DVD, thankfully, the camera tended to stay with the dancer as a whole. I suppose this approach would prove to be quite monotonous for a major motion picture, but the real purpose of the DVD is to document the performances, and what is really on display here is not the compositional skills of the camera person but the skills of the dancer.

Also in pleasant contrast to some DVDs is the simplicity and austerity of the set. While some lighting effects and perhaps a bit of smoke is used, the set itself is not cluttered with arbitrary props which obscure the dancers; if props are present on the set it is because they are deliberately placed there by the dancers and are integral to their performances. However, the use of photographic overlays and digitally inserted designs and patterns do often break up the expanse of black backdrop surrounding the dancers. In most cases the technique makes for an interesting visual, rather like a moving collage, and its rare that these overlays obscure and/or distort the dancer significantly. There are a number of cases where editing was heavily used, but in the case of the two most greatly edited pieces, it's not such a great loss since these two pieces involved the least amount of actual dancing anyway.

The majority of the costumes presented in this DVD are gorgeous, sensual, and inventive. Gothic Bellydance certainly provides a wealth of inspiration in this category. Another of the things I greatly appreciated about this DVD is the variety of styles presented. The cabaret style of bellydance was represented by Neon, Tanna, Jeniviva, Tempest, and others, while tribal fusion wove its way into the mix via Asharah's and Ariellah's performances. The two pieces by Martiya Possession, comprising the dancers Ya Meena and Raven, provided an interesting contrast with their seemingly more folkloric style. Unfortunately though, the quality of the performances varied quite widely.

I found Ariellah's solo pieces to be superb. Her interpretation of every musical nuance and her muscular control is something I aspire to develop myself one day. In my opinion, out of all the dancers presented in this DVD, she was able to bellydance to traditionally non-bellydance music the most successfully. Likewise Asharah's performances were a joy to watch, although I think at times she could appear a bit sedate or aloof. Jeniviva's pieces grew on me over time, and personally I prefer her second number ""One Night in Gotham."" Her style and arm movements remind me very much of Suhaila Salimpour.

As an art-form, bellydance is fluid enough to allow the incorporation and influence of various other elements without losing its essential core, which it has already done throughout its history. Some of the performances in the Gothic Bellydance DVD showed that a combination of the Gothic aesthetic and bellydancing can be done interestingly and well, unfortunately others presented in the DVD tended to lose sight of the core along the way.

Overall, I would say that this DVD is imperfect but still inspirational, which is to be somewhat expected of the first DVD of its kind. I would recommend it to those who are already interested in exploring Gothic bellydance as a treasure trove of ambience and costuming ideas. However, if you're just a bellydancer or bellydance enthusiast seeking to broaden your collection of fantastic performance videos featuring all-around, professional-level skilled dancers, you may wish you had looked elsewhere.",1149120000,18,4630,5.045751633986928
2485189,1,B000E36TDK,"If you must buy this DVD, do it for its Goth, not its dancing.  With only one or two exceptions, the dancers featured are only at an elementary skill level and seem to think writhing around with yards of gauzy fabric is interesting.  Give me a week and a sewing machine and I could accurately replicate most of these routines, but with more class.  They try so hard to impress you, but most end up just being funny.  This DVD also lacks a clear-cut scene selection menu, so it's difficult to tell which dancers are which.  The one dancer I do know, Jeneviva, who looks so pretty in her pictures, just reminds me of a spoiled club kid circa 1986 when she starts her jerky, self-centered dancing.  Take it from someone who wasted her money: this DVD isn't worth it.",1149033600,16,763,4.414285714285715
2485190,2,B000E36TDK,"This collection was not easy for me to rate, since I can't perceive it as a whole. It seems to be a pretty random mixture. So I had to break it down:

Ariellah - a genius! I watched her solos many times, and always profoundly admired her ultra-refined choreography and her astounding control over her body. But on the duet she went too easy. I was especially disappointed by the fact that she brought a sword on the stage, and... did nothing with it. So, 5 stars for each of 3 solos and 2 stars for the duet.

Asharah - also very, very gifted. I believe her first number is an absolute success and the best performance of this collection. It is the only number that completely hypnotizes me - by the dark, creepy atmosphere brilliantly created by the choreography, dancer's technique, music, background, and lighting. However, her second dance was choreographed far more modestly, though her technique was still sensational. So, 5 stars for the first dance and 4 stars for the second.

Jeniviva - a decent dancer. I would have given 4 stars for her first performance, but I felt that the elegantly gloomy atmosphere created in the beginning was later ruined by her rather lame attempt to incorporate knives and claws, and the addition of irrelevant feathers. So, alas, 2.5 stars. I generally liked the images superimposed on her performances, but they didn't quite suite the second dance. It wasn't a bad dance, just nothing memorable - 3 stars.

Neon - very strong technically, but not artistically. Her first dance was interrupted too much by the cheap video clipping. Her second dance disturbed me by the lack of femininity. So, 2 stars for each.

All the other numbers were shockingly disappointing. The dancers appear rather inexperienced in general and not very familiar with bellydance in particular. The choreography is... basically missing. It was sometimes stagnant, sometimes messy. 1 star for each of those 10 numbers.

So the average score is: (5x3+2+5+4+2.5+3+2x2+1x10)/20 = 2.275 stars.",1148515200,4,2001,4.922848664688427

If you get tired of seeing the same old thing, then this is for you. Although, it was a different performance from Jehan. I always admire her for pushing the envelope on her artistic freedom. I love all kinds of Belly dance, but it is great to see something different. So open your mind and ENJOY!! this is a great dvd...",1148256000,14,673,3.9558823529411766
2485192,4,B000E36TDK,"It took ages for my copy of Gothic Bellydance to reach me, and by the time it did, I was quite consumed with curiosity because it was so thoroughly discussed everywhere. I ripped it open and slid it into my player. And...

I'm afraid I quite love it!

The Gothic community and the bellydance community both seem to have a lot to say about it because it doesn't seem to fit in purely enough into either of their realms. But I'm not sure it's meant for them in the first place. As a bellydance-novice and an unlikely-Goth, I find it quite a visual treat. The DVD has a whole compilation of rich performances--though all of them aren't born equal, even to the untrained eye. I quickly developed my favourites and unfavorites. All the same there's a lot to look at and a considerable amount of content for relatively little money. There's an incredible snaky sort of dance and another amazing dagger dance. If there are a few performances that don't quite cut it, the rest are skilful and powerful enough to make up for it. I watch the DVD often (mostly spellbound) and find there's a lot of things I'd love to try out and bring into my own dancing. I even think that dancers could learn something from it, if only to let go a little and experiment and explore.

Not for everyone? Now there's an angle that's been discussed thoroughly. Actually, not many things are for everyone. If you're a Goth (whatever that really is), you'll likely think this isn't quite Gothic. If you're a long-time bellydance performer, you'll wonder where all the ""real"" bellydance went. But if, like me, you're just exploring dance, it's both fantastic and fantastical.

Also discussed to death is the inclusion of a music video like performance with more domination scenes in it than dancing. There, I don't blame anyone for wondering. Without making any judgements on this domination business and whether it qualifies as something dance-worthy, I can certainly say it doesn't seem to fit here. It's what my mother would call ""a bit much"", if I were to show it to her, which I will not make the mistake of doing. In fact, I agree with other dancers when they say it had better not be handed over to teens.

These performances are sort of theatrical and use a lot of visual effects--not the usual stage variety. They're not your average pretty-pretty either. It's weird, but wonderful--and I don't regret buying it.",1148083200,13,2389,4.665083135391924

In striking contrast to them, the rest of the contents of this DVD are not much different from what you can see on TV music channels every day. I don't know what kind of style they were trying to represent or create, but they ended up looking just pathetic. Jeniviva and Neon know how to bellydance, but don't always want to. Some others don't really know how to dance. And still others don't even try.",1146873600,3,525,4.769230769230769

If you haven't seen Gothic bellydance, it's about mystery and dark secrets. It has a different vibe. I hate to make comparisons, but every performance on this DVD is different.

You're going to get a fusion of styles, non-traditional dance music in some cases, and the overall styling of the disc is totally gothic.  Which one would naturally expect in a DVD showcasing raks gothique. I think one must approach the disc from that place in order to get it.

I enjoyed most of the performances. Only two made me say ""ho hum, next!"" or ""oh dear god no."" and hit the skip key.  There were some pieces that were completely enthralling and I found it fascinating to see how the dancers meshed traditional bellydance moves with gothic music and styling.  As with most dance DVDs that feature several dancers, there were highs and lows. Several of the dancers are obviously very experienced and have amazing technique and control while a few seem like they are perhaps newer dancers. Even so, overall, the quality of dance throughout was good. I walked away feeling inspired and challenged as a dancer after watching several of the pieces. Standouts for me were Neon, Ariellah and Asharah. I really enjoyed Tempest's outstanding veilwork. Lovely. I could have done without some of the overlays during dance pieces but I liked the words which flashed up on screen and I felt that the camerawork was well done.

Tempest and other gothic bellydancers have created something unique in the dance world and I'm pleased to see the vision realized with an actual DVD.  I think this is a nice addition to my dance video collection and I've watched it several times since getting it in the mail. Brava!",1145404800,26,1750,4.699346405228758
2485198,4,B000E36TDK,"Gothic and Bellydance are perhaps not the most obvious combination in the world but this DVD demonstrates that it can be a very intriguing and entertaining mixture. Although it is hardly purely gothic and the choreography has lots of influences way beyond traditional bellydance. The costumes and makeup were certainly stunning. Not all the music was to my taste (but I'm merely showing my age here) but it did suit the atmosphere and the performances.

The presentation of the DVD itself cetainly will provoke mixed reactions. From the main menu, I made the mistake of going straight into ""Play"" which produced the 85 minute series of dances with absolutely no information about who was dancing or what the dance was supposed to be about. For that, you need to go into ""Visions"" where you will find all you need to know about the performers. But, considering all the artsy overlays used during the dances, a quick caption before each one wouldn't have hurt.

At first, I thought the artsy approach to the visual style might detract from the actual dancing but the camerawork generally served the choreography rather than the other way around, with a minimum of abrupt cuts and the dancer almost always being framed in full figure. Even so, some of the imagery seemed excessive although it was probably included to reinforce the gothic theme. But flashing song lyrics on the screen was definitely unnecessary.

As for the performances themselves, as can be expected with such a mixed program, there were highs and lows. My favorite dancers were Ariellah, Ayshe, Tanna and Tempest. They seemed to capure the intended mood perfectly. But Jehan's performance seemed more like a Madonna video than bellydance and Neon kept reminding me of Sandahl Bergman in Conan the Barbarian (that's not necessarily a bad thing). Compared to the other dancers, the duets by Raven & Ya Meena were rather uninspiring and repetitive.

Overall, I found the performances quite intriguing while my wife seemed to love nearly every minute. It would be interesting to see these dancers in front of an audience where that interaction might produce a bit more sparkle and spontaneity. I know the emphasis on these performances is supposed to be gothic, but it would have been nice if the dancers could occasionally crack a smile just to indicate that they were really enjoying what they were doing.",1145059200,63,2370,4.962216624685139
2485199,5,B000E36TDK,"Amazing stuff, folks, so worth checking it out! Every single performance on this DVD is awesome, awesome.  I was so hooked I watched it twice in one sitting (oh yeah!....90 minute x 2, it's seriously addictive) That's right, no more revisiting the DVD trailer for the N..th time, the real thing is here!

Thinking of the DVD as a whole, the first word that comes to mind has already been beaten to death......it's Inspiring. It's also gutsy and wicked diverse. The quality of dancing is worldclass but that's not  what impressed us the most.

I rewatched it with my peeps, and what occurred to us is that all the dancers in this group are fabulous story tellers. Bingo! Mesmerizing=telling a story you w ant to hear again and again. Most belly dance shows don't tell you any story. A lot of them look the same for this very reason. I applaud this collective of top dancers from both coasts who came together and raised the bar not just for Gothic Belly dance but also for any belly dance as entertainment.  Bravo!

And regarding this pesky question, How is Gothic Belly dance different from other forms of belly dance?, my answer is: It tells a Different Story. Get it?

I agree with  other reviewers, it's the best bellydance performance DVD in my collection. I am looking forward to Volume Two (Yes!) Thank you Tempest, Ariellah, Neon, Blanca, Jehan, Asharah,Tannah, Martya Possession, Jeniviva and Ayshe. You guys have taken the art to a new level and made our dark souls proud! How about a tour, no kidding, it'll be a hit.",1144886400,11,1527,4.650557620817844
2485200,5,B000E36TDK,"Okay granted, I am a devote goth of nearly 20 years, so it's hard to imagine my not loving at least part of this dvd.  It was so great to hear these musical selections paired with such intense costuming and choreography.  With the exception of the two more music video-based selections, I whole-heartedly disagree with the reviewer who said this was over-the-top and cheesy.  The majority of these pieces were wonderfully mysterious and dramatic in their presentation.

The formatting is awkward, in that you have to access the ""Visions"" menu in order to find out the name of the performer (and no track listing anywhere!), but I am very pleased that the camera work was seamless and natural.  (Bad dance camerawork is a *big* pet peeve!)  I can't disagree with the reviewer who said the overlays were a bit much, but I didn't find them too tiresome.

A few of the dancers struck me as exceptional, and several others just had exquisite artistry working with costumes and imagery.  I admit, I had to pass over two of the tracks, but the remainder definitely made up for their failing.  So most of the dancers aren't on par with the Superstars (Ariellah & Neon certainly were, though!)- I'm just so glad something like this was made.",1144540800,45,1232,4.719626168224299
2485201,4,B000E36TDK,"This is definitely a specialty item, for an offbeat audience.  I liked it myself, but then I'm a little offbeat.  :)

I actually enjoyed the bondage, and the snake woman, and some of the other pieces that traditional folks would perhaps be hard-pressed to call bellydance.  On the other hand, I'm a fan of dance/art in general and I love fusion and theater and dark porn.  so hey, this dvd had it all for me!

Yes, some of the performances were a little less than 'internationally-renowned-professional-level' quality, but there was plenty on this dvd to make it worth the relatively inexpensive cost - and oh my it had inspiration galore!

At least on this video I saw things I could actually imagine myself using in performance - rather than sitting through an hour-long dvd with my jaw dropped to the floor thinking ""holy cow that dancer must workout twelve hours a day.""  These performances were much more accessible to my (slightly twisted/non-mainstream)aesthetic as a dancer, and I will definitely use this as an influence for my own performances.  Bravo!",1144368000,13,1062,4.888268156424581
2485202,2,B000E36TDK,"I was quite excited to discover this DVD and waited in eager anticipation for it to be available to purchase. Upon it's arrival yesterday, I immediately placed it into my DVD play and sat down to watch.  Unfortunately though - I found myself feeling rather disappointed.

I'll be upfront - while I am not a professional belly dancer - I've often been asked if I was after dancing at various goth clubs due to my natural dance style. I've always considered taking classes - but I was quite often unable to due to my work schedule.  These days though with my close friend being a professional belly dancer and my work schedule being quite flexible - I've been seriously thinking about pursuing my love of dancing on a different level. My initial ""favourite"" with belly dancing was tribal style. When I read that there was another category called raks gothique - I was thrilled!  Perfect for a dodgy ol' goth like me.

So owning up to being a dodgy ol' goth - I'll freely admit to liking cheesy goth imagery.  But, there is a certain point where the cheesiness ceases being cool and crosses over into the <em>""Oh no!  They didn't really do that, did they?""</em> category.  Unfortunately, there is a LOT of the later on this DVD.  I found that not only was it embarrassing to see the number of beyond cheesy image overlays - that the overlays were really quite distracting to the dance numbers themselves.  On the same token - it is sad to say that some of the dances wouldn't have held up by themselves without the overlays - which takes me to my next beef.

I found myself very underwhelmed with 75% of the performances.  I completely enjoyed the performances by Ariellah and Martiya Possession and I was impressed with the white outfit of Tempest - she reminded me a lot of vintage photographs of dancers.  The wings of Isis was an interesting number also - but a touch on the long side.  And, for me - that was it.  The rest of the pieces I found were too similar to each other and rather lacklustre.  A lot of the dancers didn't seem very experienced or comfortable. I was also rather confused with the inclusion of the bondage number also.  Like a previous reviewer - I'm no prude...but this number just seemed completely out of place.

So we come to the conclusion and while I am disappointed with the DVD - I am still glad I purchased it.  I wouldn't say the DVD is a good buy for everyone, but if you have a reaction similar to mine, then you might get a similar value out of it or at least be amused by certain sections.  For me, it offered the chance to discover a few good dancers and I will be eagerly hunting for more of their work.  It also worked well in showing me exactly what to avoid for when I start dancing.",1144368000,18,2725,4.41
2485203,3,B000E36TDK,"When I think of Gothic, I think of elaborate costumes: lace, corseting, triangle bell sleeves, full skirts, layers of pettycoats... gorgeous and dark.

This DVD conveyed ""gothic"" with lighting.  Most of the time the dancers were so shadowed, you couldn't see the dance and the ones that were well lit were... well... whorish.  The result is poor quality video (not headache causing color streaks or pixilation, just underlit) of dancers who just forgot their blush before they went on stage.

There were a few well done, elaborate costumes (although they didn't seem all that 'goth'), but most of the girls wore obvious bras (not even well decorated ones) and skirt/coin belt variations.  There was a random girl in a sheet playing with a domme and another in a very stiff '80's cocktail dress and maryjanes... both of these costumes confused me.

For some reason, there are lyrics printed on the screen during some of the dances (I think they are the ones refered to as 'underfunded music videos' in another review).  I found that and the cheep 'special effects' (photoshopping in sets and fading from one angle to another) distracting rather than artsy.

I like the falls (hair, not dance) on the duets.  The dagger dance was nice.  There are smooth 'wings' that I might adapt to my own work.  Drum solos and isolation work was phenominal (when you could see it).

Like other reviewers, I am not sure what to make of the light S&M.  I'm generally a fan of the darker nature of human sexuality, but I don't think it belongs here.",1144368000,10,1530,4.75
2485204,3,B000E36TDK,"I was really keen to get this DVD but I have to say it left me feeling a little disappointed. The quality of the production was great, ie good lighting, interesting sets, no odd angles, most of the costumes were beautiful and imaginative, the music was also different and enjoyable to listen to. I love things that are a bit off beat and edgy but this didn't grab me. Half the dancers seemed inexperienced and stilted. They didn't really dance, just did snakey arms and waved skirts/veils around. Even those who I know to be great dancers seemed ill at ease at times. And what about that bondage dance...was it really necessary? I'm no prude but well...I'll reserve judgement on that one!!",1144195200,12,689,4.655737704918033
2485205,3,B000E36TDK,"Well, I have a 50/50 review of this DVD.  I really liked about half of the dances and the other half left me thinking WTF??  I was really taken aback with the whole girl on girl bondage routine and the black 80's prom dress with stripper heels routine.  I am a huge fan of gothic bellydance (and even perform it myself) but I felt like I had to double check and make sure the TV didn't accidently switch to HBO's Real Sex show. There are the obviously amazingly talented dancers on there and those are the more ""known/popular"" dancers and make the DVD worth watching but some of the other dancers seemed like they were studio hafla quality dancers.  And some just seemed like an excuse to make a short music video and was used to fill in space.  I love the idea and love the fact that gothic bellydance is becoming more mainstream, but we don't have to ""porn"" ourselves out to be considered gothic.",1144195200,19,898,4.385542168674699

8104765,2,B000E36TDK,"I loved the concept of this DVD. I'm a huge fan of gothic subculture (the aesthetic, music and attitude), and I'm a lifelong student of bellydance. An expose of gothic bellydance sounded perfect. Sadly, in 'Gothic Bellydance', the talent just isn't here, save for the exceptional Ariellah. Ariellah performs 4 times, including in a duet, which I enjoyed very much. Other than Ariellah's, I found every single performance here to be so amateurish and unskilfully dramatic (those cheap knives, the cage, the cat eyes), that I could only laugh. I'm not afraid of the utter darkness of gothic performance art, and in more capable hands the intensity and drama could have been virtues, but not when the bellydancing itself is so technically sloppy. I loved the music (which ranges from oriental to industrial), but frankly I have seen more talent than this at student soirees. I am keeping this DVD because I love Ariellah, but otherwise, it is horrible.",1379030400,,949,4.9748427672955975

Goth is much more than donning black clothing, kohl makeup and APPEARING eerie!  Now onto the bellydance review.  I do not dispute that all the featured bellydancers are skilled and talented, but (outside of Ariellah--who is an interwoven gothic energy) should continue to master and mix their true passion and stay within these realms as opposed to trying to be gothic.  Graphics--oh--the graphics??  The graphics were just as horrible.  I was expecting the bellydancer to be on stage with props as opposed to some ill-laden graphics as an after effect.  This production did not hold my interest and I am actually typing this review while the DVD is playing.  I would NOT recommend this DVD.  It was much more entertaining to watch the 4 minute 55 second clip of Espana Gothla 2010 than 85 minutes of......",1330732800,,972,4.9079754601226995
8104767,5,B000E36TDK,"""Gothic Bellydance"" is a delightful surprise, full of creative and dramatic choreographies, mysterious special effects, and heart-felt performances.  Unlike traditional bellydance which has degenerated in too many cases to acrobatic displays of abdominal virtuousity and mere showmanship, it is indeed refreshing to see dance elevated to an artform, filled with both meaning and feeling through movement.  The only criticism which I would mention here (not for the viewers but for the dancers themselves) is that the sombre, almost deadpan look which most of the dancers adopt, is not necessarily conducive to intense drama.  In other words, intense facial expressions add a great deal to any dramatic performance and help convey what is being communicated through art. Nevertheless, this DVD is well worth watching, and I have rated it as 5 star.",1320969600,,847,5.450381679389313

8104769,1,B000E36TDK,"Yikes. With a few exceptions -- Blanca and Ariellah come first to mind -- this DVD is neither truly Gothic nor is it specifically Bellydance. It is kind of a cheesy 80's rock video homage (if it's intended to be tongue in cheek I have totally missed the boat here), in an overblown Alice Cooper style rather than anything that calls to mind the Victorian romance that is supposed to underlie Goth culture. Additionally, some of the pieces I would not even put in the genre of Bellydance, they belong in the softcore porn aisle. Can we please move on from this kind of thing? Gothic bellydance has so much more potential than this.",1266883200,6,630,4.535087719298246
