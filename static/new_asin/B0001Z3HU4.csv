2043392,5,B0001Z3HU4,"I, like Kimberly, by chance caught this movie on television about 5 years ago.  I cried at the end and kicked myself in the head repeatedly for not taping it !!  I have since been searching high and low for a copy of it only to learn today that it is FINALLY available on DVD! I was ecstatic to learn this and am ordering my copy immediately.  The characters are realistic, you find yourself feeling what they are feeling. It is a hauntingly beautiful love story which brought me to tears.  I highly recommend it.  Ladies,(or gentlemen?)if you are feeling sentimental about someone, rent or buy this film, pop open a good Merlot or other libation, press ""play"" and enjoy!!!You will not be disappointed!!!",1111449600,13,704,4.645161290322581
2043393,5,B0001Z3HU4,"LOVE LETTTERS has been on making the boards of theaters large and small across the United States (and translated into many languages and performances throughout the world!) since A.R. Gurney first wrote it in 1989.  It is still a popular theater piece for actors from film who want to have public exposure on the stage, for benefits, for young actors in training. Why?  Because it is an unassuming, interesting easy to perform in reading fashion by just two actors on a small stage, ultimately fine exploration of the variations love has in the periods of each of our lives. It is unpredictable, clever, well written and very meaningfully tender.

In this teleplay, revised for television screens in 1999 by A.R. Gurney, Stanley Donen directs this fleshed-out performing version with a cast that would be difficult to better.  Simply stated, this is a epistolary love story that begins when Andy meets Melissa in second grade and progresses through their very different lives (art school, Yale, Vietnam, alcoholism, divorces, politics, affairs, etc) until Melissa ultimately dies (we know this from the opening scene so this is NO spoiler!).

The technique of mixing actual interaction between the two characters with remembered responses works very well.  Part of the reason this small play becomes important is the extraordinary performance by Laura Linney as Melissa. The breadth of her characterization is richly detailed, subtle, vulnerable, and wholly credible.  Steven Weber as Andy takes a while to warm to his character (the more difficult of the two with whom to identify) but in the end he gives his best work to date.

This is really a fine little movie, interrupted only by the obvious splices of time where commercials were probably inserted in the original television version. It flows naturally and never ceases to hold your attention and your heart as it is lovingly enacted by Linney and Weber.  Grady Harp, February 2005",1109116800,41,1939,5.091482649842272
2043394,5,B0001Z3HU4,"I caught the last hour of this movie on television completely by accident.  I am an ardent letter writer..so as soon as I figured out the plot, I was hooked.  The characters themselves catch you..you need to know what happens to them.  This movie does not have what I would consider the typical hollywood love ending.  Everything is not perfect, and you ache from it. The actors make you feel what they are feeling.  The love, hate, indifference, and fear.  I would recommend this movie to everyone.

It's the kind of classic love story that you never hear about anymore. They don't show these kinds of movies with characters embroiled in a passionate yet realistic romance. Even if this love story doesn't turn out the way typical romances do, it didn't give me false hope about romance in general, but it still helped me to believe in deep love. The kind of love few see in their lives. This movie proves that love can be great no matter how imperfect it is. Watch this movie and you'll get that feeling even if it is just for a moment.",1093132800,26,703,4.176470588235294

2043405,5,B0001Z3HU4,"Wonderfully acted. This enjoyable movie is like a play in its format and overall feel. Touching story about love, how complicated life can become, and about personal weaknesses. It has a very human, fallible tone to the story. The female character is performed very well, and it's wonderful watching the different sides of the character she portrays. Definitely worth the watch. Don't get discouraged if it seems to start out a bit slow. It simply takes a few minutes to adjust to a format which refreshingly differs from most things we see.

2043408,5,B0001Z3HU4,"Just finished watching the movie and whether it's because I'm a woman or an actress who's played Melissa on stage I highly recommend this movie!  If you're an actress, sure, wait until after you've tackled the material yourself to see it but I do not think it will overly cloud anyone's interpretation since it ""treads fairly lightly"" owing to being made for TV with language restraints and also because it's not the verbatim script.  It does follow 85-90% of the script I'm guessing but Gurney has much leeway since also being the playwright.  Weber is endearing despite having to play an uptight character and Linney's beauty and sexy sarcasm lend themselves wonderfully to hers.  They still read their letters but just enough extra action is added to compliment that device.  Especially love the scenes in Andy's study because the character's intimacy was very like watching the staged reading.",1392595200,,897,5.033783783783784
2043409,1,B0001Z3HU4,"What a waste of time. I kept waiting for something good to happen and it never did. The connection between these two was boring and bland. Nothing fun, adventurous or interesting. The whole movie was about them reading boring letters to each other and when they finally end up it bed. There was no spark, no hot & steamy romance, just going through the motions. I don't understand all the great reviews on this. I would never recommend it to anyone.",1390348800,,449,4.555555555555555

2043411,1,B0001Z3HU4,"I'd always heard good things about the stage version but hadn't ever been able to see it.  So when I found the movie, I was eager to watch it.

Perhaps it just works better on the stage. Or perhaps it needs better acting and directing.  Or both. But this film version is lifeless and uninteresting.  The only reason I watched until the end was because I was waiting for the ""good"" stuff to happen.  There wasn't any ""good"" stuff; it was pretty bad all the way through. The actors do a competent job of reading the words off the pages of the script, but the story seemed weak and colorless to me.

My time could have been better spent doing just about anything else.",1387670400,,665,4.32258064516129
2043412,5,B0001Z3HU4,"I really enjoy Laura Linney.  She hasn't had any ""major"" movie that I'm aware of, but a series of well written movies that her acting skills work well in.  IMDB will give you summation of the movie and plot - in short,....this is about a love story of childhood friends - entangled in dysfunctional childhoods and forces that drive them into the choices they made.  What is endearing about the movie is the ""love language"" - it's the unconditional love that lasts a lifetime which we all hope for in our own lives.  You will not like this movie if you need action and suspense to entertain you.  You will like this movie - if you can appreciate character study and composition.",1369958400,,677,4.516393442622951
2043413,5,B0001Z3HU4,"Thank you for the delivery of this DVD as I loved the story very much.  The acting was great and it was a very sentimental love story of two people who met in 2nd grade and had the connection of being soul mates but never fully developed their love for each other, but it was a love story with unspoken words of confirmation till the end.

 It was through these letters to each other throughout their lives, that they kept in touch from wherever life took them.  I am a very sentimental person in reality and so I appreciated this movie very much.....Would I say that it is more of a chick film? .... I guess that it is, unless you happen to be married or in a relationship to a new age man who also loves and honest real  love stories......and I can honestly say that if my late husband was still alive, he too would have loved this movie, as he was into writing letters for almost any excuse.  He could say more on a page than speak about it as it had a lasting quality about his emotions.

I would thoroughly recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good story line with no sexual scenes or bad language to (enhance) the feelings between  these two people who genuinely loved each other, but it was always the wrong time for them to be together.......please buy it and you will not be  disappointed unless you are a cold hearted person, then I would say to you ""keep away"".  It is not a mushy story but a true, honest and a beautiful one to spend a couple of hours lost in it.

2043414,1,B0001Z3HU4,The movie was just about two people reading love letters to each other. The only nice twist to it was that the man later knew about the value of the woman when she was already gone.,1356998400,,181,4.055555555555555

2043416,3,B0001Z3HU4,"This is a very tough setup - basically a 2-character play in which the characters who are in the same room together recite several decades of their correspondence.  It's a very theatrical conceit and probably works better on the stage.  A movie gives you all kinds of advantages - you can have different actors play the characters at different ages (assuming the stage play uses the same two actors throughout); you can be more elaborate with your set and costume changes; when they are clearly in another time and place the characters can talk to each other in real time which should look and sound different from reading letters to each other.  However, these are the very reasons I expect a play like this to be more realistic, and in that regard this production of Love Letters is a failure for me.

In real life people do not change their clothes, make-up and hairstyles in an instant and without any indication that time has passed.  When Laura Linney as Melissa wears one look for one spoken line, and a completely different look for the next line, even though they have not moved from the room where most of the action takes place, that just makes me want to laugh, or at least grimace.  Steven Weber fares better in this regard because he doesn't change much from the uptight lawyer/politician.  His is a fairly one-dimensional performance.  Laura Linney has a more vibrant character and benefits from more hair styles and a variety of costumes, but I have to say neither actor has the goods to transport this sometimes stilted script into gut-wrenching territory.  (If Steven Weber's Andy said the word ""constituency"" one more time, I might have turned the movie off.)

In the 20+ years since the play was written, it's quite possible that the public's tastes have evolved.  In the opening scene where Andrew's aides pick him up at the airport as he is returning from Melissa's funeral, he says he wants to go home and the aide reminds him of his schedule for the rest of the day.  To me that is just trite shorthand for the pressures of a politician's responsibilities as they crash up against real life.  I would like to think a more contemporary screenplay would handle this conflict with more finesse.  In a similar vein, as Andy and Melissa's relationship progresses and causes issues about public perception of Andy as a political figure, Melissa does not act like someone a normal man would want to be with.  Spoiler alert if you have not seen this movie:  she makes it easy for him to walk away.  Like maybe he wishes he could run.

The ending is touching, and the premise is interesting.  The script has its problems and the acting is just OK.  Linney is better than Weber, but neither successfully sells the concept.  This is a high-minded movie that doesn't quite rise to the challenge.",1350259200,,2807,4.687755102040816
2043423,5,B0001Z3HU4,"I bought this movie as a favour to my girlfriend and I she was amazed by it. I must say that even I really liked it and I am usually not that much into those love stories, but this movie really got me. I can only recommend it, even for guys. ;)",1286668800,2,244,3.7115384615384617
2043424,5,B0001Z3HU4,"I first saw this movie when it premiered on the ABC network, many years ago. I was so so in love with it, instantly. In fact, I actually contacted the television network to find out if there was a way to obtain a copy of it or if they were planning on releasing it for purchase. (at the time, I was a little clueless as to the way production companies work, and movie ownerships, etc) Of course, the response was some sort of ""yadda yadda yadda... no"". But I had it permenantly stuck in my heart, and every once in a while, I'd take a search on the internet for information about it. Well, I think I actually first saw it on DVD at Blockbuster randomly. It blew my mind! That very day, I went home to look it up for purchase so I could enjoy it on my own any time I wanted; and where else but the wondrous Amazon would do?

The film, itself, is a fantastic story of two friends who battle through the perils of life's struggle and pain to stay close and deal with the romantic feelings they have and either choose to ignore or embrace. I had been aware of Steven Weber from the tv show ""Wings"", but it was my introduction to Laura Linney. She has since become one of my most favorite actresses, and I truly think she can do anything. As I understand, this is a film adaptation from a stage play. I haven't seen the play, and apparently a lot of people are critical of the movie because of the movie's difference from it. And while you do have a feeling of a made-for-tv movie in the first half and feel a little restrained with location for it, the story can really lift you into a beautiful story if you let it.

I suppose maybe I'm a little predjudiced, due to the female character being an artist, as I am, and overly-relating with the feelings and situations she finds herself in. So, maybe that might not reach everyone on a personal level; but at the very least, Linney did it right! And I admire that.

I think it's at least worth a viewing, if not a purchase, for just about everyone.",1273104000,2,1992,4.223097112860892

2043426,5,B0001Z3HU4,"This is a classic.  Totally got into it.  A really great, compelling, wonderfully written, directed, and acted piece.  Laura Linney is beautiful.  She looks great in every frame.  And Steven Weber is perfect in this role.  These are two great actors.  And when you give an actor great material it is a wonderful thing for the audience.",1246665600,3,335,4.771929824561403
2043427,5,B0001Z3HU4,"As presented on stage, A.R. Gurney's popular play features an actor and actress seated at a table, reading a series of letters that describe their lifelong relationship.  In fact, during the height of its popularity back in the early 1990s, Los Angeles audiences were treated to an ever-changing cast of stars, each pair staying with the production for a week or so, then relinquishing the stage to another duo.

For this 1999 television adaptation under the direction of Stanley Donen, Gurney opens up his play somewhat.  True, most of it takes place in one room, with the two principals speaking the contents of their letters to each other, but this approach, surprisingly, works very well.

Steven Weber plays a U.S. Senator who has just attended the funeral of his friend, Laura Linney.  Alone in his office, he begins to read the letters that they wrote to each other over the years, and Linney's spirit appears to deliver her half of the communications, thus the scenes play as a dialogue.

The two characters had met in grade school where they immediately fell in love.  However, the fact that Linney was a rebellious, free-spirited girl, while Weber was more serious and down-to-earth, kept them from consummating their romance, except for a brief affair.  Both married others, yet each was the great love of the other's life.

The actors are terrific in one of the most moving films I've ever seen.  I can't recommend this one too highly.

2043428,1,B0001Z3HU4,"I will go on record to say that this was positively awful.  The correspondence between two lifelong friends, Melissa and Andy, was trite and ultimately boring beyond words.  This 1999 Canadian television production could not have paired together two more unsuited actors in Laura Linney, a superior actress with the lifeless and untalented Steven Weber.  Weber's performance was so stultifying that any hint of chemistry between the two was lost.  After seeing this done live on stage in 1998 as a reading, this teleplay adapted by the playwright A.B.Gurney himself had all of the stage emotion and life choked from it with Weber's numbing performance and Lee Holdridge's sappy 1970-esque musical scoring.
