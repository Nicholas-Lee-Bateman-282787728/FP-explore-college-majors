2582679,5,B000FS2W12,"This was the best price around for season 4.  My daughter & I love Degrassi The Next Generation.  We watch all the episodes together.  I have to say, I think they tackle many issues affecting kids today and they aren't always happy endings, I feel it's very realistic and well done.",1168300800,,282,4.490196078431373
2582680,4,B000FS2W12,"I bought this fourth installment for my stepdaughter, who is a huge Degrassi fan. We watched every moment of it as a family -- she's now got a full DVD collection with more to come, but she'd seen most of it on tv. Thought it's over-the-top drama and gets into almost every sordid teen situation imaginable, the series is a good educational exercise for everyone. Guns at school, bipolar disorder... you name it. Degrassi (a Canadian show) takes it on. I say go for it. Ideally, you have a mature teen to present the DVD pack to, but really, it doesn't matter... it's the real world. Watch it with your child. Your child will live it regardless.",1168300800,9,645,4.521367521367521
2582681,4,B000FS2W12,i loves it. i bought all 4 seasons and just recently got them in the mail. damn this show is good.,1168128000,,98,3.7142857142857144
2582682,5,B000FS2W12,"This is one of the best seasons Degrassi has ever made!  The show took a more of an adult approach but still kept it more teen orientated.  In this season you will see Paige facing her rapist in court and destroying his car.  Craig dealing with bipolar and loses Ashley again.  Emma contracts a STD.  Then you have the world famous school shooting in ""Time Stands Still"".  Plus, six couples also break up during this season.  You also get deleted scenes (that will probably make you wonder why they didn't use 'that' in a particular episode).  Also you get way more funnier bloopers from this season than you did with season two.  It's a very good four disc dvd pack that any loyal Degrassi fan would enjoy!",1164326400,13,707,4.503937007874016
2582683,5,B000FS2W12,"This show is basicaly a how to guide for students in high school. It brings up all of the issues that surround todays teenagers and takes it to a whole other level. This season there is a school shooting, a trial for Paige Michaelchuck, a coming out, a social disease, and much much more. I give this set a perfect 5 out of 5!",1161561600,3,326,4.109375
2582684,5,B000FS2W12,"I accidently stumbbled onto Degrassi several years ago over a Christmas break and found the show to be easily addictive. Not being one for the standard sterotypical high school scene like in the OC or Dawson's Creek I was stunned on how well the show was put together along side it's addictiveness.

Not only is the show intelligently written and plotted the acting from the youthful cast is spectacular. Each character (as partly a result from them being well written) is brought out onto the screen with that particular oddness and poignancy that is all to familar with someone who just left high school.

This is not a show where the entire cast is drop down gorgeous nor act exactly the same; there is a wonderful diversity with the roster of characters present. They all don't wear most expensive clothes or drive the most expensive cars to school and do not go around spouting out mindless phrases such as 'waxing philosophical.' This is a real life show displaying real life characters with real life problems and having those characters work through them with real life means.

About six months after I discovered this little gem of a show I found with much surprise that the DVD sets for each season were available and freaked out; quickly drove to the store and laid down my money. I bought season one sortly before season two came out in Aug. 2005, and saw that the release date for the third season was already scheduled for this past March and quickly pre-ordered. I watched them the entire way through and was able to pick up larger story arcs that I had missed when I saw the reruns on the Noggin Network and longed for more after the last episode had ended on the third season disk set. Once again I saw the release date was only about six months away after the third season (a very short time considering it takes over a year for each season of most other shows to be released on DVD).

I wrote a review for the third season of this show months back and claimed it the be the best season of the entire show (based on what I had picked up on TV and later watched on DVD) and still claim that, but must admit that season four is a very close second.

As in past shows Degrassi boldly faces down such issues as teen pregnancy, drinking, drugs, sex, cutting, homosexuality, violence, and much much more with a raw force that other shows would only dream of doing. The fourth season however goes even further with such issues as noted and beyond.

Not to give anything away (though I will give away some) a school shooting occurs, a student is murdered, another paralyzed, affairs of the heart go out of control, secrets are revealed, and pretty much the same intensity ignites as it has done in the past seasons.

Though some has called this show pretentious, overly dramatic, or just plain stupid they need to think again and take a look at the other shows out there depicting life in high school and recall what it was like for themselves years past in high school. I for one (as someone who just left it) find Degrassi to be all to true to the reality that teens go through as they walk the halls to class. It's safe to simply say this show gets it right.

As for the DVD as with the past three seasons the extras seem to be a step above one another with each passing season. Deleted/extended scenes, gag reels, casting tapes; the usual (I'm not one who does much with extra features on DVDs apart from deleted scenes). The quality of the print of each episode is great (the only drawback is it's in fullscreen (although apart from HBO DVDs not many TV shows that I own are in widescreen format)).

In the end is Degrassi worth laying down the money for? Absolutely...100%...YES!!! It is a must own for fans of the show, fans of high school programs, and fans of people who just like plain good old television; you will not be disappointed.",1156118400,25,3856,4.489300998573467

It was REAL.These issues that Degrassi addressed were things kids actually dealt with and frankly still are! Everyone can relate to this show at some point.

2582734,5,B000FS2W12,"Paige faces her rapist, straining her relationship with Spinner. Spinner and Paige break up, and he begins dating a hesitant Manny, who is still getting over Craig. Marco and Alex compete to be Class President.  Rick, who was responsible for putting former schoolmate Terry into a coma, returns to school, and is bullied by his peers.  Ellie has had enough with her mom's drunken antics, and decides to move out. Toby befriends Rick.  After being humiliated in front of the entire school, due to Alex, Spinner, and Jay, Rick is fed up and brings a gun to school, which leaves one student dead, one in the hospital, and Emma and Sean especially, traumatized.  After the shooting, Sean decides to move back with his parents. Emma begins acting out, and gets involved with Jay. Liberty finally lands her longtime crush, J.T. Craig and Ashley start dating again. Jimmy returns to school and deals with Spinner's involvement in the shooting. Paige begins dating Matt, the new student teacher, and fights with Manny after  Manny reveals their secret relationship to the school. Craig deals with bipolar disorder.  Jay and Silent Bob make a movie at Degrassi.

SUCH a great season, but the best episodes have to be ""Time Stands Still"" part 1 and 2, which show the serious consequences of bullying and the aftermath.  Definitely recommend this season!",1278374400,,1343,4.937777777777778
2582735,4,B000FS2W12,"You can say I've been around a bit and grew up on Degrassi Junior High,etc..Wound up watching Degrassi ""Next Generation"" kind of unintentionally...Glad I did and the rest is history. Just a tremendous cast of young actors and great stories with several different topics. Have enjoyed many of the young actors grow through their teenage years. The show keeps adding many talented young actors as the years go by. With many of the cast from 2001-2007,pretty much gone,most have been replaced. If you have been a fan of Degrassi since the 80's or just getting into the series,season 4 is definitely something you should check and add to your collection. I'm slowly adding seasons to my collection. Check the show out if you haven't yet...",1262822400,,735,4.888

Degrassi really showed why it's one of the greatest teen shows with the two parter ""Time Stands Still."" It displayed the horrible consequences of bullying and the aftermath. I think the writers did a great job with the season, but I wish they kept it up.

5/5!!!",1240617600,,390,4.402777777777778

The most devastating one is when Rick returns to school, gets constanly bullied and finally brings a gun to school and actually shoots someone. One major student leaves after the inncident, Mr. Raditch was forced to leave the school a couple of episodes later. It also deals with Gonorrhea. A student going out with a teacher assistant. Paige finally goes to court to face Dean. J.T finally has sexually fantasies about Liberty. Marco has relationship issues with Dylan, Spinner loses all his friends, Craig gets diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder. Joey has finacial troubles with his house, Jay and Silent Bob come to Degrassi to film a movie, Craig and Ashley get back together, Ashleys dad gets married to another man. Ellie moves in with Sean.

The characters are totally realistic and believable.  Unlike many series devoted to youths, the adults involved are presented as human and fallable but still very much worthy of respect and trust.  I watch this series with my teenaged daughter and it opens tremendous opportunities for dialogue on topics that I would NEVER consider bringing up (or even know where to begin to bring up!)  Season four is especially dramatic as it pulls no punches when dealing with bullying, assault and school shootings and the aftermath faced by the students involved.  I highly recommend this series for any teen and their parent....  but start at the beginning....  it is nice to grow up with the characters and they kind of ""ease the viewer into the harder issues"".",1219622400,,885,4.979591836734694
2582739,4,B000FS2W12,"In season four of Degrassi: The Next Generation, the show changes from a relatable teen drama, into an over the top parody of teen life. I'm not knocking the show, because even despite a weak season like this, Degrassi is still one of the best teen dramas on television. However, season four takes the show into over-dramatic territory, which is why I consider it one of the weakest seasons, with a few high points.

The main problem I have with season four is the amount of drama crammed into each episode. Take the season four premiere for example. In ""Ghost in the Machine"", Paige's rape trial finally goes into effect. In some of the earlier seasons, that would've been enough to carry the entire episode. But instead, the show added more drama to add more shock value. Paige conveniently runs into her rapist at a college frat party, purposely runs into his car and totals it, and then has her boyfriend take the heat by getting arrested. This is what I mean by over the top. Too much drama for one episode. I liked it better when the show focused on the issues and less on dramatic effect.

However, despite that one nitpick I have about this season, there are also a lot of wonderful episodes and storylines that ensue. One of the highlights of season four is Rick's storyline which develops wonderfully on screen. Rick is immediately introduced as a villain right from the start, as we know he's the guy responsible for putting Terri in a coma in season three. Consequently he is shunned and outcasted at school by his peers, which inevitably pushes him over the edge and causes him to bring a gun to school in ""Time Stands Still"", which is still considered one of the shows best, highest rated episodes to date. The aftermath of Rick's actions become a major part of the second half of this season, as some of the main characters are largely effected by what happened.

Other issues covered this season are: bipolar disorder, STDs, and paralysis.

Overall season four is filled with drama and spectacles of great proportions. However, I feel like this season the show lost a bit of its light hearted edge and the issues became less real and relatable and more over the top. However, a couple of great storylines make the season more enjoyable. And like I said, despite some weak points, it's still better than most teen dramas on television today.",1216857600,,2356,4.65625

I enjoy being able to hear the commentary from the actors themselves to know how the felt while filming.
