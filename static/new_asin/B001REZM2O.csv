We rely on the car for even basic tasks such as buying food, going to work, visiting family, etc, things which a century ago (early 1900s) was just a few steps away or a few miles which the horse can take you. This documentary explains better the frustrations and problems that the car brings. It is now the embodiment of a love-hate relationship. We spend so much on not just gasoline, but maintaining and supporting this form of transportation. We go to wars, destroy the environment, become disconnected with other people, and the world, we die each year in these things. It doesn't suggest to get rid of the car, but to think other ways of living. It goes into discussion how the infrastructure is weak and collapsing due to people wanting to live in suburbs. This is a must watch video, along with Zeitgeist: Moving Forward, Affluenza, Escape from Affluenza, Corporation, Surplus, and What Would Jesus Buy? If you are on the path to simplifying your life or finding an alternative way of living and need a pick me up video to inspired you, these videos would be it.

I like the pace of this video and how it uses humor. It isn't a mind numbing humor, but intellectual humor (think Bill Maher). The pace isn't fast nor slow. it is a long documentary though, almost 2 full hours, but you would be captivated and drawn into this documentary and would be disappointed that it ended without a happy ending. We still are living a life that depends on the car and a infrastructure that continues to fall apart.

 I wish to give it all five stars but it does have bad editing with the sound quality. The music at times is louder than the voices of the interviewees, which is distracting and it really messes up the whole experience with this documentary. This isn't the first documentary I had watched that has this issue. Killer At Large (a documentary about the obesity epidemic) has countless of bad music and sound editing quality that causes the music to be louder than the voices which makes it difficult to follow thoroughly what the interviewees are saying in the film.",1426982400,,2194,4.664082687338501

8337854,1,B001REZM2O,"I saw this on CNBC on the 29 August 2011.  It was just the right time to see how stupid this idea of rebuilding the cities.  Hurricane Irene is a good reason for not living in one of these awful rat filled cities.  You can't escape. No one in their right mind would live in these over populated areas, only sheepeople.",1314403200,,318,4.180327868852459
8337855,5,B001REZM2O,"Insightful and on the mark with facts and ideas on how to recreate the unsustainable cities, and suburbs. I guess it's not too surprising Americans do not watch documentaries because our way of life will change soon. Keep the blinders on until the last minute: The American way.....",1277769600,12,282,4.895833333333333
