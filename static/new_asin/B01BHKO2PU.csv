7635183,5,B01BHKO2PU,"This was fantastic, showing how he turned a sick New York City into an up to date place.  If he can do that I think he may be able to get our country straightened out.",1474934400,3,167,3.7714285714285714
7635184,3,B01BHKO2PU,"The DVD is definitely a pro-Trump ""documentary.""  Does not discuss his lawsuits or his shenanigans or his fraud.  A quick shallow over-view of his life and times.  Good enough for those who would vote for him no matter what.",1474070400,,224,4.6923076923076925

7635187,4,B01BHKO2PU,"Whether you like him or not, it is a good documentary on the current Republican candidate to learn of his early years, what formed him, what drives him and to see that his current public persona is the same as it has always been.",1465430400,7,229,4.2272727272727275

He gains success with assistance from tax adjustments. From there he ventures into casinos and even an airline. He appears in TV and movies. Then he has some failings. Insightful, includes TV interviews of himself and others.",1463270400,,480,4.925925925925926
7635189,5,B01BHKO2PU,I love it.  I am impressed with Donald Trump.  It was well done by the producer but it needs more info about Trump's parents.,1462924800,6,125,4.166666666666667

8750210,5,B01BHKO2PU,"As a black person. this was informative. It explained a lot. His father respect. Trump got lucky, and he knows how to use every situation to his advantage. He's not afraid of failing, because its not his money,he doesn't care what people say because in his mind only what he want matters. success is getting up one time more then you fall. God help us. Can anyone say ""House of Cards"", the series",1497052800,,396,4.438356164383562

8750216,4,B01BHKO2PU,"Says quite a bit about the beginning of the man -- good and bad.  It shows his humanity in some of the mistakes he made, but also his genius.",1480032000,2,141,3.8620689655172415

8750218,5,B01BHKO2PU,"Excellent documentary.  I was particularly surprised that his family pastor was Dr. Norman Vincent Peale, the author of The Power of Positive Thinking.  I am not a great fan of Trump in general, there is a lot to be critical of, but there is no denying the man has left an incredible legacy.  He is known for fixing up broken down areas and structures, or building amazing high end properties from nothing.  I am an independent voter in search of both good and bad views of each candidate and I struggle to find anything of substance that Hillary has done for others.  Nothing.  A lot of promises, a lot of legal maneuvers to avoid prosecution, but no substance.  Both candidates are greatly flawed.  But after seeing this I am convinced this man is capable of fixing our broken federal government.",1475107200,10,798,4.65
