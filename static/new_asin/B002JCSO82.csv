He has all the elements to create a series of good DVDs on this dance but has to work on the set-up and sound. Maybe make it a little less homemade and add quality. I've learned many dances and work-outs from DVDs. Good music coming out clear is at least 70% of the enjoyment and is an excellent motivator to return to it frequently. I just love to watch poppers and their moves seem so mystical. Otis makes them accessible and his personal experience as someone who isn't necessarily a ""natural"" and needed to practice hard to learn the moves is encouraging for those who begin or have barriers to cross.
One last thing, his clothing should be a bit less baggy so we can see better the muscle movements.",1253145600,,859,4.443037974683544
