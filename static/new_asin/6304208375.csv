know of that really shows the value of internal martial arts-no apologies. The richness of the films' color; it vividness in focus. I guess this disc was fabricated just for me.....MLJ",1341273600,,298,4.339285714285714
8466475,4,6304208375,"The first time i saw this film was 20 years ago in Brasil in a Festival called ""Week of Chinese Movie"" sponsored by the Embassy of the People's Republic of China. When I came to Japan I was very glad to get a copy of this film.

I strongly recommend this film for all the lovers of the Martial Arts of Wudang for the following reasons:

- the scenario of the film (Monastery of Wudang);

- most of the artists are Martial Arts professionals;

- the artist that plays the role of the old monk in the film wrote himself a book about Tan-Tui that you probably find here in our Amazon Bookstore;

- in this film you can really understand that the world of the martial arts of Wu Dang is not for ""dancing"" but is also for real fight but without forgetting the internal part that is very important aspect in the practice of the Wu Dang Martial Arts;

- shows the moral aspect of the Philosophy of Wudang;

- and the lest but not least, the most important character in the film is a Woman! This is a very important film to be seen for the people that have respect for the Feminine approach. It shows also how strong a woman can be when practicing martial arts correctly.

I do not give 5 stars only because of the plot that I think could be better... but i think it is worth seeing it.
