8172033,5,B000MTEFNW,"I thought it was a great movie.

WARNING: If you bought the DVDs in the ""Miracles Around Us"" series, then DON'T buy this DVD. They are the same miracles, repackaged.",1512864000,,165,4.5
8172034,5,B000MTEFNW,"Okay, my wife experienced an angel visitation just after a near-fatal auto accident.  She does Believe.  This documentary, full of re-enactments, is much like those Urban Legends of yore.  But if the people believe, and they certainly are certain in every case, then how are we to dare throw Science at them?  No way and no use.  The stories are handled well and may not convince anyone, but obviously some people are as sure as a UFO cultist.  No political correctness, please.  You could even take them as All Just Made Up stories.  OR if you are religious already, then they are great examples of angelic interventions.  Certainly interesting even if just as psychology itself is interesting.",1497657600,2,695,4.871794871794871

8172036,5,B000MTEFNW,"I had this collection before. It was on FIVE, collected in a box, DVDs!
Each of the five ""volumes"" ranged between 42 and 63 minutes, each.
Excellent stories combined onto ONE digital video disc. each volume
has four or five stories. Great stuff!
Never know when/where you MIGHT meet YOUR angel.",1492473600,3,294,4.784313725490196

8172040,5,B000MTEFNW,angels in disguise is a great show. i believe it was adapted from miracles and other wonders. it describes true-life encounters people have had with angels. i love this show. it will open your mind for those non-believers. it is 300 minutes of angel stories. my favorite episodes are 'barney the trucker' and 'little blue girl.' this set has 5 dvd's. it is much better than another angel dvd set called 'angels sent on assignment.' they cut off too much of the story and the voice overs are terrible. if you are looking for an angel set. angels in disguise is the one to get.,1237161600,17,575,4.485714285714286
