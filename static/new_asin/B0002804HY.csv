We used to just watch people dancing Salsa, but thanks to this DVD we learn in one week and a half, now our friends ask us how we learn to fast and nice. The three different angle view make it easy to follow the steps. Thanks to whoever make this DVD. That was a great idea. We recomend it to anybody who want to learn easy and fast.

The combination of the angles, Gigi's enthusiasm, the music, the spirit and learning in private a new dance made this the best learning DVD I've bought in a long time.  I recommend it to anyone out there who needs a lift (and I don't mean a face lift).  This works!!",1086048000,4,397,4.171052631578948

Gigi, the instructor, is clear and easy to follow.  The 26 lessons are easy and as they progress, challenging enough for beginners like me.  Moreover, the set has a classy and old world feel that makes me think of Cuba, as well as the music.

I never thought that learning to dance salsa could be this fun and easy.  I highly recommend it.",1085961600,2,505,4.28421052631579
2065985,5,B0002804HY,"If you want to learn a dance, you have to sweat it on the dance floor for hours? Wrong. This guide to dirty salsa is the best proof to that. Even I could learn this, after going only once through the material. Anything that wasn't exactly clear the first time, no problem - change angle, repeat. Or change angle as you go.
The guide is actually not quick and dirty, just quick. The only dirty trick I've noticed is the ease of gradual introduction - good pedagogy. I wish I had courses like this for other skills I had to learn.
The ability to change angles is a great invention, and I can imagine, off the top of my head, several other things which can be taught to anyone much better, if only the student could see it from multiple angles - driving, magician's tricks, fencing... you name it.",1085875200,9,794,4.3355704697986575
2065986,5,B0002804HY,"As founder and developer of the All-Music Guide (allmusic.com) and the All-Movie Guide (allmovie.com), I have had the opportunity to review a great deal of music and film. I have been following dance music and videos for years, and Latin music in particular. And that is what moves me to write something about this amazing dance DVD.
Being a little bit of a DVD fanatic, I just have to say: FINALLY we have a high-quality DVD with true multi-angle shots! Even if I didn't want to dance to salsa music, I would keep this DVD just to show off my player. This entire DVD, from start to finish, is seamlessly viewable from three angles, which I choose at any time at the touch of a button, viewing everything from the back, the front, and from above. Why have we not seen the likes of this before?
And what a great way to learn to dance! This is the best dance video I have yet to see. The three angles give me a 360-degree view of what is going on. If I can't quite get the steps from one angle, I just look at it from another angle and there there they are. This is the way all dance videos should work.
The 26 lessons (I am at lesson 7) are clear and easy to follow. The steps are elegant and each lesson is broken out, so I can follow them, taking me from the very beginning (which is where I am at) to quite complex maneuvers. Did I mention that I can see them from any angle I choose? And the music is state-of-the art salsa.

 It is not labeled as Cuban Salsa. That means the people who buy it are mislead.
 The men are not taught how to lead.
 Voice leading rather than by your hands smacks of Rueda more than Salsa.
 I could go on...but I have already wasted enough time on it.
 The format for teaching was very good and easy to understand but if I buy a table and get a chair, even if the chair perfect, I will rate one star only...because I wanted a TABLE!!!",1200787200,8,630,4.0894308943089435

I'll be very pleased with myself if I can master everything in this beginning DVD.  You may be very impressed with all you can learn too, especially if you are like me and haven't really been exposed to salsa before.

Then I got a boyfriend last year and he felt kinda left out when we went to salsa clubs, cause he never did salsa in his life. Now to be honest I'm not much of a teacher, and he doesn't have the money for actual classes, so we had a problem. Then my teacher mentioned something about some dirty guide to salsa, I gotta admit at first I was a little sceptical, but we bought it anyway. And it's fantastic, it's so easy and so much fun and Gigi is so awesome too.

So when I got it at my party we all laughed and said we would all be amzing salsa dancers by the end of the night. A couple of hours later we went through the entire dvd and all of us could do all the steps Gigi taught us that night, from Abajo to El Dos. And the fact that we could still follow the instructions after the 2 bottles of tequilla the eight of us finished that night, proves to me that this is the best Salsa dvd you can find on this planet.",1170979200,3,554,3.7844827586206895
2066002,1,B0002804HY,"I didn't like this video. It's purely cuban salsa. The instructors aren't mastering basic dance principles. Technically speaking, very poor. The only good thing about this video is the way they introduce the different camera angles.

Having the dvd works much better for us.  Now we practice a couple times a week for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours and we have improved significantly.  The different angles and the ability to replay each new step is great.  The only issue we have is that in some of the later more complex steps, a little more instruction could be given, but by watching it a couple of times we eventually get it.  We are definitely going to order Part 2.  We also have the dvd on our potential gift list for couples!",1168300800,2,651,4.086614173228346
2066004,2,B0002804HY,"First off the use of multiple camera angles is quite helpful and is a feature that should be used for every learn how to dance video.  However beyond that a key and essential part of Salsa is missing here - how to lead each move.  There is no way to use the DVD alone with its instruction and become proficient at leading.  For this reason I think this DVD is not a good purchase.

It is also worth noting that this is Miami or Cuban Style Salsa - make sure that is what people dance in your area before you potentially waste money on this DVD.",1158278400,13,544,4.10377358490566

This feature is essential when you need to review a move 30 times in order to finally get it.  Gigi's verbal instructions are clear and concise.  At the end, the dancers actually show you how to dance, using the moves you learn.  Now I mention this because in the succeeding DVDs (volume 2 (intermediate) and volume 3 (advanced)), the dancers show you the moves, and they dance at the end, but the final dance moves are not what is actually taught throughout the DVD.  But, in it's entirety, volume 1 (for beginners) is the best dance DVD I've ever seen.",1155168000,7,653,4.547008547008547

I also ordered another DVD, but was unsatisfied due to the slow pace. I don't think that this would be good for someone who has never listened to salsa before. As the title says, it is the QUICK and DIRTY guide to Salsa. I think that they assume that those who purchase it have at least some knowledge/interest in dancing in general, and have at least some sense of rhythm.

Either way, I'd definitely recommend it...Great Buy, Great Instruction, Great Fun.",1142467200,6,598,4.4363636363636365

Learn the hot dance steps that will cause loud gasps and jaws to drop ... Anyone who loves Latin American or Caribbean music (Cuban or Puerto Rican) can learn to salsa. This DVD is the ideal gift for couples who want to spice up a relationship and love to dance. The catchy phrases and counting method used by Gigi as she teaches the steps are not difficult to follow. Miami style salsa dancing never looked so good ... as when taught by this young and talented couple. If you want to dazzle and impress ... this is how to do it! Learn to salsa and enjoy yourself!

The most amazing feature on this DVD is the ability to program the views ... This means you can view the dance steps and moves from different angles. This *one* unique feature sets these dance lessons far above the competition in providing the means to learn better and more easily. The different views make it possible for the learner to see the steps and practice as if a ""live"" instructor were in the same room. You feel as the instructor is right next to you.  There are times when it is easier to learn dance steps if you are behind the instructor, this is possible with the programmable feature. This DVD teaches about 20 or so dance steps ... all of which are easy to follow. This is one of the best ways to learn this dance. Live dance instruction is very expensive, this DVD set is a true value. Most importantly, one can learn the Miami style salsa dance moves that will make you feel like a super-star when out on the dance floor. Erika Borsos (erikab93)",1141948800,7,1655,4.422950819672131
2066027,4,B0002804HY,"* Teaches miami style turnpatterns, se below

* The patterns are shown in a straight forward way and are easy to watch and understand

* There are not a lot of details about leading and following or other technique

* The counting of steps is 123 456 with no mentioning of the structure of the music. This could be confusing if you are used to counting 1234 5678 with steps on 123 567. No great disadvantage though - you soon get a hang of this way of counting

* You can't read which turns are on the DVD on the box. This is a disadvantage. Of course you can write out the list from the homepage

* The menu system when using a DVDplayer-remote is a bit complicated. You have to press a lot on the arrows on your remote if you want to select among the different turns. On your computer it is a lot easier

2066028,3,B0002804HY,"This video will help beginners nail down the basic step, but the instructors do not cover the beat of the music, nor how to lead and follow.  One of the better salsa videos, but not the best I've seen.",1141171200,3,201,4.153846153846154
2066029,2,B0002804HY,"I have started taking Salsa classes a couple of months ago. I thought a DVD might be helpful in teaching me some more details or refining my skills. I live in East Coasts United States and I am dancing Salsa LA style which is more frequently tought in classes and danced in the clubs all over The US. There were several shortcomings in the above mentioned dvd series:

1- the countings were different; As a beginner to salsa music and dance I believe it is of utmost importance that the rhythm be tought and mentioned correctly. the dancers were dancing on 1 which is what I'm trying to learn, but they were counting 123-456 and basically the pauses were not tought/counted/or considered. I think teaching to appreciate and understand the pause on 4 and 8 in Salsa music is very important to a beginner.

2- there were only three basic steps tought on DVD; simple basic and back rocking and side steps. I was looking for more combinations of shinings and steps like suzikioo, cumbia, cucaracha, mambos, none of which were included in any of the double dvd set.

3- all turns were slightly different from what I'm trying to learn; right underarm/left underarm/inside turns/double turns were not the same way I'm learning.

4-another very important shortcoming is that the instructors do not give any clue to the guy or lady about the basic rules of keeping connections/following the hand signals/leading and following.

5- I mostly tried to use the back angle which corresponds to the way I'm standing in front of the TV , but it was more confusing than helpful as it is not filmed exactly from the back but more from the side/back.

Over all, The DVD is neat and the moves are easy to learn for someone who has no clue of Salsa dancing and wants to learn by DVD. the instructions on the moves are clear...but you have to first find out about the style of salsa you're trying to learn or is danced more around you!",1140739200,9,1913,4.578947368421052
2066030,4,B0002804HY,"As several other reviewers have pointed out, I think it would be pretty hard to learn salsa moves from this DVD.  The segments go by quickly, don't tell leaders how to guide the followers, and say nothing about body styling.  During the segment in which the instructors dance to music, they fall out of rhythm (perhaps because of a production glitch).

But the DVD is a *great* way to review and reinforce moves you've learned in a class.  I personally find it takes repetition, spaced out over a span of time, before a move really sinks in.  Such repetition can be hard to achieve in a class setting, especially the brief classes offered by dance clubs at the start of an evening.  I can't begin to estimate the number of moves I've learned and then forgotten for want of reinforcement.  So this DVD fills an important role.  It and the intermediate-level DVD describe a wide range of moves and provide a clear, consistent level of instruction.

This DVD shows Miami-style salsa, which differs from the other styles danced in North America, such as NY or LA style.  Miami style is *not* quite the same as Cuban style (or, to be more precise, Cuban style as danced on the island).  The debate among aficionados of the different styles can get overheated, but it is something to be aware of.  I would recommend not buying this DVD until you ascertain that your instructor teaches Miami style, or else you're simply going to be frustrated.",1132358400,11,1437,4.658730158730159
2066031,5,B0002804HY,"Finally here is a DVD that beginners can actually learn from. Gigi does a great job at teaching the steps in a very simple manner. As far as a review that was posted about how this is not a popular dance style in the US and how it's not useful that Gigi shouts out the names of the turns, I'd like to explain a little something.

Cuban salsa (also known as Casino or Rueda, when danced with multiple partners) is very popular in Miami, DC, and now up and booming in NYC. The reason why the turns are shouted out is because when danced in a cirlce with multiple partners, all the men need to be able to start the same turn at the same time...people have even devised a sort of sign language for the turns too (in case the club is too loud).

I've been to clubs in NYC where I've been able to dance this kind of salsa...for one there is The_Underscore on 1st ave and 90-something street. I've also been to outdoor summer festivals where you can see a circle of partners doing crazy turns and switching partners (Rueda). This is a very fun style of salsa!",1129593600,5,1052,4.2288557213930345
2066032,2,B0002804HY,"Like another reviewer mentioned, Gigi doesn't pay attention to leading at all which

from a male point of view is terrible. You might learn the moves but you have no idea how

to lead the woman.

So for men I don't consider this a good beginner dvd. It's very

important to learn how to lead properly.

Personally I didn't like the fact that all the names of the moves

were repeated so often. It was really distracting and although it

might be nice to know the names it isn't really helpful since every salsa

teacher seems to use a bit different terminology.",1126051200,12,561,4.431372549019608

2066034,5,B0002804HY,"If you are intersted in becoming a good salsa dancer you're worries are over.  Why go out and spend a whole bunch of time and money on dancing classes when you could do it in the privacy of you're own home.  This DVD takes advantage of one of the best features available but never used by others which is the multi-angle feature.  This feature allowes the watcher to experience the instructions from three different angles.  In return the watcher is able to see every aspect of the body positioning while dancing salsa.  It is no news that sooner or later every dance DVD will copy and use technology, but why wait if it is already out there.  If you are a person that think they have two left feel this DVD will prove that stylish salsa dancing is only as hard as you make it seem.  Through meticulous step by step instructions The Quick and Dirty Guide To Salsa lets anybody explore this raw, sensual, Cuban salsa style dance.  I my self do not consider my self of being a great dancer but after a few weeks of practicing with the instructions of this DVD have become a much confident dancer on the dance floor.  I know this because I have been recieving many compliments at some of the hottest Latin Salsa clubs in New York city even though I am Jewish.  My rating of this DVD is two thumbs up.  You will not believe the results and the satifaction that this film provides.

2066035,4,B0002804HY,"I received this DVD as a gift.  Its not a bad DVD, in fact I thought it was nicely produced and the multiple angles is a nice touch.  I really liked the pace of the DVD moving from one move to the other in quick order -- sort of the fashion that Al and Edie Espinosa (my personal favorites) teach on some of their instructional videos.  The instructors seem competent and were able to explain each move, more or less, clearly.  Although all my dance experience is on the West Coast, I have taken dance instruction from an instructor who learned in Miami.  All of the moves described in this video (and for that matter her next video) are what I learned as Casino Rueda from that instructor.  Perhaps, Casino Rueda and Cuban Style Salsa are one and the same.  Since I only know and met one person/instructor from Miami I cannot conclusively determine that fact from my experience.  However, if they are not one and the same then renaming this video to, ""casino rueda with the partner changes"" would be more accurate.  That in itself is not a bad thing especially if you've never been exposed to casino and have been dancing for a bit since this will definitely give you an opportunity (along with the part 2 video) to give your dancing a different look.  It may be confusing to someone who is a beginner and has already been exposed to other salsa styles.",1121558400,4,1354,4.467479674796748
2066036,1,B0002804HY,"I was very unimpressed with this DVD.  Yes, the video was filmed well and worked well with the multiple angles.  But the dancing was very confusing.  The basic step is backwards from anything I've ever seen and I've been dancing for 5 years in the U.S. and Latin America.  And they made up ridiculous names for each move.  All in all, the DVD was useless and pointless.  There are a lot of good dance instruction DVD's out there and this is not one of them.",1121126400,7,457,4.317647058823529

I hope other dance lesson video makers follow their lead (no pun intended) about the helpfulness of the varying camera angles, amount of repetition and use of DVD (over vhs only due to the ease of rewinding and pausing DVD's afford over VHS).

The first thing I noticed were the production values which are very good. The setting is visually appealing, elegant without being distracting. It combines nicely with some creative graphics to give that good first impression that you never get a second chance at.
As for the instruction, what we're all really here for, it was first rate. It's a step by step approach that's  clear and easy to follow.
One of the things that I liked most was the choice of three different camera angles which enabled you to see each step from a variety of different prospectives.
The menu was extremely helpful. It was quite detailed and allowed you to quickly find whatever you're looking for.
At the end there is a complete review both with and without music which is a nice touch.

This DVD doesn't really cover all of the basic moves one would expect a DVD for beginners should cover.  It covers some basic steps and then launches into intermediate moves.  Also, the man in the DVD is not very skilled.  It looks as though he was pulled off the street and given a crash course in salsa, and not a very good course at that.  As a DVD for beginners, it gets two stars.  If it were for intermediate students, I would give it three or four.  As for the DVD's marketing campaign, I give it five.

I think some of the reviews are funny.  The instructor gave a move a Spanish name and she threw some of you a curve.  A cross body is a cross body lead regardless of the name.

I've been to classes and met people from all over the country who have learned salsa, and there are certain things that really are basic: the basic step, cross body leads, left and right turns.  When I watched this video I saw dancing completely unlike what I've seen before. On the web site I learned that this is an essentially new style developed at a specific dance school in Miami.  I plan to keep this DVD on the shelf and learn from it when I've got the basics down, because it is some nice dancing.  But if you're just starting this isn't the DVD for you because it teaches an entirely different vocabulary of moves than you're going to find in the clubs or the classes.  If it were named for the style it teaches and marketed to experienced dancers it would be fine.

I checked out the websites mentioned on the dvd and I couldn't believe it! Someone has created an online salsa community to back up the dvd.  Many people are new to salsa like me but there are also tons of seasoned veterans out there for you to contact.  I've never seen anything like this really but i like it.  check out [...] if you're interested.  The actual dvd is great!  It teaches some salsa basics and it shows you the steps from EVERY angle!!!  This is really cool because i've always wanted to use the angle button on the dvd remote, and someone finally gave me the chance.  With those really good angles it helped me pick up the steps really quick.  I watched the disc all the way through once with my girlfriend, Then we restarted it and followed along.  an hour or so later we were both downloading some salsa music to dance to.  It's really fun!!!  I would definitely recommend buying this!!  I did, even though i already had a copy i wanted to show my support so i went ahead and bought one for my parents right here!  I think I'll give it to them for Christmas.  You should do the same...

2066052,5,B0002804HY,"The DVD back cover says that the Quick & Dirty Guide to Salsa was made by former struggling students of salsa, so we don't feel as if we're being talked down to by lofty experts. A refreshingly new approach to instruction which in my case worked amazingly well. This DVD makes us feel good about ourselves.

The instructors lead us from basic steps for both partners to increasingly complex moves. The lessons are very well paced so that the moves keep building on each other.  The instructions are without music and without self promotion so that we can concentrate on learning the steps without distraction. The menu lists the DVD by dance step, so if we need to go over some more, we can jump right to it.

The multi-angle feature of this DVD is really very useful however, the most striking feature of this DVD is the pleasant and likeable personalities of the instructors. Gigi and Pedro.

2066057,5,B0002804HY,"Salsa, unlike merengue, is a bit complicated and it can take a while before one can get good at it.  This well-crafted and conceptually pioneering DVD will definitely put us on the fast lane on the road toward becoming that smooth and sexy salsa dancer.

The DVD allows us to see the two instructors going through the various cool moves at three (3) different angles.  What a novel idea.  If a spin move is not clear to your mind's eye, you can check it out from a different angle!

Practise your moves while watching this innovative DVD, and soon you will be able to strut your stuff on the big dance floor at the Copacabana Club in New York!

The instructors pace themselves well so that a viewer will remain mentally engaged but at the same time won't have trouble remembering and memorizing each new dance move.  The main instructor Gigi is very good, and her instructions are easy to follow.

I haven't seen a salsa instructional DVD like this one.  It's unique and highly recommended.

I wish I had this DVD all along because learning from this DVD has been the easiest so far. The three-angle concept is a must see. This is revolutionary approach to dance instruction, since it allows the viewer to see complicated moves from different perspectives and get a better sense of what's going on at any given time. I have seen nothing like this before and I bet this incredible feature will be copied by other dance instructors before long. The instructors, Gigi and Pedro, are straightforward and thorough. Surprisingly, they seem like regular people instead of perfect specimens. I especially love the review with music chapter. The instructor lets you practice the steps learned. Gigi calls out the steps with key instructions to the rocking Salsa hit ""El Preso"" by Fruko. The only Salsa instructor that had the sense to do this.

It is an unbelieveable multi-media, surround sound extravaganza from the Father of Digital Media- Laurence Gartel.  This guy is in the permanent collection of the Smithsonian.  I recommend the Quick and Dirty Guide to Salsa if you want an entertaining way to ""learn"" Salsa. and if you want to experience something absolutely out of this world, then take a look at the Laurence Gartel DVD. They are completely different products that have absolutely nothing to do with each other.",1097020800,5,764,4.838461538461538
2066062,5,B0002804HY,"I used to believe there were two kinds of people: those who could dance and those who could not (and, more importantly, should not).  I of course have always counted myself among the latter.  The Quick and Dirty Guide to Salsa, Part One - Beginners has opened my eyes to a vast new world, however.  Could I, one of the most uncoordinated individuals on the face of the earth, actually learn to dance?  And I'm not talking about the kind of dancing Howard Sprague learned to do on The Andy Griffith Show - that's basically just walking around with a partner.  I'm talking about Salsa dancing, the hottest dancing I know of, with all of its intricacies, fluid movements, and unadulterated fun.  With the help of this amazing DVD, the impossible has truly been changed to the possible.

This DVD is specifically aimed at beginners; hopefully, DVDs for more advanced Salsa skills will be forthcoming from the guys and gals at Debdoot Das.  When you begin the lessons, you immediately find yourself in very good hands.  The lovely Gigi is a great teacher, and her partner Pedro adds a number of very helpful tips for male partners as we progress through the steps.  Gigi starts at the very beginning, telling you what to do, showing you how to do it, and giving you the chance to do the steps along with her.  As she gradually moves to more complicated moves, she works them into an increasingly comprehensive practice routine - what this means is that you basically practice all of the moves you have learned so far with each advancing lesson.  You can't forget what has come before because Gigi doesn't let you.  I won't name all of the different moves featured in this instructional DVD, but Gigi repeats each of them often enough that you know what move she is calling for when she calls for it.  She also counts out the rhythm and pauses that make up each dance move, helping ensure you get not only the moves but the timing of those moves down pat.

The real secret to this DVD's success, aside from the wonderful Gigi, is of course the inclusion of three distinct camera angles.  The instructional video runs for roughly 48 minutes; multiply that by the three camera angles and you get a thorough lesson of well over two hours.  I would start, obviously, with the Front Angle because it lets you see the basic moves in the clearest of fashions (and Gigi is addressing you from this camera perspective).  It can be hard to see what the dancers are doing at times, though, especially when one partner is moving in front of the other - that is where the other viewing angles come in.  The High Angle viewpoint not only gives you a higher vantage point from which to observe the movements, it also offers a more close-up view of the action.  The Back Angle is truly great and helpful - now you can see all the stuff you could not see from the other two angles (it also offers other advantages that I, as a guy, appreciated).  These multiple-angle viewpoints are immeasurably helpful in making sure you can see exactly what each dancer is doing at all times.

It is also important to note that Gigi and Pedro make Salsa dancing fun, even when they are showing you the most basic of steps.  They also make it seem easy to learn.  Only after they have gone through all of the lessons and reviewed the moves multiple times do they add music to the mix.  I also liked the fact that they did not actually dance until the end of the lessons - I think this is important because Salsa dancing itself looks like something I could never possibly learn.  If I had seen how hard it looks before learning the basic moves, I would have been less confident and thus have gotten less out of these lessons than I did.

Simply stated, this DVD and a dance partner are all you need to learn basic Salsa dancing.  If you want to learn but are too shy to take lessons, this DVD is perfect for you.  You can't just watch the DVD and expect the information sink in, of course; you have to get up and do what Gigi and Pedro are showing you.  At the very end of the lessons, Gigi and Pedro show you what more advanced Salsa dancing looks like, and I guarantee this will get you even more excited about practicing what you have learned and more than anxious to see a hoped-for follow-up DVD aimed at intermediate Salsa students.",1095552000,102,4299,4.467349551856594
2066063,5,B0002804HY,"There are two facts in life ... One, Latinos know how to party, and, two, they know how to dance .... so .. having hung with the crowd for years I had the mistaken notion that I knew how to dance salsa. It always looked so smooth and natural that I thought people just made up their own moves to the hot rythm and beat of the music. Not only are the moves sexy and sweet to watch it's impossible not to jump up and get into it ......

This DVD has most certainly educated me that salsa is not a free form dance but rather that it has structure and discipline....  the hard part of the dance is making it look so carefree and natural. Everyone in the room immediately let me know that if I wanted free form I should stick to 'merengue'...

Anyway, the dance instructor Gigi is fab ... the girl has a teacher's genes in her as she takes the uniniated, MYSELF, through the beginner steps in a crisp, clean and concise manner making you believe that the most important thing in her mind is that you learn these steps, and learn them fast.

I first watched the DVD with a group of family and friends, mostly Colombians and Puerto Ricans, yeah now there's a mix, and while the first steps piqued their interest it was the more advanced beginner moves that soon had all of us up'n dancin ..

The DVD is professionally made, it's totally interactive and allows the user to easily access any steps quickly. We all agreed that we like the 'High Angle' view the best, and like I said, with Gigi and Pedro disecting the steps and the great graphics you'll soon be movin with the best of them ..

One note of caution with this DVD ... I was told to keep my eyes on it cause the odds are good that my 'friends' were all tempted take it for their own collection ..... now where is that DVD of mine anyway ... LOL",1094860800,11,1797,4.194202898550724

Salsa is an intoxicating Latin rhythm with endlessly romantic music and very sensual dancing.  Watching well trained couples dance Salsa gives the same pleasure as watch the pros Tango.  There is a liquid beauty that is infectious.  With this DVD, taught by a very personable and competent pair of dancers named Gigi and Pedro, every movement is given a name for reference purposes, meticulously demonstrated, combined with another set of moves until by Chapter 26, you have it all.  The three angles of camera work, so easily accessible by the click of a button, allow the student to fully comprehend the moves - in 3D!  The graphics and segues that propel this disc are first class - but then everything about this entertaining and instructive DVD is 'top of the class'.  Highly recommended, not only for the students of Salsa, but to everyone who just wants to discover how fun the new dance sensation can be.",1093910400,8,1260,4.67420814479638
2066066,5,B0002804HY,"This is a very cute DVD lesson set for learning Salsa dancing. Gigi, the instructor and her partner Pedro take you from simple forward and back steps to ""Kentucky"" or a complicated turn. There are twenty-six lessons, and best of all, the DVD gives you a choice of angles to observe the steps. You can take front, back or high-angle and this gives you much more information about the dance steps than a single camera angle or cameraman's choice would ever do. The steps are called out by their names in Spanish: Enchufla, Adios a la Hermanas, etc, so you learn the proper terminology.

The chapters are organized by steps that are related to each other, then at the end you have a chance to review with music. And there's a teaser for Quick and Dirty Salsa Part Two and Three, where the turns get more complicated and there are some more moves (dips, etc.)

This is a nice, clean production with good organization on the DVD, nothing fancy but well-filmed, clear and simple. If you were taking Salsa in a class, this could be a fantastic review, and if you want to see if Salsa dancing is for you, try this. I think ""Quick and Dirty Guide to Salsa"" is very well-done, indeed.

8023383,4,B0002804HY,"Cuban salsa is a awesome style.  you really want to learn this stuff.  ignore the short falls of this dvd, because they correct everything by the second dvd, and it all comes together.

the first video is kinda shakey on its own.  the moves are good, but as other writers have noted, the female teacher leads from the back the whole time.
the Rueda calls are not a bad idea.  In Rueda the moves are called out like square dancing. so if you're super new, you don't have to think ahead, which can be intimidating at first. having the moves called out ahead is good for new leads, who are just getting the muscle memory.

so,  try to ignore the female teacher is leading from the back.  the male teacher is a good lead -  watch his movements.  he just seems a little camera shy or whatever.  in teh second video, the guy is much stronger.  he talks through his own parts and does a great job leading a freestyle at the end.",1268784000,2,921,4.2601156069364166
8023384,1,B0002804HY,"You cannot learn to dance salsa from this DVD because they do not teach how to lead! This DVD teaches a certain type of salsa called Rueda Casino, which is the salsa equivalent of square dancing. The moves are called out by someone, and then all the couples in the circle do the move. As a beginner, you cannot learn to dance regular club salsa from this DVD.

My wife and I bought this DVD, and were completely frustrated because we would learn the moves (yes, Gigi is very good at teaching them), but then I had no idea how to signal that we were going to do a particular one. My wife and I would end up arguing because she wouldn't know what I was trying to get her to do. It was only after I bought another salsa DVD from a different company (SalsaCrazy) that I realized what was going on. In dancing there is a leader and a follower. Period. It is the leaders responsibility to choreograph the dance by linking together patterns, to communicate clearly to the follower what is coming next, and to make the follower look good.

This DVD teaches the patterns, but in a mechanical, clunky sort of way, and then gives NO instruction on leading--the single most important part of dancing!  I actually had to unlearn the material taught in this DVD before I could progress using the other approach. Now (due entirely to the SalsaCrazy series) my wife and I are dancing salsa at clubs, and I can dance with any woman there, because I know how to signal to her what pattern is coming next. Maybe if you already know how to lead in salsa this DVD would be useful, but if you do, then you probably would not need the DVD in the first place. Do NOT buy this DVD.",1266451200,10,1656,4.318327974276527
8023385,5,B0002804HY,This was one of the best instructional DVD's I have purchased.  The instructor teaches at a good pace as she and her partner illustruates the steps.  I also like that she calls out each of the steps which allows you to know what steps to do next. I particularly like the end of the DVD where you can follow along as they dance to the music (which is a summary of all of the steps you have learnt).,1251849600,,397,4.076923076923077
8023386,5,B0002804HY,"So easy to follow!
This is REAL salsa shown in a way for REAL people to follow and learn. We are having a blast with this video. I ordered this vid because my girl wanted to learn salsa, but now Im hooked! Becoming a saucy salsa dancer is the way to look like a stud! Cant wait to get Vol 2.",1236297600,,291,3.7868852459016393
