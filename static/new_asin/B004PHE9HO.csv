8437686,5,B004PHE9HO,"My 2-year-old grandson, MJ, absolutely loves Barney.  I sent him this DVD along with countless others for his birthday.  I haven't seen him in awhile since he currently lives in Germany (both parents are military), but I understand that he trained himself on using the DVD player and watches each one over and over and over...
