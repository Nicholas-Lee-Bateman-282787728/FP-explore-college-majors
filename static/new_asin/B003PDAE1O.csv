8521644,5,B003PDAE1O,"This video really compliments the book and visa versa in that it really helped me continue to challenge myself in all aspects of my life in becoming a more conscious person to better my marriage, personal life, and relationship with God.  Rebecca is very honest and humble when sharing her experiences of life that helped her create this work, and that really comes across through this video.  You can tell that she genuinely cares about the people she comes in contact with, and she is even more amazing in person.  She is so down to earth and willing to talk to anyone that reaches out to her for advice and help.  The work that she is doing through this video on the shadow and her workbook have really changed my life in a big way, and you can easily identify with her because she does not mind sharing her struggles in life that have created a passion for learning and teaching this pertinent information.  I would definitely recommend this video and workbook to anyone who is tired of all the self help authors and gimmicks, and if you are ready to first be honest with yourself because she will take you places that you did not know existed within yourself. Second this is a lifetime process, and I am so glad to have someone like Rebecca available to me for advise and encouragement through this, and I know that she will be there for you as long as you are ready for the challenge.  We all know that people are in our lives for a reason, and we all know the saying, ""love your enemies"", and this video and book really tackle that proclamation by explaining the importance of having enemies in our lives.  That is because they teach us the most about ourselves if we are willing to humble ourselves and accept that usually the things we do like in someone else really have to do with what we do not like about ourselves.  Thank you Rebecca for all your love and support.  ------Samuel N. Cruz",1305158400,,1900,4.452449567723343
