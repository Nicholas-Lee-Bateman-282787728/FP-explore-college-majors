8619235,4,B00FXOO16C,didnt see the movie yet-eliska.,1503792000,,31,5.4
8619236,3,B00FXOO16C,"The twist wasn't that twisty (I figured out the angle almost immediately), but it's a prison break movie with a sense of suspense. The main actor and the lady cop were what got most of the stars here as their characters are smart and tough. The hero is resourceful. The villains villainous. But I find myself feeling a bit bored in spots. The ending wasn't particularly satisfying.",1473638400,,381,4.701492537313433

8619240,5,B00FXOO16C,"Is to protect your kids. This superbly crafted French film follows the path of others such as ""Spiral"" and ""Tell No One"". It may not be an original plot, but it is so well written, acted, and directed - right down to the end credits that match the actor to the face so you see who is who - its a first rate thriller. If the last line doesn't send an arrow of love and hope through your heart, you're doomed. Not to be missed.",1395705600,3,425,4.011764705882353
8619241,3,B00FXOO16C,"listening to French while moved up and down on a walking machine, it's an enjoyable pick.

Yet, the plot is not so fabulous and the development of each major character not fine and deep. And in the last part, when Frank struggling on the bush down along the cliff and then got shot by a old mountain dweller seems to me difficult to fit in the movie.",1394928000,,350,4.223880597014926
8619242,5,B00FXOO16C,I would recommend this to any movie fan who loves lots of suspense AND action!  I really enjoyed this movie.,1394064000,2,108,4.4
8619243,3,B00FXOO16C,"The only ""troubling"" thing about this movie is that it is  french movie and only understanding english and spanish, I had to read every caption. With that said it was a fair movie to watch.",1393027200,,189,4.4
8619244,1,B00FXOO16C,"Repeat Terrible! Not even worth the extra time to write a review, but feel compelled
to save another viewer time wasted & money. Nothing but awful in every sense.",1392422400,2,162,4.620689655172414
