7992480,2,B00009PBYE,"A depressed Canadian hit-man (Donald Sutherland) spends a lot of time brooding over his bad marriage and the disappearance of his wife and very little time doing his job which is extremely unfortunate for the audience.  Eventually he is given a shy (this movie's jargon for a hit) in England that he is highly suspicious of but he can't back out because he spent the advance money on an expensive gift for his missing wife.

Over the course of the movie three different characters reveal their obsession with Sutherland's wife but, despite extensive flashbacks, the filmmakers never manage to make her an interesting or even mildly desirable character--we pretty much have to take on faith that there is some reason men obsess over her.

At times The Disappearance feels like one of John Le Carre's tales of deceit and double-crosses, but with crucial pages ripped out so that the thing no longer makes much sense.  The movie wastes a fine cast--Donald Sutherland, David Warner, David Hemmings, John Hurt and Christopher Plummer--but it hardly matters if the movie doesn't give anyone anything interesting to do or say.  The Disappearance is a pretentious and dull waste of time.",1416787200,,1179,4.994897959183674
7992481,4,B00009PBYE,"Determinedly arthouse despite its purely commercial pulp plot, Cooper's The Disappearance - a film that disappeared from distribution for decades itself - isn't particularly good, yet there's still something there that keeps drawing you back every decade or so to see if it's got any better. It hasn't, yet there's still something haunting about this mood piece's chilly atmosphere and alienated emotional landscape. Shot in snowy Canada and England in late fall to take advantage of two sets of tax breaks, Donald Sutherland's the expert hitman too preoccupied with the disappearance of his wife (Sutherland's offscreen partner Francine Racette) to accept a 'shy' from his increasingly impatient bosses, who run their assassination bureau from a smart office like a management consultancy. There's more brooding on where their relationship may have fallen apart than thriller mechanics, with the coldness of the landscape spreading to the interiors and the characters. At times you feel this wants to be a slightly Boormanesque exercise in subverting the genre a la Point Blank (unsurprisingly, Lee Marvin was Cooper's first choice for the lead), particularly in the opening assassination on an abandoned ship, but the idea's often better than the execution.

Still, Cooper assembles a good cast to keep things interesting: David Warner, an unseen voice of authority figures in Cooper's previous film Overlord, appears onscreen this time as a disillusioned assassination executive, a young John Hurt is the too eager assassin's apprentice Sutherland finds himself saddled with, Virginia McKenna is remarkably effective as the wife of the potential target who has long since lost her illusions about her marriage, Peter Bowles does a nice line in corporate slime, Christopher Plummer turns up turns up to give an object lesson in how to almost steal a film with less than three minutes screentime in one effective confrontation and there's a chance to see co-producer David Hemmings giving a nicely understated cameo as Racette's equally obsessed ex-husband in the days before his eyebrows became large enough to support their own weather system. It's definitely a film whose credits lead you to expect more - it's adapted from a novel by Derek Marlowe, always better at premise than plotting, with a screenplay by two-time Nic Roeg collaborator Paul Mayersberg with crisp, clinical cinematography by Kubrick favorite John Alcott - but while it repeatedly fails to deliver still leaves a few resonant echoes in its wake.

Twilight Time's Region A-locked limited edition Blu-ray offers two of the three cuts of the film that exist. The best and most familiar to UK audiences from its screening on UK TV and very brief subsequent arthouse cinema release is the 101-minute director's cut. They've obvious only had access to a standard definition master, which is too dark in places, fullframe and has moments where the edge enhancement is a bit wobbly, but is still acceptable considering the film's rarity. The shorter 91-minute cut of the film offered in a beautifully remastered high definition widescreen transfer is something of a mystery: unlike the much reviled chronologically re-edited US version with a hideously inappropriate semi-disco synth score that was pulled from release after a single day (the opening 15 minutes of which are included as an extra), this retains the flashback approach but still moves some scenes around - the opening killing, for example, comes much later in the film when Sutherland and Warner discuss it and different shots and alternate takes are used for Sutherland's departure from Canada and his searching the shy's house. As Cooper notes in the accompanying interview on the disc, it's fairly sympathetic to his original intentions and structure, though no-one seems to know quite where it came from or who re-edited it (though there is a theory that co-producer David Hemmings may have had a hand in it while other sources suggest, somewhat less credibly, it was an alternate re-edit by Fima Noveck, who re-edited the US version, this time for the 1983 Canadian release). The fact that this is the version that got remastered implies that the negative got physically recut so there's no likelihood of the director's cut getting a proper remastering, but this version certainly isn't a travesty.

Cooper's interview packs quite a lot of information into its nine minutes: his time at RADA with David Warner and John Hurt, his experience as an actor on The Dirty Dozen making him realise he wanted to work on the other side of the camera, the casting process, with Lee Marvin turning down the lead despite liking the script because he'd ""played that part too many times"" and Sutherland requiring a long courtship before accepting the lead, and the film's dismal fate in the US with a small distribution company obsessed with making it `more linear.' There's also an isolated score track - thankfully Robert Farnon's restrained and classical original score that interpolates extracts from Ravel rather than Craig Hundley's funky gibbon disco rescore - and a booklet with notes by Julie Kirgo. The film may never quite achieve its ambitions, but it still exerts a strange fascination and this edition is easily the best treatment it has ever had by far.",1392940800,6,5290,5.184795321637427
7992482,4,B00009PBYE,"A professional assassin (Donald Sutherland) in search of his missing wife (played by Sutherland's real-life wife Francine Racette) is haunted by the memories of their strained marriage in this quiet, engrossing, moody psychological thriller from 1977.  This Canadian-British co-production was shortened, re-edited, and re-scored by the studio against the director's wish.  That led to a disastrous, one-day theatrical showing, and the film has been forgotten ever since -- until now.  Independent publisher Twilight Time has released the original director's 101-minute cut along with another version that runs 91 minutes.  Both versions retain the non-linear narrative structure and Maurice Ravel's lovely piano score as originally intended by director Stuart Cooper.  Note that the reviewers before me likely saw the butchered version, hence their low ratings.  The restored version has a true artistic vision seldom seen in the thriller genre, and it deserves to be re-discovered by modern viewers.

Only a Blu-ray edition (for Region-A) has been released; there is no corresponding DVD edition.  The disc contains the 101-minute original director's cut, a new 91-minute version that mostly adheres to the director's vision, and a 15-minute excerpt of the disastrous studio cut.  Sadly, the 101-minute director's cut, in my opinion the best version, is shown in standard definition only on the Blu-ray.  It is shown in 4:3 aspect ratio due to its coming from a VHS source (apparently the only surviving source of the director's cut).  It shows more picture at the top and bottom but less on the left and right sides compared to the 91-minute version, which is shown in a nice-looking 1.85:1 wide-screen, 1080p high-definition picture.

No subtitles nor closed captioning are provided.  Dialogs, record in mono only, are often softly spoken, so this could be rough viewing for the hearing impaired.  Also, like all Twilight Time releases, this disc is made in small quantity, making them susceptible to going out of print.  This is due to the company's low-budget nature, which may be why it can't afford to provide subtitles.  The disc does come with 6 pages of liner notes.

The disc has a manufacturer SRP of $30 only.  Don't be fooled by the much higher prices offered by some sellers.  The only reliable seller is ""Screen Archives Entertainment"", which is the only merchant licensed to sell Twilight Time discs.  You may also order them directly at its official website ScreenArchives dot com.  If the disc ever goes out of print, however, the price will likely go up, as is the case of nearly all Twilight Time releases.

The 101-minute and the 91-minute cut differ mainly at the beginning, where the longer version shows the assassin carrying out the fateful assignment, while the shorter version totally omits it.  There are other small differences sprinkled throughout the film which involve alternate camera angles, alternate takes, alternate audio cues, and slightly different placements of the flashback scenes.  Both versions contain content not found in the other version, but the longer cut contains more of it.  A few examples:

When the Sutherland character asks his wife's sister if there is another man involved in his wife's disappearance, in the 91-minute cut she responds, ""There are always other men; you know that.""  But in the longer version, her response is more in depth: ""There are always other men; you know that.  There are always other men, and there are always other women.""

In the assassination scene of the longer version, the victim says after he gets shot, ""You shouldn't have done it."" But in the shorter version, he says nothing.  This alters the context of the scene pretty significantly.

When the assassin goes to his ""headquarter"" to receive his next assignment, the longer version shows the receptionist there identifying the company as ""October Advertising"", indicating that the location is being used as a front.  The shorter version omits this info.

In the scene where the radio plays the commercial for ""Adventures in Memory"", the broadcast that precedes the commercial is different in the longer and shorter versions.  The longer version plays what seems to be another commercial, while the shorter version plays a hockey game.  Maybe different stock sound footage was available during the making of the two versions.

According to the 9-minute interview in the bonus features, director Stuart Cooper surprisingly says he DOES NOT know where the shorter, 91-minute version came from.  But he does say that it is very similar in vision to his original 101-minute cut.  (Shot in 2013, this interview is shown in 1080p with no subtitles, and there seems to be some audio glitches at times.  The interview also includes a few production photos.)

Other special features include, as I mentioned, a 15-minute excerpt of the butchered theatrical version, which shows a different editing style and a wildly different score.  Typical of Twilight Time Blu-rays, an isolated score track of the 91-minute version is included, nicely rendered in stereo.

The 1080p 91-minute version looks clean, detailed, with better brightness and contrast.  The 101-minute version, sourced from VHS, looks too dark at times, but otherwise presentable.",1380326400,10,5275,5.237187127532777
