7841152,5,6303213944,"I used to rent the movie all the time from our local rental shop.  It wasn't until I found it again when I was older that I realized that the movie was actually French dubbed in English.  There are certain European Christmas traditions that you might notice, such as the idea that Santa lives in Lapland (which is in Finland) instead of at the North Pole and children talking about putting their shoes instead of stockings by the fire in order to get presents.  Some people might find it a little corny, but for me, it's a sweet piece of nostalgia.  I still find myself humming the songs occasionally.

Young Simon has a very special Christmas wish that he wants desperately to come true.  Unlike other children, who are wishing for toys, he just wants his parents to come home safely.  They were taken hostage by rebels while on a trip to Africa.  Everyone else, including Simon's grandmother, has given up hope of seeing them again.  Just before Christmas vacation starts, he and his friend, Elodie, go with their class on a field trip to the airport.  Simon notices a plane that is going to the town in Lapland where their teacher said that Santa Claus lives.  If anyone can help find Simon's parents, it's Santa!  Simon and Elodie are mistaken for two other children who were supposed to be on the plane, allowing them to travel to Lapland to meet Santa. As Santa begins to search for Simon's parents with the help of a good fairy (who looks a lot like Simon's kind teacher), Simon and Elodie must escape from the clutches of an ogre who wants to eat them after making them clean his house.  Can Santa save Simon's parents and arrive back in time to save Simon and Elodie?  It's a gentle, happy movie about wishes that come true and the magic of Christmas.",1292371200,,1760,4.511041009463723
