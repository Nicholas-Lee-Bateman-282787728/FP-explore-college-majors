7835700,3,6303047300,I have other yoga dvd's and this one is mediocre.  Thanks so much.  God bless,1405382400,,77,4.066666666666666
7835701,4,6303047300,"My library still has a copy of this.  I've borrowed it a couple of times and finally decided to buy it.  I hope it will become available -- either through re-issue or used copies.  One review said it was too easy.  For me, it was perfect -- my legs and hips just won't go in the directions most of the beginning yoga tapes (or classes) want them to go.  Perhaps it would be better to classify this as basic stretching.  (And it does go beyond the sit and be fit!)",1183507200,3,463,4.088888888888889
7835702,4,6303047300,"I have bought many Yoga videos over the last several years, but this is the first that I have had no problems performing due to my knee condition.  This video allows me to receive the benefits of a Yoga workout with  stretches and breathing exercises while not over stressing my damaged knee.  It is a wonderful video, especially for those with limitations like  myself.",961891200,26,370,4.734375
