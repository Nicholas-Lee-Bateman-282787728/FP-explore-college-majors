922837,2,6304794444,I wanted to see more of the seahorses in their natural habitat. Too much depressing parts about the over harvesting etc... I think its important but needs to be not so in your face about it. Mix it up.,1355270400,,201,4.17948717948718

922839,5,6304794444,"I found this video to be very enlightening.  I loved the view of these wonderful animals from the perspective of someone who studies them in their environments.  It brought them and their lives into sharp focus.  I particularly loved the fact that they brought the plight of these beautiful animals into the public eye.  Nobody knows how many of these animals have been caught, killed, and sold to tourists.  Many more are sold to the orient for ""Medicine"" because they pair for life.  It is sad that we are so selfish we are willing to destroy any animal for any reason at any time, just because we can.  These animals need and deserve protection.
Fortunately for us, someone is doing something about it.  Through this video I found that Amanda Vincent is studying them and teaching others about them.  In the Philipine people are so poor they get money from catching and selling seahorses.  The numbers were declining until she helped them set up a sanctuary for some of them.  Now the numbers are growing again and the industrey is self sustaining.  Neighboring villagers also want such programs.  Before they realized the benefits they were coming into the sanctuary and poaching the animals from the sanctuary.  Now that they realize that she is there to help they trust her and listen to her advice.  The world could use a lot more people like her.",989366400,8,1354,4.726495726495727
