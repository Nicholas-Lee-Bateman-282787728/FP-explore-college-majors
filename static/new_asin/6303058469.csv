I tried to explain how important this movie was and is but I couldn't find words. I dono.. I'm chicano, and this was the first movie I saw with people who looked like me and spoke like me aswell..lol. good times.",1324598400,,384,4.202702702702703
7839813,5,6303058469,"This is such a treasure.  It perfectly exemplefies the crossover between traditional mexican and chicano cultures.
the Spanglish, the traditions (Gila having to take a ""chaperon"" along when out with a boy) so true to the culture! the music styles are so authentic.  I could just go on and on bragging about the content of this movie.  The producer was able to grasp the essence of this tradition ""La pastorela"" and add the perfect touch of chicano culture. Having been born and raised in Mexico and then moving to the USA, I have a deep appreciation for both cultures.  And this is a beautiful blend.  It is such a cultural heirloom for newer generations.  I love it, I love it.  PLEASE BRING IT BACK IN A DVD FORMAT!!!",1323388800,2,719,4.5703125
7839814,5,6303058469,This video is a great Christmas tradition with the best music.  You will want to watch it every Christmas season.  I used it as a teaching tool and found that junior high students loved it.,1315785600,,189,4.371428571428571
7839815,5,6303058469,movie made in the 90's but still fun to watch today. Saw it on TV back then and had wanted to buy the tape if it was available. Found it and bought an older used copy of it and it was well worth the money and the fact that it was a used copy did not make any difference. The sound was good and the movie itself did not show any effects of the age of the tape. This was the first time I bought a used movie and I would buy another if the price is right.,1256860800,2,452,3.622448979591837
7839816,5,6303058469,"This classic Mexican Nativity play has it all ~ great singing, clever writing, darling kids, classic religous Nativity scenes, the conquering of eternal darkness by the Light of Christ, battles with he-who-must-not-be-named (the BIG Diablo)and Father Guido Sarducci of SNL fame.

Our ancient VHS tape which is like 17 years old barely plays any more and the quality is crud.

I would love to have a DVD of this Christmas classic. Amazon, are you listening? MOre people would LOVE this if it was available. It also features some of the very best singing in any movie ever, the solo of the actor who plays Lucifer and Linda Ronstadt's amazing vocals are especially awesome. The music itself is gorgeous.

DVD-it, please!!

7839817,5,6303058469,"This is a great movie.  It's a fine Christmas movie, but it's just a great movie for any time.  Where I come from, this story is called ""Los Pastores."" It's a lovely Hispano Christmas tradition--it goes with Posadas--where the whole town goes house to house with Mary & Joseph searching for a room at the inn--and in my part of the world folks have old handwritten scripts in endless archaic Spanish.  It's funny, bawdy, and it used to be put on yearly in my town.
But no one is willing to memorize the enormous scripts any more.  Kids don't want to rehearse three times a week for a month before Christmas.  So lots of people have never seen Los Pastores, or even heard of it.
La Pastorela is Los Pastores with the best folks imaginable for every part.  This is the story of a bunch of shepherds who go off looking for the baby Jesus.  They get drunk.  They get lost.  Linda Ronstadt as the Archangel (I think it's Michael) helps them along.  They encounter the devil with all his stinky minions.
I am still searching for my copy of this movie (I did finally locate one for a friend) and I haven't seen it in a few years, so this isn't a very specific review.  But it's a truly great movie, for hispano-Americans or folks who enjoy them.",1012003200,29,1238,4.362445414847161
