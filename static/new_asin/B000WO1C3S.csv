The sond is better then the best of the doors and it has more songs- + there is a DVD of live1968 european tour.  Truth be told this is all the doors you need unless you want to go with ""Perceptions"" the comp of all the doors cds in 5.1- I got this used but I think its like less then $7 new. GET IT NOW its a steal and sounds great!!!!",1256515200,,625,3.8076923076923075
