Although, at times he has trouble putting his genius into words that us non-geniuses can understand, the screen shots are great at capturing his performances and Albert Margolis does a great job of translating for us mortals.",1453161600,,348,4.915254237288136
8342089,5,B001TND14E,"More proof  of what I have been saying, more proof his is our modern day piano master . Classical musicians may have a problem with that, but that is where he gets his skill set from in the first place. anyone interested in learning funky riffs as we say in the guitar word from a classically trained master. Here;s your first baby step. where you go from here is on you. Me I love this stuff, okay i am biased.",1410739200,,411,4.1375

8342091,5,B001TND14E,"I love this DVD and have watched it several times. The other reviewer is partly right, but he isn't focused on the big picture. Yeah I admit that Bernie Worrell kinda stinks as a teacher here, but the man is a creative genius on the keys. Was Einstein a great educator? Was Pablo Picasso the original Bob Ross? Probably not. Neither is Bernie.

To learn from this video, you have to do it the old fashioned way: watching repeatedly and imitating. The good thing is that the camera angles show the keys well and the stuff is easy to pick up. As far as Bernie explaining what he is doing, well that is Achilles heel of the video. The producers must've been hip to this since they have the guy that normally does these Rock House keyboard DVDs along side Bernie trying to ask Bernie pertinent questions and help explain what is going on. Even though the other guy is working hard to get things explained, this aspect of the video is a failure.

This brings me to the title of the DVD. The title is vague and almost misleading. I almost passed on buying this DVD because of the whole ""Layering"" thing. It made it seem like he was going to be doing remixes in Reason or something.

Glad the price was cheap and I decided to take a gamble. Because it really is just about playing keyboards in different roles with a band. Here is what Bernie covers in the DVD:

1) Playing bass lines on the keys (ie Moog bass). He plays several examples along with different tempo funky backing tracks.

2) Playing rhythmic chords and lines with a clavinet type sound. Again, he plays the clavinet along with funk tracks of different tempo.

3) Playing piano type stuff.

4) Playing string parts on the keys.

5) Playing organ (Hammond B3) parts on the keys.

For all of the above he uses a Yamaha Motif and plays along with several funk tracks with different tempos. After finishing each play along track, he kind of breaks down what he just played and answers questions from his co-host. Bernie explains what he is thinking when he is playing and how he is trying to get it to fit in with the band or float above the band, or call and response between his left and right hands or with the guitarist, etc. What Bernie doesn't do is tell you the chords and scales that he is playing and specific technical things. That is probably why the other reviewer gave this one star and while it is a deficiency, it isn't all that bad. What he is playing isn't that theoretically complicated. Just about everything is in E minor and for his bass and lead stuff it is 95% E minor pentatonic with some chromatics thrown in. The important thing to try to learn from this DVD is Bernie's vibe and feel not his fingerings, chord voicings, scale choices, etc.

Then video moves onto a quick section with Bernie playing a real Clavinet and showing you some effects that he uses with it and then onto finally playing a couple of tunes live with a real band on Hammond B3 and Clavinet.

I love this video and have learned from it for sure. I've learned Bernie's parts by listening repeatedly and then playing them myself with the backing tracks (the play along tracks that Bernie uses in the video are supplied for you to practice with, I think you may have to download them from the website). There are a lot of awkward moments between Worrell and the co-host and it feels like a B-Movie at times but with the great camera angles and the little break downs in between sections, you can figure out what Bernie is playing and learn a lot. Two DVDs for such a low price, a chance to learn something from the creative genius of the Wizard of Woo, how can you pass this up.

Bernie Worrell may not be the best teacher, but he is a great player and a master creator, a true artist and you can learn quite a bit of his style on this DVD. Highly recommended.",1352937600,3,3810,4.381019830028329
8342092,1,B001TND14E,"Do not buy this video! The man is incapable of explaining anything! How is he supposed to teach you how to build a groove if he cant even explain what he is doing. The sad and most hilarious part of the video is that he clearly knows that! Lol! If anything you can watch the video to view that!  His body language is priceless and tells everything. Lol. Even worse, none of his improvisations actually groove with the track! They'll all garbage to say the least!",1339718400,,462,4.372093023255814
