970959,5,630505438X,"This film was masterfully restored by David Shepherd for the Chaplin family, and was released in this version on Laserdisc and, later, DVD. The quality is awesome, and Shepherd was able to restore several cuts that Chaplin made in later reissues, cuts that changed the motivation of characters at several key moments. The quality of the film is astounding, especially for an 80+ year old film!
As far as the story goes, it is rather lean on gags, but big on heroics, with many amusing situations and a couple of unforeseen plot twists. Even children will like this film, despoite the fact that there's no color and no talking!!",1028073600,18,627,4.761467889908257
970960,5,630505438X,"""The Kid"" is easily Chaplin's best film overall and seems to be a reflection of Chaplin's own childhood at times.  It begins a bit quietly and becomes both hilarious and poignant.  It is difficult not to view Chaplin as one of the best film makers of all time when you realize he wrote the story, composed the score (which does a beautiful job setting the moods), directed and acted.  I became a bona fide Chaplin fan after seeing this one!",1001980800,3,440,4.475
970961,5,630505438X,"Both movies couple Chaplin's use of pathos with slapstick. However, The Kid is more gut rentching, while A Dog's Life is more slapstick. Still, both pathos and slapstick prevail in both movies. These two films truly showcase the genius known as Chaplin. Chaplin was not a major film figure through most of my families lifetime. However, my mom, at 67, myself, 37, and the kids age 14 and 11, all have found a love for Chaplin. His comedy is beyond words, beyond color, and truly speaks to the better part of ourselves that we can find inside of each of us. The only higher mark I would give to a Chaplin film is ""The Goldrush"" and ""The Circus."" These two films rank among the best.",998611200,3,681,4.456

To the movie.
What is wrong with the music? It sounds like someone is trying out a cheap zyntheziser. None of the original music is there. Is this original music, or has it been added just a few years ago?

All in all this is a disappointment. Yes, there are deleted scenes there, but without the original musical score this is nothing but a DVD-R with some deleted scenes from an amazing movie.",1487635200,,564,4.3619047619047615

7883535,4,630505438X,"A Dog's Life:
A routine Chaplin short - which makes it better than most other silent shorts.

The Kid:
This may be my favorite Chaplin film. It doesn't have the depth of his later films but the brilliant timing and trust in the audience to understand subtle cues already infuses Chaplin's first feature film, a film which also catapulted Jackie Coogan to preeminence as cinemas first child star. And Coogan set the bar very high for the child stars who followed.

The cinematic purity of this film, which simply tells a touching story superbly well without trying to shoehorn in a message or statement, is something I find refreshing 90 years later.",1323993600,,649,4.785714285714286
7883536,3,630505438X,"A Dog's Life (Charlie Chaplin, 1918)

A Dog's Life was the ninth film in which Charlie Chaplin's alter-ego the Tramp makes an appearance, and at forty minutes, it was, up until that time, easily the longest-- the first move towards his feature-length appearances in City Lights, Modern Times, and others. While it's still greatly enjoyable, as most Chaplin pieces are, however, A Dog's Life does have the feel of a sketch that was originally intended as one of the Tramp's twenty-odd-minute set-pieces that Chaplin decided to stretch out to see how it played in longer form.

In this one, the Tramp is trying to survive in the streets of the big city with Scraps, a mongrel he saved from an attack by other dogs. The two of them meet Edna (Edna Purviance), a bar singer who gets fired when she won't be more of a companion to the paying customers than she's comfortable with. (Yes, you'd be surprised at what filmmakers got away with in pre-Code days.) So now all three of them are in dire straits, when Scraps digs up a money-stuffed wallet buried in the Tramp's vacant lot by a pair of crooks. Now the three of them are flush, but the crooks want their money back. Commence slapstick!

Chaplin films are a fun way to return to a more innocent (in a strange way, as per the pre-Code parenthetical aside above) time in film, when the good guys were good guys, the bad guys were bad guys, and the hero always gets the girl in the end (or, in this case, in the middle). As such, they lack a good deal of the subtlety and depth that one finds in today's best comedies, but one of the side effects is that, simply, you laugh more. Something like A Dog's Life or Keaton's Sherlock Jr. packs in more laughs per minute than any modern comedy, and doesn't usually have the depressing downside of something like The Ninth Configuration or Return to Me. If you want a simple, easy comedy, you can't do much better than Charlie Chaplin. *** ",1212105600,,1930,4.505714285714285
7883537,5,630505438X,"I'd like to say a few words about this Eddie Dean set. Yes, Eddie Dean. Although it's advertised under Jennifer Holt, she is only in the Tioga Kid. Video Kart put in a lot of creativity in developing it. The cover art is a reproduction of the theatrical posters. The DVDs open with a bullet-ridden lobby card of the movie and one of the songs in the movie is playing. There's also a game where you can try to guess the title of the movie and actor. You will have to visit their site for the answers. They also put in a few movie clips showing some camera foulups. Another feature is you can go directly to the movie songs if you like. The set comes with a sheet showing the chapter titles. All this adds to the pleasure of viewing this DVD. Great job!",1162339200,,751,4.186206896551724
7883538,5,630505438X,"Avoid the disappointing Warner reissues of Charlie Chaplin's First National work and track down this Image DVD. Film historian David Shepard's excellent restorations of ""The Kid"" (1921) and ""A Dog Life"" (1918) remain the definitive, uncut versions. Why Chaplin chose to tamper with these classics in his later years is truly mind-boggling. The Chaplin family should acknowledge the superiority of the original versions  regardless of their father's final wishes.",1128816000,6,462,5.695652173913044
7883539,5,630505438X,"Charlie Chaplin began filming ""The Kid"" two weeks after the death of his three-day old son from his marriage to Mildred Harris. Chaplin had signed a new contract with First National Studio and ""The Kid"" was going to be one of the eight two-reelers Chaplin was supposed to make, but the project kept growing until the film was six reels long. As such ""The Kid"" becomes the comedian's first feature film as writer, director, and star (He had appeared as the male lead in 1914's ""Tillie's Punctured Romance,"" but that was just as an actor and not really a ""Chaplin"" comedy).

Edna Purviance, Chaplin's long time leading lady, plays a desperate unwed mother who leaves her baby in a limousine with a note pleading whoever finds him to take care of him. She changes her mind, but the baby (Baby Hathaway), is gone and ends up in the tender care of Chaplin's Tramp. The Fates have brought the two of them together, and the Tramp raises the Kid (Jackie Coogan) as best he can. They survive by working together: the Kid throws a brick through a window and Charlie walks by and offers to repair it. The big moment comes in the film when the authorities literally rip the Kid away from the Tramp's arms intending to the boy to the Orphan Asylum. The Tramp actually resorts to physical violence to rescue the Kid and flee to a flophouse. There the proprietor (Henry Bergman) learns of the reward for the Kid and while Charlie is sleeping steals the boy and returns him to his mother for the big reward. Longing for the Kid, Charlie has a wondrous dream where their poverty row street is transformed into Heaven (where the ""Flirtatious Angel"" is young Lillita McMurray, who would later become Chaplin's second wife, Lita Grey). The Tramp awakes from the dream and is taken by a kindly policeman to be reunited with the Kid and his mother.

Chaplin had seen Coogan performing on the Vaudeville stage with his parents and had given him a bit part in his 1919 comedy short ""A Day's Pleasure."" With the six-year-old Coogan ""The Kid"" was a tremendous box office hit, quite possibly the biggest money making movie of all time up to that point grossing $2.5 million. Chaplin had combined comedy and pathos before, but when the Kid is taken away from the Tramp by the authorities and screams for his papa, you almost forget this is a silent film. Posters for the film proudly stated that Chaplin had worked an entire year on the film, and audiences were obviously pleased with the results. This would give Chaplin the leeway to take all the time he wanted to perfect the films that he made the rest of his life. Coogan was the biggest child star of the silent era, but would eventually become known to later generations as Uncle Festus on ""The Addams Family."" However, his biggest impact game when it was discovered his guardians had spent Coogan's fortune before he reached the age of 18, which inspired the passage of the ""Coogan Law"" that protects the assets of minor children.

While it seems clear that ""The Kid"" owes much to Chaplin's personal tragedy, there is something archetypal to the story of the abandoned child who is rescued. Tales of orphans were popular throughout the 20th century, starting with ""Anne of Green Gables"" and ending with Harry Potter. However, ""The Kid"" is not without its flaws, which come mainly in the subplot regarding the Kid's mother. Chaplin portrays her as an unwed mother ostracized by a judgmental society for her sun, making a visual comparison to Christ on the cross and sanctifying her with strong religious imagery throughout the film. There is nothing wrong with that, but once she loses her baby she ends up becoming a famous opera star, which means that in the end the Kid will not only be reunited with his mother but be able to live the good life. Pretty convenient, but it means that the reunion of mother and son pales in comparison to Charlie rescuing the Kid from the authorities.

Also on this DVD is the 1918 short, ""A Dog's Life,"" which is one of my all-time favorite Chaplin two-reelers. The Tramp, who lives in a vacant lot, becomes friends with Scraps, and together they steal some tasty sausages from a lunch wagon (run by Chaplin's brother Sydney). The main set piece is when Scraps digs up a wallet filled with money that has been buried in the lot by some crooks and the Tramp sneaks the dog into a dance hall. Edna Purviance is a singer there, having to put up with the unwanted attentions of the patrons, and the obvious object of the Tramp's affection. The crooks show up looking for Charlie and the money as well and the best bit is where the Tramp knocks out one of the crooks and continues the silent conversation with the other one by replacing the unconscious crook's arms with his own. I also have a fondness for this short because it was the one that got my youngest daughter hooked on Charlie Chaplin.",1101772800,9,4857,4.611560693641619
