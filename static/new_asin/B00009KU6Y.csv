7990998,5,B00009KU6Y,"As a senior and aging jock, I have morned the elimination of my former high impact sports endeavors.  These DVD's have travelled around the world with me and keep me mobile and out of the operating suite.  Not your eye candy videos but good solid interventions to keep you moving.",1402876800,,280,4.58
7990999,4,B00009KU6Y,I'm in my late 50's and have really enjoyed this series.  I've taken it on girlfriend weekends and vacations.  Friends liked it so much that too have ordered them.,1392336000,,163,4.586206896551724
7991000,5,B00009KU6Y,I purchased several of Susan Winter Ward's Yoga DVD's.  I have used them over a period of 5 years and continue to learn and improve over time.  I highly recommend her DVD's from beginner's to intermediate-advanced--young adults to mature adults.,1231632000,7,245,5.1
7991001,5,B00009KU6Y,"I have tried lots of yoga dvds and normally either the instructors are annoying, or they go too fast, or the workout is insanely challenging, or the music drives me nuts.  But this one doesn't have any of those disadvantages.  It's a well-designed workout that you can use at your own pace.  I must say I was a bit embarrassed at first that the aged participants in the video were far more nimble than I (even though I think at least one of them is over 30 years older!) but I've managed to get over that mental hurdle, and have increased my own flexibility pretty significantly.  Highly recommended.",1177372800,3,600,4.527777777777778
7991002,5,B00009KU6Y,I have used this DVD many times. I enjoy it a lot. The descriptions are very precise and the instructor is good. I would say I am a beginner when it comes to yoga.,1141171200,3,163,3.823529411764706
