7826196,4,6302457068,"Among the best shows of the first season was this very succinct and compact story of Riker meeting and falling for the woman of his dreams...with a twist.  Although the storyline of Trek characters falling in love only to lose their loved one is an oft used plot device, the unusual background and setting for this episode rises above the mundane and entertains us supremely.
Arriving at a starbase, the crew is introduced to the Binars a computer-independent and androgynous alien race who will initiate some necessary repairs to the Enterprise.  Most of the crew is granted shore leave during the interval with Riker somewhat inadvertently ending up on the holodeck immediately following some updates and enhancements implemented by the Binars.  He designs a program to reflect a mid-20th century New Orleans jazz club where he meets an incredibly beautiful and sultry ""woman"" named Minuet.  She instantly causes the first officer to fall head over heels in love with her and he all but completely forgets that she is a creation of the holodeck.  During this time the crewmembers still present experience a ship wide emergency causing them to evacuate and the starship is then placed on autopilot to clear it's space dock.  Only after the starship is gone a great distance does the crew at the starbase realize that someone is attempting to hijack the Enterprise - and that the captain, the first officer and the Binars are most likely still aboard.
'11001001' is a well-conceived episode that balances both ongoing plots expertly.  The Binars were one of the most interesting alien races the Enterprise and crew encountered and it's a real shame they weren't brought back for additional appearances.  Carolyn McCormick as Minuet is a knockout and it's easy to see why Riker would fall so hard for her; the writers constructed the ending of the show excellently, helping make the point that you fall in love with the illusion and the image not the person.  Riker's conversation with Picard in the finale bears this out.  Riker also has the best line in the show.  When he checks in with Data he finds the second officer getting painting lessons from Geordi.  Quickly thinking on his feet he tells them to keep notes on the session.  Befuddled, Geordi asks him why.  ""A blind man teaching an android to paint?  That's gotta' be worth a couple of lines in some historian's book,"" is Riker's smart reply!
I found an oddity in the story when I watched it recently.  When Picard and Riker sense a problem they question Minuet about it and she explains she isn't programmed to give that information.  Several minutes later they approach her again with the same question - and without hesitation she spills her guts this time!  An oversight by the writers?  Perhaps.
Some final notes: Gene Dynarski, who played one of the miners in the Star Trek original series episode 'Mudd's Women', becomes the first guest star to make separate appearances in the two different Trek series.  The auto destruct sequence changes drastically between this show and the second season show titled 'Where Silence Has Lease'.  Here it's observed that it is automatically set for five minutes and cannot be altered; in the latter episode Picard and Riker are allowed to choose a time limit.",1043539200,2,3263,4.8963636363636365

The surprising aspect of this episode is that it wasn't only  humans that programed the Enterprise. The Bynars make their first and last appearance in this segment. The Enterprise returns to star base for the Bynars to work on updating the programming.  Supposedly each one of them works as part of the greater whole. Shades of the Borg mentality here. Wonder why they didn't help out the Federation? Well, they hijacked the big E to their planet were a supernova was set to destroy their master computer.
The crew is evacuated by a false warning. Riker and Picard are still on board. This is were it gets interesting.......Riker steps into a holodeck Jazz bar in New Orleans in the 20th century. Since the program is influenced by the Bynar everything has more ""enhancement.""...not the run of the mill shallow programs. When Riker asks for the perfect date it creates Minuet. Will Riker jumps into a relationship that can't last.
The Jazz Bar scenes and the abduction of the Enterprise by Bynar hive mind make this an unusual mix of drama and romance. Scenes of the Enterprise entering the star base were lifted from the effects shots from the movie the ""Search for Spock.""",979776000,4,1220,4.804761904761905
