8325015,5,B000DZ6VDW,"These exercises are an outstanding supplement to any traditional Okinawan martial arts style but are of particular benefit to serious Uechi Ryu practitioners. Master Takayasu is a student of Seiyu Shinjo who created what is known as the ""strong fist"" school of Uechi Ryu and the exercises presented are guaranteed to condition the body to both absorb contact and enhance martial ability. In addition to the impressive demonstration on this DVD, to further view the effectiveness of these methods I suggest you look up Kiyohide Shinjo (Seiyu's son)on Youtube. These strengthening/toughening exercises provide a missing link to traditional training exercises, (perhaps included in Kunbun Uechi's original style of Uechi Ryu) that are no longer included in today's Uechi curriculum. Although Kote Kitae is part of the curriculum,training with Chishi, Ishi Sashi and Nigiri Game are not. Master Takayasu provides a comprehensive review of strengthening/toughening methods using, Nigiri Game, Chishi and dumbells for Ishi Sashi. Standard body conditiong (ie Kote Kitae) as well as harder core conditioning using baseball bats are covered. Overall,an outstanding addition to any serious martial artists library and a must have for Uechi Ryu practitioners along with Master Shinyu Gushi's videos/DVDs. Master Gushi was also a student of Master Seiyu Shinjo as well as a student of Master Kanei Uechi, Master Uehara and Master Itokazu - all students of the founder Kanbun Uechi.",1257638400,5,1470,5.508849557522124
