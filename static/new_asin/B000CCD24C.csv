8097264,4,B000CCD24C,"DVD Review: This is a 2 Disc set featuring a documentary on Indonesian cinema, 70 minutes of Indonesia movie trailers and s*** which is the main reason to get this DVD. Would of preferred these extras on a more prestigious release like The Warrior or something but eh. The picture quality is good in 2:35 ratio and audio is funny.

Movie Review: There are three aspects I hate in the exploitation realm: strict sexploitation, most black magic s***, and women in cages crud. BUT, unfortunately I liked this movie so suck my butt. This movie has some crazy death scenes, explosions, inconsistent action scenes (at times I couldn't tell if it's a sex scene or a fight scene), moronic rape scenes (I think), sexy broads, lousy dubbing and dim-witted story. The let downs were NO NAKED INDONESIAN FEMALE BUTT and the fact the movie converted from a action flick to a women in cages CRAP but luckily it converted back into an action flick in the end. It's not the best exploitation ever made but I was fat and entertained.

Conclusion: 5 stars for the DVD and 4 stars for Virgins From Hell.",1426032000,,1084,4.61139896373057
8097265,4,B000CCD24C,"The movie itself is pretty much what you'd expect from something titled ""Virgins From Hell"".  With an absurd premise, this laughable, eye-rolling, shoot-em-up, T&A flick out of Indonesia is pure entertainment (for all the wrong reasons).  The real gold in this set though is the bonus disc and its plethora of Rapi Films trailers (somewhere around two dozen of them!), or - as it should have been called - the Barry Prima collection.  The casual cinephile may cringe but fans of exploitation cinema should definitely grab a copy of this crapfest!",1342915200,,546,4.978021978021978
8097266,4,B000CCD24C,"The movie itself is okay, but not that good. The movie rates 3 stars. Disc 2 is the reason to buy this set. It rates 5 stars. Disc 2
Over 70 minutes of ultra rare trailers from kings of Indonesian
exploitation - Rapi Films
Documentary on Indonesian Exploitation
And all the trailers are in English! Wow! Prepare to see things you never would have dreamed of.",1338681600,,358,4.4393939393939394
8097267,3,B000CCD24C,"Two sisters want to take revenge on Tiger, a crime boss who killed their parents and stole their house. They have gathered a group of biker chicks to join their cause. But not everything goes as planned and they end up Tiger's prisoners. And so, the movie turns into a women in prison-movie.

The story is okay but not great, but there are lots of scenes that are hilarious. But the movie is a bit too long, which makes the pace too slow at times. Overall, not a bad movie, but I agree with the other reviewer who said this is not the best place to start if you're not acquainted with Indonesian exploitation films. There are better ones out there. And although I haven't seen all that many, I would recommend ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mystics-In-Bali/dp/B000VNMS6K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mystics In Bali</a>"", ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lady-Terminator/dp/B0002VER3S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lady Terminator</a>"" or ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dangerous-Seductress/dp/B00061QIXG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dangerous Seductress</a>"" before this one. Perhaps also ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-s-Sword/dp/B000FI8MMK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil's Sword</a>"", which is hilarious at times but like ""Virgins from Hell"", somewhat suffers from an uneven pace.",1188604800,4,1450,7.238636363636363

8097269,3,B000CCD24C,"Ever since a friend loaned me a bootleg of a film that he absolutely, totally hated called MYSTICS IN BALI (1981), this writer has rutted along sundry gray market paths in search of anything Indonesian. Converts to this particular brand of movie magic will vouch that the films from this far-flung land are like nothing else dreamed of in our philosophies. The fantasy and exploitation films of Indonesia are crude, but never ironic, attacking their lurid and questionable subject matter with a determination to entertain their audience at all costs. My search has since turned up quite a few gems, and there are quite a few movies in my collection that are in their native language, sans subtitles. I would go on to write two long, in-depth articles on Indonesian films for two other publications. I will even step on a few toes and say that comparable films from other nearby lands can only dream of matching the audacity of the projects emanating from this sprawling section of Southeast Asia.

And so it was with trepidation that I learned of Mondo Macabro's intention of bringing Ackyl Anwari's VIRGINS FROM HELL to the DVD format. My initial response was ""what on earth for?"" (Why not a domestic release of MYSTICS IN BALI?). Indo films are not traditionally good, and well, VIRGINS FROM HELL isn't any good. No, seriously. In spite of hordes of scantily clad jungle babes riding around motorbikes and shooting off machine guns, these VIRGINS indeed make for a lousy date. Director Ackyl Anwari shoots everything from static long and medium shots, with no camera movement of any kind, leading to a very stilted and boring movie. The subject matter simply does not lend itself to an Andrei Tarkovsky-styled presentation.

VIRGINS does have unusual art direction, such as cave interiors sprinkled with glitter and shag carpeting used as wallpaper. But even the most patient viewer of cinema sludge will be checking their wristwatches for this feature to end. In both of my previous articles, I pegged VIRGINS FROM HELL as ""the film to miss"" on the Balinese trash film tour. The Johnny-Come-Lately who jumps on this bandwagon due to Mondo Macabro's superior DVDs of LADY TERMINATOR and DANGEROUS SEDUCTRESS may just want to jump off after encountering these very frigid VIRGINS.

However -- as in most DVD purchases, it's the extras that make this an essential purchase. This two-disc edition features a plethora of exotic treats on display. On the first disc, along with a widescreen, restored version of the film, there is an essay on the Women-In-Prison genre, an essay by Pete Tombs on the background of the film and the Mondo Macabro promo reel. On the second disc is the documentary ""Destination Jakarta"" about the Indonesian film industry, and a fistful of trailers for many other Indonesian genre pictures, ranging from serious war docudramas to the popular THE WARRIOR series (with action star Berry Prima) to even more horror films that has thus far escaped my purview. The trailers vary drastically in quality, but you won't care. Pete Tombs wisely ends the trailer park with the one for MYSTICS IN BALI, perhaps supremely confident that this film, above all others will lead countless other viewers such as myself down a rabbit hole to a most curious and wondrous cinematic wonderland.",1170892800,12,3300,4.963833634719711
