Phantom of the Opera is an amazingly directed, acted, and written story. This was a movie that I, was required to watch. The music is awesome on the sound track in the fact that it comes across as opera but looks and feels nothing like opera. Gerard Butler plays this role like he does all very well. You feel as if your back in time when this is happening. The supporting cast was spectacular. The story is touching and you will get misty eyed. Phantom of the Opera II? Haven't watched August as yet. The movies will come in a card board 2 pack with 2 slim blu ray cases.",1357171200,,716,4.121428571428571
