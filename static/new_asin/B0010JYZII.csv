8237908,4,B0010JYZII,"This brief, easy-to-understand DVD talks about the current rise in anti-Semitism in the Arab world and even in Western Europe.  It talks about historical anti-Semitism, and also tells how anti-Semitism is used to keep the population's eyes off the real problems in Arab countries.  Blood libel, the Protocol of the Elders of Zion, both are mentioned as ancient forms of anti-Semitism.  Interestingly, Moslems did NOT persecute Jews severely in the first milleneum, something I know about from reading books on Jewish history.

Strangely, this film does not say much about the Holocaust or about medieval anti-Semitism.  Yes, it mentions the blood libel, but not the forced wearing of the Star of David by Jews in the Middle Ages.  It does not really talk about the jealousies that European Christians had when the Jews, forced off agricultural lands and banned from the military, became successful businessmen in cosmopolitian areas.  The title might explain why these issues were ignored, but their neglect leaves us with an incomplete picture of anti-Semitism.",1309651200,5,1062,5.285714285714286
8237909,3,B0010JYZII,"The documentary made by PBS, and it even got the Emmy Award, takes up the history of anti-semitism and how it developed up to WWII pretty good.  The history of the Holocaust is imcomplete.  It does not mention even all the European countries occupied, and one was left out; my country of birth, Norway. Norway was the first European country to deny Jews political asylum in 1926, and she had also the highest % of their Jews deported to Germany.  It does not mentioned Quisling's well-organized nazi-administration from April 9,1940 to June 2, 1945.  He was so efficient that his name became an international word for being a traitor.  In Norway's defense, it should also be mentioned all the heroes in the resistanse that risked their lives in weapon smugling from here to USSR (then our ally in the war), but also risked their lives to smugle Jews to Sweden or keeping them hidden.  Thanks to one of those heroes and the very few he trusted, my Mother and I survived.
The same error is made in other documentary about those Jews who survived in hiding, where Norway is not mentioned at all.
The only synagoge in Oslo was attacked by armed people as late as 2004 and left bulletholes.
Although, it covers well the Middle-East conflict from the establishment and acknowledgement of the State of Irsael and how she became into being, and her later wars, of which the attack on Yom Kippur (the most important holiday in Judaism) in 1973 as vicious as it must have been perceived by Jews all over the world.  The are many reasons or missed oppotunities for why the conflict still is not solved and the State of Israel does not have her secure boarders.  The most important one is that she still is denied to exist.  But the Arab countries have used both under the 'cold war' as well as after the fall of USSR, the Palestinians fate to their ends in politics on the world 'scene'.  The Palestinians are not considered being Arabs by Arabs in the same way as Kurds, Armenians or Turkemans are not Arabs.  In spite of Israel's right to defend herself and her existence,  Israeli politics has also its own life within herself and her citizens who vote in elections.  Within the PLO there has also been deep political differences, which has lead to never to be able to agree on almost anything.  Why they did not accept the offer made at the end of the Clinton administration and then Primeminister Ehud Barak (now defense minister) is for me like a 'riddle'.  Such an offer will never come again and a 2 state solution seems so far away as it never has been since the war in 1967.
Today there is mix up of the State of Israel's polical leadership and anti-semitism.  Support for her security and existence, which all over the world Jews share, is used for anti-semitic hatecrimes.",1255219200,7,2773,4.594320486815416

8237911,5,B0010JYZII,"I never really understood the underlying hatred that exists against Jewish Folks.  It is amazing how so many can really believe that so few ""control the world.""  There are perhaps 12 Million Jewish people in an entire world of perhaps 4 Billion Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, and Hindus (sorry if I spelled anyone's faith wrong). Yet there are literally tens of millions of people out there that actually think a few Jewish people control everything.  Anyone with a brain (even a small brain) knows this is not really true.  With the Exception of Israel, name one Country that has a Jewish President?  Name one Major Bank, that has a Jewish Board of Directors or a Jewish Chairman.  Wachovia? Bank of America? Citibank?  Certainly not!  Anyone that is a good Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu,  or any other faith should get this DVD.  It will make you a better person, and perhaps change the sub conscience psyche of hatred toward Jewish People (in one form or another) that many of us Non Jewish Folks just may have.  Once we all understand that the entire world has turned its back on Jewish people time after time (The Holocaust, The Spanish Inquisition, The Pogroms in Russia, etc. etc.) it will become very clear why Jewish Folks are willing to do whatever it takes to make sure there is always a place for them to go (which today is known as Israel).  It is a terrible feeling when you do not have a place to go, or a place to belong.  Ask the Kurds, Armenians, Christians during the Roman Times, or any other group that has been persecuted and had no where to go.",1213315200,9,1573,4.615107913669065
