8321035,5,B001MEJTU0,"Most movies that were books before movies disappoint, however, ""True Confessions of a Hollywood Starlet"" is fantastic! I read both books before I saw the movie, and I enjoy both!

8321036,5,B001MEJTU0,This movie really surprised me.  Well-written and good acting.  A peek behind the Hollywood curtain.  And some good laughs as well.  A good film with a timely message.,1249776000,,167,4.857142857142857
8321037,4,B001MEJTU0,"I was definitely surprised by this, and for the most part due to JoJo. I know she has acted before, but I assumed her acting would be so similar to the character she's portraying in TCHS that the line would be severely blurred. Though it runs through your head while watching that she is obviously less of a problem child in real life than in the film. Her character is shipped out of Hollywood to Indiana as part of her rehab stint (Due to excessive drinking and partying... sound familiar?), to live with her aunt (Valerie Bertinelli - extremely perky and cute in this film). The fact that this film sounds so familiar is because it does resemble the life story of a number of young actresses you could think of. Though obviously this story is more of a comedy than their lives are. This movie certainly is not made for kids, despite how it may look... I recommend a viewing if you are obsessed with Hollywood and celebrities. It really makes you think about how they live with a different outlook.",1245628800,3,1000,4.5
