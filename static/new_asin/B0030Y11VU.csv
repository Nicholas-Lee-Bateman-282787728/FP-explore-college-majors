It's just fans talking about the characters and giving their opinions on the show.  It was entertaining and I did laugh out loud several times.  I would watch it again.  Buy this if you are a die hard LOST fan.  It's a nice fan-centric video.",1279152000,2,389,4.4714285714285715

This is get a bunch of people who LOVES lost to a point that the show makes them cry and they imitate the characters in real life. ""I love Kate, because she is from Iowa and I'm from Iowa and its cool,"" goes on to tell you the extent of the experts in this ""Documentary."" What was the point of the girl sitting next to the guy with tattoos other than just sitting there? Eye Candy perhaps?  So this basically is just a conversation between bunch of lost fanatics, thank god I didn't buy it.

The only thing good about the ""Documentary"" is that they go into some of the theories of the show and details into things you might have missed during the show. The DVD doesn't have any show footage, just bunch of people sitting and talking which gets old after about 15 minutes.",1266883200,4,881,4.432098765432099

The game uses the remote control and contains many great mind-bending puzzles, ala LOST!  The game even interacts with Season 6!  AMAZING!",1263254400,,294,4.8
