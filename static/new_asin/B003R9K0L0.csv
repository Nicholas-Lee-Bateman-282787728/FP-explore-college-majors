4181078,3,B003R9K0L0,"Let's get one thing out of the way: I love the Wolf Man!  He was always my favorite classic Universal monster, largely due to Lon Chaney Jr.'s sympathetic portrayal of the monster's human form, Larry Talbot.  When I first heard the title ""House of the Wolf Man,"" I was positively giddy with anticipation.

Then I watched the movie.

(Minor Spoilers ahead)
A group of five seemingly disparate strangers accept the invitation to spend the night at the castle of one Dr. Reinhardt (Ron Chaney, the grandson of Lon Jr.).  Cue the cliches: Stormy night, disfigured assistant, things that go bump in night, etc.  And to their credit, the filmmakers do mangage to more or less successfully copy the look of a 1940's-era Universal horror film.  The appearance of Reinhardt's quadraplegic grandmother serves to offer some legitmate connections (ludicrous though they may seem) to the ""real"" Wolf Man films.  You see, she's the brother of the Bela character from the original film (Bela Lugosi gets a cameo in a portrait hanging on the wall).  And Reinhardt's own lineage is, well. . .I won't give it all away.

House of the Wolf Man, with all its good intentions, has two major flaws.  The script doesn't really go anywhere.  Almost NOTHING happens in the first half hour.  And as others have pointed out, the monsters don't show up until the final 10 minutes (more on that in a minute).  But what almost sinks the film from the beginning is the horrible acting.  Sadly, the one person from whom we might reasonably expect a decent performance (Chaney) proves the worst of the bunch.  And this isn't bad acting on purpose, as seen in parodies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lost-Skeleton-of-Cadavra/dp/B00020HAY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra</a>.  It's just. . .well, it's bad.

If there's a saving grace here, it's that the monsters DO deliver when they finally appear.  For anyone who was disppointed with the 30 second melee between the Wolf Man and Frankenstein's Monster in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frankenstein-Meets-the-Wolfman-VHS/dp/6300185443/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman [VHS</a>], there's some real action to be found here.  A last-minute inexplicable appearance by Dracula adds to the feel that we are, for a brief shining moment, back in that world that we classic monsters fans hold so dear.  This thought is really brought home in the abrupt ending, a flaw shared by many of the later Universal films.  Oh, and bonus points for blink-and-you'll-miss-it homages to Creature from the Black Lagoon and Dr. Pretorious's creations from Bride of Frankenstein.

Like I said, I'm a fan.  And believe me, 3 stars is VERY generous for this film.  If you love the old monster movies, it is worth a look.  But you'll have to be very forgiving of its flaws if you are to find any enjoyment here.  I actually hope the disc sells well, as its success could pave the way for other such projects.  Let's just hope the filmmakers invest more time and money on hiring some better talent.",1286582400,4,3134,5.2894736842105265

4181082,5,B003R9K0L0,"This review was from Jason Nicholl (RIP) from [...]

In the spirit of full disclosure, I was invited for a visit to the set of ""House of the Wolf Man."" Yet, I did buy my own ticket for the premiere of the movie last night. So take my review for what it is worth.

I absolutely loved Eben McGarr's new film, ""House of the Wolf Man."" It is a love letter to the classic horror movies of yester year, and pays homage in the way many wish filmmakers would, but seldom do.

The movie is presented in black and white, full frame, and mono. It was shot in the style of the classic monster movies of the 1930's and 1940's; intended to fit in as the ""missing"" chapter of the ""House of"" franchise. Universal originally made ""House of Frankenstein"" (1944) and ""House of Dracula"" (1945). Reportedly there were plans to complete the trilogy with ""House of the Wolf Man,"" but the studio never got around to making that one. Writer / Director Eben McGarr has created the missing piece to that trilogy. He employed only the lighting, sound, and camera techniques used in those original films. The care he showed truly pays off.

The film opens on a dark and stormy night at the castle of Dr. Bela Reinhardt (Ron Chaney) where five strangers arrive. Those five people include Reed Chapel (Dustin Fitzsimons) and his sister Mary (Sara Raferty), brainy nerd Conrad Sullivan (Jeremie Loncka), the mysterious Elmira Cray (Cheryl Rodes), and renowned hunter Archibald Whitlock (Jim Thalman). They have been summoned by Reinhardt to participate in a game of elimination, in which the last one standing will inherit his estate. Along the way, the five participants come face to face with a creepy servant named Barlow (John McGarr) as well as the triumvirate of monsters - the Wolf Man, Frankenstein's monster, and Count Dracula.

All of the performances are very good, blending perfect comic timing with the right amount of campiness that was found in those original monster movies. Ron Chaney, grandson of the legendary Lon Chaney, Jr. (the original ""Wolf Man"") headlines the cast and is dead-on creepy in the role of the mad scientist. Also earning top marks is Cheryl Rodes, whose screen presence is captivating.

The film is a wonderful technical achievement. Cinematographer Royce Allen Dudley does a tremendous job of capturing the ambiance of the story. The images are eerily beautiful and you will be hard pressed to tell the difference between this movie shot in 2009 and the other ""House of"" movies shot in the 1940's. The movie is edited crisply as it speeds along at just the right pace. The story is well written by McGarr, with the right combination of campiness and chills. The choreography of the fights between the monsters is extremely well done. Overall, Eben McGarr should be praised for delivering a true gem of a movie that any fan of the classic monster movies will love.

If one of the major studios were smart they would pick this up and give it a proper theatrical release. Destined to be a cult classic, I believe it has crossover potential with older fans who love classic films, as well as with young families. Imagine the marketing campaign - ""When was the last time you could take your kids to a horror film?"" That alone should be worth millions. So here's hoping that ""House of the Wolf Man"" hits a theater near you soon. You won't be disappointed.",1285891200,4,3356,4.716723549488054
4181083,2,B003R9K0L0,"I had been wanting to make a film like this one on my own until news came out that someone else had beaten me to it. With that knowledge, I decided to spend a little money on the DVD when it came out. The trailer looked awesome, the behind the scenes story seemed good, and the film actually has Ron Chaney (Grandson of the real Wolf Man). I knew he wasn't gonna be a great actor, seeing how the man had no experience and is a farmer, and monster movies don't require great acting any way. But this movie had no good acting in it at all, except perhaps for the plucky comic relief, who hams up his nerdy-ness in an authentic 1940s fashion. The filmmakers took great pains in making the sets, editing, photography, writing, and blocking to look as authentic to the 1940s as possible with today's equipment, but fall short in many ways. It's photographed in HD, and thus has a lot of video grain because it was shooting high-contrast lighting, and lots of darkness. The actors all attempt the same campy style acting of the period, but they all end up sounding too modern. This is only forgivable for the actress playing Elmira, because she's hot. The only ethnic people are the footmen, who are blatently expendable and ridiculed in a racist manner. Perhaps this was done to add to the authenticity, but it fails to make us really like the picture any more. The makeup is terrific, but the monsters don't show up until the end of the film. And audiences going to see this kind of movie really are there to see the monsters. With a little editing, and extra foley work, the monster fight at the end could have been so much better, but it ends up just looking like a couple of stunt men in suits beating the crap out of one another. The screenplay had potential, I admit, but the whole first act takes up almost three quarters of the picture, while the second act is almost ignored, and the third just kind of ends the film abruptly. It's not the kind of movie that is so bad it's good, like an MST3K entry, because that's what they were attempting from the start and it just fails even at that. I was probably expecting a kind of spoof on this genre, like Larry Blamire's Lost Skeleton films, but it doesn't even do that. It's a movie that tries so hard to be the kind of movie we used to love, and just fails, and this saddens me greatly.",1285891200,7,2337,4.350114416475972
4181084,2,B003R9K0L0,"I was very interested to see this black and white homage to the classic monster films from Universal.

The set design is excellent, the black and white photography is good, and there is some decent miniature work too.  Once the monsters FINALLY appear (literally less than 10 minutes before the film ends), there is a fun and well staged fight between the Frankenstein monster and the wolf man, as well as a cameo by Dracula.  The makeup and costumes are excellent, but by the time they appear you'll be long asleep.

I can forgive the poor acting (Ron Chaney in particular) and the low budget look, but the pacing and completely uneventful script are real liabilities.  What's with having the monsters not even appear until the last moments? When they do appear, it's out of nowhere.  After a few brief moments of action, the movie just ends with no conclusion at all, I almost thought I was watching a serial.

Nice try, but it doesn't work. If only they'd written a better script. There are about 5 good minutes here, everything else is deadly dull.",1285804800,9,1052,4.654054054054054
4181105,2,B003R9K0L0,"First of all this looks more like a mid 1950s movie than a 1940s one. In fact if it wasn't for the word ""bastard"" being used a few times, I really would have believed this was a low rate 1950s film. The acting is pretty terrible from almost the entire cast, not just Chaney. And any resemblance between this and an actual Universal Monsters film is ...is. Well there just aint none! Highlights of course are the fight between the Wolf Man and the Frankenstein monster (who just happens to appear out of nowhere). Dracula, and his scary brides. T'was a pity his appearance was so brief. Here's a little SPOILER WARNING> There's this gross out scene that I want to let you know about because if you blink you'll miss it. SPOILER> The Wolf Man almost prys off the top of the monster's head nearly exposing his brain< END SPOILER. I just want to let everyone know that a superior House of the Wolf Man was released in 1948, and definitely the best of the ""House Of"" series. It's called ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN. If you've never seen it, watch it for the first time and see what a great movie really looks like. If you have seen it before, watch it again and be reminded what a great movie really looks like. House of The Wolf Man didn't even try to be a great movie. Both of these movies have the Big Three Dracula, the Monster, and The Wolfman. Watch them both then decide for yourself.",1302912000,,1396,4.3938223938223935

4181107,1,B003R9K0L0,"The acting was so stilted it had to be bad on purpose, and I don't get that. The acting in Universal's Classic Monster films were actually pretty good. ""Oh... my...

4181108,3,B003R9K0L0,"If you're a classic movie monsters fan, you'll love the effort that went into this film. It's meant to be the ""lost"" third film in Universal Pictures' monster mash-up ""House of ..."" series, and is set in 1946. Ron Chaney, grandson of Lon Chaney, Jr., stars as Dr. Bela Reinhart. He's invited five people to his remote castle, and he will pick one of them as his heir. Little do they know they are all his children, and that he himself is really a Frankenstein. Most of the movie plays as an old dark house mystery. The monster mayhem doesn't really get going until the last 15 minutes of the story. The acting isn't that great, but the attention to detail is amazing. The late Michael R. Thomas, however, gives an impressive performance as Count Dracula in the film's final minutes, and it's dedicated to his memory. The monster make-ups are quite excellent, too. If Chaney can polish his performing skills a bit, I'd be up for a sequel!",1298764800,3,937,4.550295857988166
4181109,3,B003R9K0L0,"It's so hard for me to come down on this well meaning little homage to the great and not so great Universal Monster films I grew up with. Where do I begin?.....with the bad?...or the good? Well...since I would like to end on a positive note, lets start with THE BAD. Ron Chaney is a terrible actor, and he and a few of the black servants destroy what could have been a very enjoyable little tribute to the old fashioned horror films, even though the script is tedious most of the cast seem to be having fun with it.

I don't want to beat up on Chaney here, but he just doesn't seem to have a clue? He is so stiff and bizarre that it just takes you out of the entire fantasy. ditto the two servants there lines are so robotic, it just ruins the experience.

THE GOOD news is this film has atmosphere to spare, if you can forgive these three actors for being caught acting! The Monster make-up is very good and the final fight between Frankie and Wolfie is better than the original in Frankenstein meets the Wolf Man! .....sure it's a little hokey, but isn't it supposed to be? It's a shame because with a little bigger budget and some decent actors this could have been the best vintage horror release of the year!",1292889600,5,1213,4.292576419213974
4181110,3,B003R9K0L0,"I am a huge Universal monster fan. It is quite apparent that the folks who made this movie love them, too. The film was made to resemble a 1930s Universal film with lots of creepy castle time and fog. The acting is a bit weak, but it's all about the monsters, folks! Without doubt, the highlight is the Frankenstein-Wolfman battle in the climax. This one makes up for the short fight in the original Frankenstein meets the Wolfman movie. So, sit back with some popcorn, turn off the lights and revisit the melodramatic
atmosphere of the past and visit The House of the Wolfman.",1292716800,4,577,4.5576923076923075
4181111,4,B003R9K0L0,"Reed and Mary arrive at Castle Reinhardt along with several other guests that have been invited to stay for the weekend by its mysterious owner, Dr. Bela Reinhardt, who intends on testing his new subjects in order to decide which of them shall inherit the estate and all of its secrets... HOUSE OF THE WOLF MAN is an experimental film that brings together swirling mists, stage lightning, dark Gothic centerpieces, and many other classic elements to form a stylized black and white production that captures the pure essence and aesthetic of the Golden Age of Horror, right down to the title cards and score. It boasts many familiar characters and monsters, including the old witch, the hunchbacked butler, the mad scientist, and of course, Dracula, The Wolf Man, and Frankenstein's Monster! The Monster FX make-up team takes on the daunting taste of redesigning the creatures for themselves, creating a vintage look with a modern twist for each of them. HOUSE is filled with campy performances that also try to recapture the look and feel of Old Hollywood, but each of the individual cast members appear to have rehearsed separately with their own differing accents and dialects. Ron Chaney is unable to match the abilities of his grandfather, and delivers a weak lead as the central villain. What HOUSE OF THE WOLF MAN shares most in common with its Universal counterparts FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLF MAN or HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN is the minimal amount of monster mayhem found only in the final moments of the film. Aside from these distractions, Eben McGarr's ambitious attempt comes together quite well in the end, making HOUSE OF THE WOLF MAN a must-see for Gothic film fans!

4181112,5,B003R9K0L0,I liked it very much. The fight between Frankenstein and the Wolfman was worth the whole purchase. Ten times better fight than His dad and Bela Lugosi's original fight in the 40's. Ron Chaney is as bad of an actor as you will ever see. He was awful but the rest of the cast was worth it. Certainly no Universal masterpeice but other than Ron Chaney's deplorable acting it was good. I gave it a five star. It was perfect for the Halloween mood. I will give Ron Chaney credit for trying to follow in his fathers footsteps. A very tall order.,1288828800,,539,4.294117647058823
4181113,3,B003R9K0L0,"Just to give you guys an idea of how long I've been waiting to see this film, I first wrote about it last Halloween (see post) while it was still making its rounds at independent screenings and festival circuits. Fast forward to present day and I now hold in my hand the unholy grail of recent horror cinema... or is it?

The plot, like oh so many of those classic fright films, revolves around a slightly mad scientist who has invited a group of young people to his castle by offering them each a chance to inherit his vast estate and resources. Each member arrives single file as Bela Reinhardt (played by a stone-faced Ron Chaney) proceeds to [annoyingly] deliver psychological profiles on each ad nauseam. There's some spooky, Scooby-Doo type shenanigans that unfold and then Bela delivers his pice de rsistance... he's actually *GASP* a werewolf! I won't spoil the second half of the ""twist,"" suffice to say by that point the surprise has pretty much been spoiled anyway.

Having not heard much about House of the Wolfman online, I've let most of my excitement rest on the merit of the still photos and trailer that have been floating around the internet for the past year. Watching it I really wanted to experience a film that would transport me back into the birth of Universal Horror (1930s). Instead, the film seems to strike an uneasy balance between being an honest homage and an all-out satire.

It would be unfair to say that the film as a whole is ""bad,"" however I don't share the same mentality regarding the acting which is really what pulls the film down to Ed Wood status. Best described as uninspired, each actor and actress delivers their dialogue with such a sense of austere disinterest it's as if they're being held against their will. Lines that should be creepy are instead wooden and awkward while moments of brevity (mostly thanks to Jeremie Loncka's ""Sully"") seem too forced. Perhaps the most jarring and uncomfortable character was Jim Thalman's character, Archibald Whitlock, whose racist overtones are arguably more terrifying than the monster's themselves.

Actress Cheryl Rodes sizzle up the screen with some vintage eye candy about halfway through, but the real bits of excellence come from the small nuances that the film offer up including a creepy, disfigured grandmother and the special effects for the Wolfman. There's also a nice throwback to Dracula courtesy of the late Michael R. Thomas, but it happens so late in the film and without any real impact to the plot that it loses any of its campy intention.

Having not seen Eben McGarr's (writer, director, producer) previous film, Sick Girl, it's hard to make a comparison but with this being only his sophomore effort I'd have to say that it shows potential. At the very least I would have to say that McGarr should be commended for the scope of his intentions as I'm sure filming a period piece is no easy feat on an independent budget. With a better cast, a little editing and a bigger budget House of the Wolfman could have been everything I had waited for and more.",1287273600,5,3062,4.75894538606403
4181114,3,B003R9K0L0,"Let me start with the good stuff.  I grew up on Universal monster films and was eager to see this attempt at finishing the ""House of..."" cycle.  It captures the atmosphere of the period quite well, the full-orchestra score is dead on, and the monsters all look terrific.  So do the sets and the miniature castle shot at the open is as good as any from the classic movies.  This movie was clearly made lovingly by true fans, and that warns my soul.  Nods to Universal abound, such as cutaways to the Creature From the Black Lagoon skeleton on a table, alongside the glass dome contain the now dead and decomposed King homunculus from Bride of Frankenstein.

However, the script is laborious, it rough going even at 74 minutes.  When I was an hour and five minutes into it and still no monsters had shown, I knew we were in trouble.  Up to that point, it plays more like one of those Monogram mystery films more than Universal.  Things pick up when the monsters arrive, they look just great.  You can see the seams on the Frankenstein make-up, but the design is terrific and the black and white photography obscures some of the flaws.  There is no real setup for the monster, he just staggers in for the obligatory (and well staged) fight with the wolfman.  Dracula appears, too, right at the end and for apparently no reason.

The story falls apart when the creatures appear, but it's what we are here for, and the preceding hour is completely forgotten at that point.  Apparently by the film makers as well.

The acting from everyone is over the top, probably intentionally, but it is taken too far.  Watch the old Universal films.  The acting styles may be more stagey than we see today, but they are well-played by actors who believed what they were doing and consequently made you believe.  These guys are playing a campy style, and it is at odds with my respect for the old films.  Ron Chaney, here of course for his name alone, is the worst violator.  His annoying monotone gets very old very fast and he is completely incapable of carrying the titular role.

The sole exception the late Michael R. Thomas as Dracula, who seems to be channelling Lugosi.  Too bad there isn't more of him.

All that said, if you are a fan of these old movies, and they are your touchstone in life, as they are for me, then you can't afford to miss this uneven film with a big heart squarely in the right place.",1286841600,20,2397,4.472350230414746

Worst was "" FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLF MAN ""

with Bela""Dracula""Lugosi's VOICE, and was BLIND! After a
test pre-screening of ""FRANKENSTEIN [played by Lugosi]
MEETS THE WOLF MAN"", the audiance was screaming at
the screen ""Dracula!"" or just chuckled.
ALL of Lugosi's speaking was edited out, scenes were cut,
and often in the film (The Frankenstein monster's stumbling
around [blind] from the previous film [but NOT explained])
Lugosi's lips are moving without dialogue... looking like he
was trembling in fear. The movie is just a bit over an hour,
and only saved by Chaney's acting. NOT a favorite of MINE.

The ABBOTT & COSTELLO Blu-ray looks GREAT in the 2D

The first is despite the title resemblance to Universal's House Of Frankenstein and House Of Dracula films this is not a film that bridges the gap between the last mentioned and Abbott And Costello Meet Frankenstein. Indeed, Ron Chaney does not play the Larry Talbot that his predecessor Lon Chaney Jr. played so well (yes, the two Chaney's are related by blood but the werewolves are not). This is a different Wolfman altogether with a plot twist reminescent of the American added footage in ""Frankenstein's Bloody Terror"" (or was the last word horror instead of terror?) to justify the title change to one of Paul Naschy's own Wolfman movies. I will say that with all things considered the movie lives up to the title. The other thing wrong with the movie wasn't anybodys fault in that the movie ends before everything can be concluded. I say this was no one's fault because tragically the actor playing Dracula died before the film was completed. If like me you enjoy the ""old school"" monster movies like the Hammer movies, the aforementioned Paul Naschy series and especially the old Universal fils than you owe it to yourself to check this one out.",1374796800,2,1575,4.689530685920578
8403386,5,B003R9K0L0,this movie deserves better treatment than it is getting from the public... it is a loving tribute to the old monster mash-ups from Universal and the detail is worth the viewing!,1371945600,3,177,4.741935483870968
8403387,4,B003R9K0L0,"If you love the old Universal Horror films you will be pleasantly amused by this film.  Yes some of the acting is stilted, and it takes too long to get to the monsters, and the script is very slow paced.  However, its is as close as you can get to a new Universal Monster film, so worth it for that, and the guy that plays Dracula is total Lugosi, worth it to see that alone!",1332633600,2,375,3.986666666666667
8403388,3,B003R9K0L0,"While this movie appears to have tons of monster screen time based on the trailer circling the internet, it is actually devoid of the monsters themselves for much of the film until around the last 15 minutes.  It is a noble effort as a tribute to the classics of the 30's and 40's, but could have used significantly less dialogue, and more scenes with the monsters actually on screen.  Despite this, there are Easter Eggs throughout the film that any veteran of Classic Horror should be able to easily spot and be entertained by.  I would exclusively recommend this movie to only the most hardcore fans of the genre.  Anyone new to old horror films wishing to be exposed to the genre would be better off watching the actual films themselves from the 30's and 40's as they sadly contain significantly more monster action than this film does.",1312416000,2,840,4.655405405405405
8403389,2,B003R9K0L0,"I really _wanted_ to like this flick. I have a deep love of monster movies and a high tolerance for cheese -- but here's what you really need to know about this film:

We don't see any monsters (not counting a scary servant and granny) 'til more than an hour in -- and the film is only 1 hour and 15 minutes long.

Then, we get a complete cluster-F of monsters -- 6 to be exact, all crammed into about the last 10 minutes of the flick.  And most of those monsters come from the ""House of No Foreshadowing At All"" (an entirely different movie).

The movie has good lighting, costumes, sets, makeup, and general production values.  The music, heavily Salter/Skinner influenced, is passable.

But the direction and camera work are pedestrian at best.  (They squander the production values.)  The dialog is suitably 40s in most places, but the plot... Well, there really isn't one.

Oh, wait, there's the standard ""Old Dark House"" plot where a bunch of heirs are invited to a mysterious mansion/castle.  But, why were they invited?  The audience figures that out in under 5 minutes, but the characters spend the first hour talking about it.  And talking, and talking, and talking.  And the acting...?

SUPER 8 came out this weekend, and it's about kids making their own movies.  Within that film, there are other films: the ones the kids are making.  In a meta-film twist, in SUPER 8 we get to see young actors portraying both naturalistic kids (in the main movie) and kids performing what they _think_ a movie should be in the film-within-a-film.  The acting in this film is mostly on the level of that film-within-a-film.  That is, it's someone's _idea_ of what 40s monster movie acting _should_ be, rather than just letting the actors act.  Lots of line recitation, very little acting (or reacting).

Step One for making a successful 40s (or 50s or whatever) Monster Movie Homage/Parody: Decide whether you're doing a homage or a parody.  And if you're doing a parody, it better damn well be funny.  This one isn't funny enough to be parody or good enough to be homage.

As an author, I know a film is in trouble when I'm constantly rewriting it in my head as it progresses.  That started pretty early in this flick.

My friend (and award-winning short-film maker)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unforgettable-Harrowing-Futures-Horrors-Dark-Humor/dp/1456566407/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unforgettable: Harrowing Futures, Horrors, & (Dark) Humor</a>, who was watching this with me, walked out before the end of the first hour; Universal Films are holy writ to him, and he just couldn't take it any longer.  (Glad he missed the closing line, which pissed even _me_ off.)  I stayed 'til the end mostly because of the lighting and sets -- and a morbid desire to see how it turned out.  If the movie had started with the last 10 minutes, it could have been better -- but it didn't.

Avoid this unless you're looking for a lesson on how to squander good production values.
