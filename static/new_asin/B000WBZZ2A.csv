2965985,4,B000WBZZ2A,"I realized I did not have any of the Mad Max movies and needed to resolve that issue. With the new Mad Max Fury Road now in theaters, my son David and I needed to watch all the old ones before we went to the movies to see the new one. That is a ritual in our house. When a new addition to the series comes out, we do a movie marathon and watch all the old ones first.

It had been at least a decade since I have watched any of these movies. I have fond memories of them as they came out when I was much younger. Its amazing how time changes your recollections of the movie. I had completely forgotten how low budget the first Mad Max movie actually was! Don't get me wrong, its still one of my favorites, but it was nice seeing it again.

The quality of the DVDs was good, as was the sound quality. Not fantastic sound, but not too bad for a movie made in 1979. The box set comes nicely packed.",1433376000,,894,3.9337016574585637

2965999,2,B000WBZZ2A,"I bought this set because I had yet to own this epic series on Bluray.  I opted for the cheaper $20 version and I can't say it was a great choice.

The transfers are awful.  These are region free disks from another country.  Unfortunately I didn't know this when I bought it as it was a drop down option from the US release.  I'm a collector so stuff like box art matters to me.  The cases are double the size of a normal bluray and the artwork is atrocious.

There's some special features but Shout just did a Mad Max release that has way more to offer.  Honestly its better to either wait and see if WB releases an updated set on the heels of the new film, or for Shout to finish the series.  You could also get the single disk releases for a bit more but trust me it's worth it.  Road Warrior and Thunderdome can't look any worse on the US disks.

Like I said I'm a collector so I'll be a bit more picky about things, like how lazy the menus are.  Even so the poor transfer and fact it hogs double the shelf space make this less of a worthy deal for me.",1431388800,7,1056,4.024038461538462

2966005,5,B000WBZZ2A,"Born in the late 70s, I never thought I'd see these films as crystal-clear as they are presented here. This collection is my first time viewing these films on Blu Ray. When reviewing these 3 films together, the occasionally campy ""novelty"" death presents itself as well as some over-acting, but damn if it doesn't just fit. The films are apocalyptic fun that never takes itself too seriously. And may I add, it is an apocalyptic portrayal that has been mimicked countless times since its release.

Mad Max -- Legendary Australian highway policeman Max Rockatansky pursues the Night Rider a fiery crash, which sets the stage for the Night Rider's brutal motorcycle cohorts to plague the area with crime and mayhem in revenge. Max gets a head start on the ultimate downfall of society by taking-out the members of the gang one-by-one without regard to any semblance of a legal system. This oft-copied premise seldom even reaches the same neighborhood this film is in.

Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior -- With the human race in ""savage mode"" Rockatansky is nothing more than a savvy scavenger dodging sociopaths on the roads of Australia. When he happens upon a fellow drifter (and wins a brief battle of surprises with him) he discovers what is most likely the country's last gasoline refinery. Two problems: 1) it's well protected by a decent bunch and 2) a ruthless band of motorized militants led by Lord Humongous is determined to lay siege to the refinery and make it their own. Featuring a frantic desert chase as the climax, The Road Warrior is easily one of the best sequels of all time.

Mad Max: Beyond the Thunderdome -- Max falls victim right at the beginning to a high-speed aerial robbery and by hook and by crook, simply wants his camels and vehicle back. It may sound simple, but he has to wade through the... ""muck"" of Bartertown and its scuzzy, violent laws. As the title states, this film features one the most unique duels you'll ever see. This too has been often copied since this film. Although this film contains the trilogy's biggest stretches in plot, it's all in good fun as the entire series has never sought to preach the way hollywood seems fond of doing in these times.

All in all, you have a highly entertaining series of films and all three are vastly different from one another. My only letdown with this set of Blu Ray discs is there aren't quite as many extras as I was expecting. Yes, there are a few, but I figured this would be a set that collectors would covet.",1427500800,,2495,4.650793650793651

2966061,2,B000WBZZ2A,"Disclaimer: This review is solely for the box set on the whole and not for the films (which are really awesome, BTW.) This box set has hardly ANY special features. The first movie (Mad Max) has a few things--a featurette, and a few other little snips--and that's all. We thought, good to have and maybe we'll get more features with the later (and better known) films. Nope. The next film (Mad Max 2: Road Warrior) has an introduction by Leonard Maltin (way to be up-to-date!) and maybe an audio commentary (I can't remember). No featurette, no making of, no behind-the-sceens, nada. Then we get to the third film (Beyond the Thunderdome) and there is nothing. NOTHING. Just the movie. There are TONS of special little features on YouTube all about these films and virtually nothing on the box set. We buy box sets (and blu ray) to get extras and this was a total disappointment. If you just want the three movies on blu ray, all in the same box, this is the thing for you. If you like extras, buy the films cheap and watch YouTube.",1422316800,,1031,4.518716577540107

2966067,4,B000WBZZ2A,"The movies:

Mad Max: Good start, especially considering the low budget.  Most important as a setup for The Road Warrior.

The Road Warrior: One of the greatest action movies ever made.  Re-defined the genre.  Anybody who has seen only CGI NEEDS to watch this so as to witness what humans, as opposed to computers, can truly do.  Never bettered, in my opinion.

Thunderdome: First half, great.  Second half (lost boys) very dumb; jump the shark dumb.  As I understand the development, this movie started out as a lost boys/girls in dystopic future seeking civilization and got shoehorned into another Mad Max movie.  I think either of these halves would have made a much better movie than tying them both together with the rather thin thread of Barter Town.  Nevertheless, really great Mad Max-style action in the first half makes it watchable.

Good package.  Acceptable extra features.  Good price.  Good delivery.  No complaints.",1420761600,,943,5.025974025974026

Inside is a slightly larger typical blue ray case with the same artwork and when opened, the 3 blu-rays are inside snapped to a holder.  The artwork on the blu-rays are plain.  Just plack with the name and nothing else.  That's really disappointing.  The audio on Mad Max is really frustrating.  Some areas can't be heard well, while others are too loud. It drove me crazy adjusting the volume.  Other than that, it looks great on a scale from 7 to 10.  The road warrior is excellent although the picture could have been better.  When it comes on, it's the original Australian version that doesn't read, ""The Road Warrior"", but instead reads, ""Mad Max 2"".  The third film Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome again could be a better picture but decent.  The special features included are practically nothing and very disappointing. Again, I'm a huge Mad Max fan, and I just had to purchase this.  Unless something better comes out, this is the best collector's Blu-ray set out there.

When you put the Blu Ray case inside it, the back has this hollow space in it so if you have your discs together on a shelf, the disc next to the Mad Max steelbox slips into the hollow and you can't see it.

2966241,4,B000WBZZ2A,"First up, getting all three movies at once it's just a bonus so hooray for that.  Also, to have not already seen all three of these in their entirety is almost a sin.
Mad Max - Old movie, very much in the style of thrillers of its age using a lot of musical cues.  By current standards it was a bit corny but it still had a certain raw feel that more modern films don't pull off.  Then of course, the development of the character of Max as being slightly off in the head as a result of certain events.  I can dig it.
The Road Warrior - Very yes.  The cars, the bikes, the action, the absurd everything is made of leather outfits, the mediocre dialogue, this is post apocalyptic inspiration at its finest.
Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome - Too far.  Just, too far.  Reeks of cheese. The third movie in the series tried to follow in the footsteps of Road Warrior but failed.  Sorry kids with a prophecy, it didn't work.
Overall - As a big fan of the post-apocalypse genre, I feel obligated to own these movies largely because of what has been inspired over the years as a result of the imagery present in them.  Mad Max and The Road Warrior in particular stand out as movies that have largely defined what a gang of futuristic raiders looks like today.  On their own merits I'd be inclined to give this set three stars.  Thank you Thunderdome for screwing up the quality of the overall set.  Knowing what I do of how these films have inspired the things I enjoy so much today it gets a bonus star.",1395619200,,1491,4.266903914590747
2966242,5,B000WBZZ2A,"I am a really big Mel Gibson fan, and the Mad Max movies are a very unique trilogy. Without giving anything about the movies away, it's basically an apocalyptic world and Max is a character just trying to survive in it all.

The first movie plays out very differently then the second two, but it's a great film in that it sets the plot as to why Max is the way he is in the following films. It shows that he is a cop, and the best one on at that. Then you move on into the other 2 movies, and it shows how things just get worse and worse for the people of the world, and how people try and survive based on shaky agreements, with no one really able to trust anyone. It's all very good stuff.

These movies are nothing like modern day action movies, which is why they are such a great catch. In modern movies your action hero is invincible who almost never loses and can't be stopped. With Max that's not the case, he's not a superhero, he's just a cool guy that your watching go through the world. Sometimes he gets screwed over, sometimes he loses a fight, sometimes he gets beat up really bad. It makes for a much more interesting set of events, since your not sitting there thinking he's going to just beat everyone. Rather it plays out a bit more like real life, which is much more fun.

I'd say check it out, I personally am a big fan of Mad Max, and with the new one coming out next year it's good to catch up on the source material so you know what the story behind Max is.",1394928000,,1480,4.096551724137931

2966247,5,B000WBZZ2A,"Ever since I first saw the Road Warrior (AKA Mad Max 2), I have loved this post apcolyptic version of the ""Man With No Name"" (Clint Eastwood spagetti western stuff here folks).  This was Mel Gibson's debut before he became famous & had his trouble with everyone, including the law.
  Despite what he has become these days, Mel Gibson was, and is, the perfect example of how to play this type of character in this type of Genre.  Stripped down, low dialog, & high action.  Mel Gibson plays ""Mad"" Max Rostinkowski with a simple intensity that was rarely seen before this series & hasn't really been seen since.
  Mad Max, shows the breakdown of society & how one man became just as desolet as the world is becomming.
  The Road Warrior (AKA Mad Max 2), how the fight to survive becomes more important than the fight to keep society, or what's left of it there is, alive.
  Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, the most commercial of the current 3 films.  How does society put itself back together & what is Important.
  What most people don't realize, is that these three movies were very well known for the excellent car chase sequences & minimalistic qualities.  The entire series is a great way to spend an afternoon with your buddies with very little talking and alot of animal grunting eating pizza & chicken wings.

2966262,4,B000WBZZ2A,"While this set may be lacking in the special features department (if you really care about that kinda thing) as far as the movies go they all look better than ever before. The films themselves may be a different story. These movies aren't for everyone, but if you are buying this trilogy you probably know what you're getting.

The first film was made under the American International imprint which was a Samuel Z Arkoff company known for making exploitation films. Arkoff was actually an acronym for a formula used to make these films, A for Action, R for Revolution, K for Killing, O for Oratory, F for Fantasy and lastly F for Fornication.

The first Mad Max film had all of these elements, but because of budgetary constraints and raw guerilla filmmaking, the quality of the product was not very high and felt more like and exploitation film than the others. After the cult success of the first movie, Warner Brothers acquired the rights to the Mad Max franchise and turned out 'The Road Warrior', certainly the best of the bunch.

Finally Beyond Thunderdome was released with the Hollywood presence was strongly felt with the casting of the well known diva Tina Turner (not to mention using her music to open and close the film). All in all it's a good set but fanatics may want a bit more.",1389052800,,1295,4.646288209606987

2966269,5,B000WBZZ2A,"I enjoy the original Mad Max and am in love with Mad Max 2 aka The Road Warrior. Road Warrior broke the mold and still remains to this day one of the all-time greatest action movies EVER MADE. It almost single-handedly started the post-nuke cinema craze and inspired the copycat crazy Italians with the source material that kept them cranking out their low buck crazy fun rip-offs for nearly 20+ years afterwards.

These films look absolutely gorgeous on Bluray. It was like watching them all for the first time. It was worth the price alone just for The Road Warrior. Mad Max was great to hear uncut instead of the silly dubbed version. As for Tina Turner does Thunder Dome, I can take it or leave it. Anyhow, to get the other 2 films in the trilogy along with Warrior was just icing on the cake. Lots of great extras are included as well, spread across the three films, which sweetens the deal even further. Watch them on a good quality high-def big screen TV with a good sound system for best results. Prepare yourself... you will be blown away!

The tin case itself is a bit strange since it has an indent on the back side that looks like it could fit another blu-ray case in it but I have no idea what its purpose is (maybe stacking?).  Aside from he odd design, the art on the tin case is attractive and lends to the theme of the films.  The movie case is standard fare for blu-ray discs, with all three in one case.  The films play without issue and look pretty good.  My only gripe is the $35 price tag.  If this went for $20 it would be perfect.

2966346,3,B000WBZZ2A,"Be wary of any movie in a series that is over-shadowed by its own kin. The Road Warrior gets a good reputation for depicting a world torn asunder by the lawless fight for gasoline. It has some good moments, to be sure; but not wonder the first and third movies are mostly ignored.

In fact, you can be forgiven at first for thinking Mad Max is all about an Australian gang going about their activities; but no, we are actually to fallow a cop named Max who chickens out at the sight of his hospitalized friend and learns the hard way that running away from your problems is a very bad solution. You can trust me to not spoil the ending, but in part because there's not much of an ending to spoil!

And finally, Beyond Thunderdome is...probably co-written by children. That would explain the PG-13 rating in an otherwise R-rated trilogy, how the plot advances mostly by dumb luck and why most characters either come right out of the blue or go nowhere fast.",1379289600,2,956,4.457142857142857

There is only 30 minutes total for all 3 films, 2 audio commentaries and nothing except the trailer for the third film (the 52-minute 'Making of Beyond Thunderdome' and other previous extras aren't included). This franchise deserves much more in the way of bonus content (such as a 3-hour retrospective documentary) in a future release. Fans who own Mad Max and Road Warrior on Blu-ray may not want to upgrade because of the light treatment this set receives. I give the films 4 stars but this set gets 2 stars.

2966406,4,B000WBZZ2A,"Warner Bros. Home Entertainment celebrates the high-definition upgrade of ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" with the release of all three movies in a special set. The trilogy is presented in a tin box with exclusive art developed for the collection. The Blu-rays are housed inside a single case within its collectible cradle.

If you haven't seen the ""Mad Max"" movies by now, what are you waiting for? Any fan of action, sci-fi, or post-apocalyptic films will love all the entries in this franchise. You better get educated now before the upcoming video game and new movie, ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" hits theaters and you're left in the dust wondering what all the fuss is about.

The movies can be summed up quite easily. Max is an ex-police officer that gets caught up in other people's problems in a post-apocalyptic world where gas and other everyday commodities have become extremely scarce. In order to get these people out of trouble, he somehow always ends up in a fast-paced battle between futuristic weaponized cars built out of junkyard scraps. Just watching these vehicular skirmishes will provide therapy for anyone's road rage.

One of the coolest things about the ""Mad Max"" trilogy is that every film is co-directed and co-written by the same person. Besides partially giving up the director's chair during production of ""Beyond Thunderdome,"" George Miller spearheaded each one. They all have a consistency many franchises lose between films because of changes in directors, writers, and the likes. Miller will continue to helm the next films in the series, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" and ""Mad Max: Furiosa.""

""Mad Max"" and ""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"" both contain some unnecessary scenes of brief nudity. Who can forget the buttless chaps the one guy in ""The Road Warrior"" wears? Obviously, there's graphic sequences of violence and some bad language as well.

I wish there was more to report as far as special features are concerned. Audio commentary by DP David Eggby, art director Jon Dowding, special effects supervisor Chris Murray, and film historian Tim Ridge is included on the ""Mad Max"" disc. It also contains a featurette entitled ""'Mad Max:' The Film Phenomenon"" and two theatrical trailers.

""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"" features an introduction by Leonard Maltin and audio commentary with Director / Writer George Miller and Cinematographer Dean Semler. A theatrical trailer is included as well.

""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" only has a theatrical trailer. I wonder why they didn't feature the two Tina Turner videos she made for the songs featured in the movie. Both ""We Don't Need Another Hero"" and ""One of the Living"" were top 20 hits.

All three movies look and sound fabulous thanks to a great high-definition transfer. They have a clean picture while maintaining the grit and grime that made the movies so great when they first came out. Each one features a bombastic 5.1 surround sound mix that intensifies the roaring engines of the post-apocalyptic vehicles and highlights the excellent musical scores.

Whether you're watching the ""Mad Max"" movies for the first or fiftieth time, these new high-definition transfers are the way to go. They've never looked and sounded better without losing the visual intensity and edge of their original theatrical releases. These Blu-ray versions are another perfect example of films being preserved without sacrificing their cinematic character.",1371600000,4,3408,5.126126126126126
2966407,5,B000WBZZ2A,It is ok.  It was as I expected.  Those movies are classic for people like me.  Not tipical scify. Ok.,1371427200,,102,4.0
2966408,3,B000WBZZ2A,"First thing's first: this US Blu-Ray set is 100% NOT Region Free.

MAD MAX is Region A locked, so do not buy this set if you don't own a multi-region or Region A compatible Blu-Ray player. MAD MAX 2/THE ROAD WARRIOR and MAD MAX: BEYOND THUNDERDOME however, are both Region Free!

Right, onto the films and the set itself.

MAD MAX: The first movie is fantastic: a jaw-dropping action film like no other, made at a time without CGI, when stunt men and women really put their lives in danger, for our entertainment.

The disc allows viewers to watch the film in the original Australian audio-track in a newly-created DTS HD Master Audio 6.1 soundtrack or dual-mono if you prefer, or the horrifically awful US English Dub, (in dual-mono only) in which many of the characters are dubbed into American English. Not only does it sound terrible as a soundtrack, it's a pretty ropey dub. Considering all the dubbers had to do was translate Australian English into American English, it really shouldn't have been that hard. But boy, oh, boy, do the dubbers monumentally screw this up!

Stick to the original Australian, and you won't go wrong. It's a meaty, beefy, loud and monsterous sounding 6.1 track, and the throng of the car and bike engines really feel like they're being revved in your living room! (Other audio track and subtitle options are available, including English Subs for the Deaf and Hard Of Hearing.)

The picture looks very good, but I'm sure it could be improved, if someone was willing to give it the time and care it needed. I have no idea if the Blu-Ray 1080p print is taken from a 35mm Master Negative, or not, but whilst it looks clear and crisp, it probably could look even better. Still, you won't be too disappointed. The print is totally uncut, which is always a plus-point, including some of the slightly gorier moments that some countries removed or toned down. So if you've not seen it uncut, then this is a good reason to own this set.

There's a 25-minute featurette, but I've not seen that yet, plus an audio commentary. Not exactly the best set of extras, but it's something. However, definitely a case of ""must try harder""!

MAD MAX 2: Also known as THE ROAD WARRIOR, improves on the original, in so many ways. A bigger, better, more souped-up version of the first, this is a film for petrol-heads and action-fans!

Essentially, an action film, with minimal plot, but it's a stunner! Feel every single car crash, every bike smash, and every pounding thud, screech and squeal, as vehicles and people are trashed. There are too many great moments to single out, but the Gyrocopter scene is always a good one.

Again, we have another newly-created for this set, DTS HD Master Audio 6.1 soundtrack. The print is once again, uncut and uncensored, including some gory violence that was cut in some countries. The print used on the film is back to what it should be - namely MAD MAX 2, and not THE ROAD WARRIOR. Alas, the extras are the exact same ones on the old Warner's Blu-Ray release: one audio commentary, and a short intro from film critic Leonard Maltin. Fun, but not exactly great by any means. Where are the behind-the-scenes shots, or outtakes of the many incredible stunts? Disppointing, but forgiveable, purely because the film itself is so damn good. Sadly, the menu screen is cheap, and naff. A static shot, and a few icons at the bottom that let you play the film, select a chapter, play the trailer, or chose your audio and/or subtitle options.

MAD MAX: BEYOND THUNDERDOME: Definitely a disappointment after the high's of the first two films, this feels very much like a typical Hollywood ""third wheel"". It's an okay film, with an okay plot, and okay characters. It's decidedly very average. Gibson and Turner try their best, and whilst there are occasional moments of greatness, it's definitely not a winner, even if you take the film as a bog-standard action film, let alone as a MAD MAX movie.

On this disc, you get a reasonable set of soundtracks and subtitle options, but it becomes clear very quickly, that no one at Warners was that bothered with this film. There are no extras, other than a 4:3 VHS-quality trailer. The menu screen is as static as they come, though it does tie-in to MAD MAX 2/THE ROAD WARRIOR. And you're left feeling like this was very much an unnecessary add-on to both the franchise, and this Blu-Ray box set too.

Talking of which, the Steelbook case is more like a thin tin, rather than a true Steelbook Case. Essentially, a case, with a lid, printed all over, it looks nice, but it's not exactly outstanding by any means. It also feels thin, and a little on the cheap side of things. If you're ordering this, you may want to double-check your set arrives undented and unmarked.

Inside the case, is a standard-sized Blu-Ray Amaray case, with a tray that holds the first two discs, and then the third disc goes inside in the usual position. The discs are dull: plain black with just the titles on, and a few other superfluous details, and the sleeve artwork is merely acceptable, though not great. Oh, and it's one of those horrible ""recyclable"" Amaray cases, with the tri-arrow recycling logo cut out of the front and back of the case. Not only does this mean the case is physically less strong, it offers less protection to the discs themselves, and there's the added potential that you can puncture the sleeve artwork, causing a nasty, irreparable tear. It smacks of cheapness. Companies need to stop using these cases immediately! I know they may be better for the environment, but on premium products like Blu-Ray's, they really do give the customer the view that you don't care if their purchase arrives damaged!

So, overall, one great film, one truly superb film, and one distinctly underwhelming film, all wrapped-up in so-so extras, and an okay case. Most people will be buying this set for the first two films, but it really does feel like this is a lot of money, for a set that's not really worth it's weight. I'm certain that once MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is unleashed onto the  public, there may well be a Quadrilogy set released, but don't bank on it containing many more extras for the first three films.

Such a shame that Warners decided that MAD MAX fans weren't worth bothering with. Ultimately, a very disappointing set. Nice to own, but wait until the price comes down.

ADDENUDUM: There are no forms of digital copies included. UK Region B fans should take a look at the UK Release due out on 12th August 2013 as shown at Amazon UK here...  http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mad-Max-Trilogy-Ultimate-Collectors/dp/B00CP1ZRYQ/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top

Be warned, though. The UK tin set, designed to look like a petrol/jerry can, is cheap looking, and cheaply made, and to be frank, is not even as nice to look at as the US Version.

Price-wise, the US set is a 1 or two more expensive, when importing to the UK, but if I were a fan, I'd still buy the US Set! It's simply not as tacky as the UK version looks. However, if you can't play Region A Blu-Ray discs, then you have no choice, but to buy the forthcoming UK release.",1371254400,63,7101,4.678428227746592
2966409,4,B000WBZZ2A,"Real good box set.  This was the first time I saw the original Mad Max with the original voices (Everytime I've seen before it was dubbed).  Anyways, my only complaint is the lack of special features.  Mad Max had one that was cool, but The Road Warrior and Beyond the Thunderdome was bare.",1370908800,2,290,4.433962264150943
2966410,4,B000WBZZ2A,"Since ""Fury Road"" (the fourth Mad Max film) is up for release next year, this three-disc collection serves up the first ""trilogy"" of Mad Max films from 1978-1985 to attract new fans.  Two of the three movies (""Mad Max"" and ""The Road Warrior"", aka ""Mad Max 2"") have been released on Blu-ray already, and the content of those two discs remains mostly the same.  In fact, ""Mad Max"" is basically the same disc with new artwork, but ""The Road Warrior"" features slightly better video quality (due to a new encoding) and a terrific new lossless DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio track.  The bonus features on both discs are identical.

The third film, ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"", is new to Blu-ray and debuts as part of this collection.  Sadly, the only extra is the film's trailer (older releases, including the DVD, were the same way), but at least the A/V quality is quite good.  Other than that, this three-disc collection is packaged in a nice metal tin and looks cool.

If you already own the first two films on Blu-ray, this might be tough to recommended.  I didn't, so it was worth the price of admission.  All three films hold up pretty well, especially due to the great A/V presentation that a quality Blu-ray treatment can provide.",1370822400,45,1227,4.669767441860465
2966411,5,B000WBZZ2A,"It's been long overdue for this one.
Roadwarrior comes with losesless audio btw which is really great.
Beyond Thunderdome just seems like a whole new picture. Great remaster esp the video transfer.
Couldn't be anymore happier with this purchase.
I'm so thrilled. Would've been nice if there some more substantial extras.",1370649600,3,320,5.294117647058823
2966412,5,B000WBZZ2A,"Soon after George Miller's ""Mad Max"" and ""The Road Warrior"" burst onto the cinematic landscape in the early `80s, they ushered in a whole new genre of thrillers where warring gangs ruled the roads, fighting for gasoline and whatever scraps of food were left behind by scavengers. Many of those imitators have been (deservedly) forgotten as the years have passed, yet the MAD MAX TRILOGY itself remains a favorite of fans, with Miller's brilliantly edited set-pieces keeping viewers enthralled despite the familiar settings of a post-apocalyptic wasteland.

Warner Home Video's newly-released Blu-Ray box-set of the ""Mad Max Trilogy"" offers - in a single, three-disc Blu-Ray case (housed inside a slightly unattractive oversized tin) - a reprise of MGM's original ""Mad Max"" BD; a new AVC encode of ""The Road Warrior,"" premiering here with a DTS MA soundtrack; and the HD debut of the third film in the series, ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.""

The original MAD MAX finds Mel Gibson launching his career as a tough cop in a world where unhinged loonies - including Hugh Keays-Byrne as the nefarious ""Toecutter"" - attack unsuspecting motorists and innocent civilians. Max's battles with his own bosses - desperately hoping to keep ""heroes"" on the road - are contrasted with the violent attacks of the gangs, and once Max's partner is killed and his wife and child targeted by the thugs, Max turns from desperation to anger in a soon-to-be-post-apocalyptic society quickly spiraling out of control.

Though ""Mad Max""'s world is only semi-futuristic compared to the films that followed, it's still a bleak, and captivating, environment that Miller captured on-screen - particularly considering the era in which the movie was originally released. The various car chases and action sequences deliver the goods, and while the picture - penned by Miller and producer Byron Kennedy from James McCausland's original story - isn't as compelling or tightly packaged as the film's immediate sequel, the original ""Mad Max"" remains one of the most important productions to originate Down Under. The picture ignited Gibson and Miller's respective careers, single-handedly ushered in a whole genre of similarly-themed cash-ins, and along with the works of Peter Weir, announced the Aussie film industry as a major player in world cinema.

It's also a movie that's perpetually had to shake off a nagging reputation that it's inferior to its sequel - something not helped by the fact that many of us originally saw the film second, after ""The Road Warrior"" was released, and usually in lousy TV prints at that. With its widescreen Todd-AO dimensions cropped, and its original Aussie dialogue dubbed by Samuel Arkoff's American-International, it's no wonder ""Mad Max"" came off for many years as the weaker sibling compared to ""The Road Warrior."" Still, taken on its own terms as an appetizer before the main course, and with its technical trappings restored, it's an involving, memorable picture with striking directorial choices.

MGM's Blu-Ray here boasts the same exact presentation as its prior BD release. The 1080p AVC encoded transfer offers an appreciable enhancement over its decade-old Special Edition DVD, limited only by the occasional griminess of its source materials, while most of the potent extras from that release have been carried over, including a 25-minute retrospective documentary and an insightful audio commentary featuring cinematographer David Eggby, Jon Dowding, Tim Ridge and Chris Murray. These extras, along with the U.S. trailers, are on-hand, plus a remixed DTS MA soundtrack of the original Aussie dialogue and Brian May's occasionally bombastic score (the American-International U.S. dubbed track is also included in its original mono).

One of the best looking Blu-Ray catalog releases, ""Max""'s sequel, THE ROAD WARRIOR, has now been surpassed by a remastered Warner Blu-Ray that's even better than its predecessor, though more so for an augmented audio track than its slightly enhanced visuals.

Gibson returns here as a more haunted, grizzled Max, with the world now completed dominated by punks while bands of humanity attempt to survive in the wasteland. Miller, Terry Hayes and Brian Hannant's script works in elements of classic westerns like ""Shane"" as Max reluctantly bands together with the survivors - including Bruce Spence's Gyro Captain - to ward off the villains.

""The Road Warrior"" has always been one of my favorite films of the early `80s - an improvement on the original ""Mad Max"" in every way (from Miller's direction to Gibson's performance and Brian May's more sophisticated, richer score) and a driving, thrilling piece of sci-fi action that's never been duplicated in its genre. Its straightforward story, lack of extraneous dialogue and subplots, emphasis on the pursuit and energy of its chase sequences, and the brilliant editing and choreography of those set-pieces makes it an all-time classic - a movie that stands alone from its bookending pictures as a spectacular piece of filmmaking.

Working from the original negative, ""The Road Warrior"" looked great on the prior Blu-Ray and has been improved by superior AVC encoding here, though in general, the two transfers look roughly the same. As with before, Dean Semler's rugged, atmospheric cinematography is enhanced by high-def, with eye-popping colors and detailed textures on-hand at every turn; it's a dazzling transfer of a film that demands to be seen this way, or not at all. The audio here also receives an upgrade with a lossless DTS MA mix (the prior Blu-Ray's audio was rendered as a basic 5.1 Dolby Digital track) that rumbles with bass and a superb soundstage for May's musical output.

The disc otherwise is identical to the original Blu-Ray, with a pair of exclusive-to-HD extras included: a commentary track with George Miller and Dean Semler, along with a brief introduction from Leonard Maltin that puts the movie into the context of its other series films, plus the original trailer.

The worldwide success of ""The Road Warrior"" - and in particular its breakthrough performance at the U.S. box-office in 1982 - lead to another sequel, this time augmented by a larger budget afforded by its predecessor's commercial success.

Deciding to go in something of a different direction, George Miller opted to turn MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME into something of a more ""emotional"" piece less driven by violence and high-octane set-pieces. Miller and writer Terry Hayes took a cue from Max's arc in ""The Road Warrior"" and turned him into a slightly more charismatic, ""Man With No Name"" sort here, with Max stumbling into a post-apocalyptic village named ""Bartertown."" There, a political struggle ensues between leader Aunty Entity (Tina Turner) and the diminutive ""Master"" (Angelo Rossitto), who's the only one (apparently) who understands how to produce methane to power the town. Aunty strikes a deal with Max to knock off Master's physical bodyguard ""Blaster,"" but circumstances eventually send Max off into the wasteland again, where he finds a ""Lord of the Flies"" type community of youngsters waiting for the messianic ""Captain Walker"" to return.

Miller co-directed ""Thunderdome"" with associate George Ogilvie, something that might explain the uneven pacing of this more ambitious, though decidedly least successful, of the ""Mad Max"" series. There are a pair of dynamite set-pieces on-hand when Max takes to the Thunderdome to battle the hulking Blaster, and Miller caps the film with one last, stirring chase with Max and the young refugees trying to escape from Aunty's gang on a train. As potent as these moments are, however, they're surrounded by a meandering mid-section where Max finds the castoff children, who look as if they've come out of the William Golding novel by way of the Ewoks in ""Return of the Jedi."" Their society isn't nearly as developed as it should've been, and for a group of naive youngsters who presumably haven't encountered anything of the punk-driven outside world, why one of them actually drops an f-bomb when they re-enter Bartertown is patently nonsensical.

There's also an obvious lack of energy in ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" at times. The thrilling, fast-paced intensity of the earlier films is replaced here with a more deliberately paced fantasy approach, and for fans of ""The Road Warrior,"" this PG-13 rated, decidedly less violent picture can be (and has often been written off as) a shock to the system. Even the production design of Bartertown seems uninspired, employing a ""Temple of Doom""-like aesthetic that makes you think Mola Ram is going to pop out at any second.

Still, there are assorted pleasures to be found: Gibson exudes more of his natural charisma here, and this decidedly ""looser"" Max feels like a natural progression of the hardened warrior who rediscovered his humanity at the end of ""The Road Warrior."" Dean Semler's wide scope cinematography is once again stylish, and Turner brings sufficient life to her scenes as a scavenger who's recreated herself as the leader of Bartertown (""he's just a raggedy man!""). What's more, Maurice Jarre's glorious orchestral score helps to smooth over some of the picture's rough passages - with its sweeping scale and melodic interludes, ""Thunderdome"" is one of Jarre's strongest efforts from one of his most prolific periods (his marvelous ""Enemy Mine"" score would follow just a few months later). In fact, the climactic, 12-minute chase cue has to rank as one of Jarre's greatest in his esteemed career.

Although it's a definite comedown from ""The Road Warrior,"" ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" is an admirable attempt at tweaking the formula established by its predecessors. Miller even manages to craft a surprisingly moving epilogue for the film as well, paying tribute to his late associate - producer Byron Kennedy - as the movie fades out and brings the original ""Mad Max"" trilogy to an emotionally satisfying close.

With only the theatrical trailer as an extra, ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome""'s Blu-Ray debut comes in the form of a highly detailed 1080p AVC encoded transfer. The DTS MA soundtrack packs an impressive punch when Jarre's score takes center stage, though it's unfortunate his final cue was dialed in so low in the original mix.

With Miller having completed filming on ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" (apparently due for release sometime in 2014), it'll be interesting to see how the eclectic filmmaker - who hasn't directed a live-action film not aimed at children in 20 years - returns to the film series he's most remembered for.",1370476800,117,10552,5.204358068315665
2966413,3,B000WBZZ2A,"So, the Mad Max Trilogy, are easily some of the my favorite movies ever!

With the new Mad Max Fury Road now in theaters, my son David and I needed to watch all the old ones before we went to the movies to see the new one. That is a ritual in our house. When a new addition to the series comes out, we do a movie marathon and watch all the old ones first.

It had been at least a decade since I have watched any of these movies. I have fond memories of them as they came out when I was much younger. Its amazing how time changes your recollections of the movie. I had completely forgotten how low budget the first Mad Max movie actually was! Don't get me wrong, its still one of my favorites, but it was nice seeing it again.

The quality of the DVDs was good, as was the sound quality. Not fantastic sound, but not too bad for a movie made in 1979. The box set comes nicely packed.",1433376000,,894,3.9337016574585637

3200496,2,B000WBZZ2A,"I bought this set because I had yet to own this epic series on Bluray.  I opted for the cheaper $20 version and I can't say it was a great choice.

The transfers are awful.  These are region free disks from another country.  Unfortunately I didn't know this when I bought it as it was a drop down option from the US release.  I'm a collector so stuff like box art matters to me.  The cases are double the size of a normal bluray and the artwork is atrocious.

There's some special features but Shout just did a Mad Max release that has way more to offer.  Honestly its better to either wait and see if WB releases an updated set on the heels of the new film, or for Shout to finish the series.  You could also get the single disk releases for a bit more but trust me it's worth it.  Road Warrior and Thunderdome can't look any worse on the US disks.

Like I said I'm a collector so I'll be a bit more picky about things, like how lazy the menus are.  Even so the poor transfer and fact it hogs double the shelf space make this less of a worthy deal for me.",1431388800,7,1056,4.024038461538462

3200502,5,B000WBZZ2A,"Born in the late 70s, I never thought I'd see these films as crystal-clear as they are presented here. This collection is my first time viewing these films on Blu Ray. When reviewing these 3 films together, the occasionally campy ""novelty"" death presents itself as well as some over-acting, but damn if it doesn't just fit. The films are apocalyptic fun that never takes itself too seriously. And may I add, it is an apocalyptic portrayal that has been mimicked countless times since its release.

Mad Max -- Legendary Australian highway policeman Max Rockatansky pursues the Night Rider a fiery crash, which sets the stage for the Night Rider's brutal motorcycle cohorts to plague the area with crime and mayhem in revenge. Max gets a head start on the ultimate downfall of society by taking-out the members of the gang one-by-one without regard to any semblance of a legal system. This oft-copied premise seldom even reaches the same neighborhood this film is in.

Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior -- With the human race in ""savage mode"" Rockatansky is nothing more than a savvy scavenger dodging sociopaths on the roads of Australia. When he happens upon a fellow drifter (and wins a brief battle of surprises with him) he discovers what is most likely the country's last gasoline refinery. Two problems: 1) it's well protected by a decent bunch and 2) a ruthless band of motorized militants led by Lord Humongous is determined to lay siege to the refinery and make it their own. Featuring a frantic desert chase as the climax, The Road Warrior is easily one of the best sequels of all time.

Mad Max: Beyond the Thunderdome -- Max falls victim right at the beginning to a high-speed aerial robbery and by hook and by crook, simply wants his camels and vehicle back. It may sound simple, but he has to wade through the... ""muck"" of Bartertown and its scuzzy, violent laws. As the title states, this film features one the most unique duels you'll ever see. This too has been often copied since this film. Although this film contains the trilogy's biggest stretches in plot, it's all in good fun as the entire series has never sought to preach the way hollywood seems fond of doing in these times.

All in all, you have a highly entertaining series of films and all three are vastly different from one another. My only letdown with this set of Blu Ray discs is there aren't quite as many extras as I was expecting. Yes, there are a few, but I figured this would be a set that collectors would covet.",1427500800,,2495,4.650793650793651

The first movie (Mad Max) has a few things--a featurette, and a few other little snips--and that's all. We thought, good to have and maybe we'll get more features with the later (and better known) films. Nope. The next film (Mad Max 2: Road Warrior) has an introduction by Leonard Maltin (way to be up-to-date!) and maybe an audio commentary (I can't remember). No featurette, no making of, no behind-the-sceens, nada. Then we get to the third film (Beyond the Thunderdome) and there is nothing. NOTHING. Just the movie. There are TONS of special little features on YouTube all about these films and virtually nothing on the box set. We buy box sets (and blu ray) to get extras and this was a total disappointment. If you just want the three movies on blu ray, all in the same box, this is the thing for you. If you like extras, buy the films cheap and watch YouTube.",1422316800,,1031,4.518716577540107

3200564,4,B000WBZZ2A,"The movies:

Mad Max: Good start, especially considering the low budget.  Most important as a setup for The Road Warrior.

The Road Warrior: One of the greatest action movies ever made.  Re-defined the genre.  Anybody who has seen only CGI NEEDS to watch this so as to witness what humans, as opposed to computers, can truly do.  Never bettered, in my opinion.

Thunderdome: First half, great.  Second half (lost boys) very dumb; jump the shark dumb.  As I understand the development, this movie started out as a lost boys/girls in dystopic future seeking civilization and got shoehorned into another Mad Max movie.  I think either of these halves would have made a much better movie than tying them both together with the rather thin thread of Barter Town.  Nevertheless, really great Mad Max-style action in the first half makes it watchable.

Inside is a slightly larger typical blue ray case with the same artwork and when opened, the 3 blu-rays are inside snapped to a holder.  The artwork on the blu-rays are plain.  Just plack with the name and nothing else.  That's really disappointing.  The audio on Mad Max is really frustrating.  Some areas can't be heard well, while others are too loud. It drove me crazy adjusting the volume.  Other than that, it looks great on a scale from 7 to 10.  The road warrior is excellent although the picture could have been better.  When it comes on, it's the original Australian version that doesn't read, ""The Road Warrior"", but instead reads, ""Mad Max 2"".  The third film Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome again could be a better picture but decent.  The special features included are practically nothing and very disappointing. Again, I'm a huge Mad Max fan, and I just had to purchase this.  Unless something better comes out, this is the best collector's Blu-ray set out there.

When you put the Blu Ray case inside it, the back has this hollow space in it so if you have your discs together on a shelf, the disc next to the Mad Max steelbox slips into the hollow and you can't see it. Maybe it's supposed to be an ashtray or a candy dish, I don't know what it's supposed to be.

3200738,4,B000WBZZ2A,"First up, getting all three movies at once it's just a bonus so hooray for that.  Also, to have not already seen all three of these in their entirety is almost a sin.
Mad Max - Old movie, very much in the style of thrillers of its age using a lot of musical cues.  By current standards it was a bit corny but it still had a certain raw feel that more modern films don't pull off.  Then of course, the development of the character of Max as being slightly off in the head as a result of certain events.  I can dig it.
The Road Warrior - Very yes.  The cars, the bikes, the action, the absurd everything is made of leather outfits, the mediocre dialogue, this is post apocalyptic inspiration at its finest.
Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome - Too far.  Just, too far.  Reeks of cheese. The third movie in the series tried to follow in the footsteps of Road Warrior but failed.  Sorry kids with a prophecy, it didn't work.
Overall - As a big fan of the post-apocalypse genre, I feel obligated to own these movies largely because of what has been inspired over the years as a result of the imagery present in them.  Mad Max and The Road Warrior in particular stand out as movies that have largely defined what a gang of futuristic raiders looks like today.  On their own merits I'd be inclined to give this set three stars.  Thank you Thunderdome for screwing up the quality of the overall set.  Knowing what I do of how these films have inspired the things I enjoy so much today it gets a bonus star.",1395619200,,1491,4.266903914590747
3200739,5,B000WBZZ2A,"I am a really big Mel Gibson fan, and the Mad Max movies are a very unique trilogy. Without giving anything about the movies away, it's basically an apocalyptic world and Max is a character just trying to survive in it all.

The first movie plays out very differently then the second two, but it's a great film in that it sets the plot as to why Max is the way he is in the following films. It shows that he is a cop, and the best one on at that. Then you move on into the other 2 movies, and it shows how things just get worse and worse for the people of the world, and how people try and survive based on shaky agreements, with no one really able to trust anyone. It's all very good stuff.

These movies are nothing like modern day action movies, which is why they are such a great catch. In modern movies your action hero is invincible who almost never loses and can't be stopped. With Max that's not the case, he's not a superhero, he's just a cool guy that your watching go through the world. Sometimes he gets screwed over, sometimes he loses a fight, sometimes he gets beat up really bad. It makes for a much more interesting set of events, since your not sitting there thinking he's going to just beat everyone. Rather it plays out a bit more like real life, which is much more fun.

I'd say check it out, I personally am a big fan of Mad Max, and with the new one coming out next year it's good to catch up on the source material so you know what the story behind Max is.",1394928000,,1480,4.096551724137931

3200744,5,B000WBZZ2A,"Ever since I first saw the Road Warrior (AKA Mad Max 2), I have loved this post apcolyptic version of the ""Man With No Name"" (Clint Eastwood spagetti western stuff here folks).  This was Mel Gibson's debut before he became famous & had his trouble with everyone, including the law.
  Despite what he has become these days, Mel Gibson was, and is, the perfect example of how to play this type of character in this type of Genre.  Stripped down, low dialog, & high action.  Mel Gibson plays ""Mad"" Max Rostinkowski with a simple intensity that was rarely seen before this series & hasn't really been seen since.
  Mad Max, shows the breakdown of society & how one man became just as desolet as the world is becomming.
  The Road Warrior (AKA Mad Max 2), how the fight to survive becomes more important than the fight to keep society, or what's left of it there is, alive.
  Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, the most commercial of the current 3 films.  How does society put itself back together & what is Important.
  What most people don't realize, is that these three movies were very well known for the excellent car chase sequences & minimalistic qualities.  The entire series is a great way to spend an afternoon with your buddies with very little talking and alot of animal grunting eating pizza & chicken wings.

3200759,4,B000WBZZ2A,"While this set may be lacking in the special features department (if you really care about that kinda thing) as far as the movies go they all look better than ever before. The films themselves may be a different story. These movies aren't for everyone, but if you are buying this trilogy you probably know what you're getting.

The first film was made under the American International imprint which was a Samuel Z Arkoff company known for making exploitation films. Arkoff was actually an acronym for a formula used to make these films, A for Action, R for Revolution, K for Killing, O for Oratory, F for Fantasy and lastly F for Fornication.

The first Mad Max film had all of these elements, but because of budgetary constraints and raw guerilla filmmaking, the quality of the product was not very high and felt more like and exploitation film than the others. After the cult success of the first movie, Warner Brothers acquired the rights to the Mad Max franchise and turned out 'The Road Warrior', certainly the best of the bunch.

Finally Beyond Thunderdome was released with the Hollywood presence was strongly felt with the casting of the well known diva Tina Turner (not to mention using her music to open and close the film). All in all it's a good set but fanatics may want a bit more.",1389052800,,1295,4.646288209606987

3200766,5,B000WBZZ2A,"I enjoy the original Mad Max and am in love with Mad Max 2 aka The Road Warrior. Road Warrior broke the mold and still remains to this day one of the all-time greatest action movies EVER MADE. It almost single-handedly started the post-nuke cinema craze and inspired the copycat crazy Italians with the source material that kept them cranking out their low buck crazy fun rip-offs for nearly 20+ years afterwards.

These films look absolutely gorgeous on Bluray. It was like watching them all for the first time. It was worth the price alone just for The Road Warrior. Mad Max was great to hear uncut instead of the silly dubbed version. As for Tina Turner does Thunder Dome, I can take it or leave it. Anyhow, to get the other 2 films in the trilogy along with Warrior was just icing on the cake. Lots of great extras are included as well, spread across the three films, which sweetens the deal even further. Watch them on a good quality high-def big screen TV with a good sound system for best results. Prepare yourself... you will be blown away! Viewing The Road Warrior on my 60"" with the sound cranked up was a near-religious experience! LOL!",1388016000,,1147,4.541062801932367

The tin case itself is a bit strange since it has an indent on the back side that looks like it could fit another blu-ray case in it but I have no idea what its purpose is (maybe stacking?).  Aside from he odd design, the art on the tin case is attractive and lends to the theme of the films.  The movie case is standard fare for blu-ray discs, with all three in one case.

3200843,3,B000WBZZ2A,"Be wary of any movie in a series that is over-shadowed by its own kin. The Road Warrior gets a good reputation for depicting a world torn asunder by the lawless fight for gasoline. It has some good moments, to be sure; but not wonder the first and third movies are mostly ignored.

In fact, you can be forgiven at first for thinking Mad Max is all about an Australian gang going about their activities; but no, we are actually to fallow a cop named Max who chickens out at the sight of his hospitalized friend and learns the hard way that running away from your problems is a very bad solution. You can trust me to not spoil the ending, but in part because there's not much of an ending to spoil!

And finally, Beyond Thunderdome is...probably co-written by children. That would explain the PG-13 rating in an otherwise R-rated trilogy, how the plot advances mostly by dumb luck and why most characters either come right out of the blue or go nowhere fast.",1379289600,2,956,4.457142857142857

There is only 30 minutes total for all 3 films, 2 audio commentaries and nothing except the trailer for the third film (the 52-minute 'Making of Beyond Thunderdome' and other previous extras aren't included). This franchise deserves much more in the way of bonus content (such as a 3-hour retrospective documentary) in a future release. Fans who own Mad Max and Road Warrior on Blu-ray may not want to upgrade because of the light treatment this set receives. I give the films 4 stars but this set gets 2 stars.

3200903,4,B000WBZZ2A,"Warner Bros. Home Entertainment celebrates the high-definition upgrade of ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" with the release of all three movies in a special set. The trilogy is presented in a tin box with exclusive art developed for the collection. The Blu-rays are housed inside a single case within its collectible cradle.

If you haven't seen the ""Mad Max"" movies by now, what are you waiting for? Any fan of action, sci-fi, or post-apocalyptic films will love all the entries in this franchise. You better get educated now before the upcoming video game and new movie, ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" hits theaters and you're left in the dust wondering what all the fuss is about.

The movies can be summed up quite easily. Max is an ex-police officer that gets caught up in other people's problems in a post-apocalyptic world where gas and other everyday commodities have become extremely scarce. In order to get these people out of trouble, he somehow always ends up in a fast-paced battle between futuristic weaponized cars built out of junkyard scraps. Just watching these vehicular skirmishes will provide therapy for anyone's road rage.

One of the coolest things about the ""Mad Max"" trilogy is that every film is co-directed and co-written by the same person. Besides partially giving up the director's chair during production of ""Beyond Thunderdome,"" George Miller spearheaded each one. They all have a consistency many franchises lose between films because of changes in directors, writers, and the likes. Miller will continue to helm the next films in the series, ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" and ""Mad Max: Furiosa.""

""Mad Max"" and ""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"" both contain some unnecessary scenes of brief nudity. Who can forget the buttless chaps the one guy in ""The Road Warrior"" wears? Obviously, there's graphic sequences of violence and some bad language as well.

I wish there was more to report as far as special features are concerned. Audio commentary by DP David Eggby, art director Jon Dowding, special effects supervisor Chris Murray, and film historian Tim Ridge is included on the ""Mad Max"" disc. It also contains a featurette entitled ""'Mad Max:' The Film Phenomenon"" and two theatrical trailers.

""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"" features an introduction by Leonard Maltin and audio commentary with Director / Writer George Miller and Cinematographer Dean Semler. A theatrical trailer is included as well.

""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" only has a theatrical trailer. I wonder why they didn't feature the two Tina Turner videos she made for the songs featured in the movie. Both ""We Don't Need Another Hero"" and ""One of the Living"" were top 20 hits.

All three movies look and sound fabulous thanks to a great high-definition transfer. They have a clean picture while maintaining the grit and grime that made the movies so great when they first came out. Each one features a bombastic 5.1 surround sound mix that intensifies the roaring engines of the post-apocalyptic vehicles and highlights the excellent musical scores.

Whether you're watching the ""Mad Max"" movies for the first or fiftieth time, these new high-definition transfers are the way to go. They've never looked and sounded better without losing the visual intensity and edge of their original theatrical releases. These Blu-ray versions are another perfect example of films being preserved without sacrificing their cinematic character.",1371600000,4,3408,5.126126126126126
3200904,5,B000WBZZ2A,It is ok.  It was as I expected.  Those movies are classic for people like me.  Not tipical scify. Ok.,1371427200,,102,4.0
3200905,3,B000WBZZ2A,"First thing's first: this US Blu-Ray set is 100% NOT Region Free.

MAD MAX is Region A locked, so do not buy this set if you don't own a multi-region or Region A compatible Blu-Ray player. MAD MAX 2/THE ROAD WARRIOR and MAD MAX: BEYOND THUNDERDOME however, are both Region Free!

Right, onto the films and the set itself.

MAD MAX: The first movie is fantastic: a jaw-dropping action film like no other, made at a time without CGI, when stunt men and women really put their lives in danger, for our entertainment.

The disc allows viewers to watch the film in the original Australian audio-track in a newly-created DTS HD Master Audio 6.1 soundtrack or dual-mono if you prefer, or the horrifically awful US English Dub, (in dual-mono only) in which many of the characters are dubbed into American English. Not only does it sound terrible as a soundtrack, it's a pretty ropey dub. Considering all the dubbers had to do was translate Australian English into American English, it really shouldn't have been that hard. But boy, oh, boy, do the dubbers monumentally screw this up!

Stick to the original Australian, and you won't go wrong. It's a meaty, beefy, loud and monsterous sounding 6.1 track, and the throng of the car and bike engines really feel like they're being revved in your living room! (Other audio track and subtitle options are available, including English Subs for the Deaf and Hard Of Hearing.)

The picture looks very good, but I'm sure it could be improved, if someone was willing to give it the time and care it needed. I have no idea if the Blu-Ray 1080p print is taken from a 35mm Master Negative, or not, but whilst it looks clear and crisp, it probably could look even better. Still, you won't be too disappointed. The print is totally uncut, which is always a plus-point, including some of the slightly gorier moments that some countries removed or toned down. So if you've not seen it uncut, then this is a good reason to own this set.

There's a 25-minute featurette, but I've not seen that yet, plus an audio commentary. Not exactly the best set of extras, but it's something. However, definitely a case of ""must try harder""!

MAD MAX 2: Also known as THE ROAD WARRIOR, improves on the original, in so many ways. A bigger, better, more souped-up version of the first, this is a film for petrol-heads and action-fans!

Essentially, an action film, with minimal plot, but it's a stunner! Feel every single car crash, every bike smash, and every pounding thud, screech and squeal, as vehicles and people are trashed. There are too many great moments to single out, but the Gyrocopter scene is always a good one.

Again, we have another newly-created for this set, DTS HD Master Audio 6.1 soundtrack. The print is once again, uncut and uncensored, including some gory violence that was cut in some countries. The print used on the film is back to what it should be - namely MAD MAX 2, and not THE ROAD WARRIOR. Alas, the extras are the exact same ones on the old Warner's Blu-Ray release: one audio commentary, and a short intro from film critic Leonard Maltin. Fun, but not exactly great by any means. Where are the behind-the-scenes shots, or outtakes of the many incredible stunts? Disppointing, but forgiveable, purely because the film itself is so damn good. Sadly, the menu screen is cheap, and naff. A static shot, and a few icons at the bottom that let you play the film, select a chapter, play the trailer, or chose your audio and/or subtitle options.

MAD MAX: BEYOND THUNDERDOME: Definitely a disappointment after the high's of the first two films, this feels very much like a typical Hollywood ""third wheel"". It's an okay film, with an okay plot, and okay characters. It's decidedly very average. Gibson and Turner try their best, and whilst there are occasional moments of greatness, it's definitely not a winner, even if you take the film as a bog-standard action film, let alone as a MAD MAX movie.

On this disc, you get a reasonable set of soundtracks and subtitle options, but it becomes clear very quickly, that no one at Warners was that bothered with this film. There are no extras, other than a 4:3 VHS-quality trailer. The menu screen is as static as they come, though it does tie-in to MAD MAX 2/THE ROAD WARRIOR. And you're left feeling like this was very much an unnecessary add-on to both the franchise, and this Blu-Ray box set too.

Talking of which, the Steelbook case is more like a thin tin, rather than a true Steelbook Case. Essentially, a case, with a lid, printed all over, it looks nice, but it's not exactly outstanding by any means. It also feels thin, and a little on the cheap side of things. If you're ordering this, you may want to double-check your set arrives undented and unmarked.

Inside the case, is a standard-sized Blu-Ray Amaray case, with a tray that holds the first two discs, and then the third disc goes inside in the usual position. The discs are dull: plain black with just the titles on, and a few other superfluous details, and the sleeve artwork is merely acceptable, though not great. Oh, and it's one of those horrible ""recyclable"" Amaray cases, with the tri-arrow recycling logo cut out of the front and back of the case. Not only does this mean the case is physically less strong, it offers less protection to the discs themselves, and there's the added potential that you can puncture the sleeve artwork, causing a nasty, irreparable tear. It smacks of cheapness. Companies need to stop using these cases immediately! I know they may be better for the environment, but on premium products like Blu-Ray's, they really do give the customer the view that you don't care if their purchase arrives damaged!

So, overall, one great film, one truly superb film, and one distinctly underwhelming film, all wrapped-up in so-so extras, and an okay case. Most people will be buying this set for the first two films, but it really does feel like this is a lot of money, for a set that's not really worth it's weight. I'm certain that once MAD MAX: FURY ROAD is unleashed onto the  public, there may well be a Quadrilogy set released, but don't bank on it containing many more extras for the first three films.

Such a shame that Warners decided that MAD MAX fans weren't worth bothering with. Ultimately, a very disappointing set. Nice to own, but wait until the price comes down.

ADDENUDUM: There are no forms of digital copies included. UK Region B fans should take a look at the UK Release due out on 12th August 2013 as shown at Amazon UK here...  http://www.amazon.co.uk/Mad-Max-Trilogy-Ultimate-Collectors/dp/B00CP1ZRYQ/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top

Be warned, though. The UK tin set, designed to look like a petrol/jerry can, is cheap looking, and cheaply made, and to be frank, is not even as nice to look at as the US Version.

Price-wise, the US set is a 1 or two more expensive, when importing to the UK, but if I were a fan, I'd still buy the US Set! It's simply not as tacky as the UK version looks. However, if you can't play Region A Blu-Ray discs, then you have no choice, but to buy the forthcoming UK release.",1371254400,63,7101,4.678428227746592
3200906,4,B000WBZZ2A,"Real good box set.  This was the first time I saw the original Mad Max with the original voices (Everytime I've seen before it was dubbed).  Anyways, my only complaint is the lack of special features.  Mad Max had one that was cool, but The Road Warrior and Beyond the Thunderdome was bare.",1370908800,2,290,4.433962264150943
3200907,4,B000WBZZ2A,"Since ""Fury Road"" (the fourth Mad Max film) is up for release next year, this three-disc collection serves up the first ""trilogy"" of Mad Max films from 1978-1985 to attract new fans.  Two of the three movies (""Mad Max"" and ""The Road Warrior"", aka ""Mad Max 2"") have been released on Blu-ray already, and the content of those two discs remains mostly the same.  In fact, ""Mad Max"" is basically the same disc with new artwork, but ""The Road Warrior"" features slightly better video quality (due to a new encoding) and a terrific new lossless DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio track.  The bonus features on both discs are identical.

The third film, ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"", is new to Blu-ray and debuts as part of this collection.  Sadly, the only extra is the film's trailer (older releases, including the DVD, were the same way), but at least the A/V quality is quite good.  Other than that, this three-disc collection is packaged in a nice metal tin and looks cool.

If you already own the first two films on Blu-ray, this might be tough to recommended.  I didn't, so it was worth the price of admission.  All three films hold up pretty well, especially due to the great A/V presentation that a quality Blu-ray treatment can provide.",1370822400,45,1227,4.669767441860465
3200908,5,B000WBZZ2A,"It's been long overdue for this one.
Roadwarrior comes with losesless audio btw which is really great.
Beyond Thunderdome just seems like a whole new picture. Great remaster esp the video transfer.
Couldn't be anymore happier with this purchase.
I'm so thrilled. Would've been nice if there some more substantial extras.",1370649600,3,320,5.294117647058823
3200909,5,B000WBZZ2A,"Soon after George Miller's ""Mad Max"" and ""The Road Warrior"" burst onto the cinematic landscape in the early `80s, they ushered in a whole new genre of thrillers where warring gangs ruled the roads, fighting for gasoline and whatever scraps of food were left behind by scavengers. Many of those imitators have been (deservedly) forgotten as the years have passed, yet the MAD MAX TRILOGY itself remains a favorite of fans, with Miller's brilliantly edited set-pieces keeping viewers enthralled despite the familiar settings of a post-apocalyptic wasteland.

Warner Home Video's newly-released Blu-Ray box-set of the ""Mad Max Trilogy"" offers - in a single, three-disc Blu-Ray case (housed inside a slightly unattractive oversized tin) - a reprise of MGM's original ""Mad Max"" BD; a new AVC encode of ""The Road Warrior,"" premiering here with a DTS MA soundtrack; and the HD debut of the third film in the series, ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.""

The original MAD MAX finds Mel Gibson launching his career as a tough cop in a world where unhinged loonies - including Hugh Keays-Byrne as the nefarious ""Toecutter"" - attack unsuspecting motorists and innocent civilians. Max's battles with his own bosses - desperately hoping to keep ""heroes"" on the road - are contrasted with the violent attacks of the gangs, and once Max's partner is killed and his wife and child targeted by the thugs, Max turns from desperation to anger in a soon-to-be-post-apocalyptic society quickly spiraling out of control.

Though ""Mad Max""'s world is only semi-futuristic compared to the films that followed, it's still a bleak, and captivating, environment that Miller captured on-screen - particularly considering the era in which the movie was originally released. The various car chases and action sequences deliver the goods, and while the picture - penned by Miller and producer Byron Kennedy from James McCausland's original story - isn't as compelling or tightly packaged as the film's immediate sequel, the original ""Mad Max"" remains one of the most important productions to originate Down Under. The picture ignited Gibson and Miller's respective careers, single-handedly ushered in a whole genre of similarly-themed cash-ins, and along with the works of Peter Weir, announced the Aussie film industry as a major player in world cinema.

It's also a movie that's perpetually had to shake off a nagging reputation that it's inferior to its sequel - something not helped by the fact that many of us originally saw the film second, after ""The Road Warrior"" was released, and usually in lousy TV prints at that. With its widescreen Todd-AO dimensions cropped, and its original Aussie dialogue dubbed by Samuel Arkoff's American-International, it's no wonder ""Mad Max"" came off for many years as the weaker sibling compared to ""The Road Warrior."" Still, taken on its own terms as an appetizer before the main course, and with its technical trappings restored, it's an involving, memorable picture with striking directorial choices.

MGM's Blu-Ray here boasts the same exact presentation as its prior BD release. The 1080p AVC encoded transfer offers an appreciable enhancement over its decade-old Special Edition DVD, limited only by the occasional griminess of its source materials, while most of the potent extras from that release have been carried over, including a 25-minute retrospective documentary and an insightful audio commentary featuring cinematographer David Eggby, Jon Dowding, Tim Ridge and Chris Murray. These extras, along with the U.S. trailers, are on-hand, plus a remixed DTS MA soundtrack of the original Aussie dialogue and Brian May's occasionally bombastic score (the American-International U.S. dubbed track is also included in its original mono).

One of the best looking Blu-Ray catalog releases, ""Max""'s sequel, THE ROAD WARRIOR, has now been surpassed by a remastered Warner Blu-Ray that's even better than its predecessor, though more so for an augmented audio track than its slightly enhanced visuals.

Gibson returns here as a more haunted, grizzled Max, with the world now completed dominated by punks while bands of humanity attempt to survive in the wasteland. Miller, Terry Hayes and Brian Hannant's script works in elements of classic westerns like ""Shane"" as Max reluctantly bands together with the survivors - including Bruce Spence's Gyro Captain - to ward off the villains.

""The Road Warrior"" has always been one of my favorite films of the early `80s - an improvement on the original ""Mad Max"" in every way (from Miller's direction to Gibson's performance and Brian May's more sophisticated, richer score) and a driving, thrilling piece of sci-fi action that's never been duplicated in its genre. Its straightforward story, lack of extraneous dialogue and subplots, emphasis on the pursuit and energy of its chase sequences, and the brilliant editing and choreography of those set-pieces makes it an all-time classic - a movie that stands alone from its bookending pictures as a spectacular piece of filmmaking.

Working from the original negative, ""The Road Warrior"" looked great on the prior Blu-Ray and has been improved by superior AVC encoding here, though in general, the two transfers look roughly the same. As with before, Dean Semler's rugged, atmospheric cinematography is enhanced by high-def, with eye-popping colors and detailed textures on-hand at every turn; it's a dazzling transfer of a film that demands to be seen this way, or not at all. The audio here also receives an upgrade with a lossless DTS MA mix (the prior Blu-Ray's audio was rendered as a basic 5.1 Dolby Digital track) that rumbles with bass and a superb soundstage for May's musical output.

The disc otherwise is identical to the original Blu-Ray, with a pair of exclusive-to-HD extras included: a commentary track with George Miller and Dean Semler, along with a brief introduction from Leonard Maltin that puts the movie into the context of its other series films, plus the original trailer.

The worldwide success of ""The Road Warrior"" - and in particular its breakthrough performance at the U.S. box-office in 1982 - lead to another sequel, this time augmented by a larger budget afforded by its predecessor's commercial success.

Deciding to go in something of a different direction, George Miller opted to turn MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME into something of a more ""emotional"" piece less driven by violence and high-octane set-pieces. Miller and writer Terry Hayes took a cue from Max's arc in ""The Road Warrior"" and turned him into a slightly more charismatic, ""Man With No Name"" sort here, with Max stumbling into a post-apocalyptic village named ""Bartertown."" There, a political struggle ensues between leader Aunty Entity (Tina Turner) and the diminutive ""Master"" (Angelo Rossitto), who's the only one (apparently) who understands how to produce methane to power the town. Aunty strikes a deal with Max to knock off Master's physical bodyguard ""Blaster,"" but circumstances eventually send Max off into the wasteland again, where he finds a ""Lord of the Flies"" type community of youngsters waiting for the messianic ""Captain Walker"" to return.

Miller co-directed ""Thunderdome"" with associate George Ogilvie, something that might explain the uneven pacing of this more ambitious, though decidedly least successful, of the ""Mad Max"" series. There are a pair of dynamite set-pieces on-hand when Max takes to the Thunderdome to battle the hulking Blaster, and Miller caps the film with one last, stirring chase with Max and the young refugees trying to escape from Aunty's gang on a train. As potent as these moments are, however, they're surrounded by a meandering mid-section where Max finds the castoff children, who look as if they've come out of the William Golding novel by way of the Ewoks in ""Return of the Jedi."" Their society isn't nearly as developed as it should've been, and for a group of naive youngsters who presumably haven't encountered anything of the punk-driven outside world, why one of them actually drops an f-bomb when they re-enter Bartertown is patently nonsensical.

There's also an obvious lack of energy in ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" at times. The thrilling, fast-paced intensity of the earlier films is replaced here with a more deliberately paced fantasy approach, and for fans of ""The Road Warrior,"" this PG-13 rated, decidedly less violent picture can be (and has often been written off as) a shock to the system. Even the production design of Bartertown seems uninspired, employing a ""Temple of Doom""-like aesthetic that makes you think Mola Ram is going to pop out at any second.

Still, there are assorted pleasures to be found: Gibson exudes more of his natural charisma here, and this decidedly ""looser"" Max feels like a natural progression of the hardened warrior who rediscovered his humanity at the end of ""The Road Warrior."" Dean Semler's wide scope cinematography is once again stylish, and Turner brings sufficient life to her scenes as a scavenger who's recreated herself as the leader of Bartertown (""he's just a raggedy man!""). What's more, Maurice Jarre's glorious orchestral score helps to smooth over some of the picture's rough passages - with its sweeping scale and melodic interludes, ""Thunderdome"" is one of Jarre's strongest efforts from one of his most prolific periods (his marvelous ""Enemy Mine"" score would follow just a few months later). In fact, the climactic, 12-minute chase cue has to rank as one of Jarre's greatest in his esteemed career.

Although it's a definite comedown from ""The Road Warrior,"" ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" is an admirable attempt at tweaking the formula established by its predecessors. Miller even manages to craft a surprisingly moving epilogue for the film as well, paying tribute to his late associate - producer Byron Kennedy - as the movie fades out and brings the original ""Mad Max"" trilogy to an emotionally satisfying close.

With only the theatrical trailer as an extra, ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome""'s Blu-Ray debut comes in the form of a highly detailed 1080p AVC encoded transfer. The DTS MA soundtrack packs an impressive punch when Jarre's score takes center stage, though it's unfortunate his final cue was dialed in so low in the original mix.

With Miller having completed filming on ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" (apparently due for release sometime in 2014), it'll be interesting to see how the eclectic filmmaker - who hasn't directed a live-action film not aimed at children in 20 years - returns to the film series he's most remembered for.",1370476800,117,10552,5.204358068315665
3200910,3,B000WBZZ2A,"So, the Mad Max Trilogy, are easily some of the my favorite movies ever!

This boxset is unfortunately quite lackluster.  The Road Warrior has already been released, back in 2007 and is basically identical to the new release, with the only difference, being a slight minimal increase in bitrate.  in Mad Max is basically a reissue of the blue ray release from a few months ago, with new packaging.  It is nice to finally have Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome on Blu Ray, but it has zero special features. A making of movie, or at least some production/press photos included would have been nice.  Nothing.....  If you don't already own the movies on blu ray then yes, pick this collection up.  If you do already have the first two movies, save yourself 20 dollars and just buy Thunderdome by itself for 13 dollars to complete your collection.  You would think Warner would have stepped up, and release a collection, that reflects the legendary vision of George Miller.
