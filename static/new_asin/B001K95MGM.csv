8314521,5,B001K95MGM,"Aki Kaurismaki made a superb version framed by a minimalist vision of the classic portrait from Dostoievski. Finland is the stage. And Raihkaien is the modern Raskolnikov.

What it really captured me is the existential despair of raskolnikov, Kaurismaki makes us see is around the city. The silence, the loneliness and despair of all the society. The witness, the police force, the female neighbor seem to be exhausted, tired of living, like frozen in time.

And the use of Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony underlies still more this crude situation.

This underrated film from 1983 made me aware about the undeniable talent of this young filmmaker - by then -.

Absolutely recommended. Don't miss it!!!",1374278400,,699,5.15929203539823
