3078619,4,B00127RAJ4,"Another year and another set of DVDs from the Afterdark Horrorfest. Last years crop had two or three films I was interested in and the films this year didn't seem to be my thing, until I had heard of Borderland and the true story behind the movie. If you look up the story on the internet you can find a fascinating story of a cult of drug peddlers that killed over sixty-three men in voodoo ritual that involved sodomy, torture and dismemberment. Mixing with the criminal nature of the cult and to me its fascinating. And Zev Berman the filmmaker behind Borderland was just as fascinated with the story integrating it into his own Hostel storyline. On the DVD He states how he became involved with the story after he and some friends were pulled over trying to enter Mexico with some voodoo paraphenalia decorating their bus.
The story as it goes is basic horror film fare, very much in the vein of Hostel in a way. Three friends bound for college go on a road trip for the vices that they can find on the border between Mexico and America. On friend Ed hooks up with a bartender Valeria and the group goes off to eat Mushrooms and party at a carnival. Therein a member decides to split after the trip starts going bad and on the way back to the hotel He gets kidnapped by the cultists who are looking for an American to use in their ritual. When the remaining friends awake the next day they go in search of their missing friend and instead find a town where the cops don't much care when people go missing (after a policeman was dismembered alive in the opening) and cult members wanting them to disappear.
Like I said the film is very reminiscent of other horror films plotlines. The three friends themselves follow very generic and cliched stereotypes with the badboy hardcase, the sensitive hero, and the goofy young religious type who enters the picture with a target on his chest. The acting is servicable at best meeting the demands of the movie and my only other complaint is against the director using an overcranked camera to film most of it. But still the cult itself was a fasciinating thing that added depth to the movie. These weren't the business men of Hostel or the cannibal rednecks of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre but a real group of disturbed people that followed a charasmatic leader in doing the most horrible things possible believing that they were invincible to the world. This part of the movie worked for the better of the movie.
As for the DVD itself its put together well with the commentary and a twenty minute making of feature. The best feature of the disc was featurette with the lead detective who investigated the initial disappearnce of the American college student that lead to investigation of the cult. They intersperse his commentary with video shot of the actual cult members being interogated while they lead police around the ranch where the murders took place and dig up bodies. One strange thing, they change the name of the victim while you can easily find the mans name on the internet. Still check out the movie. Its easily one of the better offerings from the second Afterdark series this year.",1206316800,7,3144,4.606060606060606
3078620,4,B00127RAJ4,"I've seen those based on true events movies such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Wolf Creek.  Upon actually researching these ""true events"",through this wonderful thing we call the internet, I was quite relieved to find that although these events were real, they are ""Hollywood-ized"" for entertainment purposes.  As much as I would like to say the same about Borderland, this is not the case.  It was real, very real, so real that I found it difficult to sit through this movie.  I remember these events all too well.  I was just 14 years old when I heard about this poor kid coming up missing while partying in the bordertown of Matamoros.  It hit very close to home, as Brownsville, Texas (the city right across the border from Matamoros)is a major part of my life.  I spent many childhood years there, both living and visiting family.  As familiar locals, we all knew back then that this story was not going to end well.  However, we could have never imagined the horrible reality. We were in a state of shock as disturbing details came to light. These were details that no half-way decent human being could possibly fathom.  As someone who knows this true story all too well, I must say that this filmaker did his homework. So much, that I almost turned the movie off (something this hard-core horror fan has never done) once Rider Strong was captured.  If you've seen this movie as loosely based on actual events or even fictitious, then it's just another horror flick.  Try watching it now and actually thinking of these characters (especially Rider Strong's) as real people that had a life and still have loved ones and it's more horrible than anything that you could imagine.",1206230400,38,1686,4.716723549488054
3078621,4,B00127RAJ4,"After last years horror fest I was disappointed so I really didn't know what to expect with some of this years. After watching Borderland I can say I enjoyed more than any of last years horror fest.
  The beginning of the movie shows two detectives in a house in Mexico City and once they enter they discover a slow of weird things like bloody animal meat and some strange signs drawn all over. The detectives soon become hostages to some weird cult. They force the one detective to watch as they torture his partner. One part is especially gruesome and involves the detectives eyes. They let the one detective go so he can let the police know not to mess with this cult group.

  It then flashes a year forward where 3 friends, Phil(Rider Strong from Cabin Fever)Ed and Henry. Before they go off to college I guess they want to have one last final fun time together. So off they go to Mexico. After meeting a bartender who ed becomes friends with and a prostitute bad things begin to happen. First Phil is kidnapped and soon after a green van keeps watching Ed,Henry and Valeria. It passes by and Henry sees a stuffed animal Phil had in the backseat. They go to the police but as usual the police aren't very helpful and finally upon seeing the green van again Henry runs up to it looking for a fight. The one cult member gets out and shoots Henry point blank in the neck. Just as this is happening a cop passes by and looks the other way. I guess to show that even the cops are afraid of this cult. Henry somehow survives and they then meet Ulises(the detective who was forced to watch his partner killed a year earlier).

  Meanwhile Phil is tied up in some old barn. He meets Randall(an against type Sean Astin,who did a nice job imo)an odd character who offers him chocolate and a chance to watch tv. Soon Phil finds out he is chosen for something important. As this is happening Ed decides to drop Valeria back off at her place while Henry is at the motel so she doesn't get hurt only for her to find out her sister was killed by the cult in a grisly manner. They go back to the motel only to find that the cult had gotten to Henry.

  Without giving the ending away we do find out that this cult is all about human sacrifice to please some ancient god and blood must also be shed for this to work I guess. He is tortured and soon Ed,Valeria and Ulises arrive there to save their friend. Are they too late and what happens?",1205971200,7,2429,4.293216630196937
3078622,4,B00127RAJ4,"Horrorfest 2007 did not make it to the Zenith City, so I had to wait for last year's offerings to come out on DVD to be able to check them out, going the one a night route this time around.  One of the interesting things about going to see the original 8 films 2 die 4 in the theater was the order in which I saw the films, since that colors the veiwer's perceptions of each film.  The fact that the first one I saw last year, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reincarnation/dp/B000MEYKCI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reincarnation</a>,"" was the best of the bunch certainly affected what I thought of Horrorfest 2006 overall (It was not until I watched the schlock horror films that Lionsgate released direct to DVD during the past couple of years that I had to admit Horrorfest really does represent the cream of the crop, albeit during a period of extended drought).  Anyhow, to figure out the order of these films I went to the official Horrorfest website and arranged these eight films in the order they appeared there.  That means ""Borderland"" takes the lead off position, and history might repeat itself because it was the film I heard mentioned most often as being the best of the second round of offerings.

""Borderland"" begins with a group of Mexican drug runners going to town on a pair of Mexican police officers, one of who survives the ordeal.  This is a prologue to the main part of the film, where three Texas University students travel to a Mexican border town as a last fling before graudation.  Henry (Jake Muxworthy), Phil (Rider Strong), and Ed (Brian Presley) have a series of misadventures south of the border that end up crossing the paths of both the lovely Valeria (Martha Higareda) and the drug cult.  So it takes a while to get back to the blood, gore, and dismemberment that makes up most of the final act. Clearly there are torture porn elements to this 2007 film, and parts are reminiscent of the original ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hostel/dp/B000EHRVP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hostel</a>,"" most specifically in the fact that the victims are males rather than females (although the same rules apply for figuring out which of the trio will be last one standing).  But director Zem Berman provides a mixed bag of horror genres in his film.  The back of the DVD proclaims this film ""blends the raw fear of '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Texas-Chainsaw-Massacre-with-the-stark-reality-of-ASIN-B0000AN4JE-In-Cold-Blood/dp/B000FS9FE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre}]' with the stark reality of '[[ASIN:B0000AN4JE In Cold Blood</a>.'  I can see the former as a point of reference, but not the latter, mainly because Ulises (Damian Alcazar), the cop who survives the opening scene, is around but not part of a concerted effort to track down the bad guys.

The most memorable part of this film is cleary the performance by Sean Astin, who shows up as one of the bad guys.  Having played ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rudy/dp/B00004W221/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rudy</a>"" and Samwise Gamgee in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings/dp/B000654ZK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings</a>,"" there is a tendency to think of Astin as being a kind soul and a little fellow.  Well, forget that after watching him in this film.  If you were wondering why somebody like Astin would show up for a supporting role in a film like this one, the obvious answer is the opportunity to play against type, which he does quite well.  I found it interesting that Berman was more willing to show bad things happening to the good guys than when bad things happen to the villains, although I am not sure what such a distinction signifies.  My biggest complaint here is the overuse of hand held cameras, because I am getting really tired of the shots constantly bouncing around in films these days (especially since more and more often I am convinced the rationale for the use of hand held cameras is not aesthetic, but economics: it is way cheaper to shoot a movie that way).  However, whatever they did to the film stock for  ""Borderland "" gives the movie an effective look for the south of the border setting.  Too bad the soundtrack is little more than constant ominous ambience, because halfway through it becomes rather annoying.

Unlike most movies that throw out the label ""Inspired by a True Story,"" Berman makes sure with the limited DVD Bonus Features that he proves his point.  In ""Inside Zev's Head: A Filmmaker's Diary,"" Berman tells about his own personal connections to the case of Adolfo de Jess Constanzo, the serial killer and cult leader in Mexico known as ""The Godfather of Matamoros,"" when he and some college buddies headed from New Orleans to Mexico with a bunch of voodoo stuff in their van.  The specific point of inspiration is the disappearance of Mark Kilory, a college student, during Spring Break in 1989.  It turned out that Constanzo, in addition to running drugs, engaged in occult rituals and human sacrifice as followers of Santeria, a religious hybrid of Catholicism and African religions.  The details of the investigation are covered in ""Rituales de Sangre: The True Story Behind the Cult Murder Investigation,"" where one of the Texas law officers intimately involved in the case tells the story.  As far as telling the true story behind the movie, this is one of the better documentaries I have seen.  It was almost enough to get me to round up on this particular DVD, but I really am getting sick of the over-use of handheld cameras in movies these days.  Next up: ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unearthed/dp/B00127RAIK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unearthed</a>.""",1205884800,15,5900,5.39760348583878
3078623,5,B00127RAJ4,"Borderland was a great movie. One of the better of horrorfest '07. Great cast and presents a few surprises, even for the jaded horror movie buff. Overall, definitely worth checking out.",1199232000,12,185,5.0
3078624,3,B00127RAJ4,"There's a moment in ""Borderland"" when a Mexican cop points a shotgun at the leader of a cult. I don't remember what the cop said, but I do remember that it reminded me of Mandy Patinkin in ""The Princess Bride"": ""Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."" No, this is not the desired effect of ""Borderland,"" and that only makes me question my feelings for it. Here's a film that gets more and more ugly with every passing scene; what starts out as an interesting story ends up as a violent blood fest, with virtually every character dependent on machetes and guns to get a point across. The film opens with a disclaimer saying it's inspired by true events, and it ends with facts for the audience to read. I guess that means we're supposed to believe it, much like when we believed the ""true"" stories of ""The Amityville Horror"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.""

But for all its glaring flaws, there's still something appealing about ""Borderland,"" if only just. The opening scene shows two Mexican cops raiding a house in Mexico City; upon entering, they discover an assortment of bizarre things, such as strange signs drawn on the floor, various pieces of bloody animal meat, and a human jawbone. They're then attacked by a group of insane cult members, who seem to take great pleasure in chopping off various body parts. This is exactly what happens to one of the cops while the other--Ulises (Damin Alczar)--is forced to watch. He was allowed to live so that he could spread word about the cult leader, referred to as Papa. I have no idea what this would accomplish, but I suppose it doesn't really matter.

The story then flashes forward one year, and that's when we're introduced to three graduating friends from Texas: the hotheaded non-conformist Henry (Jake Muxworthy); the desperate virgin Phil (Rider Strong); and Ed (Brian Presley), the main character. Before entering college and going their separate ways, they drive into Mexico looking for drugs, alcohol, and sex. Initially, they don't find much of anything--Phil takes pity on a young prostitute with an infant child, Ed befriends an English-speaking bartender named Valeria (Martha Higareda), and Henry is just being Henry. But after a short while, the three young men are thrust into a nightmare, one that will only get bleaker as the film progresses. One should expect nothing less from a film like this, especially since these characters are broadly drawn and never developed.

It all begins when Phil is kidnapped, and we quickly realize that his captors are the same cult members from the film's opening. They take him to an isolated barn, and after having his wrists tied above his head, he meets an American named Randall--a character that would fit right in with the clan from ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" were it not for his soft, clean-cut voice. I say this because the role of Randall was given to Sean Astin, an actor I neither expected nor wanted in this kind of film; the man who brought Samwise Gamgee to life so wonderfully is too good for a low budget shocker. Truth be told, I'm not entirely sure why his character was included in the first place.

And here's where the film loses some steam. In their search for Phil, Ed and Henry meet with Ulises, who has spent much of the past year gathering evidence against the evil cult. From him, we learn that this cult practices human sacrifice in the belief that it will appease an ancient god. In stories like this, it's all about ancient gods that demand a blood sacrifice every so often; in this case, the victim needed to be a white American because, according to the leader--Santillian (Beto Cuevas)--Mexican victims are no longer effective. Phil has been made the key to bringing this god forth, and this is obviously a bad thing, especially since it involves numerous scenes of his physical and psychological torture. It's actually a pathetic sight--a bleeding, sobbing, half-naked young man with a crudely shaved head. I felt sorry for him.

And that's how I was supposed to feel, I guess. But how far is our sympathy supposed to go? How long are we supposed to invest in these characters? By the time we reach the incredibly violent last third of the film--in which Ed, Valeria, and Ulises search through the cult's compound--I began to wonder if we were, in fact, watching a character driven film; at a certain point, it seemed more like a film that was made gory just for the sake of being gory. Some films can pull that off, specifically those made to be campy. But ""Borderland"" is not campy in the least, even when the occasional joke is told. It's intense and dramatic, about as serious as the amputation of an arm (yes, that does happen to someone, and no, I won't say who that someone is).

But something is preventing me from dismissing this film entirely. The dynamic between Presley, Muxworthy, and Strong is interesting, if a little shallow, and I got a kick out of Muxworthy's performance. Some of the camerawork is creative, such as in a scene where the characters are high on mushrooms; their movements were choppy, much like an Internet video playing on a computer with a slow modem. There are also a fair number of scenes shot with an unsteady camera, and I still can't decide if this is effective or just visually aggravating. The same can be said for ""Borderland"" as a whole, a film that doesn't quite work simply because it doesn't know what it wants to be. Maybe a human sacrifice will put things into perspective.",1194652800,14,5502,4.732012513034411
3078693,5,B00127RAJ4,"honestly one of the best ""based on a true story"" movies I have ever seen.

3078976,4,B00127RAJ4,"Three high school buddies, now graduated,  journey across the border into Mexico. There they seek the indulgence of wanton desires and end up losing more than what each expected. On the surface, that sums up the plot.

On the whole, this movie is not that badly written, acted, produced, and directed. For most, a story ""based on actual events"" makes it authentically real. Apparently, this story fictionally reports events of actual occurrence in our shared world of physical reality. If so, there are events in this physical reality occurring horrifyingly. Their depicting such inhuman events are neither understated nor overstated by the filmmakers in Borderland. Lethal events are portrayed with enough visual detail allowing the viewer to see the action without fighting the reflexive urge to look away. A combination of script writing, directing and editing accomplishes the task at keeping tension in the storyline. A sense of foreboding kept this viewer's attention riveted to the unfolding of dark, murderous events.

This film may find broad appeal with horror-film lovers, for an aspect of the dark-side of the spirit world is fictionally conveyed realistically -- hence, believably. Anyone interested in the cinematic arts might appreciate the demonstration of solid film production Borderland represents. Someone unfamiliar with demon worship would be advised to watch this low-budget, neo-journalistic (yet fictional) artful rendering of common practices of those who do worship demons.

Remember when viewing this film is that an important aspect of the craft of filmmaking aspires toward the fulfillment of a viewer's sense of entertainment. Does this cinematic story meet that requirement? Judge for yourself.",1455840000,,1726,5.526515151515151

3079159,4,B00127RAJ4,"Loosely based on a couple dozen human sacrifice killings in a Mexico border town in the late 1980s, ""Bordertown"" is an American cheapie with rich Mexican content dealing with the cult that did the killing, an episode they had with a couple Mexican cops, and a later episode with three Texas college-bound kids. The latter is what will interest anyone that is a fan of murder, mayhem, torture, revenge, ultraviolence and lots and lots of movie blood because that's what goes on in this flick.

The plot revolves around the two killing episodes by cultists, the first where they incoherently leave a living witness, the second that ends in a bloodbath of revenge and mayhem unlike much you've seen in other movies lately. I doubt the real cult ended this way; in fact, onscreen text at the end of the film suggests it did not.

However, that's nothing to worry about. ""Borderland"" provides a couple hours of escapist fun that won't totally gross out any experienced film watcher since nothing really bad is ever shown. The kicker is this is real world-based, not made up Hollywood, and it's full of sympathetic characters and those you will revile the first time you see them. And the ending is very satisfying for most fan of this genre, so don't hesitate if this kind of movie suits your taste.",1445904000,,1294,4.721238938053097

3079211,5,B00127RAJ4,"Borderland opens in Mexico City with two police officers investigating a rundown and abandoned house. Officer Ulises and his partner enter the house and during investigation, find gruesome remains of humans and animals that look to be from sacrifices. The two are attacked by occupants of the house and Ulises is forced to watch as the two men torture his partner to death before beheading him.

One year later, University of Texas graduates Ed, Henry, and Phil decide to head down to Mexico City for the week and hit up all the local bars and strip clubs as one last hoorah before they go their separate ways. When they arrive things start out perfectly. That night, Ed falls in love with a bartender, Valeria, after defending her from an abusive customer. Meanwhile, Henry sets Phil up with a prostitute who's barely 17 and has a kid. The next night the group have some fun at a local carnival with their dates where Phil leaves early to go back and give his prostitute girlfriend a teddy bear he won for her.

While walking alone on a deserted neighborhood street, Phil reluctantly takes a car ride from a group of strange men who proceed to abduct him in the process. The next morning when Ed and Henry realize that Phil did not come back, they begin to investigate and team with Valeria as well as Officer Ulises to get answers and find Phil. Because Mexican authorities are too scared of the power of the cult, they can only rely on themselves. After further investigation, Henry and Ed discover that Phil was kidnapped by a notorious and brutal Satanic cult in the area that sacrifices humans for his Nganga to communicate and receive supernatural power from a spirit named Chango. In the process of searching for Phil; Ed, Valeria, Henry, and Ulises enter a dark, dangerous, and ritualistic world with insurmountable odds that may be too much even for them to overcome all for the price of one

Overall: It needs to be said that Borderland is probably the greatest movie ever released by After Dark Horrorfest. Based on a true story, the film loosely recalls the real life murder of a Texas University student who was killed at the hands of a religious cult in Mexico while on spring break in 1989. In addition to solid performances, Borderland capitalizes on the graphic nature of the film. While it's certainly not as gory as everyone makes it out to be, the few violent scenes that do take place are graphic in and of itself. The storytelling is also really captivating. Once it pulls you in, it keeps you until the closing credits. All of the elements featured in this film, make it spectacular and not only my favorite movie from Horrorfest but perhaps their best one yet",1436140800,3,2684,4.658227848101266

Although the famed El Padrino was not Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, it was obviously him that they were  chronicling. Yes, this film is more of a thriller, but there is more than a little horror mixed in, in fact, this film is spooky! What enhances this spooky quality is the way the film is shot, in a dark, almost grainy way, that makes you think you are watching a bad dream play out.

I actually prefer this movie even though it was probably produced on a fraction of the budget ""Serpent and Rainbow"" had to work with and the absence of big name actors.

This seems much more realistic and doesn't rely on the corny supernatural special effects that permeates ""Serpent and Rainbow"".
I enjoyed ""Serpent and Rainbow"" but it's too formulae, obvious and predictable.

I don't know for a fact that Santeria is employed by Mexican drug lords for the same purpose but I wouldn't doubt it for a second.
In fact, I simply assume it is so.

This is a really excellent movie. The characters are completely realistic and the plot is masterfully navigated.

3079418,4,B00127RAJ4,Highly disturbing.  Loosely based on an event I remember in 1989 when a U of Texas student was kidnapped in Matamoros while on Spring break to So Padre Island.  It was big news here in Austin and the concept that he was randomly selected to be a human sacrifice in black ritual to aid drug smugglers to elude capture was unbelievably horrifying for those of us making routine trips to the border.,1408060800,,396,4.486111111111111
3079419,4,B00127RAJ4,"Spoilers follow.

I read the blurb for this movie and I thought, oh boy, an evil death cult movie! There aren't enough evil death cult movies! Seriously, I feel it's an underused horror sub-genre...the Sacrament recently made great use of the theme, but there's still room to explore, and I'm glad these guys did.

This starts out as a Mexican cop drama with two detectives storming an apartment, discovering the remains of a human sacrifice ritual, and then one of them getting brutally killed by cultists before the other one's eyes.
Then we shift to a band of American tourists who've just come across the border to have some fun, meet some girls, take some shrooms, go to a fair. It's a year later and the cop who survived the raid is now a whiskery, beaten down looking wretch who keeps pestering the local police about the death cult, and the local police are totally cowed by the death cultists and, I think, unaware of their true nature.
When the tourists, joined by a beautiful local bartender one has seduced, go in search of their friend who went missing after the fair, they begin discovering scary things. It's when they join forces with the detective that the movie really starts to cook.
So it's both a cop movie and a tourists getting trapped and killed movie. It's also a movie about a strong woman in love and a real treasure trove of grindhouse violence. You get the feeling that the people behind this movie have really spent a lot of time just across the border.",1403827200,,1483,4.592452830188679

Forgettable thriller/torture-porn piece about a trio of clueless college students who head for Mexico to pursue extracurricular activities and end up running afoul of a gang of supernatural drug dealers. (No, really.) There were a few interesting set-pieces, and adding a supernatural element made some of the torture-porn elements of the script feel amusing rather than tiresome and overdone, but the simple fact is that a few days after I watched it, I had two or three images left in my head and had to go read a couple of synopses of the movie to remember anything about it.

I know nothing about the true events but just by seeing the sum total of this movie, if I were to bet everything I own that that most of what is portrayed in this film is a bunch of BS Im sure Id be just fine and have nothing to worry about. Its not that I don't believe the events in this film couldn't happen, its just too much of a formula driven story that is all too familiar for anyone to actually swallow it. Also I am not sure why people are praising Sean Astins performance either. Its pretty much a standard undemanding role. And his work on 24 a few years back is far more impressive. That being said this movie is not terribley any means, its simply pretty standard and run of the mill. But its clearly mostly fiction, claiming its based on a true story, then expecting people to believe the entire thing happend as they depict it in the film. Reminds me of the alien abduction movie Fire in the Sky. While the story there as a whole may have been true, even the main subject never accounted an abduction senario anywhere near what the film shows. Obviously its the same thing here.

3079460,4,B00127RAJ4,"Often the tagline ""inspired by a true story"" or some such similar description, raises expectations that are never met, but that is not the case with Borderland (2007), a dark and brutally violent tale, not for the faint of heart, set somewhere in Mexico.  Director and co-writer Zev Berman's film is based on his experiences at the Mexican border in 1989, when US law enforcement was searching for a missing American student, who was later found dead as one of many victims of a Mexican drug manufacturing ring that believed in the occult, and practiced human sacrifice.

Borderland is a gripping and shockingly gory film that is all the more terrifying, because of its inherent realism.  Henry (Jake Muxworthy), Ed (Brian Presley), and Phil (Rider Strong), three college students from Texas, cross the border into Mexico looking for a good time.  Ed and Henry hook up with some local Mexican girls, but Phil is not so lucky.  Looking for a white man to be used as a sacrifice, the drug gang abducts Phil, and imprisons him on a farm, under the watch of Randall (Sean Austin) a fellow American.

Ed and Henry file a police report, and with the help of their new friends Valeria (Martha Higareda) and her cousin Lupe (Francesca Guillen), begin to check around.  Eventually they cross paths with the gang, and violence erupts when Henry tries to challenge them.  While at the hospital, they meet a former cop named Ulises (Damian Elcazar) who tells them that he knows where Phil is being held prisoner, and that he will sacrificed that night because there will be a full moon.

Santillan (Beto Cuevas) the priest/leader of the drug dealing cult, arrives at the farm to conduct the ritualistic ceremony.  Meanwhile, his bloodthirsty crew is on a mission to kill those searching for them, leaving behind a trail of broken bodies.  Ulises, Ed, and Valeria, infiltrate the farm to try and rescue Phil, setting the stage for a brutal, bloody, and bone chilling final act, that plays out with terrifying realism.

Opening with a grisly gross out torture scene, and featuring people hacked to pieces with machetes, Borderland is not for the squeamish.  The film is extremely effective at convincing you that the nightmare you are seeing could actually happen, should you have the supreme misfortune to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  It may be hard to believe that there are those who still practice human sacrifice, but that is what a drug dealing cult actually did back in 1989.  When the group abducted an American student, it intensifies interest in their activities, and eventually leads to the discovery of a mass grave containing dozens of victims.

The bonus feature ""Inside Zev's Head"" is a conversation with Zev Berman, a thoughtful and articulate guy who speaks about what his inspirations, motivations, and goals for the film were.  Berman clearly succeeded in telling a dramatic and horrifying story that captures the realism of the actual events.  In another bonus feature, a police detective who worked on the actual case, reveals shocking details, many of which are incorporated by Berman into the film.

Some horrific things happen in Borderland, but it's really more of a crime thriller with ties to the occult, than a pure horror film.  Although the violence is extreme, even chaotic, there is little that seems contrived or completely phony.  Things often do not go the way you might expect, and the ending is very dark and disturbing.  The cast comes across as very authentic, the dialog is very natural, and the acting performances are powerful and moving.  Despite a tense showdown around a bathtub, the finale plays a little too smoothly, until Ed and Valeria are forced to battle for their lives.  When Ed loses control and starts swinging a machete, it brings Berman's bloody nightmarish Mexican adventure to a dramatic close.",1319500800,2,3853,4.901386748844376

It's an interesting action packed ride complete with heart pounding suspense.
I loved Sean Astin as a red neck who guards the human sacrifice,he plays the dumb hillbilly to perfection. Again it is one of my favorite Horrorfest films and I watch it quite often,it has great multiple watch appeal.

Now, one could argue that a successful film shouldn't need this to complete the viewing experience, but, I was so impressed with the director's viewpoint, approach and what he DIDN'T do in this film. (I jumped up and cheered when he expressed his thoughts on cgi blood effects) This isn't thrill-violence. This, as he points out, isn't a splatter movie. It's truly tragic. It dances around genre conventions without being self-aware and hipster about it. And in many ways the characters make believable choices and take believable chances. WARNING- this is real cojones-to-the-wall stuff. Like, say, THE DEVIL'S REJECTS with victims you care about and NO JOKES. This isn't a scary-movie-as-amusement-park-thrill-ride thing. Extremely well-photographed without being showcase-y about it. VERY impressive practical effects. No scenery-chewing over-acting. and, hooray, characters pushed to their limits without being transformed into stupid butch wisecracking super-buff revenge killers. You just FEEL how damaged any survivor(s) are in the end. My only real complaints are (1) I wasn't sold on these three guys being close buddies all through college, and 2) I really don't get what all the praise is for Sean Astin's against-type performance.

3079465,5,B00127RAJ4,"I'm a true crime aficionado, especially when it comes to sick cults.  Since I am very spiritual, I think it's just probably  natural for me to be drawn to this type of madness, and seething with anger and fascination at the same time.  I have heard about the true story of Adolfo Costanzo and his blood-thirsty followers many, many times.  This case fascinates me just as much as Charles Manson's case, ""Helter Skelter""--if not MORE. The movie is obviously not a documentary of what truly went down in Brownsville/Matamoros, but I am very happy I found this movie anyway, since I'm also a horror movie junkie anyway, LOL.

The acting is really, really good.  The blood-curdling screams coming from the victims really tugged at me.  Also, living in Texas, and having visited a bordertown myself, I know how it feels to be totally out of your element.  I was with my parents at the time, and by God, Mexico is a 'banned' country in my book.  And yes, I was almost killed there.  Not dissected like these poor souls were, but almost ran over by a speeding car.  I was young then, but I still had a feeling of being a target.  The car just sped on and on, and didn't even slow down as it came close to me.  They just don't giva rat's ass down there.

These three amigos individual personalities is what really makes this movie, One naive and clueless, one cocky and arrogant, the other (the lead character) selfless and moral. Expose these personalities to brutal carnage and sit back and watch what they transform into.

I must warn you though, this movie can be brutal at times, but for the Slasher fan a Sunday afternoon appetizer. I gave Borderland Four stars for it's shock value, realism, originality and the acting was excellent for a B movie.

The bad guys look really bad. Good acting there, realistic depiction of some towns and cities in the Third World where the bad guys run the show. 2 of the 3 friends end up getting killed in a horrific manner, and the remaining 1 gets a little justice of his own when he manages to fend off the last pursuing attacks from cult members.

3079503,3,B00127RAJ4,"To start off, like most of the reviewers here the Horror Fest movies leave a lot to be desired in most cases.  I have all of them so far and plan on picking up the new batch March 31st of this year when they are released. Overall they aren't really all that great but you can find a few gems every once in a while, this one wasn't one of them.

I wish Lions Gate would spend as much time taking the time to make the movies as much as they promote them with their slick ad campaigns.  The best thing about some of these flicks are the trailers for the Horror Fest each year.

On to this movie, it is really more of an adventure/action picture more than a horror film.  There is some voodoo involved but generally that's just a background to have an action picture dressed as a horror flick.

The story revolves around some friends going down to Mexico to have some sex and some fun but they stumble upon a really nasty drug gang.  This is partly based on a true story and it's believable with what is presented.  The characters are built very well and there is some intrigue going on here but ""Where's the horror?""

There are some torture scenes early on and towards the end but generally the movie revolves around the friends trying to find their friend and the mystery and intrigue involved with that.  There is some very brief nudity but generally this movie easily could have been a PG-13, but the F-bomb was muttered more than 5 times so that made it an R.  There were some bloody scenes but again they only occur at the beginning and the end.  I found myself dozing off towards the middle when there was a lot of talk and very little action.

I didn't hate this movie and there was a really good scene when the ""kids"" and I use that term loosely, were taking shrooms and smoking pot.  During that segment the camera took on the ""vision"" of our protagonists and the effect was very well done.

I don't hate this movie but I don't love it either, it's worth a rent but don't expect a horror film it's more of a mystery or action movie.  I thought initially it might be more of a Serpent and the Rainbow type of film and that was truly horror but there were just not that many horror elements thrown in.  It's worth a watch but don't go out of your way.",1231891200,2,2255,4.231308411214953
3079504,5,B00127RAJ4,"The After Dark flicks I've seen in the past were all dissapointing and flat and very boringly put together. Imagine my surprise that when I watched this movie on the Sci-Fi Channel this morning--while eating breakfast--and then discovered it was among the After Dark entries.

This movie grabs you in the first frame and doesn't let go until the final scene. It's all supposedly based on real facts, in which some bone-headed Mexicans truly believe in this bizarre religion where human sacrifice is warranted to appease their god of darkness.

The movie is wonderfully acted, directed and photographed and there's not one cardboard cutout stereotype among the cast.  These villians look so real you wonder if they the director scrounged them up off the sidestreets.

The only two minor complaints I have is that (1) the female character never did anything but cry and cringe, even while her friends are being butchered. Only toward the last does she get up enough gumption to grab a gun and help out her boyfriend. The (2) complaint is that too many times, the victims have a chance to blast away at their tormentors but they hesitate, as if hesitate about killing someone who is going to definitely kill them at the first chance. One would think that when you're trying to escape from some certified nutjobs, hellbent on slitting your throat, that you're going to destroy them first.

Other than that, this is a way above average thriller that doesn't pause for a moment as it tells a horrifyingly true story--and the perils that come with traveling into a place with a bad reputation. In other words, take a trip to Disneyland!",1231632000,3,1629,4.82437275985663

It all seems like a pleasant vacation, what they don't know is that they will become victims of a drug-smuggling Satanic blood cult who's interests are killing people, using a little dope and dismemberment.

Interesting low budget horror thriller is influenced by a true crime that once happened south of the border in 1989. Sean Astin co-stars in this chiller that is literally a cut above the rest of 2007's After Dark Horror fest, the acting is a little weak at spots but good at times and there is some disturbing sequences of torture, brutality, and gore but with tension. The pacing is tight and this movie is a cruel yet creepy exercise into the macabre just like Tobe Hooper's ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" as it takes you to hell and back.

I wasn't in the mood to witness 'Gringos' being hacked, dismembered to death by machetes. This movie wasn't so much poor rather the location. What a depressing and vile place Mexico can be at times with extreme racism toward whites. Weird drug lords, satanic sacrafical cults and a lot unclean living. I regretted renting this..

3079541,3,B00127RAJ4,"In the last film in our coverage of the After Dark Horrorfest fims, we take a look at Borderland, a film based on actual events.  I'm happy to say that Borderland is the best of the four films that I reviewed.  On the other hand, the bar was so low with the previous entries, that this isn't saying too much.  Three college buddies, Eddie, Henry, and Phil head to a small Mexican bordertown for a few days of booze and babes.  Nave Phil (Rider Strong) is plucked off the streets by members of a cult who practice human sacrifice.

Eddie and Henry have little luck with getting help from the police who themselves are terrified of the cult.  Their only aid comes from a local girl, Valeria (Higareda) who helps the guys with the translations although she is new to the town herself.  They finally meet a Mexico City cop whose partner was killed by the cult a year ago and has been tracking them down ever since.  They plan a desperate rescue attempt to try and save Phil before the cult's charismatic leader, Santillan, can sacrifice him.

Now if the film truly is based on real events then Mexico has moved into my Top 1 spot of places that I will NEVER visit.  While not a true horror in the strictest sense, the thriller's themes are horrific and it is suitably bloody.  Victims of the cult have limbs chopped off and are hacked to bits with machetes.  Sean Astin of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy is almost unrecognizable as a fat, sadistic lackey of Santillans.  It took me several scenes to realize that was him, as I had not checked out the credits before watching the film.

Borderland had the best performances of any of the four Horrorfest films that I reviewed.  Damian Alcazar was outstanding as the beaten down, and crippled cop trying to avenge his partner's murder.  Martha Higareda is extraordinarily beautiful and hopefully she will be in more American film productions as most of her previous credits have been in her native Mexico.  Rider Strong, who also starred in another of this year's Horrorfest films, Tooth and Nail, is also very good as the innocent, baby-faced Phil.  Chilean Beto Cuevas who plays the ruthless cult-leader, fronts a rock band.

Director Zev Berman moves the film along briskly and dispenses with a lot of the usual low-budget horror film plot devices like gratuitous sex scenes and the like.  He goes after the viewer with a visceral intensity and doesn't stop until the final credits roll.  Borderland isn't a great film but it's certainly on of the best in this year's batch of Horrorfest films.

3079542,4,B00127RAJ4,"I finally got around to watching Borderland last night. I've watched most of the ""After Dark Horror Fest"" films and have to admit I wasn't expecting much. I'm not sure who picks and chooses what enters into their series of films, but I don't have much faith in them. However I'm very pleased with the time I spent with this one.

I'm not a huge fan of the Saw and Hostel films. Don't get me wrong, I love horror it's just the brutality of some of these films that put me off. Much like the face pounding scene from 28 Weeks Later.

This one had its brutal moments, but nothing like the woman taking a blood bath ala Elizabeth Bathory style in Hostel 2.

The acting was solid from everyone involved. I have to give kudos to Sean Astin for his portrayal of the one psycho gringo in the cult. He gave a very convincing performance and really proved he has what it takes to branch out.

The reality of the situation was what drove it home for me. During the time period those Devil Worship stories were popping up in Mexico and college students had disappeared I was living in El Paso Texas. We heard lots of stories about human vertebra neclaces and missing persons. I don't know how true any of it was, but I found the possibilities disturbing to say the least. Pretty scary for a 15 year old living 5 miles from the border. At the time I had no clue that it was closer to Corpus Christi on the complete opposite side of the state.

I highly recommend Borderland. It's not going to win any acedemy awards, but is enjoyable none the less.",1211500800,6,1535,4.315972222222222
3079543,3,B00127RAJ4,"I'm not a big fan of the Horrorfest films, even though I wish I was. I saw a lot of 2006's (I only liked `The Hamiltons' of what I saw... and it was just 'ok') and I think Borderland is the only one I've watched for the year 2007. Borderland is definitely the best of all the Horrorfest that I've seen so far. Now don't go hitting that 'BUY' button just yet...hear me out first.

Borderland is 'inspired' on a true event that happened down in Mexico. Basically a drug bust happened, cops found human remains in cauldrons and mass graves. The drug guys said human sacrifices to their God (or whatever it was) made them invisible (I'm guessing to make it easier to smuggle drugs). So saying that, I'm sure you can tell where this movie is going, but I'll continue.

So we got 3 teenage boys that are about to head to college. Before they do, they want to head to Mexico for a few days and party and find some hookers. In doing so, they come across a whore house with a pretty bartendress and one of our boys falls for her. Another one actually falls for a hooker, which has a kid, which his friend paid 80 bucks for him to sleep with. Now you are probably thinking, ""OH MAN THEY ARE HARLOTS! They are evil and MAKING these guys fall in love with them by magic or voooodoooo"" Nope, your wrong. They are just idiots. So later on, they decide to hang out at a Fair with the bartendress and her cousin, do some shrooms and weed, and go for some rides. After awhile, our boy who fell in love with the actual hooker wins her a stuff animal and decides to leave the group and go back to the whore house and give it to her. They let him go (alone) and on the way there, he gets picked up by some bad dudes, and doesn't make it to see his new love. The rest of the crew start looking for him, to only find out that they are now involved with a pretty bad gang of drug lords. Will they be able to rescue their friend and get out of Mexico in one piece? Well... it's a Horrorfest film so what do you think?!

There wasn't a lot of gore, which doesn't have to be a bad thing, but what gore there was, was good. I liked the beginning with the cop.  There were hot chicks here and there (I liked the main bad dude's girl... YUM), but no nudity (see through white shirt on main bad dudes girl though!). The acting was ok. But seriously, the 3 guys were well into their late 20's, yet they were supposed to be teenagers getting ready to go to college? (*EDIT*..ok I'm guessing they were in their early twenties since they just graduated college, and I'm guessing heading to medical school or something like that). Also one of the henchmen had a dome that could've held two brains. Seriously he looked like an old comic character called Leader that the Incredible Hulk used to fight. I would NOT want to be head butted by that guy. And another main bad guy looked like a psychotic mix between Ice-T, Ludacris, and Pedro (from Napoleon Dynamite). Weird. Oh and Sean Astin (the guy who played Rudy in 'Rudy', and he played Sam, the hobbit that was Frodo's lover in 'Lord of the Rings') played a pretty good role here. The funny thing is though... it seemed like he filmed this and his part in '50 First Dates' at the same time. Because he had a backwards hat, a sea shell necklace, and a tank top on....AND...he spoke with a lisp sometimes.

In the end, I would recommend a rent, but only if there isn't much out there to watch.",1209427200,19,3407,4.219325153374233

This film really is quite good, based on true events (loosely I have heard), it is a very visceral experience to watch. The violence and gore are top-notch and very realistic. The acting is strong, the camera work excellent, really the only complaint I have is that the pacing is sometimes off. The first third of the movie can run a bit slow but once it picks up, it never lets up. Don't give up on this movie and you will be pleasantly rewarded. One of the best from Horrorfest '07 by far.",1208822400,4,578,4.169642857142857
3313116,4,B00127RAJ4,"Another year and another set of DVDs from the Afterdark Horrorfest. Last years crop had two or three films I was interested in and the films this year didn't seem to be my thing, until I had heard of Borderland and the true story behind the movie. If you look up the story on the internet you can find a fascinating story of a cult of drug peddlers that killed over sixty-three men in voodoo ritual that involved sodomy, torture and dismemberment. Mixing with the criminal nature of the cult and to me its fascinating. And Zev Berman the filmmaker behind Borderland was just as fascinated with the story integrating it into his own Hostel storyline. On the DVD He states how he became involved with the story after he and some friends were pulled over trying to enter Mexico with some voodoo paraphenalia decorating their bus.
The story as it goes is basic horror film fare, very much in the vein of Hostel in a way. Three friends bound for college go on a road trip for the vices that they can find on the border between Mexico and America. On friend Ed hooks up with a bartender Valeria and the group goes off to eat Mushrooms and party at a carnival. Therein a member decides to split after the trip starts going bad and on the way back to the hotel He gets kidnapped by the cultists who are looking for an American to use in their ritual. When the remaining friends awake the next day they go in search of their missing friend and instead find a town where the cops don't much care when people go missing (after a policeman was dismembered alive in the opening) and cult members wanting them to disappear.
Like I said the film is very reminiscent of other horror films plotlines. The three friends themselves follow very generic and cliched stereotypes with the badboy hardcase, the sensitive hero, and the goofy young religious type who enters the picture with a target on his chest. The acting is servicable at best meeting the demands of the movie and my only other complaint is against the director using an overcranked camera to film most of it. But still the cult itself was a fasciinating thing that added depth to the movie. These weren't the business men of Hostel or the cannibal rednecks of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre but a real group of disturbed people that followed a charasmatic leader in doing the most horrible things possible believing that they were invincible to the world. This part of the movie worked for the better of the movie.
As for the DVD itself its put together well with the commentary and a twenty minute making of feature. The best feature of the disc was featurette with the lead detective who investigated the initial disappearnce of the American college student that lead to investigation of the cult. They intersperse his commentary with video shot of the actual cult members being interogated while they lead police around the ranch where the murders took place and dig up bodies. One strange thing, they change the name of the victim while you can easily find the mans name on the internet. Still check out the movie. Its easily one of the better offerings from the second Afterdark series this year.",1206316800,7,3144,4.606060606060606
3313117,4,B00127RAJ4,"I've seen those based on true events movies such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Wolf Creek.  Upon actually researching these ""true events"",through this wonderful thing we call the internet, I was quite relieved to find that although these events were real, they are ""Hollywood-ized"" for entertainment purposes.  As much as I would like to say the same about Borderland, this is not the case.  It was real, very real, so real that I found it difficult to sit through this movie.  I remember these events all too well.  I was just 14 years old when I heard about this poor kid coming up missing while partying in the bordertown of Matamoros.  It hit very close to home, as Brownsville, Texas (the city right across the border from Matamoros)is a major part of my life.  I spent many childhood years there, both living and visiting family.  As familiar locals, we all knew back then that this story was not going to end well.  However, we could have never imagined the horrible reality. We were in a state of shock as disturbing details came to light. These were details that no half-way decent human being could possibly fathom.  As someone who knows this true story all too well, I must say that this filmaker did his homework. So much, that I almost turned the movie off (something this hard-core horror fan has never done) once Rider Strong was captured.  If you've seen this movie as loosely based on actual events or even fictitious, then it's just another horror flick.  Try watching it now and actually thinking of these characters (especially Rider Strong's) as real people that had a life and still have loved ones and it's more horrible than anything that you could imagine.",1206230400,38,1686,4.716723549488054
3313118,4,B00127RAJ4,"After last years horror fest I was disappointed so I really didn't know what to expect with some of this years. After watching Borderland I can say I enjoyed more than any of last years horror fest.
  The beginning of the movie shows two detectives in a house in Mexico City and once they enter they discover a slow of weird things like bloody animal meat and some strange signs drawn all over. The detectives soon become hostages to some weird cult. They force the one detective to watch as they torture his partner. One part is especially gruesome and involves the detectives eyes. They let the one detective go so he can let the police know not to mess with this cult group.

  It then flashes a year forward where 3 friends, Phil(Rider Strong from Cabin Fever)Ed and Henry. Before they go off to college I guess they want to have one last final fun time together. So off they go to Mexico. After meeting a bartender who ed becomes friends with and a prostitute bad things begin to happen. First Phil is kidnapped and soon after a green van keeps watching Ed,Henry and Valeria. It passes by and Henry sees a stuffed animal Phil had in the backseat. They go to the police but as usual the police aren't very helpful and finally upon seeing the green van again Henry runs up to it looking for a fight. The one cult member gets out and shoots Henry point blank in the neck. Just as this is happening a cop passes by and looks the other way. I guess to show that even the cops are afraid of this cult. Henry somehow survives and they then meet Ulises(the detective who was forced to watch his partner killed a year earlier).

  Meanwhile Phil is tied up in some old barn. He meets Randall(an against type Sean Astin,who did a nice job imo)an odd character who offers him chocolate and a chance to watch tv. Soon Phil finds out he is chosen for something important. As this is happening Ed decides to drop Valeria back off at her place while Henry is at the motel so she doesn't get hurt only for her to find out her sister was killed by the cult in a grisly manner. They go back to the motel only to find that the cult had gotten to Henry.

  Without giving the ending away we do find out that this cult is all about human sacrifice to please some ancient god and blood must also be shed for this to work I guess. He is tortured and soon Ed,Valeria and Ulises arrive there to save their friend. Are they too late and what happens?",1205971200,7,2429,4.293216630196937
3313119,4,B00127RAJ4,"Horrorfest 2007 did not make it to the Zenith City, so I had to wait for last year's offerings to come out on DVD to be able to check them out, going the one a night route this time around.  One of the interesting things about going to see the original 8 films 2 die 4 in the theater was the order in which I saw the films, since that colors the veiwer's perceptions of each film.  The fact that the first one I saw last year, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reincarnation/dp/B000MEYKCI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reincarnation</a>,"" was the best of the bunch certainly affected what I thought of Horrorfest 2006 overall (It was not until I watched the schlock horror films that Lionsgate released direct to DVD during the past couple of years that I had to admit Horrorfest really does represent the cream of the crop, albeit during a period of extended drought).  Anyhow, to figure out the order of these films I went to the official Horrorfest website and arranged these eight films in the order they appeared there.  That means ""Borderland"" takes the lead off position, and history might repeat itself because it was the film I heard mentioned most often as being the best of the second round of offerings.

""Borderland"" begins with a group of Mexican drug runners going to town on a pair of Mexican police officers, one of who survives the ordeal.  This is a prologue to the main part of the film, where three Texas University students travel to a Mexican border town as a last fling before graudation.  Henry (Jake Muxworthy), Phil (Rider Strong), and Ed (Brian Presley) have a series of misadventures south of the border that end up crossing the paths of both the lovely Valeria (Martha Higareda) and the drug cult.  So it takes a while to get back to the blood, gore, and dismemberment that makes up most of the final act. Clearly there are torture porn elements to this 2007 film, and parts are reminiscent of the original ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hostel/dp/B000EHRVP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hostel</a>,"" most specifically in the fact that the victims are males rather than females (although the same rules apply for figuring out which of the trio will be last one standing).  But director Zem Berman provides a mixed bag of horror genres in his film.  The back of the DVD proclaims this film ""blends the raw fear of '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Texas-Chainsaw-Massacre-with-the-stark-reality-of-ASIN-B0000AN4JE-In-Cold-Blood/dp/B000FS9FE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre}]' with the stark reality of '[[ASIN:B0000AN4JE In Cold Blood</a>.'  I can see the former as a point of reference, but not the latter, mainly because Ulises (Damian Alcazar), the cop who survives the opening scene, is around but not part of a concerted effort to track down the bad guys.

The most memorable part of this film is cleary the performance by Sean Astin, who shows up as one of the bad guys.  Having played ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rudy/dp/B00004W221/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rudy</a>"" and Samwise Gamgee in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings/dp/B000654ZK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings</a>,"" there is a tendency to think of Astin as being a kind soul and a little fellow.  Well, forget that after watching him in this film.  If you were wondering why somebody like Astin would show up for a supporting role in a film like this one, the obvious answer is the opportunity to play against type, which he does quite well.  I found it interesting that Berman was more willing to show bad things happening to the good guys than when bad things happen to the villains, although I am not sure what such a distinction signifies.  My biggest complaint here is the overuse of hand held cameras, because I am getting really tired of the shots constantly bouncing around in films these days (especially since more and more often I am convinced the rationale for the use of hand held cameras is not aesthetic, but economics: it is way cheaper to shoot a movie that way).  However, whatever they did to the film stock for  ""Borderland "" gives the movie an effective look for the south of the border setting.  Too bad the soundtrack is little more than constant ominous ambience, because halfway through it becomes rather annoying.

Unlike most movies that throw out the label ""Inspired by a True Story,"" Berman makes sure with the limited DVD Bonus Features that he proves his point.  In ""Inside Zev's Head: A Filmmaker's Diary,"" Berman tells about his own personal connections to the case of Adolfo de Jess Constanzo, the serial killer and cult leader in Mexico known as ""The Godfather of Matamoros,"" when he and some college buddies headed from New Orleans to Mexico with a bunch of voodoo stuff in their van.  The specific point of inspiration is the disappearance of Mark Kilory, a college student, during Spring Break in 1989.  It turned out that Constanzo, in addition to running drugs, engaged in occult rituals and human sacrifice as followers of Santeria, a religious hybrid of Catholicism and African religions.  The details of the investigation are covered in ""Rituales de Sangre: The True Story Behind the Cult Murder Investigation,"" where one of the Texas law officers intimately involved in the case tells the story.  As far as telling the true story behind the movie, this is one of the better documentaries I have seen.  It was almost enough to get me to round up on this particular DVD, but I really am getting sick of the over-use of handheld cameras in movies these days.  Next up: ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unearthed/dp/B00127RAIK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unearthed</a>.""",1205884800,15,5900,5.39760348583878
3313120,5,B00127RAJ4,"Borderland was a great movie. One of the better of horrorfest '07. Great cast and presents a few surprises, even for the jaded horror movie buff. Overall, definitely worth checking out.",1199232000,12,185,5.0
3313121,3,B00127RAJ4,"There's a moment in ""Borderland"" when a Mexican cop points a shotgun at the leader of a cult. I don't remember what the cop said, but I do remember that it reminded me of Mandy Patinkin in ""The Princess Bride"": ""Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."" No, this is not the desired effect of ""Borderland,"" and that only makes me question my feelings for it. Here's a film that gets more and more ugly with every passing scene; what starts out as an interesting story ends up as a violent blood fest, with virtually every character dependent on machetes and guns to get a point across. The film opens with a disclaimer saying it's inspired by true events, and it ends with facts for the audience to read. I guess that means we're supposed to believe it, much like when we believed the ""true"" stories of ""The Amityville Horror"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.""

But for all its glaring flaws, there's still something appealing about ""Borderland,"" if only just. The opening scene shows two Mexican cops raiding a house in Mexico City; upon entering, they discover an assortment of bizarre things, such as strange signs drawn on the floor, various pieces of bloody animal meat, and a human jawbone. They're then attacked by a group of insane cult members, who seem to take great pleasure in chopping off various body parts. This is exactly what happens to one of the cops while the other--Ulises (Damin Alczar)--is forced to watch. He was allowed to live so that he could spread word about the cult leader, referred to as Papa. I have no idea what this would accomplish, but I suppose it doesn't really matter.

The story then flashes forward one year, and that's when we're introduced to three graduating friends from Texas: the hotheaded non-conformist Henry (Jake Muxworthy); the desperate virgin Phil (Rider Strong); and Ed (Brian Presley), the main character. Before entering college and going their separate ways, they drive into Mexico looking for drugs, alcohol, and sex. Initially, they don't find much of anything--Phil takes pity on a young prostitute with an infant child, Ed befriends an English-speaking bartender named Valeria (Martha Higareda), and Henry is just being Henry. But after a short while, the three young men are thrust into a nightmare, one that will only get bleaker as the film progresses. One should expect nothing less from a film like this, especially since these characters are broadly drawn and never developed.

It all begins when Phil is kidnapped, and we quickly realize that his captors are the same cult members from the film's opening. They take him to an isolated barn, and after having his wrists tied above his head, he meets an American named Randall--a character that would fit right in with the clan from ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" were it not for his soft, clean-cut voice. I say this because the role of Randall was given to Sean Astin, an actor I neither expected nor wanted in this kind of film; the man who brought Samwise Gamgee to life so wonderfully is too good for a low budget shocker. Truth be told, I'm not entirely sure why his character was included in the first place.

And here's where the film loses some steam. In their search for Phil, Ed and Henry meet with Ulises, who has spent much of the past year gathering evidence against the evil cult. From him, we learn that this cult practices human sacrifice in the belief that it will appease an ancient god. In stories like this, it's all about ancient gods that demand a blood sacrifice every so often; in this case, the victim needed to be a white American because, according to the leader--Santillian (Beto Cuevas)--Mexican victims are no longer effective. Phil has been made the key to bringing this god forth, and this is obviously a bad thing, especially since it involves numerous scenes of his physical and psychological torture. It's actually a pathetic sight--a bleeding, sobbing, half-naked young man with a crudely shaved head. I felt sorry for him.

And that's how I was supposed to feel, I guess. But how far is our sympathy supposed to go? How long are we supposed to invest in these characters? By the time we reach the incredibly violent last third of the film--in which Ed, Valeria, and Ulises search through the cult's compound--I began to wonder if we were, in fact, watching a character driven film; at a certain point, it seemed more like a film that was made gory just for the sake of being gory. Some films can pull that off, specifically those made to be campy. But ""Borderland"" is not campy in the least, even when the occasional joke is told. It's intense and dramatic, about as serious as the amputation of an arm (yes, that does happen to someone, and no, I won't say who that someone is).

But something is preventing me from dismissing this film entirely. The dynamic between Presley, Muxworthy, and Strong is interesting, if a little shallow, and I got a kick out of Muxworthy's performance. Some of the camerawork is creative, such as in a scene where the characters are high on mushrooms; their movements were choppy, much like an Internet video playing on a computer with a slow modem. There are also a fair number of scenes shot with an unsteady camera, and I still can't decide if this is effective or just visually aggravating.

On the whole, this movie is not that badly written, acted, produced, and directed. For most, a story ""based on actual events"" makes it authentically real. Apparently, this story fictionally reports events of actual occurrence in our shared world of physical reality. If so, there are events in this physical reality occurring horrifyingly. Their depicting such inhuman events are neither understated nor overstated by the filmmakers in Borderland. Lethal events are portrayed with enough visual detail allowing the viewer to see the action without fighting the reflexive urge to look away. A combination of script writing, directing and editing accomplishes the task at keeping tension in the storyline. A sense of foreboding kept this viewer's attention riveted to the unfolding of dark, murderous events.

This film may find broad appeal with horror-film lovers, for an aspect of the dark-side of the spirit world is fictionally conveyed realistically -- hence, believably. Anyone interested in the cinematic arts might appreciate the demonstration of solid film production Borderland represents. Someone unfamiliar with demon worship would be advised to watch this low-budget, neo-journalistic (yet fictional) artful rendering of common practices of those who do worship demons.

Remember when viewing this film is that an important aspect of the craft of filmmaking aspires toward the fulfillment of a viewer's sense of entertainment. Does this cinematic story meet that requirement? Judge for yourself.",1455840000,,1726,5.526515151515151

3313656,4,B00127RAJ4,"Loosely based on a couple dozen human sacrifice killings in a Mexico border town in the late 1980s, ""Bordertown"" is an American cheapie with rich Mexican content dealing with the cult that did the killing, an episode they had with a couple Mexican cops, and a later episode with three Texas college-bound kids. The latter is what will interest anyone that is a fan of murder, mayhem, torture, revenge, ultraviolence and lots and lots of movie blood because that's what goes on in this flick.

The plot revolves around the two killing episodes by cultists, the first where they incoherently leave a living witness, the second that ends in a bloodbath of revenge and mayhem unlike much you've seen in other movies lately. I doubt the real cult ended this way; in fact, onscreen text at the end of the film suggests it did not.

However, that's nothing to worry about. ""Borderland"" provides a couple hours of escapist fun that won't totally gross out any experienced film watcher since nothing really bad is ever shown. The kicker is this is real world-based, not made up Hollywood, and it's full of sympathetic characters and those you will revile the first time you see them.

One year later, University of Texas graduates Ed, Henry, and Phil decide to head down to Mexico City for the week and hit up all the local bars and strip clubs as one last hoorah before they go their separate ways. When they arrive things start out perfectly. That night, Ed falls in love with a bartender, Valeria, after defending her from an abusive customer. Meanwhile, Henry sets Phil up with a prostitute who's barely 17 and has a kid. The next night the group have some fun at a local carnival with their dates where Phil leaves early to go back and give his prostitute girlfriend a teddy bear he won for her.

While walking alone on a deserted neighborhood street, Phil reluctantly takes a car ride from a group of strange men who proceed to abduct him in the process. The next morning when Ed and Henry realize that Phil did not come back, they begin to investigate and team with Valeria as well as Officer Ulises to get answers and find Phil. Because Mexican authorities are too scared of the power of the cult, they can only rely on themselves. After further investigation, Henry and Ed discover that Phil was kidnapped by a notorious and brutal Satanic cult in the area that sacrifices humans for his Nganga to communicate and receive supernatural power from a spirit named Chango. In the process of searching for Phil; Ed, Valeria, Henry, and Ulises enter a dark, dangerous, and ritualistic world with insurmountable odds that may be too much even for them to overcome all for the price of one

Overall: It needs to be said that Borderland is probably the greatest movie ever released by After Dark Horrorfest. Based on a true story, the film loosely recalls the real life murder of a Texas University student who was killed at the hands of a religious cult in Mexico while on spring break in 1989. In addition to solid performances, Borderland capitalizes on the graphic nature of the film. While it's certainly not as gory as everyone makes it out to be, the few violent scenes that do take place are graphic in and of itself. The storytelling is also really captivating. Once it pulls you in, it keeps you until the closing credits. All of the elements featured in this film, make it spectacular and not only my favorite movie from Horrorfest but perhaps their best one yet",1436140800,3,2684,4.658227848101266

This movie is not a strict retelling of that event, like I said, it was a pretty loose retelling, with lots of Hollywood thrown in. However, this is a well made and spooky film. Although the famed El Padrino was not Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, it was obviously him that they were  chronicling. Yes, this film is more of a thriller, but there is more than a little horror mixed in, in fact, this film is spooky! What enhances this spooky quality is the way the film is shot, in a dark, almost grainy way, that makes you think you are watching a bad dream play out.

I actually prefer this movie even though it was probably produced on a fraction of the budget ""Serpent and Rainbow"" had to work with and the absence of big name actors.

This seems much more realistic and doesn't rely on the corny supernatural special effects that permeates ""Serpent and Rainbow"".
I enjoyed ""Serpent and Rainbow"" but it's too formulae, obvious and predictable.

I don't know for a fact that Santeria is employed by Mexican drug lords for the same purpose but I wouldn't doubt it for a second.
In fact, I simply assume it is so.

This is a really excellent movie. The characters are completely realistic and the plot is masterfully navigated.
This is very graphic yet it doesn't come off as gratuitous; simply unpleasantly realistic.

I can't find any constructively negative criticism of this movie; it's one of those rare surprises that demonstrates that a low budget film can actually outshine a big studio production.",1423180800,2,1137,4.963157894736842

It was big news here in Austin and the concept that he was randomly selected to be a human sacrifice in black ritual to aid drug smugglers to elude capture was unbelievably horrifying for those of us making routine trips to the border.,1408060800,,396,4.486111111111111

I read the blurb for this movie and I thought, oh boy, an evil death cult movie! There aren't enough evil death cult movies! Seriously, I feel it's an underused horror sub-genre...the Sacrament recently made great use of the theme, but there's still room to explore, and I'm glad these guys did.

This starts out as a Mexican cop drama with two detectives storming an apartment, discovering the remains of a human sacrifice ritual, and then one of them getting brutally killed by cultists before the other one's eyes.
Then we shift to a band of American tourists who've just come across the border to have some fun, meet some girls, take some shrooms, go to a fair. It's a year later and the cop who survived the raid is now a whiskery, beaten down looking wretch who keeps pestering the local police about the death cult, and the local police are totally cowed by the death cultists and, I think, unaware of their true nature.
When the tourists, joined by a beautiful local bartender one has seduced, go in search of their friend who went missing after the fair, they begin discovering scary things. It's when they join forces with the detective that the movie really starts to cook.
So it's both a cop movie and a tourists getting trapped and killed movie. It's also a movie about a strong woman in love and a real treasure trove of grindhouse violence. You get the feeling that the people behind this movie have really spent a lot of time just across the border.",1403827200,,1483,4.592452830188679

I know nothing about the true events but just by seeing the sum total of this movie, if I were to bet everything I own that that most of what is portrayed in this film is a bunch of BS Im sure Id be just fine and have nothing to worry about. Its not that I don't believe the events in this film couldn't happen, its just too much of a formula driven story that is all too familiar for anyone to actually swallow it. Also I am not sure why people are praising Sean Astins performance either. Its pretty much a standard undemanding role. And his work on 24 a few years back is far more impressive. That being said this movie is not terribley any means, its simply pretty standard and run of the mill. But its clearly mostly fiction, claiming its based on a true story, then expecting people to believe the entire thing happend as they depict it in the film. Reminds me of the alien abduction movie Fire in the Sky. While the story there as a whole may have been true, even the main subject never accounted an abduction senario anywhere near what the film shows. Obviously its the same thing here.

3313957,4,B00127RAJ4,"Often the tagline ""inspired by a true story"" or some such similar description, raises expectations that are never met, but that is not the case with Borderland (2007), a dark and brutally violent tale, not for the faint of heart, set somewhere in Mexico.  Director and co-writer Zev Berman's film is based on his experiences at the Mexican border in 1989, when US law enforcement was searching for a missing American student, who was later found dead as one of many victims of a Mexican drug manufacturing ring that believed in the occult, and practiced human sacrifice.

Borderland is a gripping and shockingly gory film that is all the more terrifying, because of its inherent realism.  Henry (Jake Muxworthy), Ed (Brian Presley), and Phil (Rider Strong), three college students from Texas, cross the border into Mexico looking for a good time.  Ed and Henry hook up with some local Mexican girls, but Phil is not so lucky.  Looking for a white man to be used as a sacrifice, the drug gang abducts Phil, and imprisons him on a farm, under the watch of Randall (Sean Austin) a fellow American.

Ed and Henry file a police report, and with the help of their new friends Valeria (Martha Higareda) and her cousin Lupe (Francesca Guillen), begin to check around.  Eventually they cross paths with the gang, and violence erupts when Henry tries to challenge them.  While at the hospital, they meet a former cop named Ulises (Damian Elcazar) who tells them that he knows where Phil is being held prisoner, and that he will sacrificed that night because there will be a full moon.

Santillan (Beto Cuevas) the priest/leader of the drug dealing cult, arrives at the farm to conduct the ritualistic ceremony.  Meanwhile, his bloodthirsty crew is on a mission to kill those searching for them, leaving behind a trail of broken bodies.  Ulises, Ed, and Valeria, infiltrate the farm to try and rescue Phil, setting the stage for a brutal, bloody, and bone chilling final act, that plays out with terrifying realism.

Opening with a grisly gross out torture scene, and featuring people hacked to pieces with machetes, Borderland is not for the squeamish.  The film is extremely effective at convincing you that the nightmare you are seeing could actually happen, should you have the supreme misfortune to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  It may be hard to believe that there are those who still practice human sacrifice, but that is what a drug dealing cult actually did back in 1989.  When the group abducted an American student, it intensifies interest in their activities, and eventually leads to the discovery of a mass grave containing dozens of victims.

The bonus feature ""Inside Zev's Head"" is a conversation with Zev Berman, a thoughtful and articulate guy who speaks about what his inspirations, motivations, and goals for the film were.  Berman clearly succeeded in telling a dramatic and horrifying story that captures the realism of the actual events.  In another bonus feature, a police detective who worked on the actual case, reveals shocking details, many of which are incorporated by Berman into the film.

Some horrific things happen in Borderland, but it's really more of a crime thriller with ties to the occult, than a pure horror film.  Although the violence is extreme, even chaotic, there is little that seems contrived or completely phony.  Things often do not go the way you might expect, and the ending is very dark and disturbing.  The cast comes across as very authentic, the dialog is very natural, and the acting performances are powerful and moving.  Despite a tense showdown around a bathtub, the finale plays a little too smoothly, until Ed and Valeria are forced to battle for their lives.  When Ed loses control and starts swinging a machete, it brings Berman's bloody nightmarish Mexican adventure to a dramatic close.",1319500800,2,3853,4.901386748844376

(I jumped up and cheered when he expressed his thoughts on cgi blood effects) This isn't thrill-violence. This, as he points out, isn't a splatter movie. It's truly tragic. It dances around genre conventions without being self-aware and hipster about it. And in many ways the characters make believable choices and take believable chances. WARNING- this is real cojones-to-the-wall stuff. Like, say, THE DEVIL'S REJECTS with victims you care about and NO JOKES. This isn't a scary-movie-as-amusement-park-thrill-ride thing. Extremely well-photographed without being showcase-y about it. VERY impressive practical effects. No scenery-chewing over-acting. and, hooray, characters pushed to their limits without being transformed into stupid butch wisecracking super-buff revenge killers. You just FEEL how damaged any survivor(s) are in the end. My only real complaints are (1) I wasn't sold on these three guys being close buddies all through college, and 2) I really don't get what all the praise is for Sean Astin's against-type performance.

Since I am very spiritual, I think it's just probably  natural for me to be drawn to this type of madness, and seething with anger and fascination at the same time.  I have heard about the true story of Adolfo Costanzo and his blood-thirsty followers many, many times.  This case fascinates me just as much as Charles Manson's case, ""Helter Skelter""--if not MORE. The movie is obviously not a documentary of what truly went down in Brownsville/Matamoros, but I am very happy I found this movie anyway, since I'm also a horror movie junkie anyway, LOL.

The acting is really, really good.  The blood-curdling screams coming from the victims really tugged at me.  Also, living in Texas, and having visited a bordertown myself, I know how it feels to be totally out of your element.  I was with my parents at the time, and by God, Mexico is a 'banned' country in my book.  And yes, I was almost killed there.  Not dissected like these poor souls were, but almost ran over by a speeding car.  I was young then, but I still had a feeling of being a target.  The car just sped on and on, and didn't even slow down as it came close to me.  They just don't giva rat's ass down there.

3313996,4,B00127RAJ4,"Three friends (male) who take a reckless trip down to Mexico to celebrate their acceptances into college (and party of course) Collide with a blood thirsty drug cartel that practices ritual sacrifice. I say Reckless because of the fact that when you go south of the border you most definitely have to be aware and have some knowledge of your surroundings. These three amigos individual personalities is what really makes this movie, One naive and clueless, one cocky and arrogant, the other (the lead character) selfless and moral. Expose these personalities to brutal carnage and sit back and watch what they transform into. Borderland is one of the best of the After Dark series but I do not consider it to be Horror, but more of a reality based shocker ( supposedly this movie was inspired by true events). I must warn you though, this movie can be brutal at times, but for the Slasher fan a Sunday afternoon appetizer. I gave Borderland Four stars for it's shock value, realism, originality and the acting was excellent for a B movie.
 For anybody who has never been South of the border I can see how this movie can scare you into not going there, its a movie.
But I will say this, you go into somebody else s backyard, respect it.",1264809600,,1235,4.613636363636363
3313997,4,B00127RAJ4,"""Inspired"" by a true story, this gruesome movie tells of 3 American males who decide to go down to a Mexican border town for their version of fun for the usual nonsense most males do when they get to leave their hometown. After one of the group gets kidnapped, they then realize that they've unknowingly stumbled upon a Mexican death cult which murders people with impunity. The cops aren't of any help.
The bad guys look really bad. Good acting there, realistic depiction of some towns and cities in the Third World where the bad guys run the show. 2 of the 3 friends end up getting killed in a horrific manner, and the remaining 1 gets a little justice of his own when he manages to fend off the last pursuing attacks from cult members.

3313999,5,B00127RAJ4,"first of all, this movie is not a scary movie. It is not scary to me.  It is more like an adventure/drama movie.  It is very well written and directed. The movie starts slow and then it picks up the pace quite well.  Don't let the cover picture fool you.  There is nothing supernatural.

The best of all about this DVD is the extra. The two documentaries are very well narrated.  One of the documentaries is actually scarier than the movie itself.

Bottom line is that I like this dvd.  So, 5 stars it is.",1240099200,2,505,4.242105263157895
3314000,3,B00127RAJ4,"To start off, like most of the reviewers here the Horror Fest movies leave a lot to be desired in most cases.  I have all of them so far and plan on picking up the new batch March 31st of this year when they are released. Overall they aren't really all that great but you can find a few gems every once in a while, this one wasn't one of them.

I wish Lions Gate would spend as much time taking the time to make the movies as much as they promote them with their slick ad campaigns.  The best thing about some of these flicks are the trailers for the Horror Fest each year.

On to this movie, it is really more of an adventure/action picture more than a horror film.  There is some voodoo involved but generally that's just a background to have an action picture dressed as a horror flick.

The story revolves around some friends going down to Mexico to have some sex and some fun but they stumble upon a really nasty drug gang.  This is partly based on a true story and it's believable with what is presented.  The characters are built very well and there is some intrigue going on here but ""Where's the horror?""

There are some torture scenes early on and towards the end but generally the movie revolves around the friends trying to find their friend and the mystery and intrigue involved with that.  There is some very brief nudity but generally this movie easily could have been a PG-13, but the F-bomb was muttered more than 5 times so that made it an R.  There were some bloody scenes but again they only occur at the beginning and the end.  I found myself dozing off towards the middle when there was a lot of talk and very little action.

I didn't hate this movie and there was a really good scene when the ""kids"" and I use that term loosely, were taking shrooms and smoking pot.  During that segment the camera took on the ""vision"" of our protagonists and the effect was very well done.

I don't hate this movie but I don't love it either, it's worth a rent but don't expect a horror film it's more of a mystery or action movie.  I thought initially it might be more of a Serpent and the Rainbow type of film and that was truly horror but there were just not that many horror elements thrown in.  It's worth a watch but don't go out of your way.",1231891200,2,2255,4.231308411214953
3314001,5,B00127RAJ4,"The After Dark flicks I've seen in the past were all dissapointing and flat and very boringly put together. Imagine my surprise that when I watched this movie on the Sci-Fi Channel this morning--while eating breakfast--and then discovered it was among the After Dark entries.

This movie grabs you in the first frame and doesn't let go until the final scene. It's all supposedly based on real facts, in which some bone-headed Mexicans truly believe in this bizarre religion where human sacrifice is warranted to appease their god of darkness.

The movie is wonderfully acted, directed and photographed and there's not one cardboard cutout stereotype among the cast.  These villians look so real you wonder if they the director scrounged them up off the sidestreets.

The only two minor complaints I have is that (1) the female character never did anything but cry and cringe, even while her friends are being butchered. Only toward the last does she get up enough gumption to grab a gun and help out her boyfriend. The (2) complaint is that too many times, the victims have a chance to blast away at their tormentors but they hesitate, as if hesitate about killing someone who is going to definitely kill them at the first chance. One would think that when you're trying to escape from some certified nutjobs, hellbent on slitting your throat, that you're going to destroy them first.

Other than that, this is a way above average thriller that doesn't pause for a moment as it tells a horrifyingly true story--and the perils that come with traveling into a place with a bad reputation. In other words, take a trip to Disneyland!",1231632000,3,1629,4.82437275985663

3314034,4,B00127RAJ4,"Three Texas College buddies are on a trip in Mexico, they are out for a bit of sex, drugs and fun south of the border. It all seems like a pleasant vacation, what they don't know is that they will become victims of a drug-smuggling Satanic blood cult who's interests are killing people, using a little dope and dismemberment.

Interesting low budget horror thriller is influenced by a true crime that once happened south of the border in 1989. Sean Astin co-stars in this chiller that is literally a cut above the rest of 2007's After Dark Horror fest, the acting is a little weak at spots but good at times and there is some disturbing sequences of torture, brutality, and gore but with tension. The pacing is tight and this movie is a cruel yet creepy exercise into the macabre just like Tobe Hooper's ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" as it takes you to hell and back.

What a depressing and vile place Mexico can be at times with extreme racism toward whites. Weird drug lords, satanic sacrafical cults and a lot unclean living. I regretted renting this.. It is disgusting with no remorse or payoff. Just violent dribble.. AVOID!!",1215561600,3,536,4.966666666666667
3314038,3,B00127RAJ4,"In the last film in our coverage of the After Dark Horrorfest fims, we take a look at Borderland, a film based on actual events.  I'm happy to say that Borderland is the best of the four films that I reviewed.  On the other hand, the bar was so low with the previous entries, that this isn't saying too much.  Three college buddies, Eddie, Henry, and Phil head to a small Mexican bordertown for a few days of booze and babes.  Nave Phil (Rider Strong) is plucked off the streets by members of a cult who practice human sacrifice.

Eddie and Henry have little luck with getting help from the police who themselves are terrified of the cult.  Their only aid comes from a local girl, Valeria (Higareda) who helps the guys with the translations although she is new to the town herself.  They finally meet a Mexico City cop whose partner was killed by the cult a year ago and has been tracking them down ever since.  They plan a desperate rescue attempt to try and save Phil before the cult's charismatic leader, Santillan, can sacrifice him.

Now if the film truly is based on real events then Mexico has moved into my Top 1 spot of places that I will NEVER visit.  While not a true horror in the strictest sense, the thriller's themes are horrific and it is suitably bloody.  Victims of the cult have limbs chopped off and are hacked to bits with machetes.  Sean Astin of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy is almost unrecognizable as a fat, sadistic lackey of Santillans.  It took me several scenes to realize that was him, as I had not checked out the credits before watching the film.

Borderland had the best performances of any of the four Horrorfest films that I reviewed.  Damian Alcazar was outstanding as the beaten down, and crippled cop trying to avenge his partner's murder.  Martha Higareda is extraordinarily beautiful and hopefully she will be in more American film productions as most of her previous credits have been in her native Mexico.  Rider Strong, who also starred in another of this year's Horrorfest films, Tooth and Nail, is also very good as the innocent, baby-faced Phil.  Chilean Beto Cuevas who plays the ruthless cult-leader, fronts a rock band.

Director Zev Berman moves the film along briskly and dispenses with a lot of the usual low-budget horror film plot devices like gratuitous sex scenes and the like.  He goes after the viewer with a visceral intensity and doesn't stop until the final credits roll.  Borderland isn't a great film but it's certainly on of the best in this year's batch of Horrorfest films.

3314039,4,B00127RAJ4,"I finally got around to watching Borderland last night. I've watched most of the ""After Dark Horror Fest"" films and have to admit I wasn't expecting much. I'm not sure who picks and chooses what enters into their series of films, but I don't have much faith in them. However I'm very pleased with the time I spent with this one.

I'm not a huge fan of the Saw and Hostel films. Don't get me wrong, I love horror it's just the brutality of some of these films that put me off. Much like the face pounding scene from 28 Weeks Later.

This one had its brutal moments, but nothing like the woman taking a blood bath ala Elizabeth Bathory style in Hostel 2.

The acting was solid from everyone involved. I have to give kudos to Sean Astin for his portrayal of the one psycho gringo in the cult. He gave a very convincing performance and really proved he has what it takes to branch out.

The reality of the situation was what drove it home for me. During the time period those Devil Worship stories were popping up in Mexico and college students had disappeared I was living in El Paso Texas. We heard lots of stories about human vertebra neclaces and missing persons. I don't know how true any of it was, but I found the possibilities disturbing to say the least. Pretty scary for a 15 year old living 5 miles from the border. At the time I had no clue that it was closer to Corpus Christi on the complete opposite side of the state.

I highly recommend Borderland. It's not going to win any acedemy awards, but is enjoyable none the less.",1211500800,6,1535,4.315972222222222
3314040,3,B00127RAJ4,"I'm not a big fan of the Horrorfest films, even though I wish I was. I saw a lot of 2006's (I only liked `The Hamiltons' of what I saw... and it was just 'ok') and I think Borderland is the only one I've watched for the year 2007. Borderland is definitely the best of all the Horrorfest that I've seen so far. Now don't go hitting that 'BUY' button just yet...hear me out first.

Borderland is 'inspired' on a true event that happened down in Mexico. Basically a drug bust happened, cops found human remains in cauldrons and mass graves. The drug guys said human sacrifices to their God (or whatever it was) made them invisible (I'm guessing to make it easier to smuggle drugs). So saying that, I'm sure you can tell where this movie is going, but I'll continue.

So we got 3 teenage boys that are about to head to college. Before they do, they want to head to Mexico for a few days and party and find some hookers. In doing so, they come across a whore house with a pretty bartendress and one of our boys falls for her. Another one actually falls for a hooker, which has a kid, which his friend paid 80 bucks for him to sleep with. Now you are probably thinking, ""OH MAN THEY ARE HARLOTS! They are evil and MAKING these guys fall in love with them by magic or voooodoooo"" Nope, your wrong. They are just idiots. So later on, they decide to hang out at a Fair with the bartendress and her cousin, do some shrooms and weed, and go for some rides. After awhile, our boy who fell in love with the actual hooker wins her a stuff animal and decides to leave the group and go back to the whore house and give it to her. They let him go (alone) and on the way there, he gets picked up by some bad dudes, and doesn't make it to see his new love. The rest of the crew start looking for him, to only find out that they are now involved with a pretty bad gang of drug lords. Will they be able to rescue their friend and get out of Mexico in one piece? Well... it's a Horrorfest film so what do you think?!

There wasn't a lot of gore, which doesn't have to be a bad thing, but what gore there was, was good. I liked the beginning with the cop.  There were hot chicks here and there (I liked the main bad dude's girl... YUM), but no nudity (see through white shirt on main bad dudes girl though!). The acting was ok. But seriously, the 3 guys were well into their late 20's, yet they were supposed to be teenagers getting ready to go to college? (*EDIT*..ok I'm guessing they were in their early twenties since they just graduated college, and I'm guessing heading to medical school or something like that). Also one of the henchmen had a dome that could've held two brains. Seriously he looked like an old comic character called Leader that the Incredible Hulk used to fight. I would NOT want to be head butted by that guy. And another main bad guy looked like a psychotic mix between Ice-T, Ludacris, and Pedro (from Napoleon Dynamite). Weird. Oh and Sean Astin (the guy who played Rudy in 'Rudy', and he played Sam, the hobbit that was Frodo's lover in 'Lord of the Rings') played a pretty good role here. The funny thing is though... it seemed like he filmed this and his part in '50 First Dates' at the same time. Because he had a backwards hat, a sea shell necklace, and a tank top on....AND...he spoke with a lisp sometimes.

In the end, I would recommend a rent, but only if there isn't much out there to watch.",1209427200,19,3407,4.219325153374233

8244527,4,B00127RAJ4,"Released in 2007, Borderland is a horror film about three college guys (Brian Presley, Jake Muxworthy & Rider Strong) on Spring Break in Galveston, Texas, who decide to skip over the border to party with the prostitutes. Their vacation goes awry when they run afoul of a brutal drug cult, led by a charismatic-but-diabolic occultist (Beto Cuevas). Damin Alczar plays a Mexican detective while Martha Higareda appears as the potential girlfriend of one of the Americans. Marco Bacuzzi plays the top cult henchmen with Sean Astin an American enlistee.

The opening epilogue involves a gory torture sequence, which is unpleasant to say the least, but the story soon switches to the three Americans and their trip to Mexican strip joints where a couple curvy seoritas are highlighted. I could tell this was shot on the West Coast of Mexico rather than the East Coast. The city scenes, for instance, were shot in Tijuana, substituting for Matamoros.

The story is loosely based on the 1989 abduction of American pre-med student, Mark Kilroy, from outside a Mexican bar where he was taken to Adolfo de Jess Constanzos ranch in the desert, about an hour drive from Matamoros & the border. Fifteen mutilated corpses were discovered buried at the ranch, one of them Kilroy's, who was hacked to death by a machete. Constanzos cult practiced sorcery in the form of Palo Mayombe, engaging in torture and human sacrifice for supernatural power, e.g. for their drug-runners to appear invisible to border guards.

Constanzo was a known homosexual, but the movie surrounds the Constanzo-based character, Santillan, with Mexican babes. I doubt this was done to be politically correct; Im sure the filmmakers simply wanted to give him cinematic appeal for the target audience, most of whom would run away screaming if Santillan was depicted with hunky dudes attending to his amorous needs.

While the movies sometimes unpleasant for obvious reasons, its gritty, engaging and well-acted, particularly the first half. Im sure the director, Zev Berman, is a fan of films like Apocalypse Now because you definitely see glimmerings of that kind of greatness. Unfortunately, this was the last movie by Berman as of this writing. He couldve gone on to be a contenda, like Coppola.

The picture runs 100 minutes and was shot entirely in Baja California, Mexico. It was written by Eric Poppen & director Zev Berman.
