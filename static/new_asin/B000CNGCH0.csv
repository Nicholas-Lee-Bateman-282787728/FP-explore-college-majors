8099775,1,B000CNGCH0,"I got this DVD with the intent of LEARNING to hip hop. At first the instructor starts off nice and slow with the arm and trunk motions. But after the first section, she goes really fast without breaking down the steps. I could rewind it forever trying to figure it out on my own. If you already know how to hip hop, or are a quick learner, this might be for you, but it's not for me!",1200873600,,383,3.987012987012987
8099776,1,B000CNGCH0,Not my style - although she's kind of funny to watch.  No moves I would actually use on the dance floor.,1184198400,,104,3.9523809523809526
8099777,2,B000CNGCH0,I could barely understand what she is saying... She's either hispanic or of arabic decent. Didn't like her dance style,1182211200,,118,4.95
8099778,1,B000CNGCH0,"this was so boring i laughed at it rather than trying to do the moves. The routine was way outdated, the chick was a little too much. I would never recommend buying this, because it is a BIG waste of money. Im reselling it thats how bad it is.",1178409600,2,243,3.979591836734694
8099779,4,B000CNGCH0,Very easy to learn. Simple techniques. People who have no dancing background can easily pick up dancing routine. Recommended to anyone who wants to learn from scratch.,1163203200,5,167,5.222222222222222
8099780,3,B000CNGCH0,"Personally I found this dvd to be a waste of money. I was buying it to tune up on some of my hiphop moves since I haven't been out dancing in a while. This dvd is VERY basic. If you do not know anything about hiphop dancing this would be a great dvd for you to learn off of. She goes through the movements fairly slow and with a couple of different angles, but she tends to move around her dance floor a lot which can make the angles a little odd and hard to follow if you are doing it as she is doing it. If you are trying to learn new moves, this is not the dvd for you.  These are older basic hiphop moves she shows you.  Also, I would use your own music to go along with this dvd, the music is pretty cheesy and is not the hiphop most people are accustomed to.",1159315200,13,764,3.829113924050633
8099781,3,B000CNGCH0,"I wasn't a huge fan of this dvd.  I bought it hoping I could learn some hip-hop steps.  In the dvd the only person teaching you is the girl on the cover.  Also the angles at which she shows the dance moves are odd at times.  It isn't really much of a beginner dvd.  The routines aren't hard, but she doesn't do an amazing job of teaching them.  I'm not satisfied with my purchase, but maybe that's just me.",1143763200,17,406,4.075949367088608
8099782,5,B000CNGCH0,I think this is a great dance DVD for beginners. She breaks things down and the moves are pretty easy once you get used to them. I have seen some of these moves in movies and clubs so you know you can use them in public without looking strange (assuming you practiced them anyways) I like this DVD better than most dance DVDs I tried. There are a lot of routines too.,1141430400,8,367,4.111111111111111
8099783,3,B000CNGCH0,"This video is perfect for a female who is just starting out. Think hip-hop in the late 90's. It's not some ""new moves"" video, but it's got the basics (which is exactly the target audience). Unfortunatly, I'm a male, and doing 80% of these dance moves would look, well...a little feminine.

I will give this video to my wife and hope she enjoys it.

The female who describes all the moves has something a a Russian or Cezh accent, but it's easy enough to understand.

The video layout, and step-by-step instruction is some of the most simple to follow, and she does the moves from multiple angles.",1140825600,32,596,4.5514018691588785
