The weight loss, however, did nothing to the smile we have all come to know and love, in fact I think its even bigger considering the fact that we were singing every word of every song right back to him. ( me especially as you can see on the taping with the long black hair with a chinese cut bang) ROCK ON FREDDIE!!!!!!!",1055894400,9,612,4.108333333333333
1652505,5,B00005R1OA,"BEING FROM THE OLD SCHOOL,FREDDIE JACKSON HAS ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF MY FAVORITES,HE ALWAYS PUTS ON A GREAT SHOW. AS USUALLY HE DOES IT AGAIN WITH THIS SHOW. THE AUDIO AND VIDEO WERE CLEAR AND CRISP. THIS CONCERT IS BECOMING ONE OF MY MOST WATCHED LIVE PERFORMANCES OF MY COLLECTION OF SHOWS. FREDDIE'S SHOWMANSHIP WAS ENTERTAINING ESPECIALLY THE WAY HE MINGLED WITH THE CROWD. WHENEVER I HAVE COMPANY OVER I NEVER HESITATE TO SHOW OFF THIS DISC TO MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS. THEY'RE ALWAYS IMPRESSED WITH FREDDIE'S WARMTH AND ADMIRATION, HE HAS ALWAYS DISPLAYED WITH HIS LIVE APPEARANCES THROUGHOUT THE YEARS. IF YOU NEVER SEEN FREDDIE JACKSON LIVE, HERE'S YOUR CHANCE. DON'T MISS IT.",1015977600,11,685,4.965217391304348
1652506,5,B00005R1OA,A lot of the DVD live performances I have purchased are of poor sound and picture quality.  I enjoy the 60's and 70's R&B artists.  This Freddie Jackson DVD was great and took me back to concerts I have attended years ago.  Everything you could ask for and more.,1304899200,,262,4.3061224489795915
1652507,5,B00005R1OA,this is Freddie Jackson at his best quite suprised such a good show i felt like he was in my living room singing thats how good it is,1299456000,,133,3.7857142857142856
1652508,1,B00005R1OA,"This is the first time that I have reviewed a product.  But, this was so horrible that I had to speak up for the sake of mankind and music consumers.  This is literally the worst DVD or CD that I have ever seen or heard and I have thousands of them both.  Freddie spent all of his time talking about how much everyone wanted him and no time singing his great songs.  He jacked his songs up so bad until they are barely recognizable.  Freddie, gain the weight back, get over yourself and sing your great songs the way they where meant to be sang.  I have never been to a live Freddie Jackson concert, if this is the way he performs I never will go to one. Music lovers and Freddie Jackson fans save your money and don't buy this trash.",1296345600,,734,4.133802816901408
1652509,5,B00005R1OA,"No doubt about it, if you want to enjoy a concert, this dvd is the one!!!  Freddie gives his best performance and the show is one of his best!! The show is very enjoyable, very entertaining and I've watched it over and over and over!  Whatever the price of the dvd, it's worth it!  Buy it!  Both men and women will definitely enjoy the show!  I highly recommend that you have this one in your collection!",1276905600,,404,4.2631578947368425

1652511,5,B00005R1OA,"This concert makes me want too go see Freddie in concert, he put on a classey show, he sings all his best songs and the crowd is really into him expecelly the ladies, he jokes around and kid with then and kiss then, they go crazy, I really love this dvd, I watch it all the time, he need to come out with some new stuff, hes one of the true artists of our time, he's the next Luther Vandross, you will love this dvd, the color and sound is great, so if you like Freddie Jakson as much as I do, get it now, its HOT!!!!!

1652512,2,B00005R1OA,"I didn't really like this DVD.  Freddie Jackson can sing, but it wasn't apparent in the way he sang on this DVD, because he changed the songs so much that they didn't sound like the songs we all bought and loved. He also sang them in a choppy manner, so it was difficult to appreciate the quality of his voice.",1184889600,,310,4.166666666666667
1652513,2,B00005R1OA,Well I would have to say if it's possible to over sing your own song than Freddie Jackson has absolutely accomplished this without a doubt. He over sang every single song. And by over sang I mean he adlibs way too much too many runs and  just too much of everything. To me it was nothing like any of his original work. I do not recommend.,1173916800,,338,4.121212121212121
1652514,5,B00005R1OA,"This DVD is great. Freddie is a first class international performer that has never gotten his full due. I have danced and clapped- while watching this DVD- about 3 times now and I just got it over the weekend. This artist work is not dated and his voice is as strong as ever, and he gives you a show! The hard work that went into this DVD is above board. A lot of folks did their homework on this project.

Freddie- the band- the back up singers- and the set d?cor (lighting -sound, etc) and the B.E. T. audience are on point. Now I want to buy all of his music- that is my next step.

Big ups to you Freddie and keep up the good work!

PS: I heard about this brother and his voice- right before he hit it big time and he still continues to amaze me to this day.

I used to hang out a bit with some people at Hush Productions and they only had good things to say about this brother. And I agree with them-his talent is awesome!  I also saw Freddie once, getting out of cab on 8th street in NYC a long time ago- and he had that star thing going then.",1145232000,2,1049,3.9526066350710902
1652515,5,B00005R1OA,"Whether you are alone or in the company of people, this DVD does it. Many artists can perform live but only a few can sing live. Freddie Jackson`s voice lives on. He sings songs of the 80's as if they were recorded yesterday.

Technically, this DVD has excellent sound quality. The band, background artists, Freddie and the audience feel like they are in my lounge.

At this price, it's a steal.",1109635200,11,395,4.549295774647887

7951509,5,B00005R1OA,I seen the DVD it is awesome . One of Freddy's best works. Very great and talented man. Freddie was off the chain. Good showmanship stage presence and a job well done.,1465430400,,167,4.25

7951515,5,B00005R1OA,"Freddie  Jackson commands a  stage and has showmanship for days and his voice is timeless.  the band  was throwing down. Freddie Jackson got the kind of skills that he could be  sanging outside the drive thru of  a  dunkin doughnuts and he would turn  that  Joint out.  this  show was  a great time.  still steppin and this  show just grooved.

Freddie Jackson is One of the greatest  Artists  Ever and Brother Man always  stayed cool and  can SANG!!!!!!!!! the band was  handling thangs and the background vocalists as well. the Audeince was  great. feel good show and Performance.",1329868800,,582,4.73469387755102
