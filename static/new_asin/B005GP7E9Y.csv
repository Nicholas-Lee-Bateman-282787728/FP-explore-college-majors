4693495,5,B005GP7E9Y,"I just did this DVD yoga practice today and I couldn't wait to write a review about it!  I'm an avid yogini and have purchased many yoga DVDs over the past couple years for my home practice.  I have to say that after doing this DVD--this will definitely be one I do again and again!  THe instructor (Gwen Lawrence) has an awesome body and her tone and her demeanor are calm yet upbeat and playful! Her moves were definitely challenging (not for a beginner) and creative yet I was able to hang in there for the 3 segments (20min.--upper body, lower body, core).  I am totally exhausted now yet feel great! There is also a 10min. express toning section that I didn't check out yet.  Maybe next time I practice I'll do all of it! So glad I purchased this! Namaste!",1327449600,6,761,4.368794326241135
4693496,5,B005GP7E9Y,"Gwen's workout yoga DVD is awesome.  After a few weeks I have not only gained strength and flexibility, but my body is much more balanced now.  Whether you're an athlete or just trying to get fit, this DVD is right for you.  You can't go wrong with Gwen and she's a great way to start off your New Year.",1325289600,,303,4.101694915254237
4693497,5,B005GP7E9Y,"The instruction, photography and presentation on this dvd are much better than most I've seen. The moves are all doable for most people. No extreme pretzel moves or big backbends. The instructor is very fit, calm, and without ego. There are three sections of 20 minutes which flew by for me when I did them back to back. I was tired but it felt good.
I'm cautious about a couple moves though. In one, she squats on the balls of the feet and just holds that position. This does not seem to me to be good for the knees and the metatarsals. In the downloadable quick yoga segment, there is a part when you lie on your back and repeatedly bring your straight leg up to meet your straight arm. This, along with the leg lifts seem to me to put to much emphasis on the development of the hip flexors, or psoas, which pulls on the low back. I skip these moves. Maybe she knows something I don't. Otherwise, Gwen Lawrence is a great instructor and the high production values, well-balanced selection of moves, and calm, clear presentation make this a dvd that can be used many times without boredom, in my opinion.",1323907200,18,1105,4.421568627450981
4693498,5,B005GP7E9Y,"This video is such a fresh approach for a long time yoga enthusiast. Gwen teaches poses and ways to stretch my body that I've never come across in any other style. I feel like it's a great combo for the person who is athletic and loves yoga but is tired of the same poses frequently found in many styles of yoga. The segments are short enough that they aren't too much of a commitment, making it easier for me to actually do yoga every day. And I feel like I've gotten a good workout after.",1409702400,,490,4.168421052631579
4693499,4,B005GP7E9Y,Very nice workout. However i feel she cant stop talking about her normal trainees,1408665600,,81,4.857142857142857
4693500,5,B005GP7E9Y,Great yoga DVD,1404259200,,14,4.0
4693501,5,B005GP7E9Y,This is my favorite workout DVD.  It has 3 segments that are 20 minutes each.  It's great and I wish she would release another DVD.,1398902400,,131,4.2
4693502,4,B005GP7E9Y,Good yoga dvd to get started on.  Would like t check out more of her DVDs.  will check out more.,1391990400,,96,3.75
4693503,4,B005GP7E9Y,"I liked the video,but it I hadn't done some yoga before,I wouldn't know how to perform some of the poses that she asks one to do. It is a good workout,though. It left me like I had a workout, but without the stress.",1389830400,,215,4.023255813953488
4693504,5,B005GP7E9Y,"I really enjoy her workouts, and love that they are in 20 minute increments. They are short enough to fit into a hectic schedule, but long enough to feel that I've gotten a good workout. She has some more challenging poses that I hadn't done before and really like. I feel great after the workout and am going to see if she has any other DVDs.",1389139200,,343,4.212121212121212
4693505,5,B005GP7E9Y,Much harder than I thought it would be.  20 minutes and was totally wiped out and sweating hard.  Love this workout,1389052800,,115,4.428571428571429
4693506,5,B005GP7E9Y,"I first saw Gwen Lawrence do some of this workout on TV and just had to get the DVD! I am very tight in my hips and many of the poses are a little difficult for me, but they are great hip openers.  This has become one of my favorite yoga workouts.",1383264000,,247,3.75
4693507,4,B005GP7E9Y,"wife used it maybe a week, LOL... Knew that would happen, but other then that not sure what to say??",1383177600,,100,4.05
4693508,5,B005GP7E9Y,"This offers 3 great workouts that are easy to follow for beginners yet offer a good workout for the lower body, upper body, and abs.",1380499200,,132,4.32
4693509,4,B005GP7E9Y,"Overall I liked Fit Body Yoga, it was a good solid intermediate yoga practice without too many frills. Gwen was a good and had a nice tone. I wish she had a 20-30 minute comprehensive practice included instead of just the upper body/lower body/core mix and the lighting was just a little too dark for my taste. Overall I don't regret buying it, but I'm glad I didn't pay too much.",1378425600,,380,4.366197183098592
4693510,5,B005GP7E9Y,"Vivacious instructor leading a solid workout. Her style and demeanor make me forget this is supposed to be ""exercise"" and not fun.",1373587200,,130,4.954545454545454
4693511,3,B005GP7E9Y,maybe I'm too old (in  my 50's) but this workout is way too difficult for my liking.  This video is possibly for a young yoga enthusiast who is very fit.,1372204800,,153,4.066666666666666
4693512,5,B005GP7E9Y,"I own many yoga dvd's, and have been exercising in my home for 35 years with videos.  I have to say that this is, by far, my most favorite one.  The instructor is exceptionally good. She incorporates many exercises and stretches that she says she uses with professional athletic teams.  It really is unique in many ways...and leaves me feeling stronger and more flexible than most workouts.  Right now, I am mixing it with some Core Fusion dvd's, (which are also awesome workouts!), and at 58, I feel and look better than I have in a long, long time.  Yoga and side-to-side movements are said to be the best exercise for Osteoporosis, which I now have, and this, along with lots of collagen-rich bone broth and 10 prunes a day, are my new regimen to rebuild my bones, sans any prescription drugs.  Can't wait for my next DEXA Scan to see the improvements!",1370131200,,855,4.555555555555555
4693513,4,B005GP7E9Y,"I like this workout.  I have very tight hip and hamstring muscles.  I use this for increased flexibility and love it.  Yes, there are some strange, and painful poses, but it's good as it makes my body adjust and build in areas where I need it.  My doc has suggested that my right ankle and left glute muscles are to tight due to overcompensating for my right knee problems.  This DVD address ankles and hips. I also like that it's only 20 minutes.  I can't bring myself to do an hour of Yoga - I like to do 30 minutes of harder exercises during the day, but I like to start my day with a short round of yoga.",1366934400,,608,4.067226890756302
4693514,5,B005GP7E9Y,I love this DVD! I am  Very Satisfied with my purchase! I would reccomend it to my family and friends.,1365033600,,102,4.1
4693515,4,B005GP7E9Y,"I sought out this dvd after trying the core workout on Hulu Plus.  The Core workout on this dvd is definitely the hardest section.  The arms and legs portions are more doable for some one at the intermediate yoga level, which is me, but I enjoy the challenge of the core portion.  Some of the arm and leg stretches are unique and challenging also, and it feels like I'm starting to open up more, which feels refreshing.  I have upper back and neck issues and I think the arm workout is really helping with that because she focuses a lot on the shoulders.  There is not a lot of cardio yoga. This is mostly strength training and stretching - and stretching areas that traditional yoga doesn't always touch on.  Great for athletes and runners.  Also, there is not really any restorative/meditative yoga in this video, so seek that out separately for your traditional yoga routine for de-stressing.",1364860800,,895,4.662420382165605
4693516,5,B005GP7E9Y,"I love this DVD.  It's a series of challenging body weight exercises and yoga-based stretches & strength training moves.  It is not a power yoga flow.  I always do the whole DVD (it's split into three 20 minute segments working upper & lower body, then core) and feel like I got a great workout.",1356393600,,295,4.425925925925926
4693517,3,B005GP7E9Y,"I gave this 3 stars only because I'm a beginner-intermediate to yoga.  This is definately for the advanced.  She constantly transitions smoothly and very quickly from one pose to the other.  Never stopping to let you get into a correct pose or cach up; therefore, you can't do the poses correctly.  I miss half of the workout just trying to catch up to her.  For one of the segments of the video, you are in the plank positon for almost the whole 15 minutes.  If you are advanced, then buy this DVD because you'll get a great workout!",1354838400,,534,4.3979591836734695
4693518,5,B005GP7E9Y,"This yoga tape was tougher than I expected. Gwen Lawrence mentions 'my athletes' and I looked on the case, she coaches New York Giants and Yankees in Yoga! No wonder it is such a great workout!",1350172800,,193,4.388888888888889
4693519,1,B005GP7E9Y,like i did...the WORST DVD I have ever seen. I actually hurt my back. She is just awful. She talks too much and doesn't hold poses enough. this isn't yoga ...this is weird moves that your body will not like and hurt it.,1346284800,2,219,4.116279069767442
4693520,3,B005GP7E9Y,"This is not for beginners.  It's also not for people with wrist or hand problems.  She spends most of her time in positions that rest on her wrist (plank, side plank, downward dog,etc).  If you can't put much weight on your wrist when it's perpendicular to your arm, forget it.

I like her general style.  She's not soft and New-Agey, but she moves very quickly from one position to the next, without much holding.  The workout is more athletic-feeling than traditional hatha yoga.  You'll feel your muscles working much more than stretching.  And she calls out the poses as your head is down, so if you do not know what they are, it will take some time watching before you can really do the workout.

I actually found myself feeling stressed and annoyed during it, which is pretty much the opposite of what I want when I choose a yoga DVD over others.  I'm sure that if I were an advanced practitioner I would not have felt this way, but for a beginner she goes too fast, does not give you enough time to enjoy the pose and somehow makes yoga feel like a sports drill.",1339718400,7,1069,4.408163265306122
4693521,5,B005GP7E9Y,"I acknowledge that I'm no athlete. However, I do like rigorous, plyometric workouts with weight training. And in between those types of workouts, I've recently started doing yoga.

And Gwen Lawrence's Fit Body Yoga from Gaiam is just the workout I've been looking for. The disc has three 20-minute yoga segments that are a combination of yoga and strength training (think Jillian Michaels' Yoga Meltdown), as well as the unique aspect of preventative injury stretches. For more details on the DVD, see my review.

This distinctively designed yoga workout is a perfect match for me to keep from injuring myself during my other non-yoga workouts, which is an increasing concern for me as I hear and feel cracks, pops and stiffness I never before felt in my body.

Admittedly, I'm still a yoga newbie. So, I found Gwen's poses challenging, and some totally new to me, despite having watched numerous yoga DVDs over the years. I also found these new moves quite refreshing because I get tired of doing the same sun salutations and warrior poses over and over again.

I also liked that Lawrence is not your usual meditative Zen yogi. She doesn't talk in the slow, quiet manner most yoga instructors do, which personally I can find annoying sometimes. She talks as if she's just one of your girl friends in your living room instructing you. For someone like me, who took forever to warm up to yoga, this is my kind of practice.

It's important to note Lawrence's roster of clients includes the New York Giants, New York Knicks, New York Rangers and Alex Rodriguez. If those professional athletes trust her, surely I can too. And so far, my body is feeling great for it.

4693522,1,B005GP7E9Y,"I have a total of 7 yoga DVDs and I also have sportskool on demand which includes yoga segments. They are all the power, warrior and extreme yogas, are very challenging, and I rotate through them doing yoga four to five days a week. The Fit Body Yoga is not good for me at all.  It's extremely awkward with some strange movements throughout. I love moves that challenge my strength, stamina and balance, but the odd routines aren't that kind of a 'challenge.'  She talks nonstop and most if it is not about instruction, direction or guidance, it's just chit chat, and the movement sequences are extremely awkward. I found myself bored and disinterested throughout. While there are a couple of moves that I like and can incorporate with my yoga, I will never use this DVD again. It was a waste of my money and not for me.",1333065600,3,820,4.496644295302014
4693523,5,B005GP7E9Y,"I am a newbie to yoga, having only been doing it regularly for a couple of months.  However, in that time I've tried quite a few videos from the library and a few that I just purchased.  I picked this one up on a whim and it's a great addition to my home practice video collection.

My other favorite yoga video is a gentle workout that is awesome for stretching and for keeping my blood pressure low (I have high BP and use yoga as one way to keep it under control).  It is somewhat challenging in parts, but nothing too strenuous.

This DVD, on the other hand, definitely gives a much harder workout and some goals for me to work toward - there are some positions I had a hard time with and some that I flat out couldn't do.  Not because they are so twisty or difficult to achieve, but just because my body is out of condition or too tight.  I did all 3 workouts (upper body, lower body and core) together.  By the time I got to core, I couldn't do some of the moves because my arms and legs were so tired from the first two parts.  So from now on I will do the different sections on different days.

I did this workout yesterday - and my muscles are definitely letting me know today that they got a good workout!  Anyone who says yoga isn't a real workout hasn't done yoga like this!",1332115200,,1286,4.124497991967871
4693524,5,B005GP7E9Y,"Love this; makes a huge difference!
Very challenging and well thought-out. Motivating!
Gwen is an amazing teacher and so glad I found this DVD.",1331856000,,143,5.0
4693525,5,B005GP7E9Y,"My preferred workouts are on DVD and I alternate between Beachbody, Jackie Warner, Jillian Michaels and others.  I've wanted to add YOGA into my mix - but since I haven't taken many classes (yet) it's difficult to find a DVD that I can follow without my attention being glued to the television.  Fit Body Yoga fills that gap for me.  Gwen describes each move and after only doing the DVD a few times - I can follow along without watching her moves, allowing me to focus on my own movements.  The 20 minute chapters are the perfect addition to the end of my strength and cardio DVD workouts. It's a keeper.",1329696000,,605,4.423423423423423
4693526,4,B005GP7E9Y,"I'm a first time yoga person. I got the video because I read that it was challenging. I wanted a good workout that wasn't easy to do right away. This is exactly that. I still have struggle to do the entire workout, which I like. The only downside is that I'm not familiar with some of the moves and there isn't much instruction on proper form, etc. Otherwise, great challenging video. Maybe not for yoga virgins.",1329350400,,412,4.434210526315789
4693527,5,B005GP7E9Y,"Fit Body Yoga is probably the best yoga DVD I own. The thing that i like best about this DVD is that it is split up into three 20 minute workouts. Sometimes i only have time for 1 or 2 sections. Or sometimes i only want to work out a certain part of my body such as my abs. This DVD is great for that. The production, lighting and quality of the video are fantastic. Much better than all the other videos i have. I would definitely recommend this DVD to anyone!",1327449600,11,461,4.021739130434782
8472129,4,B005GP7E9Y,"I love this. Three 20-minute workouts--upper body, lower body and core.  You can do them separately or all together. I try to do at least two of them together to feel great. Not too challenging but just enough to feel good afterward.",1525392000,,233,4.5476190476190474
8472130,5,B005GP7E9Y,"Give it to my clients. I am a massage therapist and I give this to clients . It is only 20 minutes stretching for upper body,20 minutes for lower and 20 minutes for core strengthening! Anyone can do 20 minutes. You feel fantastic afterwards!",1490227200,,241,4.5

8472133,3,B005GP7E9Y,"I had high expectations for the DVD after all I read about Gwen Lawrence.  I think she is very likable, has an impressive Yoga background and/or portfolio, and seems passionate about her Yoga practice.  Also, she is easy to listen to while she guides you through these workouts.  However, after doing the workouts on this DVD once, I never went back to it.  I have been experimenting with yoga DVDs and instructors, and have tried Colleen Saidman, Tara Stiles and a few other samples I found on YouTube.  I then tried a Jillian Michaels yoga workout, and came to realize that I gravitate towards the more ""power"" style yoga.  That being said,  I think that Gwen Lawrence would work for other folks, it was just not a fit for me.",1434931200,,728,4.553846153846154
8472134,3,B005GP7E9Y,I like the moves and the routines -don't like the instructor. There is something about her voice (kind of whiny and sarcastic?) and her style that doesn't work for me.

I felt like she was a personal trainer (which she tells you about several times) who took a few yoga classes and then decided to make a dvd. There is no flow to her routines and a lot of the moves are more 'workout-y' instead of actual yoga, if that makes sense. Some of the moves were challenging but I know I won't be able to hear her same jokes about hand cream and 'when I train my athletes' several times a week, so I gave this a new home.",1419379200,2,512,3.794392523364486
