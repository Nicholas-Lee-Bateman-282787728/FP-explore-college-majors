The battles are covered yet very little if much actual battlefields are to be seen. There is a discussion of the the battles which sum them up but for me seemed somewhat boring.  Nothing such as seen on Ken Burn's Civil War.

I bought them at Ollies and got pretty much what I expected. Though the set comes in a very nice metal embossed case, well presented, I would advise getting something better.",1523318400,,673,4.7844827586206895
8411356,1,B003ZZ7TNI,"I have the DVD version, too. The Blu ray is just as bad; 4:3 and only Dolby Digital 2.0. Simply transferred to Blu ray with no Hi Def mastering whatsoever!!! Don't buy ANY version!!!",1363219200,5,182,4.382352941176471
8411357,5,B003ZZ7TNI,"I don't know what set the other reviewers were watching, but this is a fine treatment of the battles of the Civil War that Ken Burns Civil War documentary doesn't cover in depth. I liked the commentary from the various historians and the reactments showed just how smokey a battlefield can become very quickly. I've watched the whole set many times. Highly recommended!!",1348531200,,370,4.888888888888889
8411358,1,B003ZZ7TNI,"A 4-DVD set for $9.98.  Sounds like a bargain you say? NOT!  This series has been released in single DVD form previously, and I can tell you THEY ARE BAD! There are some quality documentaries/films about the Civil War but these are NOT it.  You have been warned!",1263340800,23,262,4.416666666666667
8411359,1,B003ZZ7TNI,"On first glance, this 4 1/2 hour series is about Civil War battlefields. When you watch it though, you discover that the company recycles the same blurred out ""artsy"" video clips in every single video and throws in choppy simulations of silent films that, upon first glance, appear to be scenes from ""Birth of a Nation."" They aren't.  It is just as well that it's blurred because it covers up some of the defects of this low scale fiasco. The company is based in Eugene, Oregon, and it seems doubtful that they ever left that state even to take reenactment footage. A blurred out clip of Burnsides Bridge was used for both Manassas, Sharpsburg and Fredericksburg. I was expecting an in depth discussion of each battlefield with full colored realistic reenactment footage. If you are looking for quality and scholarship, you won't find it in this one.",978566400,30,850,4.782312925170068
