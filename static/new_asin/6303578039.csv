701604,3,6303578039,"This is a very silly movie, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. I can't believe how young Goldie Hawn looks - she can't be older than 21 in it - and Peter Sellers is great as this total dork whom women for some reason find attractive. I just enjoyed watching him play this sort of fellow. And, it has him in that famous ""I won't shush!"" clip -- the one in Sony's pre-movie film collage their theaters played in the early 1990s before each film.",999216000,4,437,4.214285714285714
701605,5,6303578039,"Robert Danvers, played by the zany Peter Sellers, is a smooth talking, jet  setting, womanizing television chef who heats up more than just dinner.  This chef's got a menu that's off the charts. There is one problem: he  can't seem to keep his dinner down. Chewing them up and spitting them out  is his culinary masterpiece. That's until an unlikely doe-eyed waif of a  girl young enough to be his daughter steps up. Marion, played by Goldie  Hawn, is one outta sight chick who is not afraid to send her meal back.  After being flung around by some youngsters it's time for Marion to play  with the big boys . . . and boy does she do just that. Just wait till the  ending; it will leave you savoring for more. Did I mention the catchy tune  that will be in your head for days to follow. Hmmmm. . . . I wonder if I  can get Roger to find out who sings it?",969235200,11,854,4.146341463414634
701606,3,6303578039,"""There's a Girl in My Soup"" is an offbeat romantic-comedy with Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn in top form.  Sellers' portrayal of vain, egocentric TV gourmand Robert Danvers is an incisive takeoff on Graham Kerr. This Boulting production received some  savage reviews which, in retrospect, seem unwarranted.  It was one of  Sellers' better efforts during a particularly lean creative period and his chemistry with Hawn is strong - one wishes they had teamed up for another film.",944179200,20,477,5.1558441558441555
701943,5,6303578039,"One of the few movies from the 60s that well captures the era without being cloyingly self-conscious about it (e.g., DIG that long hair, CRAZY music and free love, man, aren't we SOMETHING).  There aren't that many romantic comedies from the late 60s that aren't now dated (at the moment only&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-New-Leaf/dp/B007R2MJXK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A New Leaf</a>&nbsp;comes to mind, as fresh today as it was 45 years ago).  There's A Girl In My Soup demonstrates the 60s ""anything goes"" mentality without glorifying it, it just IS, and interestingly, looks at it from the perspective of both a young woman and an older man.

A light, effervescent comedy full of gorgeous scenery (mod London, the French countryside) and eye candy (the clothes, the fantastic Peter Max-ish art, Eames Era furnishings), with many clever lines and insightful though subtle observations about maturity and immaturity, attraction, and navigating the murky waters of relations between the sexes.  Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn are each inimitable and at their charming best, and the chemistry between them is potent.  In a nutshell, it's about the common ground two seemingly dissimilar people find, and what they learn from each other.  I love it, and watch it every year or two, a staple of my video library.

BTW, should you wonder at the import of Sellers' cryptic line ""I'm not THAT kind of curious!"", it's a sly pop-culture reference to the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Am-Curious-Yellow/dp/B00007L4I8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Am Curious Yellow</a>, a SENSATION at the time (and another film that's aged very well).  And Sellers is being disingenuous, that's precisely where his interests lie.

""My GOD but your lovely..."" Sellers sighs.  If you too find Hawn adorable, irresistible, you may also like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Butterflies-Are-Free/dp/B003QFPMAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Butterflies Are Free</a>.  Another of my favorites from the same era is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hoffman/dp/B00007AJE8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hoffman</a>, also with Peter Sellers, but playing the polar opposite of man of the world Robert Danvers- a shy, lonely loser (a marvelous movie).  Personally, I much preferred There's A Girl In My Soup to Hawn's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cactus-Flower/dp/B001NEI8X8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cactus Flower</a>&nbsp;(for which she won an Oscar)- it's a better, less contrived film.  The end is surprising, yet satisfying, and... fitting.  A sexy, romantic, escapist romp and a fine way to spend a couple of hours- heartily recommended!

***Let me add a big grumble- Amazon's product descriptions for this movie SUCK.  The first one, a negative critical review, says it's no good (baloney!), the second one, the actual description, gives away the plot and part of the ending!  Who selects/writes these things???  If like me, you thrive on surprise and discovery in watching films, you may find yourself skipping both Amazon's product (and especially, instant video) descriptions, AND reviews, since many reviewers detail plots and endings without bothering to provide a spoiler alert.  I HATE that.",1408752000,,3393,6.336956521739131
701944,4,6303578039,"A real sleeper. I had expected a deadly ""cute"" frolic typical of the era, but the movie is charming, unpredictable and anything but cliched. I couldn't have imagined there'd be any chemistry between Sellers and Hawn, but there is, and it's delightful. It's not necessary to brace yourself for a pat ending -- it isn't there. Hollywood took a holiday on this one.",1334707200,,362,4.761904761904762
701945,5,6303578039,"This film is one of the top ten Wine and Food Lover's films of all time, especially if you're a wine-lover, since there are so few good wine movies out there! It's a classic! Goldie is great as Marian, the young girl who goes on a wine tasting trip to the Loire Valley in France with British ""food critic/playboy"" Robert Danvers, played by the suave Peter Sellers (they should've shaved his back first--that was not very appetizing nor was it very sexy!) Instead of tasting, she drinks it all--""Why waste it?"" she says. Only to get so drunk, she knocks over an entire wall of wine while standing in a wine cave and poor Peter Sellers has to pay for it all. Hilarity at its finest! I love this movie, I've always loved this movie and I can't wait to get a DVD copy of it.",1266364800,2,770,4.280821917808219
701946,2,6303578039,"Good acting but uninteresting story. Not much happens and its very talky. Judging from the cover and the casting I expected a fun comedy but ""There's a Girl in My Soup"" feels more of an uninspired drama-comedy, with very few funny moments (I can only think of one, and I just finished watching it). The acting is good, as expected from Hawn and Sellers, but their talents are wasted. Not recommended.",1215820800,,400,4.647887323943662
701947,3,6303578039,"Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn in a romantic comedy?  While you may think the partnership might fall flat, THERE'S A GIRL IN MY SOUP presents the two talented comic actors in a fun love story, playing mismatched May-December lovers.

Based on a long-running London play, Peter Sellers plays Robert Danvers, successful TV cooking host and serial womaniser, who meets his match in free-spirited hippie chick Marion (Goldie Hawn) when she stays the night in his swanky apartment.  Marion dumps her cheating boyfriend (Nicky Henson) to accompany Robert on a trip to Paris where, despite Robert's best efforts to stop it, love begins to bloom for the determined bachelor...

THERE'S A GIRL IN MY SOUP (1970) was typical fare from director Roy Boulting and producer John Boulting, who specialised in low-brow sex comedies.  Generally panned by most critics, the film was a mild box-office hit, buoyed by the star power of Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn, who had just won the Academy Award for her performance in ""Cactus Flower"".  Co-stars include familiar British faces like Tony Britton, Gabrielle Drake, Nicola Pagett, and Thorley Walters, plus a ""special appearance"" from Diana Dors.

Fun, uncomplicated romantic comedy nonsense.  The DVD includes both widescreen and full-frame versions of the movie.  (Single-sided, dual-layer disc).",1214179200,2,1330,5.3253588516746415
701948,1,6303578039,"Peter Sellers is rightly hailed as one of the screen's great comic geniuses. Unfortunately, even a genius falters, and Sellers had more than his share of misfires. In fact, when a Peter Sellers movie is bad, it goes far beyond the usual definition of the term. This 1970 sex farce is one of his worst, which means it's unmitigated garbage.

Sellers plays a middle-aged lothario who meets his match in a free-spirited young kook (Goldie Hawn, in her second starring film role), and before long, they're off on a series of wacky romantic adventures. Nothing seems more dated than this sort of '70s ""mod"" comedy, and nothing seems more wasteful than an actor of Sellers' stature wallowing in material clearly beneath him. Sellers and Hawn never click as a screen couple; he comes across too smarmy and she comes across too flighty to even be a likable pair.",1132272000,2,854,4.77027027027027
701949,4,6303578039,This is a terrifically engaging May-December romance picture about a middle aged lothario (Peter Sellers) who begins to question his value system when he embarks on an affair with an outspoken hippie chick(Goldie Hawn) in swinging London.  Sellers and Hawn are wonderful together and there is a discernible screen chemistry between them.  My only qualm with the film is that it's central message throughout is to extol the virtues of romance and fidelity but the ending negates that for one of promiscuity.,1130284800,4,506,5.158536585365853
