729483,4,6303912656,"For an afternoon of sunny nostalgia, you can't do much better than THE DOLLY SISTERS, featuring the fabulous talents of Betty Grable and June Haver.

Loosely-based on fact, the story follows the loves and fortunes of the Dolly Sisters, Jenny (Betty Grable) and Rosie (June Haver), from small-time Budapest emigrees to the bright lights of Broadway and international fame.  Along the way, Jenny falls in love with handsome composer Harry Fox (John Payne), but quickly realises that any relationship is fated to come second-place to her career.

John Payne and Betty Grable were frequent co-stars in many musicals for Twentieth Century-Fox, but THE DOLLY SISTERS is their greatest pairing by far.  Grable also has a great screen rapport with June Haver (Alice Faye was to have been her initial co-star, but she decided instead to retire from the screen--ironically in part because Grable had superseded her as the reigning star of the studio).

There are several musical numbers which take full advantage of the richly-saturated Technicolor photography: ""The Vamp"", ""We Have Been Around"", ""Carolina in the Morning"", ""Powder, Lipstick and Rouge"", ""Sidewalks of New York""; and, for all it's non-PC attitudes, ""The Darktown Strutters Ball"".

A very entertaining bit of fluff.",1177718400,6,1270,5.293532338308458
729484,1,6303912656,"After enjoying the wonderfully restored Down Argentine Way and Moon Over Miami, I was prepared for pretty much the same formula. Alas, this turgid tale of sisterly bonds versus marriage vows drags and insults the intelligence. Nobody watches this stuff for the plot, but somebody thought the plot meant something here, so the songs, dances and costumes get draped over it, whether they fit or not.  The vaudeville numbers are unremarkable and the rainbow song gets oh-so-tedious with repetition. By the time this movie was made in 1945, blackface was out, but it gets  thrown back at us in the name of history. The only thing worth remembering about this mess are the Ziegfield numbers.",1168646400,4,686,4.956521739130435
729485,4,6303912656,"Its no secret that Twentieth Century Fox stuck to proven formulas when it came to movie musicals and ""The Dolly Sisters"" pretty much recycles every element of their previous box-office hits: sexy singing blondes (charming pin-up girl Betty Grable and the pretty but lame June Haver), eye-popping Technicolor, a backstage love affair between a talented showgirl and a less successful musician, attractive but bland leading man (John Payne), a love song that gets repeated over and over again (""I'm Always Chasing Rainbows""), lavish but only so-so musical numbers, etc.  If this is what you like, you'll really enjoy this movie, since Fox musicals, though formulaic, were the best of their kind.  If you don't, the film will seems endless.

Despite the biopic title, the film is essentially ""Tin Pan Alley"" (the superior 1940 black-and-white film that famously featured Fox's top musical leading ladies Alice Faye and Betty Grable together for the first and only time) in Technicolor, with Betty Grable taking over the Alice Faye role as the long suffering girlfriend/wife.  Betty Grable does an okay job with the ""dramatic"" scenes, but she is clearly in Alice Faye territory. (Alice Faye smartly turned down this movie to do the excellent film noir ""Fallen Angel."")  Grable was really in her element when she played lively, sassy girls, as in ""Down Argentine Way"" or ""Moon Over Miami,"" so this role isn't the finest showcase for her talents. Still, Grable's as charming as ever, and she looks great in all her Technicolor glory on the excellent DVD transfer.",1153180800,7,1557,5.090196078431372
729486,3,6303912656,"...""Wabash Avenue"", ""Sweet Rosie O'Grady"", ""Diamond Horseshoe"", ""Mother Wore Tights"", and ""Springtime in the Rockies""?  All of these are also classic Grable musicals that are today very, very difficult to find unless you're fortunate enough to be watching a TV channel that shows one of them on the late-night show.  Anyway, this movie is visually dazzling with numerous production numbers and lots of great costumes (though some may well raise their eyebrows at the Harlem-themed number about halfway through the film).",1152403200,2,520,5.407407407407407
729487,5,6303912656,"I still remember begging my sisters to take me with them to see The Dolly Sisters when I was a little girl in Dallas Texas. They finally took me, probably because Mama made them. I always loved musicals and Betty Grable was my favorite. I wish they'd bring Sweet Rosie O'Grady to DVD also. I don't believe that one has even been on VHS. The Dolly Sisters is my all time favorite 40s musical.",1149897600,3,391,4.297297297297297
729488,3,6303912656,"Take the Alice Faye Plot No 1, the roots of which go back to 1938's ""Alexanders Ragtime Band"". A few years had passed since it was last aired so now it is Betty Grable's turn. Alice Faye declined to appear with Grable so add June Haver, moving wallpaper, instead as a variation just as Grable was to Faye's ""Tin Pan Alley"". Include John Payne, as lugubrious as ever. Finally, remove any semblance of wit and topicality. Any resemblance to the real Dolly Sisters is purely co-incidental.

While this film was a box office smash in 1945, it was generally a critical bomb because it rehashed so many of the cliches which Fox filmed endlessly. This is the sort of film which gives Fox musicals a bad reputation because it is SO boring. It really is a pity that the script is so predictable because Grable shows real warmth and sincerity in her ""dramatic"" scenes.

Although the production values are outstanding, the musical numbers are pretty awful too, particularly the production numbers. The dancing is mostly showgirl strutting, the costumes are garish and ugly and everything is laid on with a trowel - absolutely no subtlety. The best song is ""I Can't Begin to Tell You"" which happens to be the only song which Grable recorded commercially during her whole career but neither her nor John Payne's voices are really strong enough to carry it.

The DVD print is generally excellent preserving the bright colour for which Fox was famous. There is also a detailed commentary from Drew Casper. Casper has a breathless repetitive delivery which is tiresome but he knows his stuff and there is a wealth of background information here.

If you are indifferent to the charms of Betty Grable, this film is a pretty hard slog. The early much livelier Grable musicals (""Moon over Miami"", ""Springtime in the Rockies"" etc) are more entertaining, if only because they have witty scripts and move at breakneck speed.",1145318400,,1902,4.807339449541284
729489,5,6303912656,"The Dolly Sisters (1945) may be a big, sappy, Technicolor musical, loosely based on the life and loves of the International stars, Rosie and Jennie Dolly, but it is one of my favorite Betty Grable movies. It is filled with eye-popping musical numbers and has a great score including, ""I Can't Begin To Tell You"", ""I'm Always Chasing Rainbows"", ""Carolina In The Morning"" and ""Darktown Strutter's Ball"". John Payne, June Haver and S.Z. ""Cuddles"" Sakall co-star in this highly entertaining musical from 20th Century Fox.",1142294400,15,517,5.094117647058823

729491,5,6303912656,"The opening scene with turn of the century New York, the 2 little girls playing the Dolly sisters as youngsters breaking into an ""impromptu"" dance in the Hungarian cafe, dancing to Gypsy music, the cut to the adult June Haver and Betty Grable doing the same thing in more filled out peasant dresses and showing a lot of ""million dollar legs""...Not too many actesses would want to be in an immediate comparison for cuteness with pretty little blond girls, but these two carry it off flawlessly.
The other songs, the scenes in Paris, the story of the romance with John Payne, how they showed the conflict (albiet a bit corny, but believable) of how both of them wanted to assert their individuality and still be together...
This is one of the best musicals I've ever seen. Family values and an adult story tastefully done.
In the ""forgotten"" old musicals category, I'd also recommend The Perils of Pauline with Betty Hutton, Cover Girl with Gene Kelly and Rita Hayworth.",1044576000,8,968,4.767857142857143
729492,5,6303912656,"The dangerous casting of established Betty Grable with newcomer June Haver set columnists hearts beating wildly when Fox produced this nostalgic musical. No need to worry. Betty and June performed delightfully in this  highly fictionalised biopic of the fame Dolly's. It is almost a rerun of  'Tin Pan Alley' in Technicolor! Fantastic production numbers - especially  the 'Darktown Strutters Ball' - elevated this musical into the top class of  the genre. Grable and Haver, practically lookalikes, played their parts to  perfection. Grable showed some nice dramatic touches in her romantic  scenes with the darkly handsome John Payne in this cavalcade of music which  encompassed World War One. Trivia note: Noel Coward, on viewing the film,  said: ""It's all done by mirrors. No girl on this earth could look like  Betty Grable!"" but June Haver more than held her own alongside her  well-seasoned 'sister.'

730049,3,6303912656,"20th Century Fox had an impressive track record with musicals during the 1930s and 1940s, turning out one box office smash after another--but for all their great popularity at the time they were not usually liked by the critics and most film historians tend to be dismissive of them even to this day.  There is a reason for that: although they were well designed and well crafted, they were seldom innovative and they existed as star vehicles plain and simple, flyweight creations shot through with lots of American boosterism and jingoism and designed to show off a female star.  And in the 1940s that star was Betty Grable.

Grable (1916-1973) knocked around Hollywood for a decade without gaining much attention--but after a stint on Broadway led to the popular 1940 movie DOWN ARGENTINE WAY she was suddenly 20th Century Fox's hottest property.  It seems unlikely: she wasn't classically pretty, had a pleasant but not outstanding voice, and was a good rather than excellent dancer--and her acting chops were very limited.  But she had that sparkle that can only be described as ""star quality,"" and the public adored her.  She became the single most bankable motion picture star of the 1940s.

The 1945 THE DOLLY SISTERS is typical of 20th Century Fox musicals.  The story and script are merely serviceable; the production values are expert rather than innovative; the music and choreography are pleasant but not inspired.  But absolutely everything about the film works to show case Grable at every possible turn.  Everything revolves around the star from start to finish, and although she shares the screen with either June Haver or John Payne in every musical number, neither of them even come close to the status of co-stars.  There is only one star in this movie, at that is Betty Grable.  Everyone else is merely there for support.

The musical numbers are fun, but this is partly due to the way we look at them today as opposed to how they were received by audiences in 1945; seen today the two major production numbers, ""Old Fashioned Girl"" and ""The Darktown Strutters Ball,"" are nothing short of screaming high camp, the former featuring a vanity case come to life and the latter a truly jaw-dropping minstrel show with showgirls in blackface and some of the most ""do what?"" costumes imaginable.  Brace yourself for the girl with the watermelon muff and the woman with a stuffed cat on her head!

The musical numbers are fun, and when they come onto the stage the rather prefunctory lighting suddenly surges into brillance, setting off the wild array of color and shape to absolute perfection.  But in truth, the musical numbers are only reason to watch THE DOLLY SISTERS, which is so incredibly flyweight that most viewers will find it hard to supress a yawn during the film's so-called ""dramatic"" moments.  The DVD offers a very handsome print of the film, and a few extras--most notably an audio commentary by Drew Casper, whose comments are entertaining if a shade too uncritical for complete acceptance.  Yes, I do recommend the movie, but only for 1940s musical fans and Grable fans in particular.

730051,4,6303912656,"Essentially a lavish technicolor remake of the B&W 1940 film ""Tin Pan Alley"", including 2 of the stars of the original: John Payne and Betty Grable. Both films have their relative pluses and minuses.  I enjoyed the many outlandish costumes of the female stars and various extras, a common feature of many 1940s musicals. Grable and Haver are much more of a sister act than Alice Faye and Grable were in the original, where they mostly performed their own numbers. The troubled on again off again romances in the present film, which fill in between the musical shows, get awfully tedious, more so than in the original. If Alice Faye had taken the part of June Haver, as originally planned, it would have been interesting to see if she were again cast as the dominant sister(I doubt it). To me, Faye has more charisma than Haver, but the latter makes a more look alike sister for Grable. I really missed Jack Oakie in this one. Frank Latimore was simply not an adequate substitute for Oakie's  cheerful comic relief from Payne's serious demeanor. Payne's character is much more of a heel than in the original. That poor gorgeous woman he led on to believe he cared more for than Grable, left alone in the audience in the  final scene, when he was reunited with Grable on the stage!",1191628800,4,1279,4.6255506607929515
