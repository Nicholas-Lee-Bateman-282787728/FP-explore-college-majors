280922,2,6300262294,"A poor quality re-release of the Roger Corman B-movie, ""Love Letters"". Either this version has been extensively edited or the legendary nude scenes have been vastly overrated. Not particularly interesting or erotic. The only good thing I can say is: I'm glad I bought the used VHS, rather than the expensive DVD.",1236470400,7,312,5.019230769230769

Jamie Lee Curtis' character believes that to concede to overwhelming passion as a threshold to true love, and have a physical relationship with a married man, is human, after all. She has a ""friend"" played by Amy Madigan, the ultimate vicarious ""coach"" who does everything *not* to dissuade her.
I have never seen Curtis act better than in this ""oddball"" flick that I assume is now in a well-deserved ""Cult"" status. She is both aggressive and vulnerable; at the end of the movie when it all comes crashing down she is especially impressive. Sally Kirkland plays the wife of James Keach and in a stunning scene shows great compassion for the young woman left trembling in the dark, at their doorway.
This movie might stir memories of movies like ""Bodyheat"", or any number of ""film noir""(s) of the '40s, although it can stand comfortably on its' own.",1193356800,7,892,4.9072847682119205
280924,1,6300262294,"anyone who thinks this is a good transfer must be daft.  in addition as was mentioned earlier 11 minutes have been cut and as i remember the film they were some of the ""best"" scenes if you get my drift.  if you want to see the original film this is not it.  avoid at all costs.",1122422400,40,277,3.9107142857142856
280925,3,6300262294,"""Love Letters"", starring Golden Globe nominee Jamie Lee Curtis, is an unforgettable love story.  It desplicts a young DJ (played by Curtis) who loses her mother to cancer.  After her mother's death, she finds some old love letters that contained material she least expected.  All were written by a man whom her mother had an affair with in the 1960's.  Suddenly, she meets a man with whom she almost instantly falls in love.  However, he's married.  This forbidden love story leads to a passionate, yet highly emotional film.

While the plot is highly interesting, it often moves too slow.  Besides, it has some great scenes; yet, it has some unnecessary scenes.  The unnecessary storylines, which do not relate to the overall film theme, often distract from the main theme.  However, the romance and sex scenes are as enticing as they should be.  They give this film the added rapture that stays interesting.  The intensity places itself in areas that keep this film suspenseful.  Sometimes, those scenes were placed in the unnecessary ones.  Every interesting aspect contains its own spice that never fades through multiple viewings.

The best aspect of ""Love Letters"" is Jamie Lee Curtis's performance.  Though all actors in this film perform well, she gives this film the added individual emotion thoughout.  She even gives the slow moving scenes the added glare.  After being hailed as a ""horror movie queen"", she proves that she's mastered the art of hardcore drama.

""Love Letters"" will have mixed reactions, but it'll surely be remembered for a long time afterwards.  Every fan of Curtis should own this film.",1097971200,10,1617,5.030188679245283
280926,1,6300262294,"This version is eleven minutes shorter than the orginal version based on the information printed on the DVD and listed in the IMDb.  I saw this film a long time ago and was looking forward to seeing it again, but was amazed at how much they had cut out of the movie.  The DVD packaging does not state that it is an edited version nor does the information provided by Amazon.  They made it a totaly different movie with the editing that was done.  I do not recommend this version to anyone.  The orginal movie deserves better than this chop job.",1096675200,67,544,4.346534653465347
280927,5,6300262294,The best movie Jamie ever made. Also the best movie to see her gorgeous body in her prime. The story of her character having sex with a married man and ending up falling in love. This is a must have for Jamie fans. They did a great job with transferring the print to DVD. Also this film came out 1983 not 1984.,1060128000,10,310,4.016129032258065
280928,5,6300262294,"OK, using my own type of mathematics, this still averages out to a '5' rating.  ...
Um, I'm not really sure what this movie is about, actually.  The love letters of the title are letters that the mother of Jamie's character had sent to HER lover over a number of year.  These letters are full of angst and remorse over her inability to leave her husband and just let herself go to her lover.
Jamie has been looking for this kind of burning love herself but had never found it.  So she decides to begin an affair with a married man in an attempt to recreate the same level of passion that she is reading about in her mother's letters.  Unfortunately, she chooses this wimpy guy played by oh, I don't know, some forgettable actor.
But none of that matters, anyway...",996105600,12,764,4.390070921985815

7807554,5,6300262294,"Okay guys just for your information, there is no original version on DVD or VHS as they as you already know are edited versions and probably due to the time it was made, was pretty racy , the powers to be decided to cut that part out. DVDs were not even here then until early 87 or thereabouts. But what was here then was the Laser Disc format and had a few great years of fame before the age of the DVD arrived. It was in that space of time that this movie in its original 98 minute version came out and yes, you guessed it---- on Laser Disc. It is indeed the whole 9 yards and is not cut or edited in any way. In other words she's all there in great form and beauty if you know what I mean. But good luck in finding that Laser Disc version and because I am 75 now and have always been into the Audio/Video industry ,I was also into LDs big time and am still a big fan of Jamie Lee Curtis so I have it in my collection of about 60 LDs. And no I am not selling it. Why they cut that 11 minutes out I will never know ----the R rated movies are a lot racier if you know what I mean today and then some. And by the way the edited versions are rated PG ----I find that rather amusing.",1364342400,3,1180,3.8401639344262297

7807557,3,6300262294,"Yes, I'm the fool who keeps ordering VHS copies of ""Love Letters"" from three different manufacturers. I keep thinking I'll stumble across an unrated, unexpurgated version that  shows all of Ms. Curtis's attributes (like I saw in the movie theater), but, alas, no matter how they describe their products, you pop them in and lo-and-behold you find that they are missing the ten crucial minutes that makes the unrated version a ""collectible"". I have to say this  version by New Concorde  uses some inventive advertising.  The box admits its the dreaded 84 minutes again, while the label on the cassette itself boldly claims to be 94 minutes. Wow, you get an extra ten minutes of the good stuff, right? Well yes, at least if  by the ""good stuff"" is  meant the inclusion of an innocuous trailer,  the blank part of the tape that leads to the trailer, and the black part of tape seen after the credits.  94 minutes of tease and no payoff! Fooled again. So you are thinking why not go and buy the DVD, fool. This fool did. Even though the DVD is a better transfer of the film  it still does not include  the good stuff. Oh well, maybe the lesson was learned this time around. Anyone wanna buy four VHS tapes of the movie ""Love Letters""? How about buy three and get one free? No takers - then how about buy two and get two free? No - well how about buy one and get three free? Didn't think so...",1331337600,10,1388,4.407843137254902
7807558,3,6300262294,"Sometimes you watch a movie because of a good story line, and ""Love Letters"" has a good story line. Other times you want to see a woman with an extraordinary body naked, like Jaime Lee Curtis, for example. If you are a member of the last department, seek out the (very rare) full-length version on VHS that was the theatrical cut. This one is chopped up. Just when things get interesting in the bedroom major portions of the scenes disappear",1325203200,3,441,4.525
7807559,3,6300262294,"This movie is a little bit hard to get as it is no longer manufactured. Amazon.com has a list of sellers who own a copy. They're a little pricey but if you are a Jamie Lee Curtis fan this movie probably should be part of your collection. In this movie Jamie plays a DJ with an ailing mother. Her father seems a caring husband as he spends his time by his wifes bedside. It is after tne mother/wife dies that things begin to happen. The relationship between daughter and father spins quickly out control when the father takes to drinking to ease his pain. The father becomes abusive when drunk. The daughter (Jamie) finds some relief of sorrow by going through her mother's things. Here lies a great supprise. A package of letters hidden away revealing that her mother had a lover. Some how this revelation stirs a hunger in the daughter to pursue a similiar course. Enter James Keach. A photographer of some renoun Jamie's character is not only familiar with him and his work but is quite excited that she might meet him. Meet him she does and an affair developes. James character is up front with her in stating that he had nothing to offer her and she accepts those terms in the beginning. But, as the affair continues she finds she needs more. She becomes irrational in her quest of love even allowing a great job opportunity to slip through her grasp. All hope is placed in this affair. Everything blows up in a scene outside of James character's house where his wife and child can see. The real redeeming quality of the movie comes in the end where a time of healing is presented when Jamie's character meets her mother's lover.
  This is only one of two movies that I know of where Jamie does a couple of nude scenes.
  There doesn't seem to be much care in the quality of the lighting while filming. This was my biggest gripe.",1240790400,7,1833,4.462686567164179
