4061628,4,B0032KC36Y,"I had the wonderful experience of visiting Machu Picchu - the lost city of the Incas - in 1980 and it was - along with seeing the Great Wall of China - one of the most breathtaking sights I've ever seen. Since then, I've been fascinated by this ""hidden city"" from the 16th Century discovered by explorer Hiram Bingham in 1912. There have been a few documentaries made but they tend to be more of a travelogue. This show is different.

Produced by PBS as part of its NOVA science series - it is really a co-production of National Geographic magazine (which first published Bingham's own story in 1915). This not only gives it creditability but some entertainment value too. (National Geographic's own specials are always well done.). There are a few interviews with scientists and researchers as well as some ""recreations"" (which, personally I found distracting and the reason for four stars, rather than five.) but mostly it is beautiful camera work showing, not only Machu Picchu from every angle, but the neighboring cities.

There is also NEWS here. The researcher who analyses bones has been able to determine the sex of the bodies found at the site as well as the level in society. These were ""middle class people.. They don't have all the answers yet but there are new discoveries revealed here. The film runs about 54 minutes and so it doesn't go in to the depth it could but it will hold your attention.

If you already know about Machu Picchu, you will learn more. If you don't, you'll probably find yourself calling a travel agent after watching this, wanting to see this amazing place in person!

4061629,4,B0032KC36Y,"Years ago, I saw a doc on Machu Picchu (hereinafter ""MP"") and it was dull.  It only spoke of the stone structure and not the people and culture who made it.  Stonehenge is impressive as it shows human ingenuity and how it spans the millennia.  However, it's also just some rocks.  Some docs on MP discuss it in that same dull matter.  This work breaks that unfortunate pattern.

This work spoke about skeletons found, how Incan descendants have blended pre-Colombian and Christian practices, irrigation, etc.  MP is not just some stones; this work shows that it has an elaborate system to deal with all the rain in that high region.  It speaks of how a culture without the wheel, iron, or writing could make such a fantastic site.  It discusses why the conquistadores never found MP.

This work has a blend of experts interviewed: Latino and Anglo; male and female.  There are reenactments here, but they are well-done, rather than cheesy.  I think parents who have children that love ""The Emperoro's New Groove"" may want to show this to their young ones for educational purposes.  Some anthropologists have lamented that their field is dismissed as ""just stones and bones.""  This doc really brought a ""dead"" subject to life.",1267574400,14,1225,4.826923076923077
4061660,5,B0032KC36Y,PRESENTED IN A SPANISH THREE CLASS.  IT CONNECTED TO A CHAPTER ON MACHU PICCHU.  IT WAS VERY WELL PRESENTED AND IT HELPED TO ENHANCE THE THEME.,1399420800,,143,4.461538461538462
4061661,5,B0032KC36Y,"we love to see history & to be able to go to these places to see what once was

4061662,5,B0032KC36Y,"I visited Machu Picchu earlier this year for the first time ever, and prepared myself by reading the recently published ""Turn Right at Machu Picchu"" as well as Hiram Bingham's book, ""Lost City of the Incas"". I also watched a couple of other documentaries.

The ""Ghosts of Machu Picchu"" brings it all together in a useful and succinct manner. Local historians and archaeologists as well as academics from the U.S. who were interviewed for the documentary continue to study the site and surrounding area to determine why the city was built on the top of the mountain and why it survived the Spanish conquest virtually intact. Advancements in the tools of bone analysis have allowed the scientists to debunk some of Bingham's original theories and to conclude that the site was a retreat for the Inca Ruler, Pachacutec, and that most of the inhabitants were there to serve the ruler. They believe that the site was abandoned some time after Pachacutec was defeated by the Spaniards, and that the conquerors never knew of its existence; thus it was left to grow over with vegetation and fade from memory without being destroyed.

The photography of the site is spectacular, and the documentary includes information on the Incan stonework and architecture, as well as the intricate system of terraces and fountains that survive to this day on the mountain top. Whether you're planning a trip to Machu Picchu or want a refresher of the marvels to be seen there, this documentary will satisfy your curiosity.",1380758400,2,1501,4.928853754940712
4061663,4,B0032KC36Y,"Generally, PBS puts out some good DVD's but, this one is only average. Since I have no plans to visit Peru anytime soon and the main tourist attention is Machu Picchu this is a good alternative.
There is only 60 minutes of film, which is not enough time to really get into the subject matter. I think it should have longer with more information on the work being done to restore the place and any new discoveries.",1351296000,,413,4.376623376623376
4061664,4,B0032KC36Y,"I enjoyed the ""Ghosts of Machu Picchu"" and would recommend it to those interested in that topic.
The great mystery, of course, is how so much was accomplished, so precisely, with so little knowledge and such rudimentary tools.
I am always left wishing to know and understand more.",1330819200,2,280,4.854166666666667
4061665,5,B0032KC36Y,"I found this documentary to be an excellent introduction to the subject of Machu Picchu and the social structure of the Inca Empire.  What particularly impressed me was how the structure of the documentary was set up in such a way that it modeled the process of scientific inquiry: hypothesis, information gathering, and proposed results.  It didn't just tell the viewer the ""facts"" of the site but positioned him or her as a scholar testing the the ways that the site been interpreted over the years.  I think this would be a good documentary to show a class, as they would get both the information and experience the process of creating and testing information.  The music is somewhat History Channel, but I suspect PBS has to do things like that or people won't watch.  Pedagogically, it still strikes me as a useful documentary.",1308787200,10,832,4.79020979020979
4061666,5,B0032KC36Y,"This is a fascinating armchair tour of this ancient city high in the mountain in South America with a deep  historic and archaeological analysis of the structure, design and building.

This new world wonder helped us understand and appreciate the wisdom of Inca people who used their brain and hand to labor this massive precise structure.  I cannot help admire their ability and knowledge in mechanical, civil and management engineering without a college degree.  Did these ancient people offer a systematic approach in making a strong stone shelter with convenience and comfort in fung shui design?  The smart terrace structure creates harmony in nature, human and land without the worry of landslide and erosion.

Why ancient made awesome wonders and modern makes concrete jungle?  Why come and conquer by converting, destroying and exterminating?

Is Machu Picchu the  Inca place to communicate with the gods to learn their secrets?",1305244800,3,936,5.27027027027027
4061667,4,B0032KC36Y,"It never ceases to amaze me how people hundreds and even thousands of years ago were able to accomplish feats of architecture that puzzle modern day scientists and engineers. Not only did they accomplish this, they did it without the technology that we have now.

This video isn't long and there is a lot more information out there but it definitely was nice to have the visuals and a good overview. If you are interested in more info, I would suggest looking to other sources.",1276300800,8,477,4.6117647058823525

4061669,1,B0032KC36Y,"I purchased the video to show to my (college) students, and proceeded to show it without any pre-screening, having full confidence that PBS productions are normally quite good.  Not this turkey!  The archaeology is superb, and the photography is just jaw-droppingly gorgeous, but the dramatic voice-over and overly dramatic music turned what could have been an excellent production into a schmaltzy, over-the-top and water-downed version of the first-rate archaeology being done there in recent years.  Even my students thought it was bad. This has got to be one of the dumbest productions PBS has released in years.",1272153600,11,616,5.329896907216495
