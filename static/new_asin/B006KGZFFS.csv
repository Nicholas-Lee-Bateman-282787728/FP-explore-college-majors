8500170,5,B006KGZFFS,"This film is one of great suspense! It was a Russian TV Serial, and it has been said that when the episodes of the serial were on TV, the streets of Moscow were empty. There are few films about espionage that are worth seeing, this is perhaps the best. By comparison, James Bond films and other such Hollywood trash cannot be compared in any way to this film.",1445126400,,359,4.294117647058823
