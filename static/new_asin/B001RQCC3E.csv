8338637,2,B001RQCC3E,"Oh my god' has its heart in the right place but gets caught trying to be too comic and having too many of these comedic situations. It only survives because of the talents of the actor called Vinay Pathak who tries but falls short to lift this wannabe drama/comedy. Pathak is a happily married man who nurses ambitions to be rich; he has an investment scheme which tried to recruit members. The more members that he has, the more money it will make. However the scheme fails to make enough money for him. Finally God played by Saurabh Shukla, intervenes by attempting to give him millions by way of accident. Pathak however refuses to accept this easy money, the situations by which God tries to give money comprises the bulk of the film. These situations are supposed to be funny but they are not. This is average entertainment not completely dull if you have a few hours to kill. However the tragedy is that it was written and directed by Saurabh Shukla who wrote one of the greatest gang movies of all time, Satya,that made me think `Oh my God'. Two stars. 2/7/11",1297555200,,1066,4.528497409326425
