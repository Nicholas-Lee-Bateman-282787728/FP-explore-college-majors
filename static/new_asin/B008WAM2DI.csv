5186439,2,B008WAM2DI,"Like so many others I waited years for this program to finally get a DVD release. Grizzly Adams is a fun series that reflects the tenor of its time. The 1960s and 1970s brought growing concerns about the environment and those concerns were often mirrored in popular culture. This hokey series was a reflection of that time. Unfortunately, CBS completely botched this DVD release. The quality is terrible. The episodes are usually washed out, with miserable sound mixes and hundreds of imperfections of every type moving across the image. I will not be buying season two because I do not wish to support this kind of lazy release. CBS should be ashamed. . .after so long fans of this program deserve some basic level of effort. I do not recommend the 2012 CBS DVD set.",1353974400,9,767,4.688888888888889
5186440,5,B008WAM2DI,"I have always loved this show. I have wanted it to come out on dvd for a long time. Since I got it I have watched nothing else. Just this show over and over. I can hardly wait for season 2 which I have pre-ordered. I can't say for sure because the episodes are framed around Mad Jack's stories, but two episodes might be out of order. On the 1st disc, 2nd episode ""Blood Brothers"" Adams already knows Robbie, but on the 2nd disc, 1st episode (which is 4th episode in the first season ""Unwelcome Neighbor"" they meet Robbie and his dad for the first time. The Episodes ""Blood Brothers"" and ""Howdy Do, I'm Mad Jack"" seem to contradict each other about how Adams comes to the mountain, his ability to/or not to make a leentwo and the circumstances of where his cabin got built and who was there when it got built, etc. As for the packaging, The case is a chubby quad(which means it is the size of 2 standard cases. Inside there are 2 on each side. What I don't understand is why they made it a chubby instead of a standard. It's not like they needed the room. When they use chubbies when they don't have to it takes up unnecessary extra space on your shelves. And when they use chubbies
the art work is chubby size too so in order to make it fit a standard quad which I buy from Amazon I would have to cut the cover. I'm probably going to buy a chubby 8 disc and put both seasons in it. I am giving it a 5-star because of the show because I love show so much. Because there was only 13 episodes I wish they had included the movie that started it all ""The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams"", but they didn't. I hope they, at some point, bring out both movies ""The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams"" and ""The Capture of Grizzly Adams""",1353369600,14,1724,4.149253731343284

5186442,4,B008WAM2DI,"I have fond memories of watching Grizzly Adams on TV and even owning the Goodtimes VHS release of the 1974 movie (which I've now ordered from here on Amazon). I jumped for joy to see the series was coming to DVD this month.

The shows are a joy for anyone who likes older TV. Each episode is introduced by Denver Pyle (Uncle Jessie on The Dukes of Hazzard) and each one is set on the essential same pattern of Grizzly avoiding capture and befriending nature. Don Shanks and Denver Pyle make an excellent supporting crew for this slow paced, family oriented show.

I did however cringe when I saw that CBS was distributing the show. CBS is notorious for not finishing what they started but I saw last night that Season Two is already slated for release in February. Sadly, CBS Home Entertainment is notorious for their sub-standard treatment of classic TV and this falls short of the mark on quality.

The disclaimer at the start of each DVD says these have been sourced from the best possible sources and have been digitally remastered. Umm, whatever. The films are scratchy and grainy and show no hint of having been restored. The 2nd episode on the DVD shows hints of videotape archives. These look like public domain episodes that you buy in the dollar bin at some discount store they are so bad. Topping it off, the shows end with the late 80's/early 90's Viacom logo at the end making me believe not only were they not remastered but that they are the syndicated, edited versions. These only run about 46 minutes from start to finish and most programs of that era ran for a full 50 minutes.

Perhaps someone will come along and redo these properly and include both movies with it.",1352592000,66,1685,4.569536423841059
5186443,3,B008WAM2DI,"If you are a fan of the show, there is no point in typing out what the show is  about.  We all know.  I  watched this show when it was on in the 70's as a teen and loved it.  Now,  the reason for the 3 stars.  The horrible packaging.  It comes  in a cheap plastic box.  Two disk set inside each inside flap.  Two to a side.  Easily popped out and sratched.  When I got it in the mail one was popped out, but thankfully not scratched.  No notes.  No book.  No listing of episodes, except what you get on the disk.  And the disk are not even numbered, so you don't know which episode is first and or last. So it is hard to watch them in order.  There are no extras at all.  Just the episodes.  OK.  I got this for $19.95.  A good price, but come on.  Why do this on the cheap and cheat your fan base?  The show is fantastic.  The the box  is  horrible.  And the fact that there are no extras is a cheat.",1352505600,44,901,3.802197802197802
5186444,5,B008WAM2DI,"I am so glad to have this, after waiting for decades to get it. My family and I watched this show together, and when I moved out to be closer to my job, we'd talk about the show during get-togethers. Season 2 can be pre-ordered, and will probably be released next February. I've already pre-ordered it.

5186445,5,B008WAM2DI,"Having had this show on a bootleg copy for awhile, it'll be nice to see a better pic of this beautiful show.  I've been hoping for it for years.  The simplicity of the show is part of its beauty. One of the episodes is all about repairing a dam for beavers.  That's it! There's no bad guys he has to deal with, just a bear to help him with his travails.  The kindness in Haggerty's eyes an voice still resonate today.  I watch it with my 9 year old son who is not into that kind of show, and the enjoys it, too.  if you like movies like jeremiah johnson, wilderness family, and judge roy bean, :), you'll like this show.

5186503,5,B008WAM2DI,"This show was new when I was in kindergarten and I remember watching it pretty much every week with my parents. I remember not really knowing what was going on and asking my mom what was happening all the time. I just remember the mountain scenes and the main characters and Ben. Hard to believe it only went for two seasons. The production company was our own Schick Sunn Classic Productions, here in Utah. No longer in business, though. I was overjoyed to see this out on DVD when I saw it at the department store one day on the new release shelf. Yeah, I'm not sure if these are the syndicated or full versions, and they have not been remastered. They just used the best vault copies they could find and put them on disc. I'm still glad to have them, though. They look pretty good even if not as good as the remastered classics like 'Twilight Zone' and 'Star Trek'. Actually I don't think many TV shows have been remastered, only the most classic ones that ran for many seasons, and not even all of those. None of the 'Emergency!' seasons were remastered, and it ran for six seasons, for example. At least those were full episodes, though.

  Anyways, the episodes look and sound good, you may have to turn up the sound a little. The first season was much better and had more interesting episodes than the second season, in my opinion. Grizzly Adams spends his time taking care of his cabin and surviving, taking care of lost strangers or animals, and hangin' with Jack and Nakoma. There's good action at times, too. They have forest fires, floods and hard storms and bounty hunters come around from time to time. I'm glad they were able to get star Denver Pyle for this show, a bonafide TV star of three series to his name with this one. The simplicity of the production of this show was the beauty and genius of it. It all happened in the mountains where he and the other regulars were living. There was no need for sets and make up and stunt doubles. It made me feel like I was up there isolated with them, an escape from here and now. I had forgotten about the other animals that visited Adams on a regular basis, like the skunks, the wolf, the hawk, the mountain lion, and some racoons. They were great. I had forgotten about Number Seven the mule, too. I remembered instantly, though, when he first appeared on the DVDs. I thought both Ben and Number Seven should have shared whatever awards they give for TV performances, the Cleo, is it? Maybe that's for commercials. They were more enjoyable to watch than the humans. All the animals had great scripts written for them and the trainers who got them all, and there were a LOT, to do what they did was remarkable work.

  There was nothing like it on TV at the time except for maybe Little House On the Prairie, but that was just a family western. I much preferred Grizzly Adams to that show. My nephews agree. They were watching this show with me on DVD while they were eight and six years old, respectively, and they said it was tied with Sponge Bob as their favorite show. I just wish the original movie was available on DVD from 1974.",1437264000,2,3098,4.426315789473684

5186548,5,B008WAM2DI,"You know when I think about Grizzly Adams, I remember the show being exactly as it is presented on these DVD sets. The show's production never looked terribly expensive from the standpoint of the technical filming components of it's day and I never got the sense the company was using grade A film stock to deliver these shows from week to week. It was a simple family show with an abundance of beautiful cinematography coupled with allot of charm from it's lead star and resident animals. I would never expect an expensive restore job or Blu-Ray quality clean up when it sits nicely in the manner in which it was delivered. I have a 55 inch flat screen and it reads just fine. This works.

The show itself is great escapist fun. If you have to reason the logistics of how or why, you've already placed more demands on the premise than is reasonable to expect from a show of this kind. It's simplicity and charm involving the great outdoors is all but explicit in execution. And the stories remain just as timeless as ever. There's no probability scale for these adventures. This is pure fantasy decked in a beautiful environment to allow the viewer to relax and forget the ills of the day. If you were a fan of this series, don't miss out on this release. It's easily the best picture quality of any I have seen since it went off the air and has a nice feature with Dan Haggerty fondly reminiscing those years in his career. A love letter for any fan of the series.",1414108800,,1466,4.449814126394052

5186564,5,B008WAM2DI,"We haven't had a TV in over 2.5 years because there is nothing on TV worth watching anymore. My husband and I were talking about the classics and he mentioned, ""The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams"" and how he always enjoyed that as a boy. We looked it up and were so glad to see that they had finally released it on DVD. We decided to get it because we could depend on it being family friendly with good morals, something that today's TV lacks highly. We watched it on our Laptop and were very happy with the quality (If you were to use a big screen, I'm not sure how good the quality would be). It is an older flick and was made on a smaller budget but an awesome show none-the-wise! We truly love watching something that we know that every second it plays there is no language, nudity/sexuality, drinking, smoking etc. You will not find that in today's shows/movies. So, I rate this high for the family entertainment. My children loved watching the wild-life and Grizzly Adam's nurturing of the animals, watching Mad Jack's crazy humor and Native American culture through Nakoma!",1401062400,3,1081,4.520408163265306

5186567,4,B008WAM2DI,"Yes, I'm one of those who watched the show every week on a black and white TV in my parents front room. I loved it then and it's still good now. The quality of some episodes do look iffy but considering CBS cancelled the show after 2 seasons we're lucky to have the tapes at all.
It's been mentioned that the DVD comes with no internal packaging and nothing to tell which episode is first; yet when I typed in a Google search I could find the episodes quite easily and the discs start on the L upper, go to the L lower, over to the R lower and at last to the upper R.
Considering I glomped onto the 13 episodes of ""Logan's Run"" (which also had some iffy areas) I'm not too worried about snuggling into bed to watch an hour or so of childhood remembrance.
I for one am glad these shows are coming out on DVD. I might be 52 but somewhere inside there's a 12 year old watching one of her favourite shows.",1397520000,,901,4.067415730337078

Added it to our collection of Little House, Brady Bunch, Gilligan, MacGyver.  No influence on my kids of kids' snotty attitudes towards their parents, over-sexual or hyped-up characters.

Aside from the show itself, yes, the film quality is lacking compared to today.  It's  1970's series and I would expect as such. It didn't take away from how much we love it though.

5186604,5,B008WAM2DI,"When it comes to decent, non violent clean entertainment this first season of Grizzly Adams shows have no contender not only because of the majestic calming great outdoors setting where the whole adventure takes place but also their implicit message regarding respect and affection for nature and it's many living things.

The programs are calming and even funny: Mad Jack's grumpiness, and Grizzly Adam's ability to get along with all wild animals not to mention the incredible acting abilities of an evidently well-trained and funny black bear named Ben. Obviously that large 500 pounds bear has been trained to stand up on two legs and growl and do other tricks on cue, for Pete's sake.

In addition Denver Pyle, in my opinion, would have deserved an Emmy award for his  sidekick role playing second dog to Dan Haggerty who also as the star of the show gives out an excellent performance.

The message we derived from this shows is totally positive: that while in the great outdoors or even within the money-oriented so-called civilization living with gratitude in harmony with nature and with all its creatures, not against them, might be the key to live a healthy and joyful life.

These great televisions series, based on the life of a real nineteen century woodsman who found refuge from civilization in the Sierra Nevada mountains and who also raised and trained Grizzly bears and other wild animals, are  highly recommended.",1383955200,,1433,4.97489539748954

5186606,3,B008WAM2DI,"First I LOVE Grizzly Adams. The three star rating is because of lack of packaging and out of order episodes. According to another website which lists the order of the episodes by chronogolical order--shows how mixed up the episodes are. For instance episode 702 (the numerical order is in the 700's--I have no idea why)is actually on disc 4!

Cheaply made. No closed captioning. And for those of us who saw this way back we are approaching that time where we will need cc--if not today soon.

The fact that the Viacom insignia shows on a whole slew of episodes bothers me less than cc. But I surely wish that someone could go back and redo both seasons. Get the ""real"" source film, restore it, put in the cc and do some heavy marketing. This is one of the best series ever.

Honestly if you are looking for really good honest family friendly movies this is one of them. Sure some of it is a bit hokey but Dan Haggerty as Grizzly Adams shines. The gentleman who plays Nakota is an absolute gem. Denver Pyle is the oddball. And the mule no. 7 is wickedly good!

So my complaint has a lot more to do with the shoddy put together, half a**ed job that someone did. Cheap with no forethought.",1381276800,,1186,4.377272727272727

This show is about an innocent man heading for the high country when falsely accused of murder.  Drifters come through the area and get in all kinds of trouble and the kind,neighborly ADAMS bails them out with the help of his thousand pound friend.

It would have been nice if they added the last movie they put out in this sereis. I believe it was titled 'The Trial of Grizzly Adams'. Interview with Dan Haggerty is only about 13 minutes.

The show was about a man who was wrongly accused of murdering someone, so he sets-off to live in the mountains away from other people.  Adams had an uncanny gift of being able to ""talk"" to various wild animals, the biggest being a grizzly bear named ""Ben"".

I guess to some degree it doesn't matter since these are not like a continuing story from episode to episode, but to some degree it does matter in my opinion especially when new characters are introduced etc.
my 6 year old is really enjoying these.  with all the garbage on tv today, it is really nice to have some wholesome tv to share with her.  she was a little scared at some of the show content at first (like wild animals attacking or little kids getting lost in the wild) but we assured her it would all turn out alright, and the animals were all friendly.

It's on DVD, but the quality is poor.  It hasn't been cleaned up or remastered by THX, Skywalker Sound or anything else.  You get the glitches in the video - hairs and dust - and the audio is what it is.  You can hear it okay.

The fist thing I noticed about the packaging is that no where does it tell you in what order the episodes go in.  No Disc 1, 2, 3, 4... no numbers next to the episode names.  So here is a listing from the Grizzly Adams Web Site Index Episode List for both Season 1 & Season 2 in order.

I remember seeing just a few episodes way back when. I have searched for a long time to find this in DVD, it finally is out and could not be happier. A program like this is what TV is all about. I wish the show had a chance to run it's course instead of being killed because a network was changing it's image. Well it sure did just that. In a negative way. I love this show, only negative thing is that I need [CC] Closed Captioning to watch anything due to being deaf. Sadly this does not have it. There are a lot of DVDs out there on this show but they are pirated & of real poor quality. If you want to relive this classic, get this collection. As soon as I saw Season 2 was coming out I quickly placed an advanced order for it as soon as it is out. Wish the numbskulls at the network used their brains, not their wallet and let this show live.

5186657,1,B008WAM2DI,"I was so excited to find that Amazon had the 2 seasons of Grizzle Adams, I wanted my grandkids to enjoy what I did as a child. Now Im not even going to waste my money because of all the negative feedback. Im glad I read before I purchased a 2 rate DVD. Amazon should not even let such low quality items on their site. Bad name!!!!",1358467200,,330,3.9402985074626864

5186660,5,B008WAM2DI,"This first season of the series is a real treat and an insight into how well childrens programmes were once made.
A real feeling of love and hope comes across as each episode unfolds.
The episodes have a way of drawing you into them and the bear is just outstanding. I reckon Dan Haggerty had a close
bond with him.
Quality wise... being shot on 16mm and with an optical soundtrack it looks and sounds like a series from the late 70's early 80's
That is exactly the feel I want. No its not HD but when played through a Sony Dvd player and upscaled to 1080p it looks very impressive on a 40 inch screen. The soundtrack is also fine and the lovely soundtrack music creates a perfect retro feel. I am more than happy with the quality.
I am from the Uk and can strongly reccomend the set to you if you have a region 1  or multi region dvd player.",1357603200,19,842,4.1656441717791415
5186661,5,B008WAM2DI,"Wow, I just love this show. I have already seen it twice. The animals, the beautiful scenery life in the mountains what more could you want?

5186676,2,B008WAM2DI,They finnaly released this terrific show on DVD but they should have cleaned it up a bit. Picture is terrible and at times completley horrible. This is no way to treat such a wonderful proram. At least the price is reasonable!!!,1355529600,3,228,4.585365853658536
5186677,5,B008WAM2DI,"During the mid 1970s, The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams was my all time favorite show.  I was so disappointed when the show ended.  I was happy when the show went into syndication, and watched it religiously, over and over again, only to be disappointed again when the show was pulled from the network.

Then, in the early 2000s, I discovered through E Bay that people were selling bootleg copies( legal through public domain), and since I had no idea whether an official release would ever be made, I purchased it.  Although the quality wasn't the best, I made do with it.

Then, I was thrilled to learn that finally, there was an official release for season one.  I did not hesitate to purchase it, and couldn't wait for it to arrive in the mail.  The quality if wonderful, and all my memories came flooding back.  Now, I anxiously wait for season 2 as well as the two movies.  Thanks for these wonderful memories!",1355356800,4,918,4.515151515151516

However the tansfer wasn't that great.  It's like watching it on a UHF channel that the reception was just okay.  Not enough to deter me from recommending it or purchasing season two.  But in todays age I hoped for a better picture.",1355097600,6,369,4.432835820895522

8531351,4,B008WAM2DI,"By no means a profound television classic, the short-lived 1970s series ""Grizzly Adams"" stands the test of time as a fairly entertaining and relaxing bit of slightly camp escapism. Where the gentle and always compassionate James Adams (Dan Haggerty) lives in the wilderness in a place where the weather is almost always nice, and all the animals are friends, and he sustains himself on a diet of fish, berries and pancakes; Adams, his bear companion, Ben; his friend, Mad Jack (portrayed by the lovable Denver Pyle); and his Indian blood brother, Nacoma (portrayed by Don Shanks); seem to ever be able to solve whatever problems may arise through good common sense and a peace-loving approach. While some episodes are virtually plotless, ""Grizzly Adams"" has an engaging and calming effect through it's beautiful wilderness scenery, slowly-paced sequencing framed by way of the soothing songs of Thom Pace whose ""Maybe"" opens and closes each episode.",1499904000,,949,5.209150326797386
