8064919,5,B0009PUM40,"This movie wasn't so much written as it was pitched.  I can see how it happened:

WRITER: People love to watch stuff being blown up.  So let's have an entire movie about this guy blowing up buildings.  We can use news footage of buildings being demolished, which will save a lot on our special effects budget.

PRODUCER: But it takes skill to make a building fall down like that.  You can't just put some dynamite in there and hope fo the best.  No one will believe it.

WRITER: That's the hook: the guy doing it is an expert on demolishing buildings, so he would know how to do it.

PRODUCER: Perfect!  When can you have a script?

WRITER: That IS the script: The guy blows up a bunch of buildings, cops go after him, and since this is a made for TV movie, there is no surprise ending: he gets caught.  It writes itself.
--------------------------------------------
I love made for TV movies.  My favorite is one of the first: The Killers, with Ronald Reagan (sure it was theatrically released, but only because it was judged too sleazy for TV).

Made for TV movies are made unde the rather more restrictive environment of television.  They try to get around that by being as sleazy as they can, within the restrictions of their medium.  This frequently comes across as more sleazy than a porn film: one fine example would be Dawn: Portrait of a Teenage Runaway.

This film continues on in the tradition of made for TV movies: a nonexistent budget, a plot that is more of a concept, and, of course, actors best known for their TV roles.  Highly recommended.",1278547200,2,1558,4.543165467625899
