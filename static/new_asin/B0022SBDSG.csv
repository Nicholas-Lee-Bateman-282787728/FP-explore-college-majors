8349660,4,B0022SBDSG,"I've had this movie on VHS since the very early days of VHS tape rentals, and I've always been surprised that it was never converted to DVD. Thankfully, I can donate my VHS copy to my library because it is finally available in Amazon Prime Video.

this 1998 film is played/acted by a much younger Kenneth Branagh & Helena Bonham Carter with Branagh's character sentenced to community (public) service. He's tasked with a motor neuron disease afflicted Bonham-Carter; she just wants to lose her virginity before she dies.

My wife is a Physical Therapist and she has spent 30+ years caring for ALS (Lou Gehrig's) as well as Multiple Sclerosis patients...she watched this film with me and she remarked on the accuracy of Helena Bonham Carter's depiction of MS/ALS patients. This is a very personal accolade from my wife, who has spent many years ""up-close-and-personal"" with this horrible disease.

As there is no cure for ALS nor MS, only treatments that comfort and prolong it would not be a spoiler to say this is not a happy ending. Personally, I've always felt that life is about the journey (the trip) and not about the destination.",1523404800,,1136,4.815384615384615

8349663,5,B0022SBDSG,"this DVD is in perfect quality. don't let the title fool you, it is in English all the way, not subtitles on. though the movie is only in full screen which makes watching the movie on a flat screen difficult, but hey now you can watch in on a format that is more modern than you Grandma's VHS player! shipping was fast and good though the Price is too high(34.50). but worth it.
as for the movie itself, wow, amazing! a woman with ALS wants the last bit of life's pleasures before her terrible demise. yes the plot does sound sick and weird, but it totally throws you for a loop if your not really for it. i relate to this movie from so many reason. probably for the fact that she wants to live life, of what little she has, and he wants to know what it feels like to be alive in an old, emotionless body. the score for this film is amazing! in fact, if it wasn't for the music I don't think I would enjoy it all that much. this movie is very up lifting and is a feel good movie of the 90's. a lot of cursing, no real nudity, heart warming.",1398384000,,1040,4.028985507246377
8349664,5,B0022SBDSG,"I saw this on cable and watch it everytime it is on . The story is fictional , but Helena Bonham Carter absolutely owns her character and Kenneth Branagh is absolutely superb in his role. I am vertically challenged and confined to a wheelchair myself, and I have experienced the same ignorance when it comes to sex and the disabled . This is an excellent movie , do yourself a favor and see it . I wish they would release it on a USA compatible dvd ...",1384905600,,452,4.206896551724138
8349665,5,B0022SBDSG,I have just watched this wonderful movie on paychannel TV. Initially I had no big expectation of this movie. But it took my attention immediately and the main actors did a fantastic and genuine performance in high class film. It touches throughout about a valid taboo sexuality issue in a serous handicapped young woman with a terminal neurological progressive disease. It is captivating and has a lot of humor. This is a film I believe will touch very many who sees it. This is a film I recommend highly. I easily give it 5 stars. This is a film I wish will be available on DVD with  several language subtitles for not native english speaking people.  OHB,1264032000,3,656,4.598290598290598
