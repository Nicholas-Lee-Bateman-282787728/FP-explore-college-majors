8355522,3,B002828974,"First off, this is a great deal, about ten bucks for 6 movies. Enough said. However, a few things need pointing out to the buyers. First, Yongary and Gappa, especially Gappa, are in really bad shape. Most of the scenes take place at night, and it's almost impossible to see anything. The daytime scenes are real faded, so bad that at times it seems like it changes from color to black-and-white. The Gamera movies are in pretty good shape but still have their flaws. I won't review the movies except for one: Yongary. Despite what I've heard, it is an incredibly stupid movie. I mean bad. No plot whatsoever (yeah, I know, Plot in a monster movie?), and when the title monster is defeated, you get 7-8 extra minutes of a wedding scene! There are also no extras on the disc, which is not a big deal, but I have been spoiled by the Classic Media releases of the Godzilla movies. Anyway, if you're like me and just enjoy a good monster movie at a cheap price then this might be worth it, but not for over 11 bucks. If you want quality, then try something else and steer clear of this set.",1276819200,6,1085,4.349753694581281
