168951,5,0800136926,"David Niven (Peter Carter) and Kim Hunter (June) are excellent as the newly met wartime couple struggling to preserve their love against the ""law of the universe"", the law of heaven.  But is the conflict  real or all in Peter's mind?  Should he be dead???
Although the script  itself is witty, poignant, and expertly crafted, in my opinion a great deal  of the charm of this movie comes from Marius Goring's supporting role as  ""Conductor 71"".  Just over the top enough to keep the movie  buoyant, the character is a terrific balance to the seriousness of the  subject and the setting.  He brings a sense of timeless romance to the  story.

168961,2,0800136926,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Since I thought Kim Hunter was not up to snuff for ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" I was thoroughly impressed with her beauty in this crazy number. Exterior shots were not her friend tho but decent acting nonetheless.

I did laugh through most of this nutjob ride especially when the new arrivals were picking out their wings vs props. Yet I never saw anyone wear them in the entire film. They probably got tired of gluing them on and knocking them off at Craft Services.

The most interesting aspect of this film was trying to figure out who in history I would most like to represent me to keep me from such a lovely existence in Heaven. I first thought of Alexander the Great because he would have liked the French cutie who came to earth with that adorable outfit and would try to impress him.

Miracles happen all the time, why does the survival of a pilot have to be such a conundrum? Oh, so we can put the Americans on trial, gotcha! Ol' Bug Eye Massey comes to the rescue to really highlight the age old rivalry between the two countries and picks an all male jury which of course gets replaced instantly with current military men, natch.

I will say I was on the edge of my seat waiting for some dancing to bust out on those steps ala Fred n Ginger but alas the famous statues had to suffice, crap.

Not sure I can recommend this for any particular reason because there is so much better tripe about Heaven around. However, you do get to hear a wee lecture on the layout of the Universe. Only thousands, not BILLIONS of stars?? Carl Sagan turning in his grave.",1449964800,,1605,4.3872053872053876

168964,5,0800136926,"A masterpiece.  Everyone should see it.  I saw it in an Area 2 DVD, sporting a gorgeously-restored version of this incredible film. Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger were brilliant, innovative filmmakers, and their films never cease to amaze me.  STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN (A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH) is one of the best.  Not only its screenplay is faultless but its technical realization is simply breathtaking, beginning with Jack Cardiff's Technicolor cinematography (his first full-length color film).  The actors (David Niven, Kim Hunter, Marius Goring, Roger Livesey, among others) are all  inspired and give unforgettable performances.  Those who are fond of CITIZEN KANE should have a good look at STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN.  Powell & Pressburger's work is just as creative as Welles' and, in my opinion, remains by far a wittier and indeed more moving film.",1404777600,3,857,5.25

168966,5,0800136926,"In 1946, writer/directors Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger gave the world this imaginative tale of an Anglo-American love story taking place the previous year when World War II was ending.
 The lovers are June and pilot Peter Carter(Kim Hunter and David Niven), who meet over the airwaves as June, a radio operator, contacts the faltering RAF pilot, Peter, as he struggles with a burning Lancaster bomber en route home from a mission, during which his crew have already bailed. It is established he expects to die, and a lugubrious June expresses her sympathy.
 Conductor 71(Marius Goring), a French nobleman executed during his country's Revolution, fails to conduct Peter to the other world because of fog over the English Channel, and Peter awakens the following day on a beach near June's base, encountering her as she cycles home from work.
 The two immediately fall in love despite Conductor 71's explanation of the snafu and urging Peter to accompany him to the Great Beyond. After Peter demands an appeal, Conductor 71 consults with his superiors and upon his return, informs Peter that his wish is granted. Peter will have three days to prepare his case and appoint counsel, which may consist of anyone now deceased. Despite discussion with Conductor 71, Peter is unable to make that choice.
 June's friend, Dr. Reeves(Roger Livesey) takes an interest in Peter's visions of Conductor 71, diagnosing his condition as chronic adhesive arachoiditid from a concussion received some years earlier. Scheduling Peter for surgery, Reeves himself perishes in a road accident en route to find an ambulance for Peter--a tragedy enabling him to serve as Peter's counsel.
 It is agreed theat Peter bears no responsibility  for his failure to leave Earth  at that particular time, and that he should be allowed to nurture and grow the love he has found.
 In the celestial court, the trial is held in counterpoint to Peter's brain surgery. Before American Abraham Farlan (Raymond Massey)a casualty of the American Revolutionary War, Reeves demands a change in the jury's make-up, resulting in more diversity.
 As the Judge/Surgeon(Abraham Sofaer) presides over the case, the debate over  Peter's fate continues.
 June is able to attend the proceedings and is willing to lovingly sacrifice herself to save Peter.
 The masterfully acted drama features Kathleen Byron as a uniform-clad angel, and Richard Attenborough as an English pilot. Bonar Colleano is his American counterpart. Robert Coote plays Flying Officer Bob Trubshawe.
 With the added elements of Allan Gray's musical score, and Jack Cardiff's cinematography, viewers enjoy a celebration of the glory and triumph of a wartime love for which literally and figuratively, Heaven and Earth were moved.",1329177600,2,2756,5.2505694760820045

168968,5,0800136926,"Wonderful movie, so-so DVD.

There are better editions available from the UK (there's even one that was orginally a giveaway from a British newspaper that you can find for $2 with another movie on the same disk, that is quite good quality. Powel used color better than anyone else did, or would for many years, so you really ought to see a good copy that does justice to the film. OK they will only play on a Euro or no-region DVD player but many US DVD players can play the UK version, with a simple hack (easy to find on the net)  to make them all region

I think the first few moments of this film are as intense as any thing I have ever seen in a film! Michael Powell had a wonderful eye, he could even make a dead man in the ruined cockpit of a burning bomber beautiful to look at.",1208908800,,786,4.090909090909091
168969,5,0800136926,"I should state here that while I have seen this film many times, I have not seen this DVD, so cannot comment on its quality.  Thus, this review concerns the film only.  I've seen the poor reviews of the DVD below and it is a great shame, because I very much wanted a copy - no library of Pressburger/Powell fans is complete without this marvellous movie, which was released in Britain under the title ""A Matter of Life and Death"".  In 2004, the movie was voted by a poll of 25 British critics as #2 on a list of the best British films ever made (of course, #1 on that list was ""Get Carter"", so make of the honor what you will).

""Stairway to Heaven"", as it was called in its U.S. release in 1947, features a suberb cast, including David Niven, Kim Hunter (of ""Streetcar Named Desire"" fame), Roger Livesey (another Pressburger/Powell stalwart, most notably in ""I Know Where I'm Going"" and ""The Life and Times of Colonel Blimp""), and Marius Goring (unrecognizable from the romantic young composer of ""The Red Shoes"").

The setting is the coast of England during WWII.  The film opens as Peter (David Niven), an RAF pilot whose aircraft is shot down during a dogfight with German attackers, is radioing in to report and to try to get a last message to his mother.  His crew is dead, his parachute shot up, his engines on fire, and he knows he is going down.  June, an American girl from Boston (Kim Hunter) who is working with the English war effort, picks him up on radio and takes the message - they have an emotionally fraught exchange, and when the radio connection goes off, June assumes the pilot's plane has crashed and he is dead.

But Peter wakes up on the beach near the downs, a bit bruised but otherwise not too much the worse for wear.  He cannot explain how he got there, or how he escaped what he assumed was an unavoidable descent to a watery death. He wanders along the beach and, of course, the first person he meets is June - they fall instantly in love.

As it turns out, Peter WAS ""scheduled"" to die in that crash - but the Heavenly Messenger (Marius Goring) missed him in the English coastal fog.  The Messenger suddenly appears and insists that Peter return with him to take his appointed place in the rolls Upstairs.  Peter points out that his situation has changed drastically - that, due to the Messenger's ""mistake"" he has fallen in love, and therefore his ""case"" must be reconsidered.

From this point on, the film moves between fantasy and reality, as the viewer as well as the characters try to determine whether Peter's sudden headaches and increasingly agitated emotional state are the result of the approach of the Heavenly Trial of his case - or a brain injury suffered as his aircraft crashed into the water below. The story's conceits on both levels are followed through with scrupulous care. Roger Livesey plays Frank Reed, the doctor who befriends the young couple and tries to help them, calling in expert neurological help while reassuring June that Peter is not losing his mind, and reassuring Peter that they won't let the Messenger take him without a fight.

""Stairway to Heaven"" represents the best form of this genre, with touches of irony and  humor, and stylish as well as sincere performances, that avoid what might have been an overdose of whimsy.  The delicate way of the Pressburger/Powell team on that strange border between fact and fantasy here results in an enchanting classic that never loses is ability to charm.  Oh - just see how long it takes you to get that ""Stairway"" theme out of your head, too!",1201564800,6,3555,4.589257503949447

168974,4,0800136926,"While I was watching ""Stairway to Heaven"",I couldn't help but think of that great movie from a few years earlier, ""Here Comes Mr. Jordan"".  The latter movie was more a romantic comedy while the former comes across as a moral fantasy about fate and the opportunity to change it.

We see, right from the beginning, the essentials of ""Stairway to Heaven"".  Two people share a special bonding moment just before one of them is about to die.  The opening is well done and enables us to buy into the ""love at first brush with death"" basis for the romantic focus of the movie.  There is a subsequent scene that is brilliantly done in which we sense, for a moment or two, that we are ""someplace else"".  We do get there eventually in order to witness a trial for the ages.  You see, one of the parties by-passed fate and now must ""pay up"".  ""Not so fast"" he says and begins to argue for his continued earthly existence.  The special envoy that is sent to ""bring him home"" ends up having to negotiate and the matter is put before a holy tribunal.

If it seems like I'm giving the plot away, don't fear.  What I've described can be pretty well forseen as the movie develops.  There are a few surprises I've left out although some of them are fairly predictable as well.  The excellence in this movie isn't so much the plot as the script and the acting.  I'd give a nod to the directing as well.  The ""trial"" gets into some pretty deep stuff and I'm not sure that I absorbed it all the first time around.  Not to worry: this is a movie I'll gladly watch again.",1130112000,7,1548,4.322916666666667

168976,5,0800136926,"A Matter of Life and Death is a picture that defines the term 'classic film'. Always inventive in their efforts, The Archers - Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger - have here created yet another cinematic masterpiece that at once is entertaining and thought-provoking.  And it is done with great style, taste and wit.  This picture is a seamless interweaving of drama, fantasy and humor of the highest order, with superb attention to detail and an ingenuous use of three-strip Technicolor and monochrome dye-transfer photography which compliment the story perfectly - as does the excellent musical score by Allan Gray.

Right from the opening credit, when the archer's bull's-eye fades into color after the arrow finds its mark, the viewer is in for a grand cinematic treat! A picture that only improves with repeated viewings, A Matter of Life and Death deserves to be as well-known as any film the reader can think of - and more so than many which are.

Please, Columbia-Tristar, release this great movie as a Region 1 DVD and promote it for all it's worth! If more Americans had a chance to see this elusive movie, it would be as well-loved and famous as OUR great classics Gone With The Wind, The Wizard Of Oz, and Star Wars, et al., and the home video sales would fill your coffers.

168979,5,0800136926,"For about a decade, beginning in the late 1930s and extending into the late 1940s, Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger crafted a number of brilliant and beautiful fantasy films, from THE THIEF OF BAGHDAD to THE LIFE AND DEATH OF COLONEL BLIMP to I KNOW WHERE I AM GOING to THE RED SHOES.  But of all of these films, my personal favorite is the amazing fantasy about the meaning of love and death A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH
Several reviewers seem to be mildly confused about the country of origin of these films, including the film here.  These were not Hollywood films.  Powell and Pressburger formed their own production company, dubbed the Archers, and subsequently used other studios as distributors.  One of the reasons that I am stressing this is the fact that I do not believe that British cinema from the forties and fifties has received its proper respect.  There were a large number of superb filmmakers working in Great Britain during that time, often making films that were more striking and imaginative than were being produced in Hollywood.
The casting of this film is remarkable.  David Niven, who actually appeared in far fewer first rate films than one might expect, given his celebrity status, is marvelous.  Along with his turns in BACHELOR MOTHER and RAFFLES, this is easily my favorite David Niven film.  One reason that some reviewers may be under the impression that the film was made in Hollywood was the presence of Kim Hunter and Raymond in the film.  This was one of Kim Hunter's first significant roles, playing the part of a young American woman who falls in love with a man who should have died.  Raymond Massey, however, was no stranger to British film, having starred in the first great British Sci-fi film, THINGS TO COME, as well as other productions such as THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL.  But for me the delight of the film is seeing Roger Livesey, who appeared in many of The Archers best films, in another role.
Visually, this is a stunning film.  The gigantic staircase upon which Niven and Marius Goring sit while trying to decide who would defend Niven in his appeal to heaven for a reconsideration of his death.  And several of the scenes in heaven are remarkably striking.
This is one of those films that even casual fans of movies cannot afford to miss.",1010016000,30,2290,4.723618090452261
168980,5,0800136926,"David Niven plays a dashing young pilot, Peter Carter who is about to die.  His plane is on fire and he doesn't have a parachute.  Rather than burn to death he opts to leap from the plane and meet his death less painfully.  However fate steps in and he is miraculously given a second chance at life.  A second chance that is unfortunately not sanctioned by the Powers that Be. The story follows Niven as he falls in love with the young American girl June (Kim Hunter at her best) who spoke to him just before he was supposed to ""die"" and his relationship with those on the other side of life who tell him that his survival was a mistake and he has to meet his maker whether he likes it or not.  What happens next is a wonderful combination of drama, humour and a smattering of science-fiction, as Peter tries to reason with those that are trying to claim his soul.  Dr Reeves, a friend of June's (another brilliant piece of casting in the form of Roger Livesey, doesn't he have the most amazing voice?) realizes that Peter has suffered a form of rare brain damage that can only be cured on the operating table.  But Peter has a trial to attend, and whether it is real or in his mind it has to go ahead, and he has to find someone on the other side to defend him.  Poignant, haunting and beautifully acted this film is a superb creation born out of time.  The scenes in the ""other world"" all filmed in black and white are quite breath-taking and for its day it displayed a surprising understanding of the human race in the form of the people it showed living side by side in heaven.  Sikhs, and Black Americans being the first two that spring to mind.  In a nutshell I loved this film.  It was wonderfully funny in parts, especially when Conductor 71 (the Angel who missed Peter's soul because of the English fog) constantly made a plethora of delicious of quips throughout the film that were rib tickingly funny. This is another David Niven classic of the highest quality which was released in the UK under the title of ""A Matter of Life and Death.""  It's also available on DVD in the UK and if you have a multi-regional player it's worth investing in as it has transferred to compact disc exceedingly well unlike many films.",983923200,13,2225,4.384428223844282

168985,5,0800136926,"I know this movie under its original UK title, A Matter of Life and Death, and it's one of the finest, wittiest meditations ever on the relationship between earth and heaven, law and justice, England and America.
Bomber  pilot Niven finds himself in a rapidly disintegrating aircraft, shortly to  come down over the sea.  His last radio message is to an American WAC, Kim  Hunter, who falls in love with him during their brief conversation.  Then  they lose contact, the plane comes down and Niven is washed up on a beach -  but much to his surprise, he's not dead.  He meets Hunter and they connect.
However, up in heaven, things are not well.  Niven should have died,  and a heavenly messenger (Marius Goring as a deeply camp French aristocrat)  is sent to earth to persuade Niven that he's in the wrong place.  Meanwhile, Niven is suffering appalling headaches.  His doctor (lovably  blurry-voiced Roger Livesey) diagnoses a brain injury.  On earth, Niven  must have a difficult operation.  In heaven, he must go on trial for his  right to stay alive.
Powell and Pressburger made the movie as part of a  wartime propaganda effort to defuse tension between American servicemen  stationed in Britain and the British people, who occasionally resented the  Americans' higher pay, better uniforms and general chutzpah.  But the  film-makers exceeded their brief by several degrees.  This is a lovely bit  of movie-making; one of the wittier conceits is that life on earth is  depicted on sumptuous technicolour, while heaven is in silvery  black-and-white (the normal practice would have been to have it the other  way round).

But somehow he survives, with only a slight head wound, and washes up on the Devon shore near her base.  But he sees things, hears things, smells things that make him think he must have missed his connection to the afterlife.
For a person who doesn't believe in an afterlife and doesn't really feel the need for one, I'm very fond of posthumous fantasy stories like ""Heaven Can Wait"" and ""The Adding Machine"".  Here is a story which might or might not be one -- it's left entirely up to the viewer to decide whether this wounded airman has actually missed his scheduled death and is appealing to Heaven to be allowed to live and stay with the woman he has met during his ""borrowed time"" on Earth, or if he is having hallucinations as a result of a head injury.  The producer, however, consulted closely with a neurosurgeon, and the ""technobabble"" is sharp in its technicalities and quite lacking in babble.
The question of whether the British airman and the radio operator from Boston will be allowed to remain together also stands in for another question: whether the wartime alliance which FDR had named ""the United Nations"" would survive after the war, or whether the United States would leave Britain to shift for herself in the postwar world.  As the pilot's brain undergoes surgery, in his mind he makes his case for life and for love, and for the continuation of the United Nations.
Heaven, as depicted in the film, is an airy confection in black and white, by turns whimsical (aviators arriving in Heaven are issued their wings in plastic covers) and majestic (the amphitheatre in which the trial is held looks as though it really does hold all the billions who have ever lived).  Earth is gorgeous and vivid in Technicolor, unmistakably the land of the living.

(1946, UK, 100 min, b/w & colour, English subtitles, Aspect ratio: 4:3, Audio: Mono
EXTRAS: Biographies, short film on Jack Cardiff

Spoilers ahead!

Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburgers phenomenal A Matter of Life and Death is one of their very greatest achievements. That makes it one of the greatest films ever made. The fact that its been overlooked for so long and still rarely appears on critics lists is for me both puzzling and sad. For anyone with eyes and ears this film is an extraordinary feast  a veritable riot of astonishing emotion, sublime poetry, superb wit, eye-popping visual imagination, resonant spot-on casting and performances, and one of cinemas most outstanding music scores. Perhaps the very eclectic nature of the film with so much going on all the time in so many different modes of visual representation has caused people to step back and under-estimate this films metaphysical rigor. A propaganda film about life and death, heaven and earth, space and time, the conscious and the unconscious has no right to be this funny! Add the quirky (and for some) ruinously quaint play with the film medium itself  skipping from b/w to colour, silent film conventions to standard talkie practices, plain dialogue to huge gobbits of poetry from (mainly obscure) English poets  and it perhaps raises the question whether we should take any of it seriously at all. I say Blah to that and insist that we should not be fooled by the jocular absurdist surface for this is a deep and sincere meditation on the nature of human existence. Its every bit as profound as F. W. Murnaus Sunrise (1927), a film which represents cinematic perfection, and one which Powell/Pressburger pay rich homage to here.

Any metaphysical meditation on the meaning of life has to start with God and I guide everyone to the key scene which takes place about 20 minutes in when Dr. Reeves (Roger Livesey) is introduced playing with his toy, a camera obscura which allows him to see his village from a high position all in one go. An observer asks him, Surveying your kingdom? and ventures her opinion that It all looks different from up here. Reeves answers, Thats because you see it all clearly and at once, as in a poets eye. The inference here is that Reeves is an omniscient God-figure and that to see everything clearly requires divine poetry. In the film there are two obvious God figures  Reeves as the man who intuits more than any other character as a neurologist and who acts as councel on earth and in heaven; and the judge/brain surgeon presiding over/operating on our main character played by the same actor, Abraham Sofaer. But larger than these two figures is of course another pair  our God (the prime creator of the universe and everything in it) and our filmmakers (another entirely appropriate binary combination  Powell and Pressburger!) who filter Gods creation through their own camera obscura to give us their film as in a poets eye with everything shown clearly and at once.

In the tradition of understanding the human condition in binary terms which stretches back from Freudian psychoanalysis through Hegelian dialecticism, Descartess duelism between mind and body, and beyond, The Archers deploy a myriad of binary and binary opposite combinations throughout the film to give us their system. Its announced right from the very beginning as Ranks Gongman and The Archers target segue from b/w into colour, then the title announces life and death, then the opening written prologue announces This is a story of two worlds, and then we taken out into space (created by God) undercut by an ironic narrator (the Gods of our film)  This is the universe. Big isn't it? A jokey reference to the A-bomb just dropped on Japan as the film went into production (Someone must have been messing about with the uranium atom as a star explodes) leads to the Earth spinning around. Reassuring isn't it? our narrator purrs as we are taken down through the atmosphere full of confusing and anything but reassuring wartime electronic signals to meet the films main theme  love. Love is presented as the most important binary combination of all personified as the mystic union between man and woman  Peter Carter (David Niven), a doomed RAF pilot of a crippled Lancaster bomber about to bail out without a parachute and June (Kim Hunter), the military air traffic controller who falls in love with his voice as he spouts absurd metaphysical poetry and asks her to send his love to his family. From the moment these two fall in love even without seeing each other, the binary combinations multiply out in a number of directions. These can be adduced equally to our two Gods, the God who determines us, the characters, the story and the themes of the reality which we see and the Gods in control of our film who mediate this reality  how everything is shown to us.

The narrative of the film spins on an error made by Conductor 71 (Marius Goring), an angelic messenger from heaven who manages to miss his charge in the fog. Peter should have died and been conducted to heaven, but instead finds himself washed up on a beach very much alive after which he meets June and consummates (we assume!) their love. The fact that this is done while Peter is technically dead sets up the dialectic between the law of the universe on one hand (which demands Peters presence in heaven) and the power of earthly love on the other (which allows him to stay on earth because he fell in love in time which technically wasn't his). Naturally, here the main binary opposites are life/death and earth/heaven. To take things onto yet another level and to fulfill the MOI brief to provide propaganda to promote good will between the allies, the dead Peter is English while the live June is American so that the whole film is set up as a duel love story between man/woman and England/America. Furthermore, Conductor 71 is a French aristocrat beheaded in the French revolution and his meetings with Peter in which he tries to persuade the Englishman into joining him in heaven take the form of an ironic on-off Anglo-French entante cordiale as well. These meetings make visual another important dichotomy  time and space. Time flows with all the events that happen as we see them, but when Conductor 71 appears time stops (the whole world is frozen) as he talks with Peter in space. This in turn links on to the dichotomy Reeves perceives in Peters medical condition which shows all the signs of epilepsy and a division between his conscious state (time) and his unconscious state (space) which takes over increasingly as the narrative progresses. Peter has three encounters with Conductor 71 in which he is granted the right to appeal and struggles to find a defence councel. All three are related as mental relapses in the real world of time and they lead into the trial itself which is imagined as Peter undergoes brain surgery. The trial is a battle between America and England just as the operation is a battle between life and death and finishes with England proving that On earth nothing is stronger than love, as June (who has been called on to prove her love for Peter by giving up her life) rushes down the stairs (which have jammed simply because her number is not yet up) and into Peters arms for an ecstatic ending.

Cynics might sneer at such a corny fanciful ending just as they also sneered at that other 1946 film which starts out in space and features a heavenly messenger (Its a Wonderful Life of course), but what astonishes in this film is the way the omniscient Archers tell their story. The binary combinations don't stop with the plot and the main themes, they continue throughout all three vital components of any given film  the way scenes sound, the way scenes look and the way scenes are put together in relation to one another. Taking these in reverse order, The Archers stamp their authority as Gods of their narrative structure by splitting it up into 7 b/w scenes and 7 colour scenes. The number 7 is of course Gods number and as He built the world in 7 days so they build their world in 7 x 2 scenes.

Visually, there is a binary relationship between the colour scheme and the mise-en-scne which in turn is broken down into binary opposites. The colour scheme was unusual for its time though it had been tried in The Wizard of Oz (1939). Here, heaven is shot in b/w while earth is shot in colour. Powell said he did this to counter audience expectation and he makes a very famous reference to it with Conductor 71 saying, One is starved of Technicolor up there when talking about heaven. He also draws self-reflexive attention to his film as a film in a joke reference to Launder and Gilliats I See a Dark Stranger (1946) in a scene where June notices Reeves has been reading a book and asks, What did your book say? to which Reeves answers I see a dark stranger in his life. We may imagine Pressburger chortling at us possibly searching for some Freudian meaning here, but contemporary audiences would have got the reference I think, the idea being Reeves reads film magazines as well as medical journals! Also self-reflexive are the scenes of stop motion (the Garden of Eden sequence and the table tennis contest). Further to the colour scheme of the film there is also a dichotomy between silent film conventions and standard talkie practices. One is very conscious of the complete silence of the heaven scenes beyond the imaginatively deployed music. Even the meetings between Peter and Conductor 71 (shot in colour) take place in total silence, Peter noiselessly running across a room and up-setting books in slightly sped-up fashion characteristic of silent film. Then the films mise-en-scne pits modern natural studio settings against monolithic sets (courtesy of Alfred Junge) we associate with the silent era, especially UFA and Fritz Langs Metropolis (1927)  the Department of Records in heaven shot from above and then from below with use of animation, a huge expressionistic clock, the famous stairway (actually escalator) to heaven with its statues of famous people, the downward shot of the heavenly arrival hall as Reeves gets there with John Bunyan (more animation) and the huge amphitheater setting for the trial sequence from which the camera zooms away very impressively as the jury are taken down the stairway to see Peters operation. Most significant of all is the films closing quote to the final scene of Murnaus slient classic, Sunrise where the window is opened and the lovers lay their heads on a pillow and celebrate their new future together as the light pours in. All of these silent film references sit dazzlingly next to the talkie scenes flashing from b/w to colour to make for an extraordinary visual mosac.

Moving on to the sound, the dialogue of this film makes a powerful impression. Its quick, quick-witted (I recommend using the subtitles to get everything as it flies by!) and shows yet another dialectic, this time between plain speech and poetry which is as interventionist as the colour scheme and the use of silent film conventions. I cant think of any other film which crams in more poetry quotes and more names of poets than this one, the form taking on radical dimensions as they are wedded with real speech. Virtually the first words Peter utters are, Give me my scallop-shell of quiet, my staff of faith to walk upon, my scrip of joy, immortal diet, my bottle of salvation, my gown of glory, hopes new gage. And then Ill take my pilgrimage (Sir Walter Raleigh) quickly followed by But at my back I always hear Times winged chariot hurrying near. And yonder all before us lie deserts of eternity. (Andy Marvell)  And what a marvel! quips Peter. Reeves spots June through his camera obscura, quotes Byron and adds his own comment: She walks in beauty like the night only shes cycling and the suns out. The country house where June and her fellow Americans are staying is host to the rehearsals for a production of the miss-spelt Shakesperes A Midsummer Nights Dream and much fun is had by the gum-chewing, gangster-like American cast choking on the great bards immortal lines. The search for Peters councel excites a stream of names including Socrates, William Pitt, Henry VIII and Madame du Barry (Nobody knows more about love, opines Conductor 71, Rather a one-tracked mind though, quips Peter.) On the stairway to heaven the films original script has the following names either seen or mentioned: Alexander the Great, Beethoven, Chopin, Confucius, Benjamin Franklin, Julius Caesar, Abraham Lincoln, Michelangelo, Muhammad, Sophocles, Moses, Murillo, Plato, Rembrandt, Richelieu, Shakespeare, Solomon and Swift. The link between all of these was that they were all thought in 1945/46 to have been epileptics (ie; to have shared Peters condition). John Bunyan is also rumored to have had the same condition and once the gloves come off in the trial Reeves calls up for the defense of England John Donne, Dryden, Pope, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, Keats, Tennyson, Bridges and Peter Carter himself (also a budding poet conveniently for the script of course) with the prosecution adding Milton and Shakespeare for good measure. The question is perhaps not what poet is mentioned in the film, but what English poet isnt! Most emphatic of all is the way the judge closes the trial with a giant chunk of Sir Walter Scott which settles once and for all the preeminence of love on not just earth but in heaven as well: In peace, love tunes the shepherds reed. In war, he mounts the warriors steed. In halls, in gay attire is seen, in hamlets, dances on the green. Love rules the court, the camp, the grove, and men below and saints above. For love is heaven and heaven is love.

As if all this poetry isn't enough to surprise and astound, the film really springs into comic gear with the way the script (especially the sharp dialogue) takes swipes at national stereotypes particularly in the relationships England has with her friends France and America. This builds out of the required brief for propaganda of course, but its done so astonishingly well that all dryness is lost in a flurry of delightful wit. Conductor 71 tells Peter he missed him in the fog because of your ridiculous English climate when I lost my head (he was guillotined). Later when Peter kisses a frozen June who cant notice anything the Frenchman quips, These English! What is the good of kissing a girl if she does not feel it? It is noticable how thoroughly the film is structured out of national stereotypes. Conductor 71 is linked with the smell of fried onions, chauvinist nationalistic pride (his battlefield against Peter is a chessboard with Philidor [The greatest chess player, a Frenchman naturellment] his teacher), and notions of clichd romance exaggerated courtesy of a ridiculously enjoyable performance from Marius Goring. In the case of the other countries involved, England and America are shown throughout to be getting along with each other remarkably well. The English side features Carters stiff upper lip (Niven never finer), a country house, a rural Kent village, the English coastline replete with beaches and dunes, a rose garden, cricket, a village doctor on his motorbike and every English poet you care to mention especially Shakespeare. For the American side there are soda machines in heaven, a gum chewing actress, broad accents and then once we get to the trial a stream of bigotry uttered by Abraham Farlan (Raymond Massey) in high-faluting terms which glorify his country and earn wide applause from the Americans in the audience. Farlan was born in Boston like June and has an axe to grind against the British having been the first American to have been killed by a British bullet in the American War of Independence in 1775. The trial features a very interesting sequence in which Farlan plays a radio recording of a cricket relay which has a sad droning voice intoning that cricket is the sport which encapsulates the English the most. He also bemoans Englands draughty windows, smoky chimneys and faulty plumbing. As a riposte Reeves has a radio blaring out the latest American jazz which Farlan finds equally repulsive. The trial is effectively won when Reeves calls Farlans bad conscience into question by quoting George Washington (Labour to keep alive in your breast that little spark of celestial life called conscience) and has the jury changed from England haters (antagonists from past conflicts with France, South Africa, Russia, China, India and Ireland) to representatives of America today (all change to the same countries Americanized immigrants except for the Indian who interestingly morphs into a negro). The film shows England offering America a conciliatory olive branch with Reeves meeting Farlan on his own terms and in the central love story of Peter and June, the old adage of the Americans in Britain over-paid, over-sexed, and over here is inverted with the English man getting the girl, not the other way around.

The other aspect of the films aural presentation is of course the music and here we have a terrific score by Allan Gray. Grays real name was Jzef migrod and he was born in Poland, learned music under Schoenberg and worked in the UFA studios along with Pressburger and Junge in the 20s before fleeing the Nazis. His understanding of the post-Romantic idiom, silent film accompaniment and Schoenbergian atonality made him perfect for this film. The films present tense consisting of Peter and Junes love story and Reeves attempts to save Peters life are rendered with the usual post-Romantic lush string sonorities then in vogue in Hollywood. The wonderful 4-note descent love theme is worthy of Korngold or Steiner at their finest. For the heaven scenes there is an ingenious Schoenbergian 8-note piano scale with no harmonic resolution. This sounds especially other-worldly set against the total absense of natural noise. This tone-row is brilliantly embellished with orchestra when Peter famously runs down the stairway away from Conductor 71. As Conductor 71 is a French relic of the 18th century so Gray provides a brilliant French baroque pastiche for the Garden of Eden scene and the later scene where Reeves evidence (Junes tear) is gathered on Conductor 71s rose. Ingeniously as the rose dissolves into b/w and we are taken to the Metropolis-like set of the trial, French baroque fades and a Wurlitzer cinema organ (the clichd accompaniment we all associate with silent film) takes over and introduces our antagonists with little silent film-like themes whilst never negating the massive cathedral-like atmosphere it also brings to the occasion. Appropriately enough, there is a burst of Mendelssohn for the A Midsummer Nights Dream episode, but Grays music is totally successful throughout in enhancing the many binary components so central to this film. He also provided the music for The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (1943), A Canterbury Tale (1944) and I Know Where Im Going! (1945) and deserves to be celebrated as part of The Archers firm alongside the more famous Brian Easdale of The Red Shoes (1948) fame.

All of the binary and binary opposite combinations that I have outlined lead off very neatly indeed from the films opening written prologue: This is a story of two worlds, the one we know and another which exists only in the mind of a young airman whose life and imagination have been violently shaped by war. The equations might run as follows: The world we know = earth = life = time = the conscious = colour / The world we don't know = heaven = death = space = the unconscious = b/w. Straddling both are man/woman and England/America with love the link between two halves of The Archers system. There is something missing here though and that missing ingredient is ambiguity or mystery. This is supplied via a final binary opposite vital for Powell/Pressburger throughout all their very best work  fantasy and reality. We might expect fantasy to equate with the world we don't know and reality to equate with the world that we do, but that is not how The Archers see it. Where there is reality we find fantasy and where there is fantasy we find reality, the two are fused in an intoxicating mix which sweeps all before it in a delicious and entirely irresistible torrent of delirious emotion from first scene to last. Take the opening and closing scenes as examples. They are set before and after Peter jumps and recovers from his operation (ie; not affected by his death) and the settings are very real. In the opening scene Peter is strapped to his seat in a flaming airplane, his fellow airman Trubshaw is dead and his eyes stare out of his corpse in highly dramatic fashion. And yet the conversation with June is sheer fantasy (June even says, This is such nonsense!) with Peter raving giant gobbits of metaphysical poetry as he falls in love with someone hes never seen (I love you June  Youre life and Im leaving you!) in the most bizarre way. The film closes on the very real scene of Peter and June united with their whole lives before them, but it starts with one of the most bizarre shots of the whole film as Conductor 71 throws back the chess book from the stairway and theres a horizontal split across the center of the screen, the upper part in b/w rolling up with the stairway and the lower part in colour as Powell zooms in on Peters bag as June closes it with a very audible zip. The whole trial/operation was mostly fantastic and we arrive back in reality with a sense of narrative completion, and yet The Archers give us a quote from Murnaus Sunrise, the ending of which is as fanciful as cinema gets.

Within this realistic frame shot through with fantasy the film seeks to contradict realism with every scene  Peters arrival on the beach replete with sentinel watch dog and nude goat boy straight out of Greek mythology suggests heaven only to have a low-flying bomber zoom overhead waking Peter up to reality where he just happens to meet June on her bike!; Two visitations from Conductor 71 in space should strictly be in b/w, but they are in colour with the stopped motion suggestion of fantasy being very obvious especially when Conductor 71 invisably rights a table with books and steals the chessbook; the sheer plastic artificiality of the Garden of Eden; Reeves camera obscura; the use of the Schoenbergian tone-row (which should be used in heaven) in the country house as the Shakespeare rehearsals take place; the giant eyelid that closes off the light on the operating table as Peter is knocked out; and then most obviously of all when the jury descend the stairway to see the operation all shown in colour when we should be watching in b/w. Conversely, the realism of these scenes is also stressed, especially surrounding Reeves and his medical diagnosis of Peter. Phrases like arachnoid adhesions involving the olfactory nerve might sound like movie techno-speak, but Powell/Pressburger put a lot of effort into researching epilepsy and neurological science. Powell took advice from his brother-in-law Joseph P. Reidy, a plastic surgeon who had worked closely with Dr. Hugh Cairns, an Oxford professor of neurology who had operated on airmen during the war. Similarly, Pressburger had read Frygers Karinthys Round My Skull (1939). As Diane Broadbent Friedman says in her essay on the Powell/Pressburger Pages site entitled A Matter of Fried Onions Reeves diagnoses and the operation we see in the film is very close to reality with many doctors and nurses publically confirming this after they had seen the film.

The Archers accentuate the realism of the heavenly fantasy scenes as well. This is especially obvious in the very first scene in heavens waiting room where an angel (Kathleen Byron) checks in the new arrivals and dispenses wings. The fantasy is obviously there, but we notice a soda pop machine for the American airmen and Trubshaw observing the all too human bureaucracy of it all  Holy smoke! If anyone had said clerks worked up here just like on earth to which the angel answers, There are millions of people on earth whod think it heaven to be a clerk. A bureaucratic mistake announced by numbers Invoiced 91,716, Delivered 91,715 continues the realism as the Chief Recorder (Joan Maude) berates Conductor 71 for his oversight. Then much later there is the very notion of a court of appeal in heaven with all the associated legal paraphenalia which reminds us that though what we are watching is fantasy, reality plays a large part as well. The debate between Farlan and Reeves ranges over many topical thorny issues which were controversial in 1945/46. All the facts Farlan cites are historically accurate from the tax on tea in 1766 to the report to the senate in 1944 by four senators. Reeves makes a point of underlining the veracity of Farlans examples, only questioning the bad conscience that lies behind the stating of them.

This deliberate blurring of realism with fantasy cuts right to the heart of all thats best in Powell/Pressburger. They offer a perfectly logical system to us via various binary combinations, but then undercut it with a stress on the central unknowability of the universe, of people and of love itself. Following through their intention of seeking to see it all clearly and at once, as in a poets eye they give us a film full of ambiguous poetry both in the dialogue and in the extraordinary photography. The cinematographer Jack Cardiff worked wonders here to produce shot after shot of the most gorgeously textured film in existence. It was his suggestion that they shoot the whole film in colour so as to give a pearly effect to the b/w sequences when they were processed that way. The colour scenes are just as dazzling as the b/w sequences  the depiction of the beach, the Garden of Eden, Reeves home, the country house and that amazing stairway to heaven whether shot in b/w or colour. My favorite shots of all though come at the end as the judge is reciting Scott and we have two stunning shoulder portraits, the first of Kathleen Byron and the second of Joan Maude. This is the first time we have seen them in close up and in colour and the darkly romantic expression on their faces in the halflight as the judge eulogizes love is rapturous. The same word sums up the whole film for me for its truly a heady experience full of light, beauty and everything thats positive about human existence. Who says metaphysical speculation necessarily has to be dour and grim?",1492387200,,26542,4.846934274371416

It has been my favorite movie of all time ever since, and I often use a CD of it as a present when appropriate. I am happy that it is still available on DVD",1491350400,,244,3.784313725490196

Also, the copy is from the British release of the film, as the title reads ""A Matter of Life and Death"".  Otherwise, the DVD is watchable on both computer and Xbox One, with no accessible menu, and the  video quality is acceptable for a release this old.",1488240000,4,369,4.71875

Seems like a pirated copy to me - The film itself starts as soon as you stick it in the machine.  No menu or anything.  Just the film.  Which is awesome, but I hate hate hate the idea of supporting pirates.  Maybe the manufacturers can confirm it isn't and explain the dodgy printing on the jacket and disc itself.",1482883200,8,486,4.5813953488372094
