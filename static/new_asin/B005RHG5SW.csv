8484271,5,B005RHG5SW,"I love old movies and love Ginger Rogers and would love to have this. But the only copy of it for sale on this page, which clearly states that it is a DVD, is a VHS copy. If no DVDs are available for sale here, then the product should be designated as VHS. Very disappointing.",1328140800,9,276,4.036363636363636
