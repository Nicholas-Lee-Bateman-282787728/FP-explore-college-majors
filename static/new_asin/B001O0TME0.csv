3725743,5,B001O0TME0,"My 2 year old grandson is crazy about Thomas the Tank Engine.  I had purchased a couple of full length Thomas videos, and they were too long for his attention span.  So I was happy to find these shorter episodes.  He would probably watch all the way through this one, but I really don't like him to watch too much TV.  I think it is more important for him to do interactive activities.  A little TV goes a long way to calm him down when he is getting too wild.

I read one review of a Thomas video which complained that the engines were mean to each other, and the person didn't want their child to watch it.  I feel differently.  My grandson doesn't have other children to play with very often, so he hasn't learned to share, or play nicely with others.  I think there are some pretty good lessons on interpersonal relationships in these stories.",1303257600,3,847,4.343949044585988
