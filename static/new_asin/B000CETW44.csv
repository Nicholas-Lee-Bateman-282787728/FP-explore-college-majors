8098478,1,B000CETW44,"dont waste yuor money on this low grade vedio, you can hear people talking in the back ground ,all i got was a lot of double images with all the animals and also looks like they used a low grade camcorder dose not work with a 3d tv and shutter glasses",1317772800,,251,3.9411764705882355
8098479,1,B000CETW44,"This is in side by side format,and does not work with any of the 3d options for viewing 3d on my Samsund 3d tv that will even convert regular tv into 3d tv. Do not buy this and expect 3d viewing capability.",1307577600,,206,3.9285714285714284
8098480,3,B000CETW44,"3D is good, the menu is a little annoying.  If the zoo znimals were shown without the menu, it would have been better. Overall the dvd is worth having for your 3D collection.",1195948800,,174,4.2727272727272725
8098481,2,B000CETW44,...but the interface is a bit annoying--you can't simply watch all footage--you have to navigate a menu between each short segment (each segment featuring a different creature).  From the makers of Around the Alps and 3D Hawai'i.  Check out that evil Tapir!  This requires the electronic 3D shutter glasses (field sequential 3D) for proper viewing.,1139356800,2,348,5.290909090909091
