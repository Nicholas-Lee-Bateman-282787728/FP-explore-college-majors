8189390,5,B000P6R5R0,Anyone attempting to portray Sam Byck in Assassins should watch this program. They did an outstanding job with this story and brought to life a man and a time that was so divisive in our history. I can only imagine the terror onboard that plane.,1372723200,,245,4.466666666666667
8189391,5,B000P6R5R0,"I was deeply saddened and somewhat angered after finally watching this movie. I was one of the attendants on board that flight, which subsequently ended my career with that particular airlines. Although we were treated with disdain, I'm very thankful to be alive along with the other two African American flight attendants who experienced the ordeal. Until that film was documented, no one had spoken to us about that morning in Baltimore. One attendant was still relunctant after two decades and chose not to be interviewed. Airport security has come a long way since 1974; this is a must see documentary.",1341273600,4,606,5.00990099009901
8189392,4,B000P6R5R0,"This is an amazing story, all of this happened when I was 10 years old and I lived 4 doors down from Samual Byck, I asked my parents if they knew about this story and they had no idea. All they knew is that he did something against the government and was killed in the process. After viewing the story I can state that this was Samual Byck and an amazing part of US history",1327536000,,373,3.986666666666667

8189394,5,B000P6R5R0,"The story of Sam Byck is a laugh a minute until you see what he nearly accomplished.  Bipolar and disgruntled, Sam Byck embarks upon a mission to hijack an airliner and fly it into the Nixon White House in retribution against the Small Business Administration.  Their rejection of Byck's tire-peddling business, Byck Tires (pronounced bick, not bike), had pushed him over the edge.  His plan is to use a gasoline bomb as a threat to seize control of commercial jet liner and fly it into the Executive Mansion -- 27 years before 9/11.  Byck has to drive more than 100 miles to reach the airport at a time when the Arab Oil Embargo was creating lengthy gas lines everywhere, and he chooses to buy gasoline a gallon at a time.  Byck finds the all gasoline he needs without waiting anywhere, and his spontaneous terror attack is disrupted only when fast-thinking security officers shoot out the tires -- of the jet.  This is the chapter of the U.S. Presidency that may have driven Nixon to release all of the Wategate tapes.  Release all the tapes, but distract history from the Plot to Kill Nixon.
