4255910,4,B0043LMF1O,"I didn't want to take away from the show by giving it fewer stars, but the one episode I watched was barely watchable due to the terrible video quality. I understand the prime streaming is just an add-on to the actual prime membership, but that was unexcusable. The video was blurry 95% of the time, and I mean BLURRY.  I have two other streaming video services and have never seen quality this bad.  Love the show, but amazon prime needs work.",1363737600,2,444,4.469135802469136

8415090,5,B0043LMF1O,"I love  Say Yes To The Dress Atlanta! It's a smaller staff and lots of southern charm and southern drama from the brides and their families and friends, but count on Monty and Lori to save the day! There are plenty of touching and very funny moments in every episode and as a Northerner, I never know just what will come out of their mouths to make me laugh out loud.  Every season is great fun, and I have watched them all pretty much now. Great fun for bridal fun! Loved them all and I love Monty and Lori!",1391558400,,508,4.121212121212121
