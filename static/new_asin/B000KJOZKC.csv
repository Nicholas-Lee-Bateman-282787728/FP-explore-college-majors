numbers on each, 1 and 2.
That about sums it up.  Home movies transferred at home, but an interesting
insight into 1939.  A chance to see home movies 70 years later.",1313280000,,241,4.333333333333333
8157179,3,B000KJOZKC,"As others have pointed out, these are DVD-Rs. Most of the content is silent. Also, the image quality suffers due to heavyhanded video compression; blocky artifacts are visible in scenes with fast motion.

But with all that said, this is a fantastic opportunity to see the 1939 World's Fair in detail--not just in carefully edited snippets, as in the Jason Robards ""World of Tomorrow"" documentary.

The Medicus Collection color home movies, which make up most of this two-disc set, cover the exteriors of just about every building and attraction, and the interiors of many. This wasn't just a quick once-over... Mr. Medicus obviously spent many days at the fair, documenting everything he saw on hours of Kodachrome film. (Color film and processing weren't cheap, so it must have cost him a pile of money.)

Watching these videos is the closest we'll ever get to wandering the avenues of the Fair, and it's a wonderful experience!",1260057600,3,929,4.980645161290322
8157180,4,B000KJOZKC,"Be aware... these are DVD-Rs you're buying.  The cover is a black and white photocopy... not the color Amazon image.  Still, the content makes up for that as I can't imagine where else you'd fine such fantastic footage.",1242864000,3,219,4.7368421052631575

Definitive document of pre-World War II futuristic utopian thinking, as envisioned by General Motors. Documents the 'Futurama' exhibit in GM's 'Highways and Horizons' pavilion at the World's Fair, which looks ahead to the 'wonder world of 1960.'

Leave It to Roll-Oh 1940 8:42

Tongue-in-cheek film showing a domestic robot freeing housewives of their chores (and intimating that their work is hardly necessary); actually a promo showing how relays and switches function in the modern automobile. Shown at the New York World's Fair in 1940.

An RCA Presentation: Television 1939

Early promotional film introducing TV to the American public, probably coordinated with the rollout of scheduled broadcasting at the 1939 New York World's Fair. Shows scenes of television production at the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) studios at Rockefeller Center, New York City, using equipment manufactured by NBC's corporate parent RCA.
