This shocking story is more restrained than the original movie. Which was better? Which was truer to the original book? Per Wahl and Maj Sjwall wrote ten mystery novels between 1965 and 1975 that used Swedish society as the background. You may find them better novels.",1408665600,,3659,4.914239482200648
