8110551,4,B000EJ9V9I,"This double feature presented by VCI Entertainment is an excellent product for the price. The films included are the classic ""B"" film noirs D.O.A. (1950) and the Hitch-Hiker (1953). Both films are fast paced and enjoyable and also are great representations of classic film noir. Most people probably already know about the plots of the films and such, so the review and rating here are purely for the product presented. The two movies are presented on a single disc in a standard dvd case. This DVD has a little more flair than other public domain films I have purchased, with the packaging actually looking decent and the title menus being unique looking but still functional. Neither movie has been restored or thoroughly remastered, but the prints appear to be in satisfactory condition. There are some noticeable problems beyond dirt and dust on the picture, but overall the picture quality for both films is very watchable. The audio is also surprisingly good, and I wasn't forced to continually adjust the volume like I often have to do with public domain films. These are by no means up to say Warner Brother's or Criterion's picture and audio standards, but they are definitely better than the vast majority of public domain DVD's. I have a digital copy of D.O.A., that I downloaded from the internet archive, and this picture and audio quality of this DVD release are much better by comparison. If you are looking for a copy of either of these films and do not feel like shelling out the money for the well done but now discontinued Image Studio releases, this DVD is the one for you. Ultimately, at $5 this is a DVD release that can't be passed up by lovers of classic film noir.",1287532800,2,1689,4.728813559322034
8110552,5,B000EJ9V9I,"VCI Entertainment presents ""D.O.A./The Hitch-Hiker - Edmond O'Brien"" --- (Dolby digitally remastered)...featuring top performances by actors to die for from the '40s and '50s with outstanding drama and screenplays...from little known films we now refer to ""film noir"" that will leave you intrigued with all the suspense...so pop some popcorn, sit back and enjoy the movie.

First up we have ""D.O.A."" (1950)  (83 min. B/W)...under director Rudolph Mate, producer Leo C. Popkin, screenplay by Russell Rouse and Clarence Greene, music score by Dimitri Tiomkin ...the cast includes Edmond O'Brien (Frank Bigelow), Pamela Britton (Paula Gibson), Luther Adler (Majak),  Beverly Campbell (Miss Foster), Lynne Baggett (Mrs. Philips), William Ching (Holliday), Henry Hart (Stanley Philips), Neville Brand (Chester), Laurette Luez (Marla Rakubian), Jess Kirkpatrick (Sam Haskell), Cay Forrester (Sue),Virginia Lindley (Jeanie), Michael Ross (Dave), Carolyn Hughes (Kitty), Jerry Paris (Bell Hop), Frank Gerstle (Dr. MacDonald), Beverly Garland (Miss Foster), Lawrence Dobkin (Dr. Schaefer). . . . . .our story is a strange one, never before were these words ever uttered on ""I want to report a murder...mine.""...from then on it's a roller coaster ride with flashbacks galore up to the present time...Edmond O'Brien is told he has received a deadly poison known as iridium...within  24 hours O'Brien must locate his murderer, not telling his fiancee Pamela Britton what is going she must help him trace the shipment of iridium...the suspense is almost unbearable and the acting in each scene is superb...with no antidote he has at most, a week to live...the question is who did this and why, this is a nail biter. . . . . .special footnote, Edmond O'Brien had a famous quote - ""Versatility is a dangerous thing. It's very satisfying to portray many types of roles, but often your own identity gets lost. Seldom does a producer say, 'This is an Eddie O'Brien part.' On the other hand, while the rewards may be great in fame and financially for stars, the work becomes monotonous. No actor who plays himself is a happy person.""...Mr. O'Brien was truly a great actor during his time on stage and in films.
