Yes, I agree that it's a shame about some of the jokes being a bit TMI when so many other choices could have been made; however, the method of teaching the narrative arc of the Bible can't be faulted (in one viewing, we knew all 12 colours), and our group of 10 children (from 14 down to 6) were absolutely hooked when watching and listening to the reasons we should read the Word and love it so much more.

Here is where I also admit that I'm not Catholic. We're doing this study with a family who is. There are occasional references to parts of the Catholic mass, and some prayers that include invocations of saints, but so far, there isn't anything we diverge on so much that we can't learn a huge and valuable lesson about our responsibility to know God more, and use his Book for doing it.

Now I have to go out and buy a Bible with the Apocrypha in it -- woot-woot!",1380240000,3,1049,4.261306532663316
8340810,5,B001T8GOYS,I highly recommend this course not only for Teens but for Catholic Adults who have not been trained in how to read and speak to God with the Bible!  Excellent and Mark Hart is very engaging!,1363824000,,190,4.277777777777778
