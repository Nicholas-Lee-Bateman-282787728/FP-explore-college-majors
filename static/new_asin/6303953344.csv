752837,5,6303953344,"First of all, let me say tha Im very happy that he classic Hana Barbera cartoons are finally getting some dvd time. Im excited that as a fan of anything produced by the Barbera studio diring this time, Im cant express how wonderfull such masterpieces are being imortilised in such an archival media.
  I highly recomend anyone with any faint impulse of nostalgia, to consider aquiring these tittles, as it will not only boost anyones collection, but motivate the studios to put out more of the classic stuff.
  This review refers to all the Hanna Barbera DVDs being released.",1079481600,5,575,4.777777777777778
752838,5,6303953344,"When I heard that Johnny Quest series was being released on disc
I almost fainted. This was not only one of the best animated series
to crank out of the Hanna and Barbera factory but still remained on
top as one of the most intelligent. I never really considered it on
a cartoon level because the characters seems so 3 dimensional.
Sure there was the comical antics of Bandit and a living Mummy here
& ahovercraft there but you also learn a real facts about radiation
or how a laser works or what the Russkies & Red China might be up to(and these were pretty hot topics in the early '60's.) The show
just always had a way of being entertaining without being boring
or overstimulating. A feat unfortunetly rare on today's tube.
The moment you hear that infamous Jungle Jazz beat opening theme
you know your in for the best half an hour (20 min?) ride of your
life because ""this IS the adventures of Johnny Quest!""",1079308800,7,912,4.434523809523809
752839,5,6303953344,With horrible BOX ART!  What is WARNER BROTHERS thinking?  They have the classic style guides from DOUG WILDEY and ALEX TOTH But they use a 3rd rank artist to do an important box cover like this?  Anyway....the series is EXCELLENT and I will be getting this set for sure.  I will just have to cover up the bad art with some of the original art from the series.  STEVE RUDE even did box art that was wonderful when the set was slated for LASER DISC a few years back.  Oh well....,1079049600,7,478,4.197802197802198
752840,5,6303953344,"Just found out that this SUPER series is finally coming to DVD, ...Santa got my letter. This show along with ""The Flintstones"" is truly a favorite of mine.

752841,5,6303953344,"Jonny Quest is one of the all time best animated shows ever made.  It holds it up very well, forty years after its initial release.  I am thrilled that Warner Home Video is releasing this title and the others in the ""Hanna-Barbera Golden Collection"" series.  I hope that other classic H-B characters, in particular Huckleberry Hound, will get their own DVD box sets as well.  I am going to enjoy this one, as well as the Flintstones, Scooby-Doo and the Jetsons.  I am hoping that more of the classic Hanna-Barbera characters will show up soon on DVD.  I don't want it to be another character collection set like ""Cartoon Crackups;"" give each character their own DVD set.",1078444800,3,670,4.683760683760684
752842,5,6303953344,"This along with the other 3 videos were released in about 1995.  Based on the popular 1964 t.v. cartoon show Jonny Quest. Which still remains one of my favourite cartoons of all time.
Among the 2 episodes featured on this video there is the classic CALCUTTA ADVENTURE and PIRATES FROM BELOW.  Both are great episodes and will bring back good memories for sure.  Plus there are 2 bonus toons, a world premier toon as well as a classic episode of Space Ghost featuring Spider Woman and the Lizard Slavers! It doesn't get any better than that does it?
This video along with the other 3 are classic gems and would fit nicely in any collection.  Highly reccommended!!!",984787200,13,663,4.641025641025641
753247,4,6303953344,Jonny Quest is one of the best cartoons ever and gets 4 stars.  However the Boomerang version on Amazon Prime is shown in an incorrect aspect ratio that destroys the picture making everyone short and fat.  In fact many cartoons on the Boomerang channel are stretched for widescreen TV's.  It's annoying as it's not my TV it's the source.,1522368000,,337,4.677966101694915

I have to say the picture quality for a DVD is top, you won't get much better on DVD. I can see there are some spots that are not completely clean but it is still pretty good, colors are very nice and bright. The only thing I find annoying is that the 3 discs come piled up on top of each other instead of being hold individually in a more protective way. Other than that at this price range, $13 I think, I have nothing to complain about. The discs are region locked.",1512518400,,631,4.180327868852459

753443,5,6303953344,"This review is for the Amazon streaming version of the series.  I wouldn't go so far as to say that Jonny Quest received a restoration, but I do believe this version at least was created from better prints that were used for the previous DVD releases. To me, the video looks smoother with no apparent digital compression artifacts that are annoyingly noticeable on my DVDs and definitely less dust and dirt specks are visible (still present in a few instances but absolutely an improvement from the previous DVDs/prints). The Amazon streaming version is just an overall better presentation than any DVD set I have owned. Also, the audio seems to have more punch than my DVDs as I noticed better fidelity and more present bass - which is definitely appreciated with Hoyt Curtin's percussion heavy score!  Of note, the previous ""PC"" dialogue edits in the DVDs (The Pursuit of the Po-Ho and Monster in the Monastery) have NOT been edited in these versions.",1510790400,3,953,4.840490797546012

I had bought this version hoping, as this was the 60th anniversary Diamond Collection, that they would have restored the few pieces of audio that had been edited out in the earlier version, and that they would have thrown in a few more extras. Unfortunately, neither was the case. The Golden Collection was 4 discs, it folded out, with the episode titles and multiple pictures from the series on the flaps. The discs were colorful with the number of the disc and a full color picture of a main character on each. It took up the room of more then one DVD case but less then 2. The Diamond Collection has a slip cover over one DVD case. There is an insert with the titles which has some pictures from the series on it. There are 3 discs, stacked on each other in the DVD well. The discs themselves are plainer, each one numbered, with line art of 3 of the 4 characters. I haven't compared all the episodes yet, but I haven't noticed any discernible difference in quality.

I know, I know, I know!  It's only a cartoon, but jeeez-o-pete!  Can we have at least ONE episode of Jonny Quest where this idiotic mutt that never seems to grow beyond puppyhood DOES NOT run off half-cocked after the bad guy, the monster, the threat or whatever is causing the problem in the story and get himself or one of the heroic foursome (Jonny, Hadji, Dr. Quest or Race) in any more trouble or peril than they're already in from the outset of the plot,, PLEASE????  I mean Jesus Marimba!!  There's no other recurring character in any other cartoon show from my youth that I can remember that I just would like to see either blown up, slowly tortured, captured and killed or annihilated in an assortment of wonderfully painful ways other than Bandit!!!  There is no other cartoon canine that I can recall watching during my youth that I can actually think of praying to the great cartoon gods to just let their owner to LET THEM DIE other than Bandit!!!  Not only was this idiotic pup extremely stoopid and possessed of the greatest Napoleonic complex since Scrappy Doo (another annoying cartoon canine from a different era) but this French Bulldog mix (I imagine that's what this mutt was, since he never got any larger than a handful) had to be the most disobedient little dog I had ever seen that wasn't cast as a villain's sidekick, like Muttley!!!  At least Muttley got laughs because he was SUPPOSED to be disobedient to his master, cause him trouble and THEN laugh at him as he extricated HIMSELF from the perilous circumstance and watched Dick Dastardly get himself blown up by his own trap, failing once again to catch, kill or even slow down Yankee Doodle Pigeon!  :)  But I digress!  I truly do love this cartoon series and seriously give an emphatic thumbs-up to The Original Adventures of Jonny Quest, starring his brilliant, ingenious dad, the absolutely, most marvelous and smartest human being on the planet (at least at the time), Doctor Benton Quest; his bodyguard, pilot, mentor/tutor/babysitter and all-around ex-super spy sidekick, ""Race"" Bannon; the mystical/magical boy, and imparter of East Indian class, Hadji the Magnificent; and, of course, what every all-American boy could never be without: the cute, spunky little puppy that was never afraid of anything (at least until it was funny enough to be) that ALWAYS himself got into trouble, Bandit!  I finally got the chance to watch all 26 episodes of this fabulous cartoon series and it was absolutely marvelous!  Besides that one teeny, tiny little minuscule problem with Bandit, it was superb!

753728,5,6303953344,"Loved it as a kid in the 60's, every Saturday morning. I made sure my kids got to grow up with it too on vhs, and now my grandson of 5 has seen it 100 times, and loves it. I even converted an old 12"" GI Joe into a Race Bannon for him with a red shirt and white hair. The Robot Spy is still suspenseful, The Invisible Monster is still a great and creepy episode, and the jazz score is incredible. At a time when James Bond was dominating the box office and spy shows were on every channel, Jonny Quest bridged the gap for kids and parents on a Friday night as two 11 year olds assisted their scientist father and faithful bodyguard in thwarting the bad guys. Then of course it went on to run for years on Saturday mornings. I thought there would be several seasons but there's just this one and it far outshines the attempts at revival in later years. This is the gift I buy for friends with young kids and it's never failed to be a hit. Great adventure, kids and adults working together with character, courage, and respect, always to defeat evil around the world. Yes it's been edited, and I hate that, but better than  to not have it at all, and my kids wouldn't know the difference.  Let's all just hope they don't totally ruin it when it becomes a live action movie.",1496534400,6,1270,4.200819672131147

One night while absolutely bored I decided to download this show online. BEST MUSICAL SCORE FOR A SHOW EVER.

753784,4,6303953344,"When I was a kid, watching Jonny Quest was the only reason to get up on a Saturday morning. It might have been ""kid"" oriented, but it had an adult sensibility, and frankly still does. It fit in with the time's fascination with spies and espionage, along with monsters and supernatural forces all explained away with sound scientific logic. Really heady stuff if you were a kid, made you feel smart just watching it. I do have a quibble with it watching the original shows today, however. As at least one reviewer has noted, some of the non-PC dialogue has been excised, but one thing that cannot be excised is the race and ""ethnicity"" of most of the ""bad guys."" If they are evil geniuses or mad scientists, the ""bad"" guys are usually Chinese or some other Asian nationality, while inhabitants of Africa and Latin America are laughably portrayed as ""savages"" from a different time, like the Stone Age, or some other Darwinian racial fantasy. I don't think the writers of the show intended to be racist, but rather felt compelled to stage the action in ""exotic"" locations like isolated jungles, deserts and islands; the Vietnam War was going on, us fighting ""bad"" Asians in those jungles, but ""kids"" were apparently not ""ready"" to be indoctrinated about Cold War Russian saboteurs or face the ideology of Nazi types or ""lone nuts"" plotting to blow-up federal buildings. But other than that quibble, the ""cool"" factor of the show hasn't diminished much for me.",1489795200,,1457,4.785714285714286

There is real peril to the show, even as the heroes are shot at with machine guns from their enemies.

754307,5,6303953344,"Jonny Quest is in my opinion at the pinnacle of animated shows.  It has everything.  To me the first step is good animation, and the animation, while not flashy like some modern shows, is realistic, detailed, and all in all very impressive for being as old as the show is.  I don't care how good someone says a show is, if I don't appreciate the animation I won't like the show.  Jonny Quest is also in a league of its on when it comes to action.  The amount of gunfire and danger is amazing, but there are other shows that have plenty of that.  What really sets it apart is people are actually killed whether it be by explosion, invisible monster, or (and this is unheard of to me) by being shot.  I don't think I've ever seen another animated tv show(that's target audience is kids anyway) where you actually see someone get shot and killed.  No blood can be seen or anything but it's refreshing to watch a show where things like that actually happen.  They didn't shy away from anything in this show.  If you can't tell I am a huge fan of animated shows with realism in them, and Jonny Quest reached a level that, in all my searching, no other show has been able to surpass.  Batman TAS put forth a great effort and while I like batman better than Jonny Quest overall, even in batman there were too many instances where someone obviously would be killed but somehow they survive or something corny like falling off a building and grabbing hold to a small windowsill as if anyone could do that.  Jonny Quest is one of my all time favorite shows with great animation, characters, stories, action, and warm relationships with family.",1469664000,2,1633,4.461279461279461

It's a shame that we as a society have come to the point that a classic cartoon is being changed for the sake of political correctness. I'm glad to have the episodes, but I would immediately buy a new set without edits.

Two examples I specifically remember

1. Race Bannon in ""Pursuit of the Po Ho""
- He comes out of the water painted purple and his mouth moves but no words come out. Originally he calls the Po Ho ""ignorant savages"" and ""heathen monkeys""

2. Johnny in ""Monsters in the Monastary""
- One of the yeti is falling towards Johnny. Originally Johnny says ""Uh-oh. Here comes the Oriental Express."" This has been removed and all you see is his Johnny's mouth move.

Once again it's sad to see such a great cartoon being changed due to political correctness.",1466035200,74,950,4.570588235294117

It is riddled with humorous subtext, and clearly serves as potent inspiration for a great deal of animated comedies on television today such The Venture Bros, Archer, and more. It takes a lot of patience to watch some of the egregiously racist moments in this show, however. I'm not saying this to tarnish the intentions or legacy of the show creators, but in retrospect many scenes are cringeworthy. On the plus side, the character of Race Bannon persists today as a stalwart of masculinity and it amuses me how often you find Race chillin' without hardly any clothes on. +1",1460160000,,593,4.711538461538462

There are, oddly, numerous other unedited times when ""savages"" is used in that very episode. All that aside, it is an exciting, fun cartoon; great to reminisce for people who were around when it was first aired. I think it would be interesting to modern audiences as well.

It was one of the best cartoons ever made, 2nd only to Bug Bunny / Looney Tune produced in the '50s and '60s.  Jonny Quest was like a James Bond adventure for kids.

My sisters and I looked forward for this cartoon. You know it had Dr. Quest a brilliant scientist,his son Jonny and best friend Haji. And last but not least there was the black and white family dog Bandit. I truly enjoyed espionage type action that made the cartoon such a hit with our generation.

755231,5,6303953344,"I watched the series during its initial broadcast when I was young.  I watched it again with my brother, who is ten years younger than me,  during repeat broadcasts on television.  The image and sound quality were very clear for these DVDs.

I read reviews about the original episodes being made politically correct (remastered)  by the owning studios. They also restored the color and video quality.  I did not notice the revised over-dubbing of  politically correct dialogue of spoken lines or eliminated scenes.

If you have  never seen these shows, think of  James Bond for children mixed with some science education.  If you let your children watch PG or PG13 movies, you should find nothing offensive in these.  They are G rated, if you accept some violence - hitting and shooting the bad guys.

There was talk years ago about Steven Spielberg making a movie.  Who knows if we will ever see one, but fans all have their own personal vision of what they think a good Jonny Quest movie would be like.  One day, maybe it will be at theaters.",1423958400,,1044,4.69060773480663

755295,4,6303953344,"Jonny Quest is an iconic TV series. In some ways compromises and short cuts made by the producers, for example - the inclusion of the 'juvenile' puppy character ""Bandit"" -  made it fall just short of being 'great'. It really could have been the first animated TV adventure series for adults, but it just missed. In a sense, Jonny Quest highlighted a path that wasn't taken, although it did prepare the ground for later, more conventional 'adventure' cartoon shows, like Scooby Doo, that pitched to the younger demographic. The plots, international locations and brushes with the cold war world of spies and intrigue, give the series a ""techno-thriller"" aspect that was ahead of it's time. For my money the background art work in Jonny Quest is some of the best you will see in TV cartoons.",1423699200,2,789,4.801470588235294

It's real life qualities pale beside modern animation, but back in the late sixties when this came out it was AWESOME. The reason I wrote a review on this particular installment is because it scared me silly as a child. But it was a thrilling kind of scary. This ""cartoon"" scared me WAY more than...oh..let's say, The Creature From the Black Lagoon, or Dracula. For it's time, Johnny Quest (each frame painstakingly drawn and painted)  absolutely astonishing.",1415318400,7,609,4.8

As an early teen I was just coming off reading the famous TOM SWIFT books (a few yrs. previous) and just getting into the James Bond craze, bubble gum cards and all, when International intrigue hit television in the form of JONNY QUEST, a definite meld between both the scientific juvenile series novels and the more current scientific ""spy"" craze. I was in pop/pulp fiction heaven as an impressionable youth, Tom Swift + James Bond = JONNY QUEST!

755451,5,6303953344,"The original Jonny Quest cartoon series was considered so cutting edge that its first run on television was during primetime.  Technology has left the cartoons behind a bit, but they are still fun to watch for those who remain boys at heart.  The first episode, ""The Mystery of the Lizard Men"" introduced the main characters (except Haji, who showed up later), and provided a pretty spiffy mystery.  A series of ships go missing in the Sargasso Sea.  A survivor's mumbled story interests an unnamed intelligence agency, which turns the problem over to Dr. Benton Quest.  Dr. Quest, his son Jonny, and bodyguard Race Bannon investigate the Sargasso Sea by ship, and promptly run into the mysterious Lizard Men.  What follows is pure adventure, with Cold War overtones.

Let me show you how, 1.the hovercraft airplane didn't come out till the 70's ,2 the deep sea craft didn't come out till the 80's .Remember this cartoon was made in the  60's 30 years ahead of it's time. Most realistic cartoon ever made of geeks like me. I understand your concern about the violence, yes in 2014 we have problem. The cartoon didn't make people violent, we are of a different breed. Kids now day have a problem what it is, where it's coming from i can't tell you. You look at people my age we didn't have these problems. You should make a cool movie call the adventures of Jonny Quest; and don't make hoky looking. Make it realistic looking like the show in the 60's . I can give you other, ideas that are realistic,besides the plane and deep diving machine. How about the hover craft during the opening and the music was way cool for a 6 year old boy. I grew up wanting go on wild trips. becoming a science geek. Like Dr Benton Quest. Make the MOVIE,and make it RIGHT

Bannon says his entire speech in it, so it is not edited to be more PC (thank God). I am so glad. Even if some people don't like it, it's not right to change history just because you may not like something that happened in the past.

All episodes are well done with some that may be slightly frightening for younger kids.  All characters are strong and are not wasted in any episode.  I even named my former cat after the dog in this series (Bandit).  One minor annoyance is the same beginning and ending in every episode, but nothing fast forward can't fix.

I never knew that Tim Matheson was the the original voice of Jonny Quest as he was virtually unknown to me until I saw him for the first time as 'Otter' in the movie Animal House.

A must for anyone that remembers this show and wants to show their children that 'smart' cartoons can be fun, entertaining when created successfully.

To my surprise it was the original unedited version so I purchase the whole season 1 on Amazon Prime.

i get that people don't want anything tampered with and i agree i don't either.  i don't see where they redid anything in the monsters of the monastery episode.  people are downgrading this whole release by multiple stars and all i remember is one part of one line is taken out of one episode called the pursuit of the po ho.  it wasn't the best example of diplomatic relations right there i will agree.  but to give the release 1 star when you can't get many of the episodes otherwise i just wouldn't do it when you are so happy to have it and it's only one line.
it had the best illustration of the classic cartoons on the networks for decades when practically all of them were in the limited animation style for decades.  it is really hard to animate people moving in an action cartoon and make their features look realistic.  it was also interesting in that it was an early US cartoon that dealt with countries outside the US.  a good show.",1367193600,2,1240,4.264957264957265

While these cartoons are certainly pitched to boys of the time, my 9-year old daughter has been lapping up each episode as I watch it.
It is true, as other reviewers said, that one of the episodes was censored (crudely, too) because it is now politically incorrect, and probably true also that the credits were tampered with.  While I watched the series in childhood when it originally came out, I was not bothered by these nits watching the DVD today, and might hardly have noticed them had I not read some of the negative reviews.

From the first notes of the familiar JQ theme to the closing credits each 29 minute episode is a delight.  I remember all of the adventures and even though I haven't seen the show in decades they still seem relatively fresh and are exciting.  My wife is a few years younger than I and never saw the shows when they originally aired and to my surprise she likes them too.  I agree with other reviewers that some of the audio editing of certain PC unfriendly dialog is a foul there's not enough of it to be intrusive.

UPDATE: April 2018
  Just decided to watch Jonny Quest again after re-discovering it a few years ago and its still a great show even though it is 54 years old. If you look around the internet about the original JQ you will find some critics complaining about how racist it is.  Specifically the depictions of African native tribesmen, pygmies, and Hadji are targeted as being blatant stereotypes.

  Cmon folks it was 1964 and the fact the show featured a person of color as a main character was ground breaking.  Ill concede there are some cringe-worth moments with Hadji; using a flute to tame poisonous adders or doing a rope levitation trick, but at the time those tropes squared with what we saw in National Geographic.  Of course NG now is issuing apologies about their racist portrayals of indigenous peoples.  Maybe if Dr. Quest had been captured by the Wakandans instead of the Po-Hos hed probably have received some needed cultural enlightenment instead of narrowly escaping from being roasted alive by burning coals in a pit; you have to view this in the context of 1964.  Also today Dr. Quest and Race would be under investigation by CPS for all the perilous situations they put Jonny and Hadji in.  And really, shouldn't Bandit have been on a leash?!

  Jonny Quest is a well written animated series with sophisticated storylines, terrific artistry, Bond-worthy villains, and technology that was ahead of its time that holds up decades later.  It features one of the best ever musical themes and scores that really pumps up the viewers adrenaline.  Jonny Quest is well worth seeing for baby boomers looking to indulge in a nostalgic look back and newcomers interested in discovering an old school adventure cartoon that appeals to adults as well as kids.",1315353600,,2625,4.62634989200864

756072,4,6303953344,"Premiering in ABC's primetime time slot (eventually to be picked up by ALL THREE major networks and revamped and retreaded time and again over the years), the Quest team is back in their original series run! Scientist Dr. Benton Quest, armed and dangerous, ex-government bodyguard man Roger ""Race"" Bannon, impulsive Jonny, streetwise Hadji, and endearing to few, annoying to most Bandit, traveled the world in search of adventure. From the Arctic to Calcutta, India, the Quests tangled with pirates, aborigines, monsters, assorted evil genuises, and, on repeat ocassions, the notorious Dr. Zin.  The set does, of course, have its pros and cons.

PROS

+It's the original Jonny Quest in extended episode format (roughly 26 minutes per episode). I'm young for the initial series run but my personal favorites ""Skull and Double Crossbones,"" ""Calcutta Adventure"" (Hadji's premier), ""Double Danger"", and ""The Robot Spy"" (perhaps the most famous appearance of Dr. Zin) are all here plus twenty-two more to experience for the first time.

+ For all of the cheap, underhanded edits that the execs decided it was their duty to do (if you haven't read about it yet, then I'll explain later). every gunshot, foreign-born enemy, and utterance of ""sim sim salbim!"" are still intact. Considering everyone who the Warner's execs could have pandered to, fans and newcomers are lucky to see this gem again at all.

+ Enough special features to effectively takedown a small army of ""lizard"" men, particularly the ""Video Handbook"" of heroes, villains, and destinations, ""Fun facts/Trivia"" version of ""Double Danger,"" and vintage PF Flyers ad.

CONS

-Quest encounters and succeeds against many an antagonist situated in his own time and in many parts of the world. However, when up against a more ""politically correct"" (red flag, red flag!) America, the HEATHEN MON--I mean, ""suits"" at Warner Home Video won a few battles of their own. Having experienced ""Pursuit of the PoHo"" for the first time, it is obvious that Race's dialogue has been tampered with as his lips continue to flap against silence (thanks to numerous other reviewers that I read AFTER I had ordered, I know what the original dialogue was). To which I call ""MOO!"" (a little political correctness can get real annoying real fast, can't it)?  It's been asked at least once and it bears repeating: these episodes (untampered with) were good enough for air in their own time and even untampered with in reruns to this day. Why not for the commercial DVD market?

-The title cards didn't make it off of the cutting room floor either, instead jumping straight from the jet flight to the episode title.

-Remastering? I don't know how often the occurence is repeated throughout these volumes but, for all of the dirt and debris over the first few frames of the infamous ""Pursuit of the Poho,"" it looks like it was ""remastered"" by a landfill (what is with Warner Home Video and their problem with finding suitable film material)!

-The fight sequences (to my knowledge) were left thankfully untouched but, unfortunately, so was every last sometimes painful ""Bandit-stealing"" scene (""Double Danger,"" for example, was a great episode but was filled with probably the most ""Bandit"" cuteness of them all). I guess we know who the Warners were pandering to but (gasp, call the ASPCA!) it wasn't to me.

-Okay, the HEATHEN MONK-- ""stuffed shirts"" had their reasons to toy with the content; I'll give them the benefit of the doubt for a moment. But to not properly credit Doug Wildey for his work in helping to bring this gem to the small screen (credit that the ""TRIVIA AND FUN FACTS"" version of Double Danger tries to give)? For shame, Warner Home Video!

For this extensive list of ""cons,"" is this set still worth four stars? It is from me. I repeat: this was a different time and JQ '65 was made for PRIME TIME television (the adults and older kids). Hadji was an Indian who performed magic, the fight scenes were at times graphic, and practically every villain was foreign-born. It was good enough for audiences back then and audiences today are lucky to be able to experience such art ever again. But is it still ""art"" when the artist's finished product has been noticably tampered with and airbrushed over? In a way, I am glad to be able to experience the Quest team's original escapades; so Kudos to Warner Home Video for that. But with Jonny Quest, if you're going to give us some, give us all! And if not being ""remastered"" meant that the original film would have stayed untouched (dialogue intact and proper crediting applied), maybe fans would have been more better off.

I was born in the 80s and, therefore, grew up experiencing Jonny Quest for the first time as part of the ""Funtastic World of Hanna Barbera"" and, additionally, am waiting patiently for Warner Archive to release JQ '86. Does that make me a nonpurist? Perhaps; but JQ '86 was MY first experience with the Quests, just as the original was the first experience for many fans.",1310428800,3,4988,4.887573964497041
756073,5,6303953344,"The year was 1964. While the nation's top scientists were preparing to send a manned rocket to the moon for the first time, another nasty little projectile had just made an impact crater in President Kennedy's head, sending the nation into trauma, and setting the stage for a decade of violent (and non-violent) social upheaval.

Goldfinger had just come out, creating a James Bond feeding frenzy in the media, spawning compulsive imitation of the spy genre around all around the globe, and most especially on American television.

Into this Cold war environment, Jonny Quest came blasting onto the ABC network in primetime in 1964. If one examines the series closely, it is evident that the Bondian seeds of Jonny Quest came not from Goldfinger but from the earlier James Bond incarnation, Dr. No. At any rate, JQ is a rich example of how to create a James Bond-style action adventure story -- sans the sexy girls -- that fits into a 26 minute time slot, while, in the Hanna-Barbera style of limited animation, using as few drawings as possible. Thus Jonny Quest endures the irony of describing as much action as possible with as few drawings as possible. Aside from it's exciting stories and likeable characters, this is the great charm of Jonny Quest: Maximum action and soundtrack, minimum drawings.

There are countless ""scene jumps"" to avoid cumbersome character movement. And if any non-cycling action is depicted, such as characters fighting or struggling, it never lasts for more than 3 seconds at a stretch. Because the ""locations"" from all across the world were drawings and painted backgrounds, Jonny Quest could go ""convincingly"" to places that a live action show could not afford -- even underwater.

The directorial and story style focuses on efficiency and directness, with dialogue frequently ""up front"", spelling out feelings and character motivation with blunt force -- there's little time for subtlety. Still, the short time slot makes the stories even more impactful, cramming a great deal of action into 26 minutes.

Quest pioneered a unique, hybrid-anthropomorphic look in character design, which dovetailed perfectly with it's taking the battle between science and superstition into a cultural fetish at the cartoon level. Starting out with one of the finest action-oriented show opens ever created, Jonny Quest broke new ground in the quality of it's stories and it's music.

The show's primary ideology is pro-science, pro-American, and Cold War-centric through cultural innuendo (without being specific about politics), and is a mixture of cultural inquisitiveness, cultural prejudice, and a certain lack of environmental awareness that reflects American values -- or at least network television's values -- in the early 60's. Indeed, Dr. Benton Quest seems to be at the very heart of the military-industrial complex, devising weapons for the military and running his own, sprawling laboratory complex (as in ""Robot Spy"".) It was the perfect recruiting tool to enlist boys of the sixties into the military -- or at least getting a job with General Dynamics.

In this decade, the scientist was king, so it was not really audacious to create a cartoon series with a scientist as the main character. Another endearing aspect to fans is that Jonny Quest has more ""pre-censorship"" violence, more violence than would be permissible or ""appropriate"" today, even on prime-time cable. Later in the decade of the 60's, the Federal Government, led by President Johnson on the heels of the Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy assassinations, exerted pressure on the networks through it's influential licensing arm, the FCC, to cut back on television violence.

Being an action-adventure show, the purpose of the violence is not to provoke laughs as in a typical Hanna Barbera or Warner Brothers cartoon, but it is a ""serious"" matter, consistent with mainstream comic book violence of the period; although the simplified cartoon style does permit the killing at times to veer into a humorous vein.

It's also worth noting that when Hanna Barbera tried unsuccessfully to recreate the Jonny Quest series in the late 1970's, it proved to be such a difficult task that it bankrupted the company and made a forced sale necessary.",1307577600,8,4240,5.169096209912537

So, it was a good investment to order the whole season. I noticed the one episode that edited out Race's comment to make it more politically correct. And though it's not right to mess with history, it's better having this set, than not having it at all. So I am appreciative of that.

756107,4,6303953344,"I loved Jonny Quest as a kid -- the exciting story lines, the vivid background scenery, the dramatic background music and the lifelike human characters.  In fact, the only character done in caricature is Bandit, Jonny's lovable dog -- who often provided the show's comic relief.  Even though the animation was a bit more stilted than, say, Disney or MGM shorts, it was still light years ahead of ""Scooby-Doo,"" ""Batman,"" and the other action-adventure shows that succeeded Jonny Quest.

Among the things (and people) that Jonny, Dr. Benton Quest (his scientist father), ""Race"" Bannon (his bodyguard), Hadji (his East Indian pal) and Bandit battle are lizard men, pygmies, dragons, gargoyles, and even a turu, a walking mummy, an invisible monster and a crawling eye.  Each story is packed with edge-of-your seat excitement for young viewers -- without boring their parents in the process!

This DVD set comes in a fold-out cardboard and plastic case of 3 DVDs, which are housed in individual DVD holders.  There are other bonus features, including a PF Flyer (sneakers) ad featuring none other than Jonny Quest!

However, the one thing that kept me from rating it 5 stars was the bleeping of Race Bannon calling the Po-Ho warriors ""you heathen monkeys"" (even though you can still see him mouthing the words!).  This was rather surprising, especially since Warner Brothers were not ""politically correct"" with either their ""Droopy"" or ""Popeye"" collections.  Personally, I think they should have left the dialogue in for historical purposes and put a disclaimer at the beginning of the set, as they did with both Droopy and Popeye.  But that's minor.

Otherwise, if you want the action, adventures and pure fun of yesteryear, I would highly recommend this set.",1288656000,,1756,5.083623693379791
756108,5,6303953344,"Jonny Quest, along with his scientist father, Benton Quest, government agent and bodyguard Race Bannon, foundling and friend Hadji (from India) and the little bulldog Bandit travel the world during the course of Dr. Quest's experiments and trouble shooting. Of course, in each instance, they find trouble in the persons of inimical criminals who have their own agendas, and don't want the Quests butting in.

The show was great for several reasons. A reason not to be overlooked is the short but incredibly cool jazz theme music. Second, the travels around the world and the mundane and fantastic creatures they encounter make the show occasionally educational as well as being fascinating. Third, the monsters and criminals are legitimately scary, but not too much so. Fourth, they get to use cool gadgets and transportation that are just as leading edge now as they were in the early 60s (hydrofoil boats, hovercraft, jet backpacks, diving bells, yachts, and private jets, to start with).

Jonny Quest was almost certainly inspired in part by the series of Tom Swift books published in the 50s, which had a very similar backdrop for adventure. The adventures are all fun, and tense at the same time, and I enjoy watching them occasionally still.

Tim Matheson, who has gone on to make himself famous in many adult roles, was the voice of Jonny (as well as Jace on Space Ghost). Since there is now talk of making a live action Jonny Quest movie, I think it would be outstanding if they hired Tim for the role of Dr. Quest. Rumor abounds about using Dwayne Johnson (the Rock) as Race, which I think is perfect.

Much has been made about edits to the voice track in the DVD set to make a line here or there ""PC"". I too was initially appalled by this action, as there really isn't anything offensive. Frankly, protecting a small child from hearing Race Bannon call a native tribe a group of savages seems silly when most kids that age are right in the middle of calling each other dufus and retard, and worse, but that's what the producers decided to do. However, I decided, in the end, who are these shows really for, us or our kids? For the kids, they'll never know the difference, and the stories are just as much fun. For us, after all this is an almost 50 year dated cartoon show. Its not as if they've changed Bogey's ""Here's looking at you kid"" into ""Have a nice flight, ma'am.""

Of course, you can also record these shows on Boomerang for your kids, and get the original dialog. For some reason its OK to show it on cable TV channels at midnight (EST/EDT), just not on DVDs. LOL At a show per evening, it only takes about five weeks to cycle through the one season of shows that was initially produced. Jonny Quest has been part of the Boomerang schedule for years, and doesn't look to be going away soon.",1286409600,3,2811,4.602794411177645

Since the death of his mother Jonny has become a possible pawn in enemy schemes to manipulate his brilliant scientist father, so he's being homeschooled at Quest's lab on Palm Key and travelling with him when he's called to help the Government or friendly countries in locations ranging from the Canadian North Woods to Southeast Asia and from Norway to Nepal.

The animation in this series falls well short of Disney quality but is still an improvement on that of HB's comic serials, and while Jonny is sometimes impulsive, he also has, as Race says, ""a good head on his shoulders"" and several times saves the day by coolness, courage, and quick thinking.  There are a few glitches in continuity that I find mildly irritating: Hadji first appears in Episode #2 (""Arctic Splashdown""), but his background isn't revealed till #7 (""Calcutta Adventure""); Dr. Quest's nemesis, Dr. Zin (Vic Perrin), appears in four segments, but it's never explained where he and the Quests first butted heads; the Eurasian adventuress Jade (Cathy Lewis) has two appearances but her history is never revealed, and one foe, Gen. Fong, appears in ""The Quetong Missile Mystery"" and is recognized by Race and the Quests, but we never find out how they know him.  Despite its high-tech ambience, there are some instances of very faulty science (wrecks in the Sargasso Sea in Episode #1, ""Mystery of the Lizard Men;"" a pygmy tribe in the Brazilian jungles in #14, ""Dragons of Ashida;"" a Gila monster in Maya country and an aggressive attack by vampire bats in #6, ""Treasure of the Temple;"" a reference by Dr. Quest (who should certainly know better!) to dolphins as fish), as well as a storyline featuring Muslim Arabs fearing the wrath of an ancient Egyptian god in #3, ""The Curse of Anubis"" (not that they don't have reason to, as it turns out).  But there's also a lot of intriguing stuff going on--Jonny and his team encounter, among other things, a living pteranodon trained by a human, a walking mummy, the Abominable Snowman, and what appears to be genuine magic (Hadji can perform the Indian rope trick under an open sky and do levitation).  And there's also surprisingly little chauvinism for a series that aired originally in the mid-'60's, long before the invention of Political Correctness.  With hovercraft, jet-packs, and futuristic weaponry, yet surprisingly little fatal violence, it should appeal to Baby Boomers and their kids and grandkids alike.",1269907200,,3619,6.182902584493042

I really wanted to like the newer episodes that they created later because I wanted more, but I won't even watch them, they can't hold a candle to these originals!!!I think its sad because cartoons have become a lost art, they are now done cheaply, quickly, and just can't compare in quality.

756430,5,6303953344,"I consider this to be one of, if not the, greatest animated series of all time.  It's definitely on the list of the top five best cartoon series ever assuming you like action and adventure.

I am not alone in this opinion as is indicated by the interviews on disk four with people who work in the animation business.

And this is still true after 40 years of advances in technology which you would think would cause cartoons to be better than back then.

Why is it so great ?  Many reasons.

It starts with the entire concept of two kids travelling around the world to exotic (and real) places on adventures with their father.

The art.  The writing / stories.  The voices.  The music.  All of these are exceptional.

Here's some of my favorite episodes although I like them all:

3. The Curse Of Anubis (probably my all time favorite and my lucky number)
8. The Robot Spy
14. Dragons Of Ashida
20. The Invisible Monster
23. The House Of Seven Gargoyles

This is a great dvd collection at a great price.

Disk four has some extra features where you can find out a lot of interesting facts about Jonny and company.

I like this series so much that I got a Jonny Quest tattoo.

The Hanna Barbera studios came out with some great animated series back then although not all of them have been released on dvd yet.  That's bad.  They need to release the rest of them including 'The Fantastic Four'.  Space Ghost and Birdman are available now.

756433,5,6303953344,"Jonny Quest-the Complete First Season is a guilty pleasure.  It was created by Hanna- Barbera in the early sixties.  For those of you who don't know, the animation team of Hanna-Barbera used to work for MGM's animation department.  When the department was closed, they got rich producing cheap cartoons for television.  Their creations include the classic Flintstones, The Jetsons, Magilla Gorilla, Huckleberry Hound, etc.

Jonny Quest was their foray into action adventure first televised on ABC  primetime.  This was a radical departure from the humorous offerings Hanna-Barbera was known for previously.  It combined science, technology, action, adventure and mystery in a manner that is still enjoyable over forty years later.

Jonathan ""Jonny"" Quest is the son of Dr. Benton Quest.  His scientist father is considered such a national asset, that the family is given a federal agent as bodyguard after the death of Jonny's mother.  Roger ""Race"" Bannon also is the family pilot, tutor and judo instructor.  Hajii is the adopted son, an orphan who saved Dr. Quest's life in India.  Considerable comic relief is contributed by Bandit, Jonny's fat little dog.

This series is a juvenile male fantasy.  Jonny and company live on a private island off the coast of Florida.  This is the home when they aren't fighting, sea monsters, recovering stolen artifacts, testing weapons for the Army, fighting hostile natives or the schemes of the nefarious Dr. Zin.  This series was created before political correctness or environmental awareness.  These guys travel the world in high tech aircraft (including VTOL) piloted by either Race or Dr. Quest. They have the carbon footprint of an F-18 squadron.  There are no significant female characters except Race's sometime girlfriend Jade.

Their personal technology includes hydrofoil speedboats, submarines, bazookas,  jetpacks, hovercraft, etc.  Dr. Quest is one of those scientists whose skill set would be representative of about six Phds in engineering, technology and or all things archaeology.  Their unlimited resources make feasible dropping everything and traveling 12000 miles to rescue a colleague of Dr. Quest.

This series is fun and doesn't take itself too seriously.  You don't mind things like Hajii waterskiing with a turban on.  In our world, Dr. Quest would be brought up on charges for child endangerment.  In a heartbeat, he, Race and the boys joined by Bandit are getting shot at by the villains of the week. There are explosions, monsters and scantily-clad natives throwing spears at them.  Don't forget about that mummy......

And yes the bad guys do die.

The opening theme is accompanied by a now classic theme that just lets you know these guys are going to kick butt.  Each episode ends with the same music playing so you know our boys will be at it again next episode.

You can't wait to be there with them....",1201996800,6,2879,5.1645021645021645

The majority of the episodes are so overtly wrong on many levels in terms of social awareness. So it all makes sense now why the TV watchdogs didn't allow many of these shows to be aired in the late 70s and early 80s when the reruns were viable. This fact makes the series so enjoyable! I busted my gut laughing at many of the sincere (maybe not?) points of logic made during the shows. ""Jonny, some bombs are good."" another: ""Crocodiles! Everybody grab a gun!"" Jonny and father empty cartridge after cartridge of bullets into the attacking crocs! Even though it is truly a testament to American interest in promoting multiculturalism (see Hadji) the show is actually quite good at promoting stereotypes and displaying American naiveness in the 60s. Probably, people in certain midwest communities won't understand what I'm referring to but it is simply a great time watching these episodes and picking up on the mentality of that age.

756472,5,6303953344,"I remember THIS show from way back when. JONNY QUEST debuted in 1964 on primetime TV, lasting (unfortunately) only one 26-episode season despite its ratings, after which it was cancelled by ABC, who couldn't afford it (!) because this animated show demanded so much detail.

Why the DVD is marketed as THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON is a mystery worthy of the show's protagonists as there was only one season.

After being cancelled, JONNY QUEST moved into the land of syndicated Saturday morning cartoons where it held on for seven years, before falling victim to the Children's Television Thought Police who said it was too violent for a young audience (forgetting that it had originally been a primetime show). Apparently, Warner Bros. is of the same mind, having excised some of the violence and much of the colorful language (""Hands up, you monkeys!"") from this release. Too bad. After all, JONNY QUEST was of a different era, and this Orwellian desire to bowdlerize everything and rewrite the past doesn't undo what was, it only hides it, and so the lessons are lost.

Never mind the fact that JONNY QUEST was intelligent, imaginative, visionary, and just plain well done. Hanna-Barbera, who gave us THE FLINTSTONES and THE JETSONS (and HUCKLEBERRY HOUND and QUICK-DRAW McGRAW, among many others) pulled out the stops for JONNY QUEST.

Each week, Jonny, his adopted brother Hadji (from India, and always dressed in turban and Nehru jacket), and their dog Bandit, would accompany Jonny's father, Dr. Benton Quest, an eminent scientist and explorer, and his pilot, Roger ""Race"" Bannon, to the far ends of the earth to make some kind of unique discovery or fight some exotic, usually Eurasian, evildoers.

JONNY QUEST is redolent of the atmosphere of TERRY AND THE PIRATES and the Saturday Matinee film serials of the previous generation of the 1940s. It also owes much to Young Adult book series' such as JACK ARMSTRONG, THE HARDY BOYS, THE THREE INVESTIGATORS, and TOM SWIFT and TOM SWIFT JR.

One week's episode might find Dr. Quest in danger of life and limb while investigating a Mummy's Curse in Egypt, while the next week might find the Quests in China, discovering radioactive emeralds that make time-travel spaceflight possible. Jonny Quest's planet Earth is filled with far-flung places that should be on the map, places with names like Dragonia and Mundania---places that tantalized the imagination of older and younger viewers alike.

There is much of James Bond and DR. NO in JONNY QUEST. If the evildoers are all foreign-sounding, put it down to Cold War paranoia (remember, the show hit the airwaves just two years after the Cuban Missile Crisis), and if the tribesmen and locals are a little too primitively savage and speak jungle gibberish, put that down to American naivete. Still, by presenting us with Hadji, JONNY QUEST was the first primetime show to feature a nonwhite character in a major recurring (and equal) role. It was a landmark accomplishment.

The impact of JONNY QUEST can be measured by its impact on another famous Johnny, Johnny Carson. Carson's TONIGHT SHOW character, the psychic Karnak The Magnificent (wearing an oversized turban) borrowed Hadji's mystical incantation, ""Sim Sala Bim"" for his exercises in mind-reading.

One of the best animated shows of its era, or ever, I always looked forward to JONNY QUEST, and I'm thrilled it's out on DVD. The original episodes are classics, and never grow stale.",1191283200,9,3443,5.026315789473684

They were digitally remastered so they are bright and sharp to watch with clear, full sound. It's funny, but in some ways they seem more modern, and optimistic, than anything being produced these days. They really predicted an incredible amount of present day technology.

And to tell you the truth, I first watched JQ on Saturday mornings in the '70's, so Race's line was probably censored anyway. I remember the episode but not the dialog, still... otherwise, other 'censorable items' are still intact: the boys praying, people getting shot/blown up (not graphically, more like a war movie from that era but probably graphic for it's time),creepy monsters, exactly as I remember it.

756540,5,6303953344,"When I was a boy, Saturday was a day of heady delights: Dad made us pancackes for breakfast, there was no school, cartoons all morning, and playing with friends all afternoon. There were only three cartoons that REALLY mattered: Scooby Doo, Looney Tunes (the original program), and the best of all: Jonny Quest.

Jonny Quest was/is an ingenious show. It didn't speak down to the kids. It was not science fiction, but it was certainly science ""possible"". Each week, there was a new adventure for the cast to take on and each week, it was unique and exciting in the same way that many of the low budget serials from the 50's were: they spoke to kids...they were intriguing.

Each week the cast was called upon to investigate strange scientific investigations. Each week they rose to the challenge and thrilled the audience.

The characters are: Dr. Quest (a scientist of unique distinction, often called upon to investigate strange goings on around the world), Race Bannon (ostensibly Dr. Quest's right hand man, body guard, and tutor for his son), Jonny (Dr. Bannon's 8-10 year old son who has a penchant for getting in and out of trouble and who is more than capable of assisting when called upon), Hadji (added in the first episode, Hadji is an orphaned Indian boy with the ability to perform certain feats of real magic), and Bandit (the Quest family dog).

What made the show all the more exciting was the fact that it wasn't the boys who got called on exciting missions, it was Dr. Quest. The boys either finagled their way along on the missions or they smuggled themselves along. The boys were never the primary characters, though they were more than on the periphery. It made the show very ""real"" to me. All of us boys used to talk excitedly Saturday afternoons about the Jonny Quest episode we'd watched that morning and how we would have done this or that instead of what happened. Or we'd go on and on about how cool things the stuff in the episode had been.

There are many episodes that are exciting and I won't go into them all. However, suffice it to say, that this series was too short-lived. It should have continued. It was one of the very few Hanna Barbera productions that was really well done.

When that theme song started up each Saturday morning, I would fairly quiver with excitement - even if I'd seen the episode half a dozen times before.

For those of you around my age, who fondly remember seeing Animal House when it came out in the late 1970's, you'll be interested to know that Tim Matheson voices Jonny. He was probably around 10 himself when he did the voice work.

756600,5,6303953344,"Hanna-Barbera's ""Jonny Quest"", which debuted in September 1964, remains today what it was when those 26 original episodes first aired so many years ago....and that is: one of the best animated adventure series ever created (in my opinion anyway).

The original series lasted just that one ""classic"" season (1964-1965), but ""Jonny Quest"" was revived for subsequent television series in the 1980s and again in the 1990s. But those later incarnations just couldn't match the quality, charm, and spirit of the 1960s variant.

And, fortunately, it's that original '60s version that can be accessed via these Amazon ""Unbox Video Downloads"". Very close to all of the 26 programs are available for downloading here at Amazon.

""Jonny Quest"" is a series that was quite ahead of its time in many ways. The gadgetry that can be found in virtually every episode has the word ""futuristic"" written all over it. We see flying platforms, rocket belts, sophisticated lasers, a robot ""spy"", and ""ray guns"", among other fancy-looking gear and transportation devices that are employed by the Quest team of adventure-seekers (and Dr. Quest's foes) from episode to episode.

I'm sure that many fans of this fast-moving animated series are like myself, and have vivid memories of ""Jonny Quest""....memories that will probably never fade completely away. Such as some of the gadgets I mentioned above, or possibly memories of the top Quest nemesis -- the evil ""Dr. Zin"" -- who is featured in a number of the JQ episodes.

The series' main characters (consisting of Dr. Quest and his young son Jonny, Race Bannon, and their friend Hadji, plus Jonny's faithful dog, Bandit), in addition to having to do battle with Dr. Zin from time to time, also came up against some pretty ferocious creatures in the various episodes....such as deadly spiders, poisonous snakes, gargoyles, man-eating dragons, werewolves, abominable snow creatures, wild panthers, very unfriendly sea beasts, angry pygmies, lizard men, an energy-absorbing (and invisible!) monster, and one of my favorites (in the episode ""Turu The Terrible"") -- a Quest-hating prehistoric pteranodon, which was trained by a wheelchair-bound madman, voiced by Everett Sloane. (""Kill, Turu, kill!!"")

Another great way to re-capture the fun of ""JQ"" is to purchased the DVD collection --&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jonny-Quest-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B0001MZ7J6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Jonny Quest: The Complete First Season""</a>&nbsp;-- which was distributed by Warner Home Video in May 2004. It's a highly-recommended 4-Disc set, which includes several interesting bonus supplements as well.

The ""Classic '64"" version of ""Jonny Quest"" has been released over the years on the VHS video format too, and some of those tapes aren't bad either, with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/this-4-episode-collection/dp/B00064PMBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">this 4-episode collection</a>&nbsp;being a favorite of mine. That tape also includes introductions to the four programs by series co-producers William Hanna and Joseph Barbera.

Another good ""JQ"" VHS tape is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/this-one/dp/630395331X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">this one</a>, released by ""The Cartoon Network"" several years ago.

756601,5,6303953344,"Some of you may remember reruns of the TV show, Jonny Quest on the television machine.

Jonny Quest was made in the early 1960s; the greatest years of american civilization. The tailfin years. The world of Jonny Quest is a world filled with super technology; they all have special secret agent gadgets, hovercrafts are how scientists get around land, they fly around in a supersonic jet; everything is tailfinned and jet powered. America had just conquered the atom and beat the stuffings out of the Nazis a mere 19 years before, and had turned the Empire of Japan into the empire of nice cameras and Godzilla movies. It was the time of the first generation of supersonic jet aircraft; every barrier that nature put up seemed breakable. This was the apex of the machine age. The age of optimism that built the Saturn-5 rocket that took americans to the moon. It was the age of chrome grilles and preposterous consumer items like 500 horsepower Plymouth Max Wedge engines.

The Johnny Quest adventures happen in the wilds of the world. To the western mind of the early 1960s, there were still wild lands where one could experience high adventure. Places with poisonous snakes, quicksand, animated mummies, villains in submarines, booby-trapped ivy-covered hidden temples, levitating hindus and bone-through-the-nose cannibals. Places like Bali might as well have been the dark side of the moon to an american in those days. This is completely bizarre to modern sensibilities, but it is quite true. Even in the early 1970s, being able to make a few minutes telephone call from Vietnam to America was insanely difficult. Getting to Yemen was still an adventure; people actually wrote adventure travel books which simply involved going some place weird and far away.

The animation is shockingly good. Apparently, this wildly popular show had to be canceled because the production quality was too high: it simply couldn't make enough money to justify itself. This is too bad, as amortized over its lifetime, I am sure it more than paid for itself. But people didn't have the concept of using films like high yield bonds the way the studios do now a days. Those were more innocent times, indeed.

One of the more interesting things about this show is Hadji. Hadji was the first serious kids show character in america who was from another culture. I remember being very confused why it wasn't called the ""Hadji and Race Bannon show"" -they were more interesting and sympathetic characters than Johnny Quest (who was the type of oafish kid who would give me noogies when I was younger) and Dr Benton Quest (who was a helpless wimp, really, always getting into trouble). Hadji by contrast was very well educated, and extremely composed. Not only that, but he was simply a lot smarter than Johnny. Plus he could do magic tricks, which was awesome. Since I was young when I watched this show, I identified best with Hadji. I wanted to be a sikh or a hindu or whatever he was supposed to be, so I could levitate, jump around magic jars, and pick bones out of dogs ears. Apparently, Hadji is the american soldier nickname for natives of Afghanistan and Iraq. All things considered, it seems to be a high compliment.

Race Bannon was also a great character. Back in those days, a hero could have grey hair. George Clooney aside, that doesn't exist any more. Now the hero has to have striations on their abdomens. While Dr. Quest was supposed to be the smart one, it was generally Race Bannon who knew important stuff, like what the Sargasso sea was all about, how to do judo throws, or how not to get kidnapped. I never quite figured out who Race was supposed to be, but I knew he was bad to the bone. Upon re-watching the show as an adult, I realize he was a CIA man; spies were often considered universal men in the early 1960s. He was an american James Bond sent to look after the hapless Dr. Quest and his high spirited lad.

I see this show (recently rereleased) as a sort of last ultimate embodiment of a certain kind of adventure entertainment. Men's adventure magazines died around the time Johnny Quest died; they were cut of the same cloth. Early Dr. Who was something similar, though it was more British; a kids adventure show that teaches a bit of history and geography. It's fortunate such things still exist in video form; they embody something which is really great. Will you be offended by its anachronisms? I suppose many people who calibrate their exquisitely sensitive moral barometers with a protractor made from recycled tofu, a straight edged icon with Germaine Greer's photograph in it, graph paper and a copy of the New York Times Editorial section will be offended. But such people are born to be offended. Those folks miss out on many of the great things in Western culture, like Mr. Moto movies, and the fact that they don't live next door to cannibals. I think modern kids will love it. It's not jaded, or wretched and denatured like modern kids entertainments; just wholesome adventuring.",1175817600,32,5003,4.764705882352941

756604,5,6303953344,"Here it is, the series that sent busybody do-gooder group Action for Children's Television (ACT) into apoplexy in the 1960s and 70s. The most politically incorrect cartoon series ever made.

Jonny Quest features two ten-year old boys who occasionally handle guns! Johnny Quest follows the adventures of Johnny (white) and Hadji (Aryan Indian), and their pet bulldog ""Bandit"" a preternaturally intelligent animal who is almost human with his miniature body type and cowardice of Lou Costello.

Jonny's bodyguard ""Race"" Bannon is there to keep Jonny and Hadji safe (Rutger Hauer modeled his character in ""Blade Runner off of him), and Jonny's father is famous scientist Dr. Benton Quest (you can tell he's a scientist, he has a flaming red goatee) who invents reasons for them to have lots of guns and jet planes.

Graphics are all in detailed Doug Wildey's fantastic comic-book-panel like minimalist animation.

In the Jonny Quest universe there are lots of ray guns built by evil people in exotic places, so our heroes have to race around the world blowing things up.

And yes: ""here there be dragons.""

Jonny Quest is a world without females to slow things down.....

plenty of violence and comic relief....

gigantic and expensive mechanical toys.....

evil yellow skinned mastermind criminals...mindless henchmen only there to get shot and blown up, etc.

Yes, the only thing missing from these ""Boy's Own Ripping Tales"" are the drinking and the tang.

Jet planes, hovercrafts, rockets, boats, submarines, scuba gear, lasers, guns (and lot of `em), all terrain vehicles, and real Land Rovers with all the safari gear you'd need.

Ignorant savages burbling unintelligible gibberish dropping their portage loads and running off into the jungle? You got `em Bawhana, in nearly every other episode.

Monsters? How about Pterodactyls, mummies, komodo dragons, robots, Asians, crocodiles, Africans, snakes, and women (Race Bannon's mysterious old flame, Jezebel Jade, occasionally shows up).

Because he is from the mysterious east, Hadji can levitate people at will by merely incanting ""sim sim alah-bim"" over and over again. Scientist Dr. Quest accepts this as normal.

Boys raised on Jonny Quest who then saw ""Animal House"" in high school saved fraternities and the Greek system on college campuses nationwide, since whacked `68 liberals by that time had intoned its death knell. Jonny is voiced by Animal House actor ....",1174176000,12,2422,5.270833333333333
756605,5,6303953344,"Imagine a cartoon series that teaches your kids respect of elders, doing homework, saying your prayers at night, bite-sized science lessons, respecting other cultures and people while at the same time actually killing the bad guys instead of worrying about offending them.

Welcome to Johnny Quest - A journey into TestosteroneLand where men are men, boys are boys, bad guys get killed and women are nowhere to be found.

This cartoon series is about as conservative as a cartoon can be.  You will NOT see this box sitting on the movie shelf at your liberal friend's house.  For example, attacking crocodiles get repelled with gunfire, bad guys get shot (dead), the key scientist has morals (and prefers to be armed), and ex-military bodyguards protect the kiddies by using bullwhips to crack scorpions into pieces.  Also, Dr. Beton Quest is prone to tell the boys to pray when science eventually fails to come to the rescue.

Jetpacks, hovercraft, jets, monsters, ray guns, scientific experiments, military action (tanks vs robots), bad guys, soldiers and police (being portrayed accurately in a positive light!), prehistoric beasts, cavemen, Natzi war criminals getting punished, etc.

Imagine the government only relying on REAL scientists who examine things through actual experiments and resulting data - not politicians pushing junk science like global warming, totally ignoring the millions of metric tons of greenhouse gasses and solid particulates volcanoes release and how it was warm enough for the Vikings to grow crops in Greenland 1,000 years ago.

I would have paid hundreds of dollars for this DVD set.

PS:  You might be interested to know that the title of this product is mispeading, as there was never a second season of Johnny Quest, and thus, there will be no additional DVD sets of the original Johnny Quest - this is all there is.  The original 1st-season 26 shows on this DVD set were actually stretched out over two seasons when it aired in 1964-65.  These 26 episodes are all that were ever made.  The show was also hugely successful, but the production costs (this kind cartoon-making was unprecidented at the time) killed the series.

Now that I'm nearly 50, finding all 26 episodes from the original show in one DVD set was just incredible. Watching the different episodes takes me back to an exciting time of wordly adventures through the eyes of a young boy, just like I was. Jonny Quest was funny at times, but the real interest for me came from the different locales the tales took place in and the exciting way Jonny and Hadji found their way into, and out of trouble.

Jonny Quest was the James Bond for young boys in the 60's. I have watched the four DVD's with my sons and they too watch in anticipation to see what is going to happen next. Each episode brought back more exciting adventures and great memories.

756781,5,6303953344,"This series has stuck in my head ever since I was a kid.  Upon watching it I confirmed that it really was a cool and stylish show.  The score is about as sophisticated of Jazz as you're going to find in anything from the early 60's.

There are some editing issues and a number of Cold War era stereo-types (almost all villians come from Asia / Middle East / Russia, and I don't recall any female scientists). Another issue that some modern viewers may have is the violence.  There is a lot of gun-play and other realistic hazards.  Whether this is better or worse than the poisoning and such that you find in a Disney cartoon is for you to debate amongst yourselves.

I like that the characters travel to real places with at least semi- plausible situations.  There are no magic spells, aliens, evil magicians, etc... I'd rather have my kids daydream of being a scientist and exploring the world than becoming a fairy/Wizard.

I also like that the father is a hard working, intelligent, professional, rather than some bumbling half-wit that the kids have to sneak around.  He also has high expectations of his children.  He is tough about homework, but also trusts them to be responsible for expensive and important equipment.  By equipment; I mean Hoove-crafts and boats, not iPods and Gameboys.

The second reason I bought the series is because I absolutely loath (HATE!) the cartoons that are generally found on the Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon channels.  The so-called ""edgy"" sarcasm and mean spirited (especially to adults) characters and plots are painful to watch (what are we teaching our kids?).  Even though Jonny Quest is sometimes violent (lots of guns and explosions), the overlying message is great.  Jonny has a great relationship with his dad - (I'm a single dad and this is BIG) - he and his dad have these amazing adventures together.  My son and I watch every episode together.

Hanna Barbera got very smart by packaging and marketing their most popular cartoon series, such as the Flintstones and Top Cat (two more favorites).  Jonny Quest originally aired on WABC TV on Friday night at 7:30pm for one season in 1964-65, for a total of 26 episodes.  The Flintstones were also another cartoon that ran in prime time, certainly a brave move by Hanna Barbera, as cartoons were ""kid's stuff"", reserved for Saturday morning or other non prime time venues.  Repeats began on Saturdays and I was hooked.  The voice of Jonny is listed on the credits as Tim Mathieson, who later changes his name to Matheson, whom I remember best in ""Animal House"".  I highly recommend this four DVD set, which contains some cool bonus features, like a PF Flyer sneaker commercial featuring Jonny Quest.

756935,5,6303953344,"This was a very ambitious prime time project by the successful creative team of Bill Hanna and Joe Barbera in 1964. Up until the time this series debuted, animation for television consisted of funny animals, prehistoric families, space age families and wise talking New York cats. All wonderful, but it seemed it was time to push the medium and play to a different audience. Along came Jonny Quest, the first animated adventure series clearly aimed at adults as well as children. The series had a jazzy driving theme song, excellent and unusual underscoring, visionary design, more naturalistic character designs and lots of fast moving action just like the live action adventure series of the day. The plots were fairly intelligent and more complex than the series that came before peppered with plenty of science fiction and high tech gadgetry, circa the mid sixties. Because of the expense and labor involved in the animation process the animation was limited, but this was compensated for by clever layout and staging and a sophisticated and imaginative sound track. In fact, like the Fleischer Superman cartoons of the 1940s, Jonny Quest was essentially a layout driven production. The animation was adequate and, again very cleverly economical, never detracting from the stories. Really, the show was like a living comic book and we loved it. Attempts were made to revive the show in the mid 1980s with what I would consider to be disastrous results. None of the later shows came even close to the level of the original 1964-65 run and to me it was clear that the writers and producers of the new series were clueless as to what made the sixties episodes so fun, stylish, exciting and, well, just plain cool! In your quest for quality, stick with the classic first season.",1148688000,5,1778,4.93
756936,5,6303953344,"My title comes from the 1956 cartoon Colonel Bleep, but it could very well apply to this 1964 one. Jonny Quest was Hanna- Barbera's entry into the realm of adventure cartoons, and they did it in a big way. Comic book artist Alex Toth designed the characters and look of the show (he also designed Space Ghost). Decades before Indiana Jones would look to '30s and '40s Hollywood for inspiration, H-B's writers spiced the dialogue with film noir touches and set the backgrounds in exotic locales.

The added versimilitude, along with suspenseful soundtracks and tight camera action shots brought a heretofore unseen level of excitement to cartoons. Jonny's dog Bandit provided comedy relief in the tried and true (and later overtried) H-B tradition, as his East Indian friend Hadji brought mystical and cross-cultural intrigue.

Then there were the science-based plots that seemed lifted from Tom Swift books, and the detective work ala the Hardy Boys. All of which anchored H-B's new animated series in a strong tradition (both series were read avidly throughout the '50s and '60s) as well as taking limited animation in a ground-breaking new direction.

Hanna-Barbera would become the leader in this new genre, producing numerous popular shows including Space Ghost, Thundarr the Barbarian, Pirates of Dark Water, and probably the most imaginative, The Herculoids (hopefully soon to make its advent on DVD), but none so changed TV or are so fondly remembered as Jonny Quest. As with so many other Hanna-Barbera cartoons appearing on DVD, this series is sure to find fans in a new generation.",1147305600,4,1591,5.111538461538461

I'd always go running to the t.v. set because I didn't want to miss seeing the taradactyl swoop down, or the giant gila monsters, or the boy being chased by the hostile natives.  This is definitely one of the great classic Hanna Barbera animations.  I'm so happy I re-discovered it.  I love the nostalgia.

The tampering and neglect fail to harm this awesome series!  It's immune due to the infinite quality with which JONNY QUEST was produced in 1964, far surpassing all other TV animation untill 1992's BATMAN series 28 years later.

756985,5,6303953344,"I've been wanting to see Jonny Quest for the longest time.  After watching it, I was impressed that American animators came up with something like this forty years ago.  It's got good writing, good acting, and a distinct design style which sort of mimics comics.  I also love the opening credits and the way the main characters are introduced.  The writers pull no punches throughout the series and even kill off characters in a number of episodes, something you almost never see in American cartoons today.

For me Jonny Quest doesn't have the cheesy cringe factor of many old cartoon shows due to the strong writing and visual design.  What's also great is that it totally reflects the attitudes of its time.  The show definitely has a Cold War vibe to it, with foreign villains, implied to be Soviets or other communist enemies, bent on destroying America.  Some episodes also feature treacherous bad guy Arabs, while some other episodes depict primitive tribes ranting and behaving in an uncivilized way.  They made me wonder if such episodes could possibly get made in the present day.  The show even comes complete with the required Asian archvillain and his legion of minions.  Although I'm Asian, I'm actually not offended by all this, probably because I feel that overall the writers created many memorable heroes and villains of all ethnicities.  In particular, I liked the way they handled Hadji, the Minority Character of the main cast.  He is intelligent, heroic, crafty, and has a lot of personality.  In this regard the writers were very progressive during a time when ethnic stereotypes ran rampant.

Another area that makes Jonny Quest stand out is its heavy dose of ""realistic"" (as far the 1960's goes) science and technology.  They are an integral part of the Jonny Quest universe.  The show presents a gee-whiz optimism that science and technology can solve many problems.  In one episode Dr. Quest even tells Jonny about the importance of getting a good science education.  This is one of the very few shows, animation or live-action, which portrays scientists as being genuinely cool and heroic, and not nerds.

Jonny Quest is a brilliant show.  It was ahead of its time in many ways.  This series is most definitely a classic, you must see it!",1131408000,7,2266,4.892388451443569

The colors and background shading are terrific and coupled with the orchestration lend some definite atmosphere to the series.

756989,5,6303953344,"There's no other cartoon quite like ""Jonny Quest"", the inventive animated action-adventure series that just might have been Hanna-Barbera's finest half-hour. While I was just a mite too young for it back in the '60s, this excellent DVD box presents the entire ""classic Quest"" run- and there isn't a clunker in the bunch. I'm sure that sci-fi/gadget/action-crazy kids back then wanted to be Jonny, and who could blame them? Here's a clean-cut blond kid who lived on a private island off Miami Beach, didn't go to school, had an exotic buddy from India who did neat magic tricks, and traveled the world with his ""two dads"": a brilliant inventor/scientist and a rugged special agent who flew rockets and wrestled alligators. Together, the Quest Team went everywhere from the North Pole to the South African veldt, always fighting off assorted mad scientists, Nazis-in-hiding, vicious predators and man-made monsters. If you think that's way cool, imagine how it must have knocked kids' socks off in the '60s!

  ""Jonny Quest"" has a vivid look that, for me, brings back the days of great adventure comic strips and old-time radio serials. Turns out that's exactly what Joe Barbera had in mind- in fact, he intended it as an updated take on radio's ""Jack Armstrong"". The clear, realistic human characters mix with exotic animals, nifty sci-fi transporters (miniature hovercraft, anyone?), and some classic old-fashioned villains. All this was created and drawn by a gifted, self-taught cartoonist named Doug Wildey, a protege of the greatest adventure artist ever, Milton Caniff (""Terry and the Pirates"", ""Steve Canyon""). Wildey trained the Hanna-Barbera animators to draw this cartoon in his style- so much for their ""hack"" reputation!

  The best of ""Quest"" would have worked as live-action, too. ""Invisible Monster"" is a chilling, ""Twilight Zone""-esque tale involving a physicist's ""harnessed-energy"" equipment gone haywire. In ""Turu the Terrible"", the team discovers a man-eating pterodactyl in the Amazon jungle. Wherever Dr. Quest and the boys are sent- usually to uncover some sci-fi mystery- you can count on them to overcome whatever villains and creatures that get in their way. Incidentally, ""Quest"" never, ever stinted on this; bad guys and monsters are always blown up in fur-flying fashion.

  Future ""Brat Packer"" and ""West Winger"" Tim Matheson got his start as the voice of Jonny, while the late H-B stalwart Don Messick used his deep natural voice for Dr. Quest- and his signature dog barks for Bandit, Jonny's ever-curious bulldog puppy. The other two main characters, action agent Race Bannon (great name!) and Hadji, the turbaned sidekick from Calcutta, are also well-voiced by Mike Road (a veteran of many Westerns and superhero shows) and Danny Bravo (a Mexican child actor).

  In the era of James Bond, ""Mission: Impossible"", and ""I Spy"", ""Jonny Quest"" also boasted some of the most exciting music in cartoon history. H-B's prolific music director, Hoyt Curtin, went over the top with a pulsating piece of Afro-Cuban-tinged jazz that introduced each episode- the effect is almost that of an animated 007, and, again, it must have blown kids away (or scared them off, as may have been my case) back in '65.

  This package, as noted, includes the complete ""classic Jonny Quest"" series. There's also a well-done ""Quest Files Handbook""- mini-sketches of each main character, plus the settings and hardware. A subtitle track for the episode ""Double Danger"", which revolves around a clever Race Bannon lookalike, includes interesting tidbits on the cast and artists. And I was delighted, but not surprised, to find Brad Bird (""The Incredibles"", ""Iron Giant"") as lead commentator on ""Adventures in Animation""- if you know his work, and I do, you can tell that he loved ""JQ"" and it rubbed off.

  ""Jonny Quest"" is not only a heckuva ride- even now- but the direct inspiration for everything from ""Spy Kids"" to ""The Incredibles"". If you love the hero-adventure cartoon genre, the best of Hanna-Barbera, or old-school sci-fi, you'll love this. Hey, I'm nearly 50, and I wouldn't have minded growing up like Jonny, either- but keep me away from the mad Dr. Zin!",1127865600,6,4170,5.143491124260355

I will now be able to expand that small collection with all 26 episodes. I can't watch most modern day cartoons with my kids without being thoroughly disgusted with the values and content. These classic episodes portray good vs evil kind of values. Interestingly enough these cartoons have many interesting similarities with the Scooby Doo cartoons. In one episode the bad guys dress up in frog-man costumes to scare the too curious. The inclusion of bandit into the plot is another similarity. One can see where ideas from this series influenced the original Scooby Doo cartoons. Unfortunately these Jonny Quest episodes are one of a kind, and nothing with similar content is likely to come along.

Anyone interested in animation and comic book art should know about this series. The artwork is flat out amazing, and not at all what you would expect from the makers of the very flatly drawn ""Flintstones"" and ""Jetsons"". The video transfer to DVD is great. The colors are fantastic and the sound is amazing. This is a real treat.

Sure, some of the dialogue is dated. But it's pretty fun to hear kids say, ""Yipee"" and ""Yahoo"". If you're of an age to remember these cartoons from your early childhood, the language might strike you only as familiar, perhaps eliciting a bit of nostalgia. It shouldn't be seen as a negative when so many of today's cartoon kids are simply smarmy. These guys know how to have fun while respecting adults (the good adults, anyway).

The stories become a little familiar as evil world domination plans are foiled again and again. But the villains are great, and did I mention the artwork is truly amazing?!

Yes. There definitely is a body count in this series. Perhaps that will shock some people. Somebody dies in nearly every episode. They blow up thingsreal good, you know. But the dead bodies are never seen, as far as I can tell. Just the 'splosions and debris.

Since their missions take them all over the world. The animators get to stretch their creative muscles on some truly gorgeous and very spooky backdrops--Andean Mountains, the Himalayas, Sargasso Sea, etc.

I often forget how the cast gets from place to place as I contemplate other areas of my life.

757080,5,6303953344,"I was born in 1972 and loved watching Jonny Quest as a child.  In my opinion this is one of the most imaginative, interesting, and entertaining cartoons ever made.  Now married with young children, my wife & I got the kids this series on DVD as a Christmas gift.  The kids *love* it, outside of a few older cartoons (Tom & Jerry, Looney Tunes, Scooby Doo) this is all they want to watch lately.

These cartoons feature imaginative plots, charismatic and interesting villains, interesting storylines, and lots of action and humor.  Most adults are going to enjoy this cartoon as much as the kids.  Several friends of our children, relatives, and adult friends have watched an episode or two and been enthralled with the show.

The premise behind the show is following the adventures of Dr. Benton Quest (Jonny's Dad), Race Bannon, Jonny, Hadji, and their dog Bandit.  Dr. Quest is a government sponsored scientist, Race is a bodyguard/mentor/tough guy who watches out for Dr. Quest and the boys.  Hadji, an East Indian boy, is Jonny's best friend and introduced a few episodes into the series.  Bandit is along for comic relief and of course Jonny's role in the adventures is the main focus of the show.  Dr. Quest and the rest of the group live on a private island in the Florida Keys but are constantly traveling around the world to explore strange phenomena, perform scientific experiments, perform some type of investigation for the government, or help out friends in need.  They invariably get into some sort of trouble in each episode, and in many ways one can draw alot of parallels between this show and James Bond movies.  The villains are excellent.  A good villain needs to be charismatic enough to be ""marginally likeable"" but at the same time be intelligent enough to seem dangerous.  In Jonny Quest they are like this, and there is one very good recurring villain (Dr. Zen) in several of the episodes.  There are a few recurring characters of interest as well such as ""Jade"", Race's love interest who helps the group out from time to time.  There is a great deal of interesting technology used in the show (much of which was speculative and didn't actually exist when the show was made) and the group is in a different exotic locale for every episode.  Enemies and villains run the gamut from energy eating invisible monsters, nazi war criminals, pirates, criminal organizations, mummies, flying dinosaurs, robots, & jungle tribes among others.

The technology and equipment in the show are really fun.  The group uses equipment such as hovercrafts, lasers, sleeping dart guns, jetpacks, rocket sleds, bazookas, ""Harrier"" type aircraft before they were ever invented, various guns, and advanced computer equipment that while laughable from today's standards seemed very advanced when the show was made.

I am pleased to say the show is very ""politically incorrect"", which is very refreshing in these days of delicate sensitivities.  Jonny and Hadji pray before bedtime in some episodes, there is a great deal of gunplay in many of the episodes, some smoking by certain characters, and alot of stereotyping of accents and mannerisms of people from different geographical locations.  In Jonny Quest everyone is good or bad, there is none of this gray area ""he's kind of good and kind of bad"" tripe that is prevalent in a lot of tv today.  There is no mistaking who the villains are and who the good guys are.  Some of the bad guys may die from time to time in the show, but there is nothing I can recall that would seem graphic or disturbing to a young child.  It's generally of the variety where a bad guy does himself in by for instance shooting glacier ice that collapses on him or the like.  There is indeed a lot of violence in the show, but it generally has consequences unlike the watered down politically correct garbage shown on tv these days.

I haven't had any technical problems and the color looks great to me.  The Dolby Digital track could have stood to be done a bit better but it's not bad.  (At least it *is* encoded in Dolby Digital!!)  The extras are a bit on the light side but not bad.

This is good, clean entertainment for the entire family and I give it 5 stars stars from an entertainment perspective.  Maybe 4 stars from a DVD perspective due to the subpar Dolby Digital encoding and the editing out of a couple of phrases and scenes.  Leave the originals alone Hollywood!  We don't care if you are PC elitists and out of touch with reality.  Leave our favorite shows from the past alone and unedited.",1106179200,14,4539,4.730279898218829

Well, the DVD set is good and does contain every episode of the original (real) series (please forget Hanna-Barbera's horrible modern Jonny Quest attempts) and they do look clean, crisp and colorful but the set does have its flaws. First, the extras really stink. The documentary about the series is poorly done and features nothing more than a group of people I don't know and never heard of offering their memories of the series. Who cares? I want to know about the complete history of the show with profiles of all the creators and voice actors who participated in its production. The documentary was a BIG disappointment. Secondly, having read the reviews on Amazon, I have learned about the various PC edits that have been made to the shows.  This, of course, doesn't sit well with me. Also, as someone else stated the music that plays on the main DVD menu window is ridiculous. It sounds like the theme to some old game show or something. Why didn't they play the theme or music excerpted from the series instead? Bad decision guys.

What would I have liked to have seen? How about a real tribute to Doug Wildey, Jonny Quest's creator. They really needed to have included a something of substance for this great man. They could have also included, assuming it still exists, the original pilot film for Jonny Quest (when I believe it was going to be based on Jack Armstrong). Scenes from the original pilot film appear at the very beginning of the end credits. You know, the scenes with the hover craft and the angry African natives throwing spears.

I would give a full five stars to the show itself but have to give the DVD set less due to my above comments.",1105833600,13,2249,4.700507614213198
757082,4,6303953344,"Having a bit of a hard time with this one...

I loved the series as a kid... every young boy WANTED to be Jonny Quest, myself included.  As someone who lived for ""Jonny Quest"" nite, and who has dialog indelibly burned into his memory, I am a little bit PO'd at the ""thought police"" for making this classic ""politically correct"" (stupid, Stupid, STUPID move!!!), but whatever, this was really a wonderful blast from the past for me- cheesy animation (but great for it's time!), lame dialog, phony science, ridiculous plots and all!

The good stuff...  Remembering how much I hated ""Bandit"" and wished he'd found a way to get lasered by an evil villian's death ray, Race 'rasslin' alligators, etc., ""Sim, Sim, SalaBim"",

""Dr. Zin"", the spider-looking ""robot spy"", ""Jade"" (pretty hot for a cartoon babe, at least back then!), cool theme music, how all the villians smoked cigarettes, hovercrafts, lizardmen... I could go on and on.

Finally, I need to mention that the ""extras"" included the original ""PF Flyers"" sneaker commercial.  Man, every little boy wanted a pair of ""PF's"", since Jonny Quest wore 'em.  Of course, this was in the days before even Converse ""All-Stars"" were popular!

In short, if you were a fan of the old show, expect a few disappointments, but sit back, put the old brain on ""hold"" and enjoy anyway!!",1105574400,9,1321,4.8097345132743365

I believe however, that the person who thinks that the ""shadow of the Condor"" show was edited has mistaken this episode with ""The Dark Tower"".  The Dark Tower has the scene that shows the Nazi soldier throwing a hand grenade at the Quest team from his plane when they are trapped on the side of the mountain.  I don't recall a scene ever in

""shadow of the condor"" that has the pilot throwing a grenade.  I may be wrong but I believe this set is complete and unedited except for the voice editing on the Ho-Po showing.

However, I signed on early morning 15 Sep, within twelve hours or so of the previous price quote, intending to purchase the set, and the online price is back up to around $50!!! What the heck?!?!

757157,4,6303953344,"It was 1964-65, and being almost 11 at the time, I remember JQ very well indeed. My brothers and I would be totally captivated by JQ when it aired on Friday evenings at 7:30. It was light years ahead of any other animated program... bar none! Fast paced, intelligently written with story lines that would even hold our father's interest.

After it's one season run, JQ was rehashed in syndication for several years. I will always recall noticing how in the mid-70's someone decided to ""crop"" certain scenes from each episode... usually involving some level of violence. This always seemed to lend an air of ""lameness"" to that particular episode... ala the ""A-Team"" where a dozen guys with automatic weapons fire at each other with NOBODy getting seriously hit!

Hmmm... violence with NO consequences... gee, what a FANTASTIC message for impressionable young minds!

Gee, in this day and age of rampant ""PC"", I am surprised to read that only comments such as ""heathen monkeys"" and ""ignorant savages"" are being voiced over. How in the heck did Jade get away from the censors with that cigarette holder she is almost always seen with ?!?

What can we expect next from the ""PC"" brigade... screening every film since 1972 for any reference to the World Trade Center and editing THEM out too?

Come on, people... Jonny Quest is a CARTOON. Leave things as they were originally ment to be, will ya' ?!? Anything less is just plain insulting to those of us that remember...",1094515200,143,1464,4.7936507936507935
757158,4,6303953344,"First of all, I'm thrilled to finally have Jonny Quest on DVD.  Despite being a product of its time, with its overt racism, sexism, etc., it's still head and shoulders above the sanitized pablum that is currently inflicted on children (and the parents responsible enough to watch what their children are viewing).  Let's face it, even the sanitized pablum has its problems with non-PC issues...they're just disguised better than they were in the old sixties cartoons.  Yes, JQ was quite violent, but it showed violence with consequences.  People were hurt or died when they were shot or beaten.  Nowadays, cartoons show violence as being safe, i.e., nobody dies, everybody just bounces back and recovers.

Overall, the DVDs are pretty good, however, I'd also like to complain about the dialogue edits that other people have mentioned.  Given all the other non-PC issues in JQ that were left in, these particular edits (of outdated terms that most of the younger generation are unlikely to even recognize as racist slurs) are ridiculous.

In terms of the DVD production, I agree with other reviewers that the colors are oversaturated.

I'm also going to mention that two episodes, ""Mystery of the Lizard Men"" and ""Pursuit of the Po-Ho,"" have a bad case of the telecine jitters.  So if you've noticed these episodes jittering back and forth, it's not because your eyes are tired or your equipment is bad.  Somebody involved in the DVD production decided to be cheap, obviously, since they didn't bother to correct this problem.  I sincerely hope the various technical issues are resolved in a future release.

JQ started out with a five from me for the nostalgia factor, but because of the edits and the technical problems, I'm subtracting a point.",1093824000,28,1746,4.979310344827586

757160,5,6303953344,"Jonny Quest was an extremely innovative cartoon series in its day, and in many ways, still is. Like the Flinstones which preceeded it, it was originally an experimental prime-time cartoon aired in the evenings for the growing numbers of teens in this country at that time. Hanna-Barbara were the bomb in the 60's and always strove to push themselves and their audience.

 This new DVD box-set is everything a great cartoon DVD set should be. It's flawless. Every single episode of the classic 1960's Jonny Quest cartoon is here in its entirety, remastered, in 5.1 surround sound, and with subtitles. The colors look brighter and richer than I've ever seen Jonny Quest when aired on TV throughout the years. The picture is sharp, clean, and clear - it looks like this was animated in the present, not over 30 years ago!

 Ignore the tagline Complete Season One as its misleading to consumers. There only was one season of the cartoon and all of the episodes are here - in other words, you aren't missing anything and there are no further box sets to buy. This is all the Jonny Quest that fans need every purchase. It's that complete!

 I love the Jonny Quest series: the characters are so unique, the stories are so neat, the drawing-style of the animation is so stylish and comic-like, the music is so cool, the villians are so different and awesome...its quite a treat.

 It's hard to say what my favorite episode of the series would be. There's too many ultra-classic episodes here. I suppose if I did have to choose a personal favorite, I'd have to go with ""The Dark Tower"". I love the weird concept of a renegade Nazi war criminal using a lost civilization of neanderthals as his slaves. That's the kind of other-worldly adventure that makes Jonny Quest so cool, even to this day!",1090800000,16,1784,4.677316293929713
757161,4,6303953344,"In my opinion the newer versions of the ""Jonny Quest"" series can't hold a candle to the original and shouldn't even be mentioned in the same breath. I bought this DVD release because my memories of this amazing show had all but faded and purely for nostalgia.

All things considered and given the age of this show the picture and sound are really clear and crisp. The opening theme music is still catchy and it pulls you in from the moment you hear it. The colors are vivid and sharp; better than I can remember seeing on any previous VHS or Television viewing. In the ""Jonny Quest"" complete series set, you get all 26 episodes and some special features spread out over four single sided discs with great disc artwork.

The cast of ""Jonny Quest"" aren't getting any younger so a where are they now or reunion feature would have been a great addition to this release. I guess my only complaint is that the outer packaging doesn't hold up very well. The outer box slip cover is a pain to take off and put back on and I have had a couple of the disc's fall off their posts.

Overall with its high tech gadgets / lasers and well written and imaginative stories, ""Jonny Quest"" remains one of my favorite shows from my childhood; I really did grow up in the era of great Television. This DVD set is a real treat for the whole family and for the new legion of ""Jonny Quest"" fans waiting to discover him.

757230,4,6303953344,"Yes, it's wonderful to be able to watch the original adventure series on DVD.  However -- it is atrocious, inexcusable, and deserving of a kick in a sensitive place to the decision-makers who decided to change the originals.
  You can see other reviews for explanations of where dialogue was cut.
  Almost as egregious is the stupid, stupid, stupid repetition of the SAME end credits for EVERY episode, EXCEPT for episode 9, ""Double Trouble.""  It's a real shame that a voice talents like Keye Luke, as well as others, are ignored by this lame-brained patchwork job.
  Why would somebody do this?  Probably not to leave creator Doug Wildey's name off.  My guess is that this DVD release was just more metaphorical sausage ground out from the Warner Bros mill.  Especially since it was a title created by another studio (Hanna-Barbera), and available for release simply because Ted Turner had bought HB.  No, the clueless decision makers probably figured that nobody would care.  Or, worse, they may have asssumed that the credits were all the same for every episode.  Of course, that doesn't explain the different end credits for ""Double Trouble."" ...

This show, although ""too violent"" for the ""Politically Correct"" parents of today, was way ahead of its time, and so realistic that the invisible monster used to scare (...)me every time I saw it.  Long before we started to see the sillier side of Hanna-Barbera, Jonny Quest helped a world steeped in espionage, cold war paranoia, and the race to the moon stop for 30 minutes every Saturday to see some really cool kids use some really cool ""toys"" to fight some really scary bad guys in some really cool far-off places.  Although I have a hard time visualizing the same Tim Matheson that played in ""Animal House"" giving a voice to JQ, I still envy him for getting to play the coolest animated kid character of all time!",1087603200,6,904,4.466666666666667
757233,5,6303953344,"It's about time this series was released on DVD.
Johnny Quest was the ultimate show for guys.  It had plenty of action, an exciting theme song, and dynamic background music.  Yes, the show was violent but it portrayed the world as it was, not as it should be.  It taught us that the although the world is beautiful it is also sometimes a dangerous and violent place.  Villains met their demises descending into tar pits, crushed in a cave-ins, falling off cliffs, or being eaten by crocodiles.  There was plenty use of guns but no one died directly from a gunshot wound. Of course, Bandit would always encounter some indigenous creature.
There was also cool equipment - the vertical take-off jet (Harrier jet), lasers, jet packs, diving bells, and robots. Dr. Quest also had a personal computer when computers were large and ominous.  He video screen radio - one could argue the predecessor to the cell phone.
Although I'm not thrilled with the ""editing"" of the Po Ho episode I'll overlook it. This DVD collection still has a lot action - something the politically correct crowd can't take away despite their efforts.",1087344000,6,1117,4.791666666666667

757235,5,6303953344,"I'll have to admit I missed the original hey-day of this cartoon (having been born in 1970), but fell in love with it in repeats throughout the 70's.  The animation was top-notch and believable, the adventures were incredibly fun, and it was the kind of show which continually presented you with ""gee-whiz"" moments (""Gee-whiz!  Wish I had a rocket belt!  Just think of what I could do with THAT!"")
This was simply the most realistically animated cartoon, bar none - and it helped the willing suspension of disbelief considerably, leaving us with something engaging, absorbing, and downright *fun*.  Having set an early standard, every similar cartoon has had to live up to the inevitable comparisons (mostly failing rather badly, especially the short-lived mis-directed ""Real Adventures of Jonny Quest"" series from the 90's.)
One tip - watch these episodes one or two at a time, just before bed, with the lights off.  Perfect setting for such a show.
Technically, the set is extremely well put together, although I'm a bit confused as to their ""remastering"" claim, but perhaps it is because I expect some decent amount of cleanup to happen when ""remastering"".  Most of the episodes here exhibit spots and speckles (some astoundingly huge) from the old film prints, but this diminishes a bit as you reach the later episodes.  The sound quality is superb.  The extras are a bit sketchy (several people are brought out to talk about the show, but you're rarely told why these particular people are the ones doing this commentary) but entertaining and modestly informative nonetheless.
The stories, as ever, are wonderful - compared with modern animation, it's surprising how much plot they squeezed into each episode.  It's actually something the first episodes of Scooby Doo did almost as well, making the episode feel longer than a half-hour show.
In short, this is an animation classic, a great example of scriptwriting, and a whole lot of fun.  At the slightly elevated prices of these sets (compared to something like ""The West Wing"", which delivers twice as many hours of programming for ten to fifteen bucks less), this is the only one fully worth it (okay, Scoob.  Maybe yours too.)",1086739200,8,2187,4.997245179063361

After viewing the DVD, it was amazing that almost half of the episodes were like a new cartoon to watch which was very nice.  If you haven't had a chance to watch the entire series in a long time, do yourself a favor and get this.",1086307200,5,405,3.9753086419753085
757237,4,6303953344,"I was four years old when this was on Television, yet I remember several episodes plain as day. That was how exciting I found young Jonny Quest to be and how enveloping the inventions and science fiction to be, even as a preschooler. I also remember being excitedly scared by some of the more fantastic elements of the show...like ""Turu the Terrible"" and ""The Invisible Monster!"" This was the kind of stuff an eventual reader of Hardy Boys, Tom Swift and Danny Dunn books craved before books began to seep into my life. Now that these DVD's have been issued, it's a safe bet to say they will have a permanent space on my DVD shelf.

So why not a perfect 5 stars? We'll get to that. First the plusses. These were, more than anything else, adventures for boys. Jonny and Hadji were always there when the brilliant Dr. Benton Quest got a call to rush from Quest Laboratories in the Florida Keys to some far off country, travelling on the most recent invention. Lasers and Space Flight were frequent resources for story lines, and as a 4 year old want-to-be astronaut, it made it seem like anything was possible. Of course, this was the era of cold war politics, so the villains were often foreign guys with creepy accents. (Think Dr. Zin.) One of the frequent reasonings for Dr. Quest to have to go out on one of his missions was to make sure that these innovations didn't fall ""Into the wrong hands.""

But it also meant that Jonny (and, by proxy, I) were able to visit Tibet, the Arctic Circle, South American rain forests and other exotic (and real!!) locales before I even entered school. Looking at these 40 year old episodes anew, it's amazing that Jonny looks like he could be drawn today; an inquisitive eleven year old in black shirt, blue jeans and sneakers, he could be from anywhere USA even now. And who wouldn't want to have an extended family with a cool an adoptive brother as Hadji (one of animation's -- or, for that matter, all of prime time's -- minority main characters), a tutor as devoted as teacher/bodygaurd Race Bannon or a dad as equal parts brilliant to understanding as Dr. Quest? Add that the animation was far more real looking than the club footed dopiness of ""The Flintstones"" or the animals acting like people of ""Top Cat,"" (Bandit never suddenly started to ask for treats...) etc, and the world of Jonny Quest was something that we all could slip in to.

In the pre PC world, Jonny could react exactly as a kid could when first confronted by an inquisitive girl (in ""The Dreadful Doll""). No matter how you slice it, a kid his age would be flustered and annoyed by a female his age making inquiries. By the time the ""New Adventures"" came out, Jonny had to have a female foil, and my response was just what Jonny's would have been had he been a typical (read: real) 11 years old...""Ick!"" And can you imagine a show today with a broad base of young watchers where the Father character smokes? (Dr. Quest enjoys a pipe in one of the episodes.)

Which leads to my short list of minuses. Coloration throughout the set is really good, but sometimes oversaturated, and in ""The Werewolf of the Timberland,"" White Feather's skin is in two different colors! Also of dubious note, what happened to Doug Wildey's credit? It seems to only show up during ""Double Danger,"" otherwise I seem to get the impression that the end credits were remastered from one episode then taped onto the end of all the episodes for DVD transfer.

And the worst offense...what heathen monkey was responsible for editing the dialog out of ""Pursuit Of The PoHo""? Is this from the same brain trust that wiped out explosions and gunfire from classic Warner Brother cartoons and then blacklisting Speedy Gonzales for being stereotypical? If I emerged unscathed from that kind of language as a 4 year old, why am I expected to be offended by it now? If that was the root case, why not edit out the smoking, the shooting, the animal cruelty and the really obvious stereotypes from the Cold War era? It's enough to make me want to wave my hands while muttering ""Sim Sim sala Bim"" and to thusly wipe all of you ignorant savages of the face of the Cartoon Network.

OK, end of rant.

Those are all just me carping. If you were at all enthralled by ""Jonny Quest"" in 1964 or its countless repeats on Saturday Mornings, you need to have this. As soon as the exquisitely James Bond-ish musical theme comes up (Hoyt Curtain's music for this series was light years beyond most TV shows, and even today's), you'll be back in your PF Flyers and ready for more adventures for boys.",1086048000,136,4558,4.5512195121951216

I vote for The Invisible Monster as my overall favorite but I also vote for The Curse of Anubis as sadly is still is the most contemporary episode. Doesn't seem like much has changed in the Middle East. As Akim says ""Borders are a fluid affair"".  Right on target for a ~50 year old cartoon!",1085875200,2,594,4.333333333333333
757239,4,6303953344,"In the early 60s, Hanna-Barbera was among several companies trying to establish animation shows in prime time. Other companies tried to revive Amos and Andy and Alvin & The Chipmunks, but those were only on for one season. Hanna Barbera had a hit with the Flintstones and two strikes with the Jetsons and Top Cat going for only one season. This was thier fourth and most ambitious try. It is unlike any other prime time animation series because it alone did not rely on laughs, instead it pursued a suspenseful course. No other animated prime time series ever tried this, in fact the closest anyone else came to Jonny Quest was the various Supermarionation series made by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson. It's a shame that nobody else ever tried this in prime time. The animated series that comes closest to Jonny Quest was the Star Trek animated series, but that was never shown on prime time, instead it was relegated to the Saturday morning ghetto.
I was 8 years old when the series premeired, and my ABC station at the time (WTAE in Pittsburgh) pre-empted the first run on their station by showing something else. When the time slot changed in the middle of the season (from Friday to Thursday), well, I caught the reruns and I was hooked on the series. When Jonny was cancelled in prime time, oh that was a sad day for me.
I haven't seen the episodes in years, when I got the set, a bunch of friends had an extended lunch and we watched the pilot episode on my Powerbook. There were several complaints about Jonny's Title card being cut from the introduction of the shows and the original Screen Gems (Columbia) tag eliminated at the end of the episode. Oh, I consider those very minor.
I give the set 4 stars because of 1) some of the episodes have color inconsistencies, but that is probably with age. and 2) some of the language has been cut or modified (especially in the Po Ho episode). After I spent the weekend watching these episodes, well, I now understand why Captain Kirk said ""I feel young again"" at the end of the Wrath of Khan. They help me remember happier times in my childhood!
Thanks Bill and Joe!",1085788800,7,2114,4.536649214659686
757289,5,6303953344,"Okay, first the bad news.  They mucked up the series opener.  They cut the JONNY QUEST art card from the end of the opener, also forcing them to truncate what may be the best TV theme song ever.
Okay - that's the bad news; and that's ALL the bad news there is.  This is a great DVD set.
It comes in a cute package with a clear outside meant to look like an animation cel, with uncolored outline art on the inside package itself.
The transfers are beautiful.  They're so sharp they have antialiasing problems, but still have all the original animation defects, which I applaud.  It must have been tempting to go in and fix some stuff like that cel moire flutter on Anubis from the series opener, but they didn't, and so we get Jonny Quest at the best we could have hoped to have seen in a pristine print back in 1964.
It's got some nice extras - a featurette interviewing contemporary people in the biz like Steve Rude and Alex Ross and Brad Bird about how JQ influenced them, and telling of the series origins as Jack Armstrong the All-American boy (not a mention of any Tom Swift or Doc Savage influence is to be found); an episode presented with pop-up trivia (although I find it hard to believe 'Double Danger' was produced before 'Mystery of the Lizard Men' which is so CLEARLY the pilot); a 'video handbook' with fun features on the cast, villains, gadgets, etc.; and an excellent PF Flyer commercial.
Despite the fact that they're advertising this as 'season one' this is ALL the episodes of the original Jonny Quest there are - any others will be ill-conceived revival series attempts with altered casts.  This is all the JQ you need, and the set to get.",1085270400,8,1661,4.465346534653466
757290,5,6303953344,"These classic Jonny Quest episodes have been  remastered brilliantly;  the quality is as good as we're ever likely to see, and it's a joy to watch them without commercial breaks or transmission glitches.  However -- I haven't seen  all the shows yet yet, but they may have been edited  for PC-ness.  There is a point in the ""Pursuit of the Po-Ho"" episode where Race is trying to frighten the Po-Ho Indians of South America by appearing in purple dye as their water god, and during one of his tirades the sound cuts out while his lips keep moving.  If you turn on the subtitles, you can see that he is supposed to be saying ""... you heathen monkeys!"" (they forgot to edit the subtitles).  I hope they don't keep doing this in other episodes.  Come on, Hanna-Barbera, leave the Quest adventures alone;  they can't help being of their time.  Anyway, the Po-Ho's really DO seem to be ""ignorant savages""; the Quests certainly outfox them easily enough with that dopey ""I'll pretend to be their god"" ruse.  What's truly unforgiveable  in the way of post facto edits is  spotting Beavis and Butthead strolling across the background in one show.  (I'm not going to tell you which one.)  It's bad enough those guys turn up in  the Lord of the Rings movies, now they're infiltrating Jonny Quest, too.  When will the madness end?",1085011200,4,1318,4.632034632034632

From the heart pounding drums of the opening theme to the final frame of the ending credits featuring Race and Dr. Quest on rocket packs looking for ""Turu The Terrible"", Jonny Quest captured every young boy's (and some girls') zest for excitement and adventure.  I always found the show entertaining and educational.  The premiere episode about the lizard men featured the concept of laser technology.  It's where I first heard the term laser!  Now lasers are a permanently part of our lives.  How ironic that this very DVD set will be played on a machine based on laser technology.  My favorite episode was ""Terror On Monster Island""  The adventures of Jonny, Hadji, Race, Dr. Quest and of course ""Bandit"" have entertained generations.  I was able to share these shows with my son when he was a youngster.  He couldn't believe that I watched this show when I was his age.  This series is a timeless testament to a gone by era.  Enjoy!

757292,3,6303953344,"I don't know what it is. I used to LOVE this as a kid, and even a few years ago when I watched it on Teletoon. But now, after watching Mystery of the Lizard Men, I just feel like I wasted my money, I don't know why. Maybe there's too much Bandit goofiness, I don't know.
Anyways, if what I hear is true about the censoring, then I am rightfully PO'ed (I'd write something else, but I'd probably get censored!). That's like censoring classics like ""Huckleberry Finn"" or ""Of Mice and Men"". Jonny Quest is a classic and should not be altered in any way just to satisfied modern, politically correct BS sensibilities. The Po-Hos were ignorant savages and Race did well by calling them such!
Oh well, there are still some great episodes here, in this ONLY season of Jonny Quest (if you're actually counting that eighties tripe with the big rock man, then you need to be sedated). As a child, I can't remember anything scaring me more than that fat guy with the giant lizards on leashes chasing that skinny wretch through the jungle and cackling like a maniac until the poor guy jumps into the ocean. Or the lunatic screams of the pterodactyl in Turu the Terrible. Or the horror as the paint-covered Invisible Monster descends upon a helpless, petrified Bandit.

The bonus material is confined to an interesting series of interviews with current animators telling how Jonny Quest came to be and how it affected their own careers. They credit Doug Wildey with bringing sci-fi comic book sensibilities to the project, including the great artwork and ""just over the hill"" technology we'd all thought we'd have by now.

757295,1,6303953344,"Before I start singing any praises to Warner or Hanna Barbera, I've got two major complaints:
1)  Why is Doug Wildey's name conspicuously missing from the end credits?  On the broadcast versions he was credited with the original Jonny Quest concept and there was no mistaking (or missing for that matter) his distinctive signature on the end credits.  Seems to me that the real driving force behind the look and feel of Jonny Quest deserves better treatment than to be dropped from the show he helped to create.
2)  If you are remastering the episodes anyway, is it that much trouble to include the real end credits that accompanied each episode?  If you pay close attention to the end credits on the DVD set, you'll see that it's the same one being used over and over again.  The end credits on the broadcast versions were different in regards to voice acting and writing/storyline credits.
Pretty shabby folks.  I can only wonder what kind of flack would have resulted if somehow Warner or Hanna Barbera weren't credited on this set.  But I guess so long as they get their recognition, it doesn't matter if the people who deserve the real credit get overlooked.",1084752000,149,1163,4.7227722772277225
757296,5,6303953344,"Jonny Quest was ""the Man"" when I was growing up in the early 60's. Though I haven't bought this DVD yet, I do have every original episode on VHS. Tim Matheson did so many cartoon voices during that time period but Jonny was the best! I was compelled as an adolescent to grow up to be a scientist because of Jonny's influence (I did serve as an Air Force policeman without quite the glamour). Forget Cat/Dog, the Tick, and all these other cartoons of today's generation; Jonny was exciting, real and educational (and had the neatest toys too!)

757298,5,6303953344,"Here's a detailed look at all the Supplemental Bonus Features that are included in this fun and spiffy 4-Disc DVD boxed set of ""Jonny Quest: The Complete First Season"". Some details concerning this set's menu layout are also shown below. Plus a critique of the cool packaging as well. .........
BONUS FEATURES:
>> ""Jonny Quest Files: Fun, Facts and Trivia"" is a unique type of bonus DVD feature. When you choose this bonus, the entire episode ""Double Danger"" will play with integrated ""pop-up"" text coming on the screen periodically, displaying bits of trivia and show information. A fun bonus.
>> ""Jonny Quest: Adventures In Animation"" -- This is a terrific little mini-documentary (in rich-sounding Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo to boot). It features several people in the industry (artists, animators, directors, and writers) talking about their thoughts on the ""Jonny Quest"" cartoon series. Lots of episode clips are used for this bonus program, which has a run time of 15:14.
>> The ""Jonny Quest Video Handbook"" consists of 10 separate ""Mini Bios"", covering just about anything anyone would ever need to know about the Jonny Quest series. These short narrated bio pieces (which all feature a Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo track) contain many clips from the series as we listen to the capsule biographies, which are told in an entertaining tongue-in-cheek style. Each ""bio"" must be accessed individually from the ""Video Handbook"" Main Menu. These video segments range in length from 50 seconds to 3:05, with a total length of 16:57. The ten sections are entitled: ""Jonny"", ""Race"", ""Dr. Quest"", ""Hadji"", ""Bandit"", ""Allies"", ""Villains"", ""Vehicles"", ""Gadgets & Gear"", and ""Locales"". My favorite is ""Villains"", which gives us a glimpse at all of the Quest foes and bad guys. Wryly-told, this one is really a hoot!
>> ""P.F. Flyer Sneaker Commercial"" -- This is an original (color) TV commercial spot (circa 1960s), with ""Jonny"" and ""Race"" advertising -- and wearing -- their ""P.F. Flyer"" athletic shoes. The end of this ad has the original voice of Jonny (Tim Matheson) telling the viewers about the cool ""P.F. Magic Ring"", complete with a ""secret compartment"". I'll bet every kid who watched Jonny Quest in those days wanted one of those neat rings. This TV commercial spot lasts exactly 1 minute (although the DVD packaging shows a length of only half this). And the video quality for this bonus ad is remarkably good. Looks brand new! Great stuff here!
>> Trailers for 4 other Cartoon DVD sets. Each of these promotional ads runs a little more than 1 minute. Makes me want them all!
DVD MENU INFORMATION:
Just like these Jonny Quest episodes themselves, I found this DVD set's Menu structure to be very cool. A brief animated sequence comes on screen when any disc is initially loaded into the player (featuring some clips from various episodes), which then expands to show the menu selections -- which are presented in the guise of the instrument panel of the Quest private vertical-takeoff jet.
There are Sub-Menus for ""Episode Selections"", ""Special Features"", and ""Languages"". All bonus supplements are located on Disc 4. You move around the various menu choices using an icon resembling Jonny's bulldog, ""Bandit"". A ""Play All"" feature is also included on each disc's Main Menu.
A catchy little ""adventurous-sounding"" musical theme has been created for this DVD set, that plays while the Main Menu is viewable on screen. While this snappy theme was not derived from the show itself, it still seems to ""fit"" the spirit of the series very nicely. Yet another well-done touch.
THE PACKAGING:
Warner Home Video has issued this 4-Disc set in what they have described in their official press release as ""dazzling translucent collectible packaging"". And, upon seeing it in person, I'd have to agree completely with that statement. This super-shiny packaging is just bursting with color! The glistening outer slipcover of this ""Digipak"" case (which is made out of plastic, and not cardboard) securely houses an inner, five-panel fold-out section. The inner paneled section of this unique-looking case must be slid inside the outer ""slipcase"" in order to gain the full-color effect of the image contained on the cover. When the two sections are placed together, you get the ""complete"" colorful picture (which seems to emit a kind of ""three-dimensional"" status when both of the box parts are merged). Excellent graphics indeed!
My only complaint with the box design is that the cover art on the front of the case is NOT an image (drawing) from the original 1964 version of the show. The cover artwork is, instead, taken from the second (1980s) version of the series. Oh, well...the image on the cover still looks nice, even though it is from the much-inferior 1980s Quest series.
Each of the individual discs displays a different JQ character (Race Bannon, Dr. Quest, Jonny, and Hadji on Discs 1-4, respectively). After you've removed a disc from its plastic holder, you'll see a different image of each of the characters printed on the case underneath. Nice work was done on this eye-appealing packaging.
There's no physical paper insert or booklet included with this set. Instead, the episode information (along with some trivia and some excellent vintage photos) is printed onto the various sections (panels) of the inner cardboard fold-out case. There are 7 episodes on each of the first three discs; with the remaining 5 shows on Disc 4 (along with all of the bonus material).
There are no ""chapter breaks"" for any of the episodes, which is a bit of a disappointment. I would have liked the advantage of at least a chapter break after the opening credits.
This 26-episode DVD collection of ""Jonny Quest: Season One"" will have great appeal to any fan of this ground-breaking, Hanna-Barbera animated action-adventure TV series. Showing off excellent video quality, several intriguing bonus supplements, and snazzy-looking packaging, this ""Jonny Quest"" complete-season set from Warner Brothers should satisfy every ""JQ"" fan's requirements.",1084492800,14,6026,5.1063829787234045
757345,5,6303953344,"What can be said about Jonny Quest. This cartoon is unlike any I have ever seen. It was so serious and so darn cool. This show canme out in the 60's WWWWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY before my time, and I still find it to be wonderful. Jonny is very smart, very eager and very determined. Hadji is the perfect sidekick with his mystical powers and awesome turban. Bandit the pup serves as a comic relief and is funny. Race is just too cool, I mean he can fly a fa-reakin plane and fight and Dr. Quest is sophisticated. The places they went gave me an insight look into the different cultures around the world and the plots were very imaginative. JQ combined science fiction fantasy and geography into a very impressive 30 minute cartoon sitcom. The first season is amazing and I am glad that have realeased it on DVD. It is a must for any JQ fan. But don't take my word for it, you buy it and experience the Quest!",1084492800,,915,4.420118343195266

Would the kids of today get into this stuff?  Just ask my 13 year-old son who had to be pried away from the TV at bedtime.  Buy it today!",1084492800,2,465,4.287356321839081

Watch with awe as you witness the ""smooth as glass"" animation & the amount of excrutiating detail put into each frame. See ""Race"" sweat! See Jonny cry!

Then Race continued, ""...get a good look at Aquezio,"" this I heard him say! Yet, next I notice his mouth moving and heard nothing.  So, I turn on the subtitles and found the last sentence stating, ""you heathen monkeys.""  This is the first DVD I have gotten that was censored.  The DVD's are suppose to be the original version of the show.  Yet, it is to bad a cartoon that was shown to a 1964 audience before PG movies were on the theaters is being censored on a private home viewing today.  I know they let the subtitles go threw but they should have let the sound go to.  Maybe Warner Brothers could not replace the audio when Network TV originally cut it in the 1970's.

757349,5,6303953344,"Okay okay, if you loved the series when you were a kid, you'll still love it today on these wonderful DVDs. Buy this set without hesitation.
But what about today's kids? Does Jonny have what it takes to grab their attention away from Yu-Gi-Oh and Ed Edd and Eddy? In my home, the answer is a resounding yes!
My two boys -- ages 8 and 9 -- are loving this box set. The stories resonate with them. They laugh at Bandit's mishaps. They cheer for the heroes and relish the demise of countless memorable bad guys. They love the gadgets and the mystery. And they beg to stay up late for just one more episode. This series connects to them just as it did my own brother and me.
Every episode I can remember is included here (and it's just season one?!)
I've had the theme song playing in my head for well over 30 years. It's a true pleasure now to hear it again as we gear up for the next adventure. And it's even better to share it with my kids.
On a side note, I recall years ago when the Cartoon Network was brand new, they had an online poll asking viewers to vote for their favorite cartoon mom. Wilma Flinstone came in second. Viewers' pick for top mom? Race Bannon!",1084320000,2,1165,4.205357142857143

I find it particularly offensive that one can watch an unedited episode on TV, but after spending $60.00 for a DVD to watch in the privacy of your own home, Turner/WB decide to remove 40 year old dialog from classic animation. Save your money and look for ""other"" collections of the same series.",1084320000,37,440,4.88
757351,4,6303953344,"Got the set in the mail yesterday and have only watched ""The Robot Spy"" (one of my favorites) so far.  There are what appear to be some mild pixelization artifacts present (a character moves and a few stray ""blocky"" pixels of the character's image remain on the background from the character's previous position).  Maybe it is in the source print but in freeze frame, it looks like artifacts to me.  Otherwise, the quality is pretty good.  We'll see how the rest of the episodes measure up.
The DVDs are packaged in that ""wonderful"" quadruple-fold cardboard thingy that Warners is known for.  I don't know about you, but I do not care at all for this cheapish, flimsy, awkward packaging, especially for a relatively high-dollar item such as this.  Perhaps Dr. Zin works at Warners and was trying to keep the set less than perfect. :-)
For all these ""nit picks"", I dock the set a star.
As far as content, I watched JQ in syndication in the late 60's and early 70's when I was a wee chap.  It was one of my favorite shows and having all the episodes is a real treat.  This set has been long overdue.  Now, if we can work on that packaging...",1084320000,,1139,4.4375
757352,5,6303953344,"I remember, at the tender at of 9, switching between the 5 channels I had available to me on my family's little black and white television set, and coming across this cartoon that, from that first second, held me in awe.  The show was Jonny Quest, and the episode was Mystery of the Lizard Men!  It had high adventure, incredible suspense, thrilling music, wonderful comedy- and most importantly, a young boy right in the middle of it all.  (Was his dad irresponsible?  Eh...whatever.)  From that moment on, I was hooked.  So much so that, on a weekly basis, the show simply had to be enjoyed from the first frame of the opening titles, to the very last ""This has been  a Screen Gems presentation"" closing (as spoken by Race Bannon!)
And when those opening titles played, boy, were we thrust into adventure!  That thrilling music!  Those incredible visuals.  Maybe it was my age, but no show before or since has quite had that kind of impact.  It's so nice to see it finally arrving on DVD.
My favorite episodes:
Mystery of the Lizard Men
The Curse of Anubis
The Pursuit of the PoHos
The Robot Spy
Shadow of the Condor
Dragons of Ashida
Turu the Terrible
The Invisible Monster

757353,5,6303953344,"In an era dominated by frenetic, nerve-jangling, video-game cartoons, I know there's an audience out there for the clean lines and elegant simplicity of this '60s adventure serial, which recalls the early Hardy Boys series or comic strip serials like Terry and the Pirates. The Quest team jets to exotic locales, confronts nefarious evildoers of various suspect ethnicities armed with the latest ""science"" (lasers, rockets, fake volcanos), and beats them with better ""science,"" old-fashioned American brawn (courtesy of Roger ""Race"" Bannon), youthful ingenuity, and a touch of the mysticism of the Mysterious East (courtesy of Hadji). It's great retrograde fun--though sensitive types should be warned that it's borderline racist at times, in the casual, semi-spoofing spirit of an adventure movie like GUNGA DIN or the INDIANA JONES pictures. It has the virtues of straightforward storytelling, slow build-ups of tension, and a sense of mystery--all lacking in contemporary cartoons. I loved it as a kid, my kids love it today.",1082332800,7,1028,5.471698113207547
757354,5,6303953344,"If you think about it, you could probably come up with many examples of classic comedies, classic dramas, classic cop shows, detective shows, etc.  But you would be hard pressed to come up with numerous classic adventure programs.  Jonny Quest is certainly one of the greatest adventure series that television ever produced.  Along with the other great Hanna Barbera series like The Flintstones and The Jetsons, Jonny Quest was blessed with inspiration from the word go.  Who can forget the classic Hoyt Curtain theme?  Who can forget the great voice talent the show offered, even though Vic Perrin and Henry Corden worked WAY overtime to create a wonderful rogue's gallery of villains.  But what really makes this show succeed is its storytelling.  These are just good stories well told-and fans of the series have their favorites.
I am especially looking forward to this set to re-watch the all-time great episode The Curse of Anibus.  As many know, this is the famous mummy episode.  Has a mummy EVER been more scary, in real film or animation??  Perhaps the mummy in the Brendan Fraser film ranks about as high as this one, but what makes the spirit of Anibus especially creepy is that this mummy doesn't talk or make any sound at all.  It just walks and follows.  You've got to see this one.  And full marks must go on how beuatiful and terrifying the mummy is drawn.  Watch for the famous moment where the mummy is looking into Jonny's bedroom window.  Wow, this is the stuff for nightmares!!
This is a marvelous series that is finally being released and it is worth watching again and again.  May you all enjoy and re-enjoy this set as much as I plan on doing!",1082332800,12,1667,4.696551724137931
