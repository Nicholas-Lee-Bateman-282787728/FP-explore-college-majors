1039065,5,6305480672,"At the beginning of Shamira's video, we hear her tell us about the mysteries of belly dancing as we watch her in a mesmerizing silhouetted performance. We know we're in for something special. She follows this by  going through some of the basic moves that makes up this exotic form of  dance. I thought her pacing was superb as she starts with simple exercises  and introduces more complex ones as the video progresses. I also liked the  feeling that Shamira is letting us in on the secrets of her art by showing  us each move in isolation. She provides so much more than just a good  workout, but if that is what you are looking for, you certainly won't be  disappointed!",959040000,26,672,4.5041322314049586
1039066,5,6305480672,"I used to hate working out until I bought this video.  Now, I can't pull myself away from it!  I've lost 23 lbs. in the past month, and my SO can't get enough of seeing the new dance moves I learned!  Finally, I thought  that performance montage at the end was HILARIOUS, and the closing music  written by Leslie Sanford was great too.  If Amazon ever sells her CDs,  I'll be the first one in line for them!",959040000,4,407,4.141025641025641
1039067,5,6305480672,"I love this tape, not only for the clear, professional instruction, or the wonderful sacred warm-up, but also for the beautful feel of the video- from the music and drum tracks to the set to Shamira's elegance and class. This  was my first tape and I still watch it just for the workout and warmup. I  recommend it for beginners and for any dancer who wants an elegant and  beautiful video to practice to.",958953600,10,405,4.445945945945946
1039184,4,6305480672,"This is one HOT video. Each chapter is sort of a duplicate of each other, but I don't care! I think Shamira is one sensual Hottie to ""enjoy"" to the MAX!",1135900800,,152,3.935483870967742
1039185,5,6305480672,"this is a wonderful workout and bellydance instructional dvd.

shamira is a great teacher who really loves her art and it comes across. this can be used by both beginner and advanced dancer for a good workout & training drill. if you are a BRAND NEW beginner, though, you will want to also get a beginner dvd such as the dolphina beginner's workout or the veena & neena basic dance. some of the hip circles such as the bicycle hips are shown in more detail in the dolphina & twins' dvds. BUT, all in all, anyone can enjoy this dvd.",1130976000,27,531,4.31
1039186,5,6305480672,"I bought this DVD last year and never seemed to get around to writing a review as I was new to the writing game then. I love bellydancing and have since bought many learn to bellydance and bellyrobics DVDs. This ""sensuous"" workout really is one of my favorites, on mornings when I feel like doing a ""sensuous"" workout instead of a strenuous workout, I go for this one. Lots of circles, hiplifts and ""sensuous"" figure 8's, all are muscle toners. Circles are fantastic on the upper thighs and the lower bottom while the figure 8's work the hips and upper bottom. In fact the lower the impact of the workout the more fat you will burn, the higher the impact, you lean more toward sugar and fluid loss thus dehydrating, so as soon as you eat, the weight you lost during your high impact workout will be gained. The music on this DVD is wonderful too and puts you in a real mood for the moves. Sensuously, dance your way to fitness.",1124928000,23,927,4.395348837209302
1039187,5,6305480672,"...this is the DVD to buy. I had not been exercising for quite a while and needed inspiration. What a lucky break this DVD was. It's different, so not only do I not mind sweating, I look forward to working out with it! I also don't want to lose the gains I've made on learning the moves by not practicing! (I've surprised myself.) Best of all you can just take off your shoes, change into a tank top, and start exercising within 3 minutes of deciding you are going to exercise. (critical excuse avoidance)

The DVD has a fairly short instructional section in the beginning that describe the moves in detail.  She's in tights so you can see exactly what her hips, knees, and stomach are doing.  The rest of the video is workout and instruction combined.  The moves are repeated just often enough, long enough for you to get the move down a little better each time. (I don't want a video I can do all of it the first time)  She does small combinations in each section.  After I'd had the video for 30 days or so, I could do the whole video. Then I noticed I was concentrating on my posture and exactly how far forward I was pushing my hips and exactly how round my hip circles were.  The workout became more difficult. Now I am actually able to concentrate on being sexy and enjoying my non-model-sized body while ""dancing"" as much as I am ""exercising""

The only negative thing about this DVD is that there isn't a full dance on it--- for you to perform at the end. I was expecting that.  I would have taken 1/2 a star off for that if I could.

The music seems good to me, as limited as my experience with Belly Dance Videos is, but the music and the cues were perfect for the moves being taught. Best thing of all, I've lost an inch or two off my waist.  (Again, I had not been exercising quite in a while.) I've got an extra 2 inches of space in the waistband of my pants now. (Using, Hula work out and SHORT pilates video too) I thought my ACL repaired knee would be a problem, but it really wasn't and now because my legs are stronger, the knees are more stable; I took it real easy on the knees at first but my knees are definitely better and need less anti-inflam. meds when I workout or walk long distance. This has been win-win-win for me.  I can't wait to get the other Shamira video.",1111449600,38,2291,4.241379310344827
1039188,4,6305480672,"I'd never tried bellydancing before so I was very anxious to get this DVD and start practicing.  The workout was fun and well explained for the hip movements, and I felt muscles being used that I don't normally feel with a normal low-impact aerobic workout.  For someone with no experience bellydancing however, there were definitely some problems.  For one, she is wearing a typical bellydancer's outfit with the long flowing skirts.  It is beautiful to look at, but unfortunately, it means at no time can you see the position of her feet, how she is moving her legs, or if her knees are locked or bent when she does a certain move.  The other problem was that she never really explains any arm movements so although your hips and thighs get a great workout, she moves her arms randomly throughout the entire tape so there is nothing to follow along with.  As I said though, I enjoyed the DVD quite a bit, but I'll probably end up using it as a backup workout once I have a better understanding of the leg and arm movements that go along with it.",1108944000,67,1047,4.484210526315789
1039189,5,6305480672,"This workout is as the title say ""sensuous"", and it makes you feel very sexy.  I have the VHS actually and have used it for over 2 years now and still inspired me. I am ordering the DVD version to give my VHS a rest. Shamira gives you the basic movements before the exercise/dance program. There is a music video at the end which shows Shamira's good sense of humor, down to earth personality and her ""obsession"" of star trek! (her website proclaim she is a trekkie!). I have e-mailed her a few times for questions and what not and she always response right away.

For the beginners, the dance might be a bit intermediate but be patient you will get it in no time as you continue to do the workout. I have a background in latin and belly dancing so it's a bit easy to follow her movements.",1102291200,20,789,4.253333333333333
1039190,5,6305480672,"I'm so glad Shamira listened to the wise words of a certain fan--grin--and had her videos put onto DVD.  Having met this lady in person and seen her teach, as well as dance, I can say that she knows what she is doing.  Belly dancing is not something Shamira does merely to pay the bills; it is her means of self-expression, of sensuality.  It is her art.
Unlike many artists, however, Shamira is not only knowledgeable about her craft but is also able to convey her knowledge in a down-to-earth and comprehensible manner.  Her DVD reflects this in every way.  It is, as she says, devoid of frills and fluff, concentrating instead on teaching the student the basic movements.  She explains clearly what she is doing as she goes along, and each movement is given its own chapter on the DVD, so if the viewer finds one move more challenging than another, she need only select that move's particular chapter from the menu.  And of course, Shamira is more than happy to answer any questions a novice might have, as I have discovered by e-mailing her myself.
My recommendation:  do yourself or a loved one a favor and buy this DVD.  The sensuous woman rests in all of us, so wake her up and embrace her, already!",1083801600,29,1206,4.52073732718894
1039191,5,6305480672,"Before I bought this DVD straight from Shamira herself I thought I'd read up on the reviews that were typed up here on this page. There were more good remarks than there were bad ones so I took the chance and got it. All I can say is WOW. This is a wonderful CD full of great combinations thats sure to help you put more interesting moves into the way you dance as well as workup a sweat. One of these reviews says something to the effects of  ""if you are looking for a bellydance workout try Suzanna Del Vecchio"" I have both her workout tapes and I love them and would reccommend them, I would also reccommend Keti Sharif's Bodyquake I love that one too and in the same breath I would reccommend this one too!! Why? cos' I love that one too. To me I can wake up and think do I feel like a strenuous workout or do I feel working up a sweat or do I feel like being sensuous!!",1081382400,2,874,4.022988505747127
1039192,5,6305480672,"is now on DVD!  I took one of Shamira's classes, but unfortunately, it was a bit of a drive for me.  In lieu of having her directly before me, I bought Bellydancing:  The Sensuous Workout with Shamira on VHS.  I found it to be direct and to the point, and Shamira maintained throughout her kind teaching manner, as well as her lovely dancing technique.  I certainly recommend the video; however, please note that Shamira has taken my suggestion of having a DVD version made. ...",1080259200,2,478,4.576470588235294
1039193,3,6305480672,"This is a lovely video and I'm sure new(er) people who buy it and try it will learn some solid fundamentals of belly dance.
As a negative, it's titled as a ""workout"" tape, yet, it seems to be paced as in instructional tape. I found that very disappointing. I was hoping to get my heart rate up following the tape, and that didn't happen. Also, Shamira wears skirts that conceal her legs through most of the workout. Since much of the ""hip"" work in belly dance is actually ""knee"" work, that made it difficult to follow certain moves.
On the plus side, Shamira is a beautiful, graceful, and sensual dancer. She has a good motivating sense of humor in both her dance and voice-over narrarion. Her arm work was almost hypnotic. And, she packed a phenomenal amount of both repitition and variation within the 50-ish minutes of dance time.
I definately recommend it as a keeper if you want to learn to Belly dance. Just don't buy it as an exercise tape, and be warned that some moves may be frustating to learn if you haven't been exposed to them elsewhere.",1044921600,14,1051,4.507853403141361
1039234,5,6305480672,"I am fairly new to belly dancing and LOVE it!  I have taken some classes, attended a workshop, and have purchased a couple of videos.  I found Shamira's video to be the best of the ones I've seen.  I do not understand why anyone would give this tape a negative review...it is easily the best of the instructional tapes that I've seen...and I've seen some of the ones mentioned in other reviews and they are NOT anywhere near as good as this tape.
Shamira clearly demonstrates each move and her use of combinations is excellent.  The video is well produced and well worth the price.  I hope to some day dance half as well as Shamira!
Happy dancing to all!",1020384000,,654,4.416666666666667
1039235,1,6305480672,"Shamira's video is geared for a low-level intermediate dancer who already has a grasp of how to do the movements and is looking for some guidance in putting them together into a dance routine. It is not for beginners--there is no clear instruction on how to do the movements and Shamira does not emphasize the importance of maintaining the basic posture (pelvis tucked, back long, shoulders up and relaxed, knees bent)--and the advanced and higher level intermediate dancer will quickly be bored by the simplicity of the combinations. My advice as a dancer/instructor of Middle Eastern dance for the past 20 years? Buy this video used or borrow a friend's copy and save your money. For much better instructional/workout videos, I highly recommend Introduction to Middle Eastern Dance by Kathryn Ferguson for beginners/low level intermediate dancers. Definitely the best beginners video I've seen on the market yet (Bastet Productions is her website, surf for it). For high level intermediate/advanced dancers looking for a real workout, I recommend Suzanna Del Vecchio's Precision Workout (again surf and you'll find her website). 45 minutes that will make you sweat. Standard disclaimers apply: I get nothing for mentioning these vids, I'm simply a satisfied customer.",1017187200,18,1269,5.318407960199005
1039236,5,6305480672,"Shamira is very good dancer, she has a wonderful technique. I will recomend this video for an intermediate or advanced dancer.
I like this video very much, is not just to workout. You will learn lots of bellydance moves.",1008115200,,220,4.666666666666667
1039237,4,6305480672,"I am pleased with moves that are taught, but I thought there would be some routines to practice your newly acquired moves with. Oh well... Shamira is very beautiful and graceful, it is a very good tape.",1004659200,2,202,4.486486486486487
1039238,4,6305480672,"I have had absolutely no previous experience before I got this tape, and it was strenuous.  I know I still don't look sensuous but I did find muscles I didn't know I had.  I do feel more graceful, after 2 weeks I still can't do the whole tape.  I am working up to it!  She explains very well, and if I don't get it I just rewind.  It is a good tape, very well made.",996710400,3,365,3.8133333333333335
1039239,1,6305480672,"I am very disappointed to have spent so much money on this videotape: 1) It is neither a ""workout"" nor an instructional videotape about bellydancing!!!!!!!  It might lightly tone your lower body, at best -- with very little cardiovascular benefit.  Bellydancing moves are introduced VERY preliminarily, so you won't get a solid foundation in bellydancing from the tape either. 2) As others mentioned, it is VERY, VERY difficult to see what Shamira is doing from the waist down -- which is of course what you need to see in order to learn bellydancing!!!!!! Even in the beginning of the tape when she supposedly demonstrates the basic maneuvers, she is wearing a strange half-skirt which makes it somewhat difficult to see what she is doing. IN THE MAJORITY OF THE TAPE YOU CANNOT SEE ANYTHING FROM HER WAIST DOWN AT ALL!!! Not even her feet, hardly!  This fact alone makes the tape almost useless to me. If we had been able to see her body, I am quite sure I would have given this tape at least a two-star or three-star rating.  She does look absolutely stunning in her full costumes, and her dancing is beautiful -- but that is not why I bought this tape. I also bought Veena & Neena's tape -- the sensual dance set -- and although they are not quite as impressive in their technique as Shamira, at least you can see them demonstrate the moves clearly!!! 3) ... The production is not particularly good. The set is ""authentic"" but the lighting is fairly weak and it's a bit difficult to see her.
There are a few good things: If you already know some bellydancing, I think this would be a nice supplement in order to learn a few sequences and to learn how to put some moves together and to start learning to improvise a bit. But this tape is *definitely* not for beginners!!!!!!!! I might find this tape a bit useful once I master the basic foundations.
Overall, however, I am boggled at all of the glowing reviews written here. All i can say is, Shamira must have a lot of friends!
One last note: I agree with the reviewer who said that this is more of a dance tape than a workout tape -- if you are looking for a workout that incorporates some bellydance elements, this is not what you are looking for. This is more like a bellydance practice/refresher tape for intermediates.
I am not plugging Veena and Neena, but so far (after a week with both tapes) their ""basic moves"" tape is a lot more useful to me, as a beginner. And a hell of a lot less expensive.",996710400,24,2458,4.467706013363029
1039240,5,6305480672,"What a great video. I originally ordered this tape because I wanted to trying a workout that offered something fun and different from what I'm used to. I certainly got my money's worth. This is a great video. The movements are explained in a very clear and precise way. Don't be fooled, it is definitely a workout! My respect for bellydancers has grown even more since viewing this tape.",996537600,,387,4.6231884057971016
1039241,5,6305480672,"Shamira's instructions were absolutely clear.  I like the way the entire tape is designed to be an easy-to-follow, step-by-step workout.  Unlike another tape that I also bought that tries to teach many things in one tape, this one emphasizes on the basic elements such as hip work and steps and spends more time reviewing the fundamentals with the audience, which I personally think are the most important foundations for people who are serious about learning more of belly-dancing.  I could follow the instructions thoroughly.
The only thing I didn't quite like about it is the last part of the video.  I had expected Shamira to present a short dance, but instead it was like a short MTV of her in various circumstances -- restaurants, garden, sweeping the floor!  That was the only part that I found weird.
But as an overall, it is a VERY GOOD basic instructional tape.  I plan to purchase more instructional tapes by Shamira.",995414400,15,928,4.841772151898734
1039242,4,6305480672,"I have recently gotten interested into bellydancing and the only available video for me was Shamira's.  Shamira includes a warm -up and goes through many basic movements. For someone who is unable to go to a class to learn bellydancing, Shamira's tape is excellent and can be done by all people of different sizes and shapes.  This tape is definitly reccommended for even first time beginners.",993427200,,393,4.9393939393939394
1039243,5,6305480672,"I have taken some classes with Shamira, and this video is simply wonderful. It is high quality, easy to watch, and she breaks down the movements very well for beginners. I love the music video at the end. If you can't tell, she's a Trekkie fanatic! The camera work is good, she has plenty of costume changes. She adds a bit of fantasy that you may or may not like, depending on your tastes. I like it. This is a good workout video. Sweat nuts may complain (as they would about most belly dance videos) that the exercise is not strenuous enough, but I don't believe that fitness equals pain. This is good for all levels of fitness. Buy it, you'll love it!",992822400,,654,4.32520325203252
1039322,5,6305480672,"I totally love and enjoy this video. It shows you step by step without boring you. It easy to follow but at the same time challenging enough. Both begginers and intermediate will find this workout satisfying. True to it's title, it is a very sensual one since it focus on hips movement. If you want to master all the hips movement this is the video you're looking for. She looks comfortable in front of the camera and the voice over is great. This is a sexy workout you will have fun with! I'm pretty sure I will be doing this video workout over and over again....
I only wish she includes the steps on arms movement and undulations. Another great workout video that includes this moves is The Goddess Workout,it doesn't hurt to check this one out, it is equally enjoyable and fun.",990921600,6,781,4.468531468531468

It feels kind of silly doing from time to time (heck, I don't think I'd do this anyplace else right at this point, not even in front of the husband! LOL) but its very simple, and if you don't ""feel the burn"" you at least feel better after you do it (probably from all the stretching and swinging the hips.....which is a nice change from pain the next day from other workouts)I've been out of town for two months, but I think I'll be pulling this tape out to start my workout again very very soon!",976147200,2,552,4.12037037037037
1039324,4,6305480672,"This is a really well put together video.  I am a extreme beginner with bellydancing, and this video helped me to get some of the basic moves down.  The best part of the tape, in my opinion, was that it always showed her whole body while she danced.  With a lot of  workout or instructional dance videos you get a lot of close ups of the teacher's face.  For me, it is very difficult to get the moves without seeing the legs, arms and feet do the whole thing.  It is not terribly high intensity workout, but you do work up a sweat, and the tape goes by very quickly.  Almost 40 minutes goes by before you know it.",972000000,16,613,4.100840336134453

It's a great workout and  Shamira does a great job teaching the steps.  Great fun to do and it's  obvious Shamira has fun performing.  The costumes are incredible (had a  hard time deciding what to concentrate on - undulations or the beading on  her bra!)and the setting leads to the sensuous and lush feeling these moves  will inspire!,969321600,13,533,4.447916666666667

The instructions are very clear and  provides for a continuous workout.  I also liked the fact that each move is  repeated several times and not just demonstrated once. If you follow along,  you feel that the instructor is talking directly to you.  Also by having  the dancer in full costume and not in practice clothes allows you to see  the full effect of each sensuous move.

I lived in North  Africa for  a few years and while I already know a few  of the dance moves, it was  great to see her break down some of the dance moves I had seen done by  others but that I couldn't figure out how to do it myself.

If you are looking for a great work-out,  this IS it ! It is good for beginningers and even advanced too. She gets  all the main muscles one would use in bellydancing. You should really get  this video, I am super strict in what I like, and Shamira is great !  I  can't believe I haven't heard more about this video ! I really enjoyed the  music, and the little scene at the end. In each different section of the  video she has a change of costume. They are beautiful.

I like the  warmup section especially. I like to use this warmup before any kind of exercise, or any other exercise video. She also teaches the movements one by one and breaks them down in very simple terms for beginners. The workout itself is very gentle. I would recommend this video to beginners, especially those without any other dance background who find other DVDs intimidating. I also recommend it to anyone who is so out of shape they can't make it through an entire intense workout. I liked to use this video to get back into exercise after recovering from a soft tissue knee sprain (which I used to get pretty regularly, and it always took no less than 8 weeks for recovery, by which time I was totally out of shape from not exercising). Just start with the warmup exercises. Do those one night, then just work your way up to doing all the sections of the DVD. Good basic instruction. Good basic exercises. It's a keeper.  (The Star Trek intro is also very entertaining. I wish she would also make an entire Star-Trek themed workout bellydance DVD in actual 60s retro Star Trek costumes.

Her incredible gracefulness, especially in her arm movements, is pure inspiration.  I learned a lot just watching and imitating her arms, once I got the hang of the hip moves.  Downsides are no mention of upper body isolation and moves, she focuses on the hips and legs with a short shimmy section.  Having already had dance experience I did not need details on leg and feet, although her beginning section does show her in tights so that you can see her leg and feet positions.  But her dancing is incredibly graceful and just by imitating her hip and arm moves, I added a lot to my own dancing.  And you truly do feel sensuous!  I've never seen any other video that shows as much the playful, fun-loving and graceful spirit as this one.  Definitely worth buying as part of a collection.  Even though there is no upper body work, I gave it 5 stars because it is so unique and captures the essence of sensuous belly dancing.",1325462400,,1022,4.365079365079365
7890524,4,6305480672,"This DVD is wonderful, if you know what to expect from it. It's not super long (46 min), and it won't fulfill every desire, but it does what it does very well.

Let me start with the negatives, and save people some money. Do not get this video if you want:
- A high intensity workout. It's not, it's just not. I do break a sweat sometimes, especially if I try to follow along with her arms, but you won't feel challenged if you dance regularly.
- Thorough bellydance instruction. It really helps knowing the moves before, though she does introduce them in the ""Basic Movements"" section. I advise using this after another video, even after her Sensuous Workout 2.
- Lots of bellydance moves, complex technique.
- Shimmy work. Her shimmy section is very short. The video is much better on circles, hipwork, traveling steps and turns.
- Finally, and this is the reason I took off a point, while there is a warmup, it's short (no neck stretches, for example), and there's no cooldown. So you have to add to that on your own. Also, I really think every bellydance video should go over posture, just as a matter of course.

However, this video is fantastic if you want:
- A light, not too strenuous way to get moving and have fun. It might be a good way to start an exercise program, or to get moving if you've been sick or not dancing for a while. I have much fancier bellydance videos in my collection, but since dancing is my hobby, not my life, I wind up playing this one much more than I ever expected to. It's just great when you're not that energetic, you don't want to strain your back or knees, but you want to get moving and feel the spirit of the dance.
- A sense of the grace and beauty of bellydance. Shamira's style is not to string together a hundred movements in ten seconds, so if that's what impresses you, get something else. She uses a few movements (especially in this video), but she puts them together in a lovely way, and gives you a sense of how you might make combinations out of them.
- Easy traveling and stationary combinations. It's nice practice.
- Incredible hands and arms. It's funny: to me, the loveliest part about Shamira's dancing are her hands and arms, but she doesn't really talk about them on the two Sensuous Workout videos too much. If you've got the steps of the video down, try following along with the arms -- it makes it much more challenging, and gives the video the potential to be used for a longer time.

To conclude, Shamira's dancing, even in this ""workout"" DVD, represents to me much of the reason I first got into bellydancing. She's graceful, expressive, and playful. I think even dancers who know many more moves than are represented on this DVD can stand to learn a lot from her, if they pay attention.",1202256000,6,2755,4.440711462450593
7890525,5,6305480672,"I just started taking belly dancing classes and this was reccomended to me for home practice. Her moves are so beautiful that I feel inspired to practice more and more! When I watch it I feel like if I practice I can get the moves and make them look as beautiful as she does. I wish I could see her feet and knees better, but I love everything else about it. I also love that she works on specific moves and add little variations to keep it interesting. She doesn't add other moves that distract you. I feel like I can focus on specific moves and ""get"" what she's teaching. I've done other DVD's where they show you a move, you practice it a few times and then they are adding it to others to create combinations. As a new bellydancer, I like Shamira's format better.",1178323200,,767,4.260273972602739
7890526,4,6305480672,"It takes a little practice to keep up with this workout, but it's very fun and rewarding.  I wish she would give a little more warning when she's changing moves, but it's easy to learn with practice.",1172275200,,199,4.378378378378378
7890527,5,6305480672,"I have had about a year's worth of beginners belly dance classes. Due to a move into an area where belly dancing is not offered, I've resorted to purchasing several belly dance DVDs. I must say that Shamira's, by far, are the absolute best especially for a beginner or someone with limited previous experience.

I'm 40 years old, slightly overweight, do not have the best body coordination in the world and I have permanent toe and ankle injuries that semi limit what I am able to do physically.

Shamira's Sensuous Workout allows me to put those handicaps aside to get a wonderful workout and I don't feel like a total fool executing the moves. She explains and shows the movements well. She also does an excellent job of talking us through the drills which are broken down into ""figure 8's"", ""Hipwork"", ""Shimmies"" etc.  Each drill is long enough to feel like you've gotten a good workout but not so long as to be boring or impossible to accomplish.

I've had so much fun working with Sensuous Workout.  In fact I've had numerous times where upon finishing I was like ""wow!  I'm done already!""  When was the last time you could say THAT about a workout video?",1165190400,4,1160,4.601941747572815
7890528,2,6305480672,I have several Bellydance workouts by different artists.  I did not enjoy this workout at all.  It had received such great reviews that I just had to order it.  I've only done this workout once and walked away from it feeling disappointed.  It has been several months since I did this workout so I apologize for not being able to go into specifics...sorry.,1162425600,,356,4.603174603174603

7890530,3,6305480672,"This DVD is great if you're interested in toning your abs and strengthening your lower back... but that's it. I've been bellydancing for awhile and I find that this DVD is a good bellydancing introductory.

Shamira hits the basic steps for hip movements and only hip movements missing basic steps for the feet and arms.

The run time is rather short. It left me dissatisfied. It would be nice to see one bellydance routine as an extra just so you can get a better idea on how to put it all together.",1155427200,7,499,4.413043478260869
