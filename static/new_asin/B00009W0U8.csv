Sable vs Torrie - *, boring unless you watch WWE for softcore porn. I dont, so it wasn't very good.
The FBI & John Cena vs Rhyno, Chris Benoit & Spanky - ***, Good match but not for a PPV match. More like a match you'd see on Smackdown
Battle Royal for the  Intercontinental Title - ****, thank God the IC Title is back. And with a surprise ending.
WWE Tag Team Championship -- Ladder Match
Eddie Guerrero & Tajiri vs Team Angle - ****, Absolutly awesome, not the best tag ladder match but definatly awesome.
Mr. American vs Rowdy Roddy Piper - ***,  Two very slow, fat old men, thankfully this match wasn't very long but it got a good reaction with some near falls.
Jazz vs Trish Stratus vs Jacqueline vs Victoria - *, Again, these women wrestlers cant wrestle, they are very boring.
World Heavyweight Championship
Kevin Nash vs Triple H - ***, Well, although it was better than I thought it would be. That's still not saying much. Cool ending with Trips going through the announcers table though.
WWE Championship -- Stretcher Match
Brock Lesnar vs Big Show - *****, This was absolutly insane. They beat the tar out of each other. Big Show proved he can wrestle 20 minutes with an athlete like Lesnar. And take very big bumps. Definatly a highlight of Big Show's career. Good to see they are building his credibility up. There was alot of times in this match where you thought it was over, but then something crazy would happen. Show took some nasty bumps, falling onto a stretcher was one. Lesnar had some help from Rey Rey at the end and went crazy on Big Show. And a very unbelievable ending you have to see to believe.
Overall, its the 3rd best WWE PPV so far this year. Right behind Wrestlemania XIX and No Way Out.",1055894400,,1765,4.411042944785276
1891367,5,B00009W0U8,"THIS SHOW WAS EXCELLENT may be more intense than Wrestlemania XIX which had according to me only one greeeeat match and you know which one if you look at my name...
So let's go back to judgment day BROTHER!
Benoit and his friends did a good opening contest ,fast ,may be too fast against gli italiani VAI VAI VAI! Very good match but too short.
MR AMMMMEriCA is back ,not dusty rhodes dude,Hogan gave us a classical fight but hogan is hogan if u know what i mean...
Now ladies and gentlemen USA VS FRA .La Rsistance represents my country ?What a poor attire for those 2 guys;;;!!!Nobody ,i mean nobody wears ""berets"" in France since the time the Titanic sank around 1912 man,what a shame for two talented men who fought against steiner and the hal-fasshaircuttedpunk named TEST, test what?
Stacy was there and it was entertainning for once,for a steiner's match...Nobody cared about the issue but the americans AHAHAHAHH, it was fine after all.
Another great match was the one oppposing SABLE AND TORRIE in a bikini contest,DON'T MISS THIS ONE ,girls goes wild sometimes...
Trple H flew right trough a table ,think he won't forget this event?
The battle royal for the InterREcontinental Title was very desapointing with 5 men out after 10 secondes,Why the bookers did that?Christian won ,a new push for a skinny 'chump!
Eddie and Tajiri did a good perf in a non appropriate ladder confrontation because of the injurie of Chavo,the match was good but if you saw The HardyZ before at LADDERS 1,2,3..ect you will forget this one with some phone called moves.
Brock Lesnar took Big show to the skys in this show by putting him on a truck to bring him out of the ring in this ""STRETXCHA MATCH "" MAN i hope this one will never, EVER ,Happen ,Again!",1055548800,,1742,4.622580645161291
1891368,3,B00009W0U8,"I saw other reviews calling this the best pay-per-view ever! They must not have seen many pay-per-views. The Triple H-Nash match was one of the worst title matches ever! Triple H has lost it and Nash never had it. Most of the rest of the card is a boring utter, waste.
The only two saving graces are Team Angle v. Eddie and Tajiri & Brock vs The Big Show. The former was a good ladder match with some great spot by Eddie and Benjamin. The strecher match with Brock was a fun one, with a great ending!
If your willing to buy for two good matches, go ahead. Otherwise, there are dozen of better pay-per-views to choose from.",1055462400,,622,4.279661016949152
1891369,1,B00009W0U8,"This ppv had the worst match lineup of all time. First of all, the opening six-man tag between Rhyno, Benoit,and Spanky and the FBI and Cena lasted about 2 minutes and was not exciting at all. Once again Chris Benoit got the shaft as he had to wrestle in a dork match that no one cared about. Next up was a lame tag match between La Resistance and Test and Scott Steiner. I think La Resistance has potential but watching Test and Steiner is painful because they both royally [aren't good]. The ladder match for the wwe tag-team titles was decent but the storyline behind it was kind of thrown out the window when Chavo got injured.  Eddie and Tajiri did well against Team Angle(who should really drop the ANGLE from their name since Kurt isn't around). The IC battle royal was nothing spectacular. Kane was the first man eliminated which is pretty f'n ridiculous. Hulk Hogan wrestled Roddy Piper in his lame [rear] Mr America gimmick. Some kid with one leg interfered and helped Hogan. It is pretty funny that Hogan has to get help from amputees to win matches. I honestly thought that the World Heavyweight championship match would be a great match, but Triple H and Kevin Nash did not deliver. It lasted all of 7 minutes with the ending coming on a sledgehammer shot to the refs chest.  Nash powerbombed the game through a table to salvage some entertainment. It is too bad, because this could have been a great rivalry and storyline but everything leading up to it was dull and so was the match. At the time I am writing this, I am hoping Hell in a Cell is off the charts to propel the Game back into a streak of excellent matches. Finally, the Stretcher match for the WWE title was oaky, but could have been so much more brutal. I really dislike Smackdown and most of the talent they have on the show.",1055462400,,1805,4.450151057401813

1891389,2,B00009W0U8,"Judgment Day 2003 was pretty bad and I'll go on record and point out this is the worst ppv of 2003. The highlights from this ppv was the stretcher match and the tag team ladder match.

Co-GM Stone Cold Steve Austin opens up the show and welcomes the Charlotte crowd to Judgment Day. This soon will lead to a bunch of segments involving Stone Cold & Eric Bischoff throughout the night up in Stone Cold's press box.

1. Six Man Tag
John Cena & the F.B.I. w/ Nunzio vs. Chris Benoit, Rhyno, & Brian Kendrick
Very short match. I would say only about 3 tags in the whole match. Benoit was very fired up and Kendrick was pretty good. Decent at best. 2/5

2. Scott Steiner & Test w/ Stacy Keibler vs. La Resistance
This was a slightly better bout but only due to it was a little bit longer than the first match. Another decent tag match here. 2/5

3. Ladder Match for the WWE Tag Team Titles
Shelton Benjamin & Charlie Haas vs. Eddie Guerrero & Tajiri
It was originally suppose to be Eddie and Chavo but Chavo got hurt a couple of days earlier and couldn't compete. This was a far better match than the previous matches. Haas & Benjamin seemed like they knew what they were doing with the ladders and they pulled some very good and interesting moveneuvers as well. Eddie was good too and so was Tajiri.
Some nice bumps and shots onto and off the ladder. Eddie was able to do his frog splash off the ladder onto Benjamin. A good relief right here. 4.25/5

4. Battle Royal for the vacant IC Title
Kane vs. Chris Jericho vs. Christian vs. Booker T vs. Lance Storm vs. RVD vs. Goldust vs. Val Venis vs. Test

Some smart person in the back figured out that keeping the IC title belt vacant wasn't a good idea. The first five eliminations came so fast just all at the same time, right after another. The final four put a pretty alright match up. There was a few double teaming from the four guys. But the true highlight of the match was how Jericho got eliminated by Christian. That was the best part of the match. A controversary ending that turned into a rivalry between Christian and Booker t. 3.25/5

Bikini Challenge hosted by Tazz
Sable vs. Torrie Wilson
Both gals looked unbelieveable hot. WWE would never show anything this hot on free tv, haha. Both Torrie & Sable was the winners in my view.

5. Mr. America (Hulk Hogan) vs. Roddy Piper w/ Sean O'Hare
A horrible match. Nothing good or decent came from this whatsoever, a pure waste of time between these two old timers. 0.5/5

6. World Heavyweight Title
Kevin Nash w/ Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H w/ Ric Flair
Just a nasty brawl, not even a match at all. Earl Hebner would be out for the majority of the match and then get hit by the sledgehammer. Just an all out brawl. Triple h would get jacknifed through the announce table which ended this confrontation. 3/5

7. Fatal Four Way for the Women's Title
Trish Stratus vs. Victoria w/ Stevie Richards vs. Jacqueline vs. Jazz w/ Teddy Long
The women didn't brought their game on this night. A couple of good spots here and there but nothing good. Trish takes a hard shot onto the floor which looked nasty but the match was nothing out of the ordinary. 2/5

8. Stretcher Match for the WWE Title
Brock Lesnar vs. Big Show
This match was more of revenge for Brock when the Big Show took out Rey at Backlash. These two guys really used the stretchers to its fullest right here. A lot of good spots with the stretchers and some good brawling. Rey would come out and help Brock to get the victory. Match of the night for me. 4.5/5

Judgment Day 2003 was a pretty bad ppv. Its passable.",1221004800,,3574,4.3578947368421055
1891390,4,B00009W0U8,"Hurricane VS Stevie Richards: Extra match from Heat is pretty good.

John Cena & FBI VS Chris Benoit, Rhyno, & Brian Kendrick: I enjoyed Cena's prematch rap disses. This was a good way to kick off the PPV, nothing to speical but still good.

Steve Austin and Eric Bischoff have skits going on thru out the night, not really funny and pretty stupid. The story is Bischoff couldn't hold Austin's food or beer, cant remeber or nor care too.

Scott Steiner & Test VS La Resistance: A decent little match but La Resistance did botch alot of moves on Steiner. Test never really gets in and he ""accidentally"" nails Steiner with a big boot and Resistance wins. This was to further the stupid Test-Steiner feud for Stacy.

Gregory Helms interviews Mr. America, I will admit probably the funniest promo Hogan ever did and only reason why I mention it.

Team Angle VS Eddie Guerrero and Tajiri: This is a lost classic ladder match. It was very well done and a must watch.

Battle Royal for the Intercontinental Title with Christian, Kane, Test, Booker T, Goldust, Val Venis, Chris Jericho, Lance Storm, and RVD: A decent Battle Royal but nothing speical. I did enjoy the ending though.

Mr. America ""with Zach Gowan"" VS Roddy Piper ""with Sean O'Haire"": This is a typical Hogan (Mr. America) match, not bad but very typical. It did go well though.

Sable VS Torrie in a Bikini Contest: I'm not horny enough to watch this, even though it's pretty steamy.

Kevin Nash VS Triple H: Ric Flair was in Triple H's corner and Shawn Michael's was in Nash's corner. Both men are gone from ringside before the match starts. A typical Nash match, a typical Triple H ending for the time. The match was going good and Nash powerbombing Triple H thru the Raw table at the end was satisfying.

Jazz VS Victora VS Jacqueline VS Trish: Why put this before the main event?

Brock Lesnar VS Big Show in a Stretcher match: A short main event thats a pure brawl. I enjoyed it and the ending was pretty awesome.

1891392,2,B00009W0U8,"I have too many insulting review titles that ""Judgment Day 2003"" has inspired out of me.  I disliked it back in 2003, and every time I've tried to watch it since, I get even more angry at it.  I better give the Devil his due before I get even more upset and make a 1-star review.

Let's start with the opener!  On one team, you have a young John Cena and The FBI.  The other team is comprised of Rhyno, Brian Kendrick, and Chris Benoit.  Sounds like a decent match, doesn't it?  Well, it's decent...for the whole 4 minutes it lasts!  Who in their right mind put Chris Benoit in a 4 minute match!?  I don't think Rhyno even gets a legal tag-in for the whole time.  What a stupid way to use these 6 men, and we're just getting started.

Next up is La Resistance defending their World Tag Tag Titles against the bickering team of Scott Steiner & Test, with lovely Stacy Keibler at ringside.  The Test/Steiner feud got stale before it even began, but to be fair, I thought this two-on-two match was okay.  The crowd was behind Test & Steiner, thanks to La Resistance doing their cheap anti-USA schtick.  In the end, I doubt anybody cared about this one.

There is one above-average match on the card.  Eddie Guerrero and Tajiri (replacing Chavo) challenge Shelton Benjamin & Charlie Haas for the WWE Tag Team Titles in a Ladder Match.  While not even close the best of the WWE's Ladder Matches, this was a very entertaining contest.  The only real problem with this one is that Haas & Benjamin didn't look like they knew what they were doing with the Ladder spots, and I don't think it was a ""performance"" either.  But they all pulled it off.  This match was rightfully kept off the WWE's 3-disc ""Ladder Match"" set, but it was a nice breath of fresh air for this dreadful PPV.

The match that angered me the most was probably the Battle Royal for the newly-reinstated Intercontinental Title.  Eric Bischoff shelved the belt for about 7 months because he only wanted one champion on ""RAW"", but somehow it was decided that it was time to bring it back.  Now, the premise is very intriguing.  Have a 9-man Battle Royal, with each wrestler being former IC Title holders.  And to top it off, have Pat Patterson award the belt to the winner.  So, guess what happens?  Well, over half of the wrestlers are eliminated in a matter of 2 minutes, with little method to the madness.  Before you know it, Chris Jericho and Christian are double-teaming Booker T (the only non-former IC champ) for a boring length of time.  And when it finally ends, you've just awakened from a deep sleep.  Fun, huh?

WWE then tried to wake us up with a Bikini Contest between Sbale and Torrie Wilson.  I gotta be honest, I found this to be entertaining.  Sometimes, WWE manages to put on a decent ""talking segment"", and they even throw in a lesbian kiss for our viewing pleasure.  I have to admit I was satisfied with this little skit.  Then again, I'm a heterosexual male.

So, as if disgracing the Intercontinental Title wasn't bad enough, how about revisiting an 80s feud that nobody thought would be worth it.  Roddy Piper, in an embarassing return to the WWE ring, decided to pick a fight with Hulk Hogan, who was wrestling under the persona ""Mr. America.""  Now, I have to be honest, I thought Mr. America was a hilarious concept, and it made me laugh everytime I saw it.  But this match was awful.  Asbolutely awful.  Even if you're not a fan of Hogan's, you admit that his matches a certain charm that just clicked with a lot of people.  But this has none of that spark.  It's just a confusing mess that seemed to be more about Mr. McMahon and introducing us to Zach Gowen rather than giving Piper & Hogan something worthwhile.  In short, this was the worst match on the card.

Still with me?  Alright, now the ""Judgment Day"" PPVs have a strange history when it comes to title matches (see 1998, 2004, or 2009), and here's another example.  Triple H defends his World Heavyweight Championship against recently-returned Kevin Nash.  To hype things even more, Shawn Michaels and Ric Flair got their own entrance as the cornermen for Nash & HHH, respectively.  And once the bell rings, Nash basically decimates HHH, with ""The Game"" only getting in a few moments of momentum.  The action was fast-paced, and I was enjoying myself.  And then...HHH gets himself disqualified.  DQ finishes are enough to tick off fans in general, but I personally thought it made sense.  HHH was overpowered, cowarded his way out of it, and got beaten even more for his cheap tactics.  The Jackknife Powerbomb that Nash put HHH through the announcer table was sick to watch.  All in all, I liked this match, but understand why some people hate its frustrating finish.

Next is a Fatal Fourway for the Women's Title.  Oddly enough, it's one of the best matches on the card.  You get to see Trish Stratus, Victoria, Jacqueline, and Jazz (the champion) duke it out for the gold.  Everything moves at a quick pace, and while nothing special, it was nice to see the Divas get in on the action.  The ladies division has been on-and-off in terms of quality.  This nice little cooldown of a match will show that 2003 was a quality year for the Divas.

Our main event pits Big Show against WWE champion Brock Lesnar in a Stretcher Match.  I've always believed that nobody worked with Big Show better than Lesnar, and this contest is another solid entry in their matches together.  WWE hadn't had this kind of match in a long time, which I think did both men a great favor so that they didn't have to worry about comparisons to other Stretcher Matches.  After 5+ years, the match holds up.  Both men are evenly-matched, and the Stretcher spots are quite good.  Rey Mysterio makes a neat little entrance, and Lesnar makes an even more dynamic re-entrance!  This is one that doesn't look like much on paper, but if you've ever seen what Lesnar & Show can do together, you'll be curious to check out this Stretcher Match.
________________________________________________________

Unfortunately, the good Ladder Match and good Stretcher Match all went to waste.  I forgot to mention that the PPV has a running gag where Steve Austin and Eric Bischoff share a box suite, with Austin getting Bischoff more sick with beer and food as time goes on.  But as many hardcore fans believe, as long as the wrestling is good, we don't care about any of that other stuff.  ""Judgment Day 2003"" fails on that basis.

A lot of PPVs have interesting ideas that just weren't executed well.  But ""Judgment Day 2003"" wasn't even well-conceived before the show began.

Match One-Spanky,Rhyno & Chris Benoit Vs Chuck Palumbo,Johnny Stamboli & John Cena-Cena comes out and cuts his rap on his opponents and on teaming with the FBI. There was lots of high flying moves by Spanky and lots of teamwork by Palumbo,Cena and Stamboli. This match was average except Benoit got about 40 seconds in the ring and Rhyno didn't get tagged in. The ending was very innovative except it didn't make this short match much better. My rating 5.63/10.

Match Two-Scott Steiner & Test Vs La Resistance-This was an ordinary match which makes two ordinary tag matches to start this show. The length was average but it was good cause it wasn't a great match. The ending was a lot of miscommunication between two members of a team. My rating 5.42/10.

Match Three-Ladder Match-WWE Tag Team Championship-Charlie Haas & Shelton Benjamin Vs Eddie Guerrero & Tajiri-This match had some absolutely great spots with Eddie and all the wrestlers but Tajiri missed a couple and nearly killed himself trying to do a plancha. This was a great idea for the tag team titles. My rating 7.13/10.

Match Four-Battle Royal-Intercontinental Championship-Val Venis Vs Y2J Vs Christian Vs Lance Storm Vs Kane Vs RVD Vs Goldust Vs Test Vs Booker T-This was a Battle Royal to see who the new Intercontinental Champion is after it was vacated in October 2002. The match was pretty much a brawl. The winner got eliminated and cheated to win the title. Feud these people with each other as it was enjoyable 7.25/10.

Match Five-Bikini Challenge-Torrie Wilson Vs Sable-This was just a big waste of time. Sable has talent and should be on Raw using it in the Womens Division. My rating 0/10.

Match Six-Mr America Vs ""Rowdy""Roddy Piper-This had lots of interference from Zach Gowan and from Sean O Haire. It was an average match bout six minutes or so. But you can't expect much more from two old wrestlers. My rating 5.89/10.

Match Seven-World Heavyweight Championship-HHH(C)Vs Kevin Nash-This match was pretty pathetic with Nash and Hunter just brawling with lots of ref bumps. This will have a remath no matter what. My rating 6/10.

Match Eight-Fatal Fourway-Jazz(C)Vs Trish Stratus Vs Victoria Vs Jacqueline-This was better then most womens matches with the faces and heels teaming on each other. Lets get a feud happening. My rating 5.13/10.

Match Nine-Main Event-Stretcher Match-WWE Championship-Brock Lesnar(C)Vs Big Show-This was better then most of the matches on the card if not all of them. It had two big men brawling for a while with F5's, Chokeslams and more signature moves. Rey Mysterio makes a come back and attacks. The ending was great and made the PPV look better with the ending of this. My rating 7.76/10.

Overall this PPV was rather dull with only the Battle Royal,Stretcher Match and the Ladder Match doing good. The score for this show is 50.21/90 which is equal to 55.78% which is alright. That in a grade is a C+ which is ok. I reccommend only buying this if your a mad fan.",1119916800,,3604,4.892026578073089

Both women are gorgeous.  But we've seen them naked so that renders this crap.  Just plain stupid.

1. Chris Benoit, Rhyno, & Spanky vs. John Cena, Johnny Stamboli, & Chuck Palumbo (Six Man Tag)

This match was never announced until the wrestlers came out.  It was actually a good match for while it lasted.  Very, very short match.  (7/10)

2. Scott Steiner & Test vs. La Resistance (World Tag Titles)

Yawn!  Boring match.  This was thrown in so the WWE could start the Steiner/Test fued, which actually ended up to be pretty good beef.  (6/10)

3. Eddie Guerrero & Tajiri vs. Shelton Benjamin & Charlie Haas (WWE Tag Titles/Ladder Match)

Tajiri was thrown in at the last second because of a shoulder injury to Chavo.  Not the best ladder match, but still very good nonetheless.  All competitors take good bumps in the match.  There are a couple of screw-ups.  Good finish.  (9/10)

4. Intercontinental Battle Royal (Winner Wins the Vacant IC Title)

I was really excited to see the IC belt back, and just as excited to see it decided in a Battle Royal.  This match was put together really badly.  It was too short and the ending was sloppy.  Wrestlers included: Chris Jericho, RVD, Kane, Christian, Booker T, Val Venis, Test, & Lance Storm.  (7.5/10)

5. Torrie Wilson vs. Sable (Bikini Contest)

Wow!  These girls are hot and the bikinis are skimpy.  (9/10)

7. Triple H vs. Kevin Nash (World Heavyweight Title)

Good beef, but not the best match.  Nash just didn't have it anymore.  The match is quick.  Post match is pretty sick, as Nash Jacknife's Triple H through the RAW announce table.  The following night on RAW, Triple H and Ric Flair had a classic match.  (7/10)

8. Jazz vs. Victoria vs. Jacqueline vs. Trish Stratus (Women's Title/Fatal Fourway)

Who cares.  Nothing happens.  (3/10)

9. Brock Lesnar vs. Big Show (WWE Title/Stretcher Match)

This was not the best PPV, but I recommend picking it up for the Ladder match.  Any ladder match is worth having.  The extras include the Andre The Giant/Killer Kahn Stretcher match from 1986.  It is weird because their is no commentary.

1891429,1,B00009W0U8,"Based on the one-line summary in blue above, you can pretty much already tell what I think of this Pay-Per-View. Read on to find out why it's so horrible. As always, prepare for spoilers.

Chuck Palumbo, Johnny Stamboli (F.B.I.), and John Cena def. Chris Benoit, Rhyno, and Brian ""Spanky"" Kendrick: This match lasted a total time of 3 minutes and 55 seconds. Six of the most talented guys on the entire roster get less than 4 minutes on this PPV? What a waste of these guy's talents. 1.5/10 (For it's shortness and for simply wasting these guys like this).

La Resistance def. Test and Scott Steiner: What is the reason for dressing up La Resistance in that attire? The WWE is trying to get them over as a serious tag team, but they have them wearing rediculous outfits that even Mike Shaw (Bastion Booger/Friar Ferguson/ Norman The Lunatic) would be embarassed to wear. What do you expect me to give this match as a rating? If you guessed that it was another bad match on this horrible card, then you guessed right. 1/10 (Although it could have been worse).

Ladder Match for the SmackDown! Tag Team Championship- Eddie Guerrero and Tajiri def. Team Angle (c) to win the titles: The original match was supposed to be Eddie and Chavo Guerrero vs. Team Angle, but Chavo was injured the Tuesday before this event took place. No mention of the injury was even said on SmackDown!, which they easily could have mentioned since he got injured before the actual taping of SD!. I remember a few days before this PPV, I even jokingly stated on a message board that they'd pick Tajiri as Eddie's partner and give them a name like ""United Nations"" or something. Well, half of my joking prediction came true. The match itself was pretty good, but this Team Angle vs. Los Guerreros/Eddie & Tajiri angle has been played out for far too long an/d we've basically seen matches like this one on SmackDown! for free. 6/10

Intercontinental Championship Battle Royal- Christian wins: You know something about this battle royal that never made any sense and shows that WWE can't even remember what they've already booked? When Steve Austin was setting this match up, he stated that only former Intercontinental Champions would be able to participate in it. Well, they decide to put Booker T in this thing, despite him never holding the IC title before. The WWE have brought back the Val Venis gimmick in this match, yet again. I'm writing this review around two months after this event took place, and the WWE have yet to use Val Venis in anything noteworthy or interesting so far, proving that it was a bad decision to bring him back in the first place. The Battle Royal itself was suprisingly bad, considering what kind of talent they had in this thing, but I guess it's pretty decent when comparing it to the rest of this card. 3/10

Bikini Contest- Torrie Wilson def. Sable: Lame. A complete waste of time and this is just the same crap that we saw on SmackDown! the past two months. Sable gets louder cheers and Torrie actually gets some boos, but Torrie is somehow declared the winner. Here is a quote from someone else who recapped this PPV on another site ""Think about it. If you can afford 35 bucks for this pay per view, you can afford the 6 or 7 bucks it takes to buy the Playboy's that they're in and actually get to see them NAKED instead of teasing us. And there's always the Internet"". I can't disagree with him there. 0/10

Mr. America def. Roddy Piper: Lets think about this for a minute, you've got two senior citizens that are 50 years old, then you've got Sean O'Haire (A man who has more talent then both of these geriatrics combined) sitting in the corner doing nothing. What do you do? If you're Vince McMahon, you obviously go with the two old has-beens. A rare occurance happens here, as this is another one of those matches that are so bad that they get a negative rating. -4/10

Raw Championship- Kevin Nash def. Triple H (c) By Dq, HHH retains: It should be noted that the WWE advertised for weeks that Ric Flair and Shawn Michaels were going to be in the corners of the two competitors, but now they don't want the two guys out there because their presence would overshadow that of the people in the ring (credit to Scott Kieth for this information). See, even Vince knows how bad this match will be, but yet he still goes through with it. Trips retains the title, proving that he won't even put his best friend over. Match ended in a srewjob finish and was quite awful. 0/10

Women's Championship Match- Jazz(c) def. Jacqueline, Victoria, and Trish Stratus: We see how important the Raw title is, just by having this Women's match go after it. This is basically the same exact match from the same exact people that they've had on Raw for months now. Well, at least Trish didn't win the title for the 13th time in the past year and the match wasn't as bad as some of the others. 1.5/10

SmackDown! Championship Match- Brock Lesnar(c) def. Big Show: The beginning of the match was a bit slow, but the ending really picked up and made the rating go up. 4.5/10 (not bad for a Big Show match).

Overall: Just a horrible Pay-Per-View and I'm glad I saw it for free, otherwise I might have actually been so mad that I would have thrown a brick through my t.v. I can't bad-mouth this PPV enough and I strongly recommend you to avoid this event at all costs.",1093219200,,5359,4.532574974146846

Chris Benoit, Rhyno, and Spanky vs The FBI and John Cena- Nice to see Spanky and The FBI on PPV, but why does every Spanky match have to turn into ""Who can beat Spanky up the most?"" Predictable ending hampers what would have otherwise been a solid match. 6 out of 10 stars.
Scott Steiner and Test w/Stacy Keible vs La Resistance- La Resistance is just a repackaged version of the UnAmericans that the WWE had last year, which in turn were just repackages of even older gimmicks. It's possible to be from another country and not be against the U.S. Which is one of the things that Smackdown got right with the FBI(Full Blooded Italians). This was the beginning of Test's turn against Steiner and it was quite obvious what they were building to. La Resistance still were green yet still get the vic. Go figure. 6 out of 10.
Team Angle vs Eddie Guerrero and Tajiri in a Ladder Match for the WWE Tag Team Championship-The big stand out match of the PPV. While not as good as past tag team ladder matches this match is still solid and with an unexpected ending with the newly formed Eddie Guerrero and Tajiri winning the titles. Ejoyable, brutal, and fun ladder match. Eddie Guerrero really starts to elevate himself in this match. 8 out of 10 stars.
Battle Royal for the Intercontinental Championship- Well, the IC Title is returning after being retired at No Mercy 2002. The rule was that any FORMER IC Champion could enter this Battle Royal. However, Stone Cold let Booker T enter and so it seemed obvious that he would win. However, the saving grace of this match is it's unexpected ending. Good to see the WWE pulling off at least some sort of an upset. 7 out of 10.
Torrie Wilson vs Sable in a Bikini Challenge- Both women are hot and both women have appeared in Playboy. Really, what is the point of having them in a bikini challenge. A waste of PPV time and space. 0 out of 10 stars.
Rowdy Woddy Piper w/Sean O'Haire vs Mr. America w/Zach Gowen(a.k.a. Tenacious Z)- Let the obvious be said that Mr. America is Hulk Hogan in a Captain America mask. Why the WWE feels the need to pirsue this stupid angle is beyond me, but whatever. A few months ago everyone was criticizing the Steiner/HHH matches. Well, here is one worse than both of those. Both men need someone to carry them, that does not mean that together they can carry a match. I like Roddy Piper, but he's a better manager/host than wrestler right now. 5 out of 10.
Triple H w/Ric Flair vs Kevin Nash w/Shawn Michaels- Triple H at it again with another one of his ""Former Best Friends."" Nothing totally horrible here, but definately nothing worth noting. A nice powerbomb spot after the match, but definately nothing that hasn't been seen on tv before. PPV worthy? Not really. 6 out of 10 stars.
Trish Stratus vs Jacqueline vs Victoria vs Jazz in a Fatal Four-Way for the Women's Championship- Again an obvious outcome. For some reason the WWE feels the need to make a point of saying that woman in the WWE can beat Jazz one-on-one yet alone in a Fatal Four-Way. 5 out of 10 stars.
The Big Show vs Brock Lesnar in a Stretcher Match for the WWE Championship- ""A match that hasn't been held in over 20 years"" and it's obvious why in this match. Instead of being a match so brutal that one man is wheeled out on a stretcher, this match just gives the wrestlers a different weapon. It might be kind of fitting that the last Stretcher Match has Andre the Giant in it and this one has The Big Show in it, but even that irony can not save this match from being a stinker. How many times are we going to have to sit through these two? 6 out of 10 stars.
As with most WWE dvds there is a nice list of extras. Match Promos and Pre and Post Match interviews. Also two extra matches. One being from Sunday Night Heat-The Hurricane vs Steven Richards and the second being the original stretcher match with Andre the Giant and Killer Kahn. A lackluster ppv, but a solid dvd.",1066176000,,4248,4.385297845373891
1891447,4,B00009W0U8,"This was a decent event. I was very impressed with the matches. I won't go into each one, as there are plenty of people doing that here. What I will say is the stretcher match for the WWE title is worth it. Brock Lesnar and The Big Show put on a much better match than I thought, the ending is great!
I also enjoyed all the extras from Sunday Night Heat and the post match interviews. I do have one complaint. While I totally enjoy the WWE for putting old matches out as extras on their new DVD's I was very disapointed with the one that they chose. While I do appreciate the old school wrestling, When I saw Andre the Giant vs. Killer Kahn in the first stretcher match they ever did, I thought I was going to be in for a blood bath. Not at all this match is only 9 minutes long and it is B-O-R-I-N-G. It makes me love what Brock and Show did all the more.
On a side note I wish Vince would release all the Saturday Night's Main Event's on DVD...that would be awesome.

Steve Austin comes out to start the show with a promo. Yes, so for everybody paying money to see wrestling, you'll be deeply disappointed throughout the night as Austin/Bischoff have many other 'HILARIOUS' encounters.
John Cena, Chuck Palumbo & Johnny Stamboli vs. Chris Benoit, Rhyno & Spanky
This was the first PPV match for Spanky, a fine young rookie in the WWE who has had a lot of good matches in the Indys against other big named Indy guys. The WWE has since misused him horribly. This match didn't even hit the four minute mark folks, but I guess that was to make room for the hilarious Austin/Bischoff segments. 1/2*

1891462,2,B00009W0U8,"Many people review PPVs and review them on matches they want to see e.g. Rock vs. Goldberg from Backlash 2003 but these people are called marks, people who judge wrestling on characters and storyline whether people who jusdge primarily on wrestling skill, charisma and promo waork are called smarks, smart marks. Here's a review from that ponit of view:
1. Chuck and Johnny Stamboli(The FBI) and John Cena vs. Chris Benoit, Edge and Spanky. This was a last minute match where various styles are mixed. The F.B.I. aern't very talented but John Cena is a good worker and can cut great promos, on the other side Chris Benoit, a very technical wrestler can't really cut promos but is very technical due to his training in the Hart's Dungeon, on his side in an ironic twist of fate is Spanky, aminly speedy wrestler trained in Shawn Michaels school, and Rhyno very talented old ECW wrestler, but his skills have downed since then.
2. La Resistance vs. Test and Scott Steiner, the first La Resistance PPV match and the only reason they were in this is to premiere a PPV win and to gain heel heat(crowd boo's). They are both great technical wrestlers but don't particularly stand out while cutting promos, still quite good. Steiner was jammed with Test after his drop from upper-card level from a blunt squash from Triple H and if it weren't for this feud Test would be on Heat.
Now that I've explained the lower/mid-card matches in depth I'll just use one-liners.
3. Team Angle vs. Eddie Gurrero and Tajiri - Best match of the night, good techincal from Team Angle and Eddie combined with good speediness from Eddie and Tajiri. Two thumbs way UP!
4. Intercontenial Championship Battle Royale - After Triple H squashed Booker T TWICE, Booker T aslo went to mid-carder hell with this Battle Royale and the IC title only created for him to have something to do. Kane's getting stale and Chrisitan's getting a good push. ...P>5. Sable vs. Torrie(Bikini) - Good EYE CANDY but nothing more. TWO THUMBS WAY UP!
6. Rowdy Roddy Piper vs. Hogan America - Old wrestlers don't work. Sleeper vs. Leg Drop. Ugghh!
7. Trips vs. Nash - It's Steiner vs. Triple H all over again!!! Arrrrgggghhhh!!!!
8. Women's matches have been getting better lately and just wait until Lita returns and Gail Kim(a luchador woman) premieres. Finally some credibility in the division!
9. Big Show vs. Brock 23 - Not again! At least one good wrestler was here, Rey Mysterio!!! Brock's very technical and Big Show's... well slow. But some big things happen so hey...",1056844800,,2523,4.7494305239179955

While this PPV has some of those guys, the show as a whole is lackluster and the two main events of Kevin Nash vs. HHH and The Giant (I know what his WWF name is. I boycott it!) vs. Brock Lesnar are quite boring, even with the Lesnar match adding some extra & unusual hardware to the fray.

If you're on a budget and are looking at older PPV's on DVD, then my recommendation is to save your money and go for a better one amongst the many other possible ones available.",1413417600,,643,4.103174603174603

Even with the roster getting split up, at least the under-appreciated talents would get more time and opportunities than they did here. Guys like Chris Benoit, John Cena, Christian and Chris Jericho seemed like less than afterthoughts on this show!

The bulk of the event centered around a lot of ""special attractions"" like a bikini contest, a gimmicky match between Roddy Piper and Mr. America, and a Battle Royal for the recently resurrected Intercontinental Title. None of these matches were particularly good or made use of the time they were given.

The main events included a very short, listless brawl between Kevin Nash and Triple H for the World Title. The match is only noteworthy for the aftermath antics with H getting a Jackknife through the announce table. The other half was a very good Stretcher Match with Brock Lesnar finally ending his feud with the Big Show once and for all.

The other good match was a strong, if not excellent ladder match for the WWE Tag Team Titles between the World's Greatest Tag Team and Eddie Guerrero and Tajiri (subbing for an injured Chavo). It's a good match, but lacks the cohesive energy and chaos of the very best ladder matches.

Unfortunately, there's way more to dislike here than to enjoy; by my count, there are a total of two good matches and everything else isn't just mediocre... It's really bad. Not worth the time.",1410220800,,1607,4.6879432624113475

What a huge step down for Benoit. After being in Judgment Day classics with Jericho and Angle to being in the opening match with Spanky. Anyways, a quick opening match that ends with Palumbo getting the pin on Spanky following the Kiss of Death from Palumbo and Stamboli.

A decently good Tag Team match from both teams. This was Dupree and Grenier's PPV debut and they were certainly impressive in their first PPV match. La Resistance get the win after their Bonsoir double team move on Steiner. After the match, Stacy checks on Steiner but Test yanks her away from him, which would begin the Summer love triangle story between the 3

3.) WWE Tag Team Championship Ladder Match: Team Angle vs Eddie Guerrero and Tajiri

This was a real treat, considering it had been quite awhile since we had seen a Tag Team championship Ladder Match on PPV. This match gets pretty violent at times and is overall just exhilarating. Eddie retrieves the titles in the end in what was no doubt a classic and forgotten gem.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) WWE Intercontinental Championship Battle Royal: Val Venis vs Chris Jericho vs Goldust vs Lance Storm vs Rob Van Dam vs Christian vs Test vs Kane vs Booker T

After the Intercontinental Championship had gone vacant many months prior, it was back up for grabs in this highly entertaining over the top rope battle royal. Everyone excluding Booker T was a former Intercontinental Champion, so it featured some of WWE's best Intercontinental Champions throwing down. Pat Patterson even sat ringside for the match. Booker T originally won the match but the referee had been knocked out, so it allowed Christian to sneak back in the ring (ala Stone Cold 1997 Royal Rumble), attack Booker with the title, and throw him out of the ring to win the match and the championship. Great match with a nice swerve at the end

5.) Bikini Contest: Torrie Wilson vs Sable

If you ask me, this was probably one of the biggest reasons fans ordered this PPV. Sable had recently returned to the company after a near 4 year hiatus and got involved in a feud with Torrie Wilson over on Smackdown about who was the better Playboy Cover girl. I honestly didn't understand why guys were so head over heels for Sable when she came back in 2003. She had a horrendous plastic surgery and she looked....well....not as pretty as she did in the 90s to put it nicely. If you just look at this you'll see for yourself. Anyways, both divas strut their stuff and the winner would be determined with the most fan cheers. Sable gets the most cheers but Torrie strips off an extra layer that was much more revealing and Torrie wins the Bikini Contest. Following the contest, Torrie plants a kiss on Sable to ensure there were ""no hard feelings""

6.) Rowdy Roddy Piper vs Mr. America

I remember this feud back in 2003. And even then and even now, this is one of the stupidest storylines in WWE history. Hulk Hogan playing his alter ego, Mr. America and Piper and McMahon trying to prove that Mr. America was Hulk Hogan. Mr. America said he wasn't Hogan, despite him using Hogan's theme and Hogan's moves. It was just a mess. Then Zach Gowen made his debut and got involved and then this horrible match happened. Everything about this storyline was just bad. This match was even worse. Hogan..er...umm...Mr. America puts us out of our misery with a leg drop on Piper close to the 5 minute mark for the win. Why were Hogan and Piper fighting in a match at this event anyway?? This was 2003, not 1985. Both Hogan and Piper were past their prime and out of shape. Horrible horrible horrible.

7.) World Heavyweight Championship Match: Kevin Nash w/Shawn Michaels vs Triple H (c) w/Ric Flair

Basic match that's not all that great to watch. Pretty much one-sided with Nash dominating Triple H the entire match throughout until Triple H gets DQ's hitting Earl Hebner in the heart with his sledgehammer. Triple H gets beaten some more and eventually Jackknifed through the announcer's table by Nash. It seemed that fans weren't very invested in Nash in 2003 like they were back in the 90s. But then again, he hadn't exactly been in the internet's good graces since WCW so it was understandable why he wasn't necessarily liked by many fans

A segment where Bischoff throws up out of the skybox and onto some fans below. Throughout the night there were some pointless but semi-comical segments with Bischoff and Austin where Austin forced Bischoff to overeat and overdrink, leading him to throw up everything he had consumed

8.) Women's Championship Fatal 4 Way Match: Trish Stratus vs Jacqueline vs Victoria vs Jazz (c)

Short but sweet women's match. The Women's Division on Raw was shaping up to be pretty impressive around this time. Jazz was rising as probably WWE's top diva heel while Trish was WWE's top babyface diva while Lita was out with her neck injury. Jazz retains the title with a DDT on Jacqueline

9.) WWE Championship Stretcher Match: Big Show vs Brock Lesnar (c)

This was the final match of the Brock Lesnar vs Big Show PPV trilogy and what a match it was. This was without a doubt their best match, compared to their Survivor Series and Royal Rumble battles. The storyline was intriguing as Big Show was wrecking havoc over on Smackdown and injuring superstars and putting them on stretchers. With Brock Lesnar being the only one big enough to stop him, their final one-on-one PPV score was settled in this awesome Stretcher Match.  In addition to the Bikini Contest, this was another must-see fans probably ordered for. Near the end, Lesnar drives a forklift to the ring and the fans go wild. In what was probably the moment of the night, Lesnar dives off the forklift into Big Show. Follow it up with a suplex and an F5, Lesnar rolls Show on the stretcher, positioned on the forklift, and drives the forklift/stretcher over the line to retain the title. No doubt, the match of the night and probably Lesnar and Show's greatest match against each other.

Overall: A pretty poor Judgment Day if you ask me. The Tag Team Ladder Match, the Battle Royal, Bikini Contest, and main event are the only reasons to really watch this PPV. Everything else just sucked and was boring or didn't deliver enough. This would be the last Judgment Day PPV to be co-hosted by Raw and Smackdown as it would become exclusive to the Smackdown brand the following year",1400889600,,7589,5.477292202227935

Great performances all around with some ""tounge n' cheek"" humor along the way.  Stacy Keibler and Sable are in this video and they are smoking hot!",1388361600,,301,4.555555555555555
7993308,5,B00009W0U8,"1. Chris Benoit, Rhyno, Spanky vs. The FBI & John Cena: I Felt this a pretty good opener for Judgment Day. The match was short but still a good opener. The ending wasen't so good thou
2. Scott Steiner & Test vs. La Resistance: This match sould have been saved for raw. I didn't like this match. The story backround was the only thing that made this match a little better. So this match was not an add on to the ppv.
3. Team Angle vs. Eddie Guerrero & Tajiri Ladder match for WWE tag team titles: This was one of my favorites of Judgment Day. Lots of great action many weapon shots. There where some spots that looked so painful for them.
4. Battle Royal for I.C title: I love battle royals but this one not so much. There were only 8 superstars in the match, but the match was still good and the outcome is a little different from what you would expect.
5. Bikini Challenge Torrie Wilson vs. Sable: I really loved this match. Even thou there was no wrestling involved but it was really hot and Tazz the announcer made very more enjoyable to watch (not like it already was) but the ending was something you don't see often in WWE. It even put Tazz down to 1 Knee.
6. Mr. America vs. Roddy Piper: This match was only good because their were to legends going at it. Even thou one was not in top shape at all (Roddy Piper). THe match it self wasen't that good, but its always good to see to legends going at it.
7. HHH vs. Kevin Nash For World Heavyweight title: This match was good it could have been better but the ending was great for the story line. The ending of the match it self was bad.
8. Trish Stratus vs. Jacqueline vs. Victoria vs. Jazz For Women's title: this was an enjoyable divas match. Im not saying it was the match of the night but, 4 great divas from that time in the ring at the same time made the match good.
9. Brock Lesnar vs. Big Show Stretcher Match WWE title: This was my favorite match of the night maybe even the best of 2003 but that's just my opinion. The ending was great and my have been a little insulting to the Big Show but still very fuuny.

Overall: I loved this ppv I would recommend getting it. This dvd had some ""Bad Ass Matches"" Said by Stone Cold at the beginning of the whole ppv. Its sometimes hard to find good ppvs with multi special matches now at days. But like I said that's my opinion. So this is worth the money even if your not a big dvd buyer I would still recommend this to any wrestling fan. Lastly this dvd includes a bunch of extras on it. Please give me some feedback whether you like my review or not.",1371513600,,2557,4.155241935483871

Cena and the FBI defeats Rhyno, Spanky, and Benoit.
 4 minutes?? talk about rushing a match here, I understand you open up with something fast pace to get the crowd involved... But it only gets a lousy four minutes!? Rhyno didn't even get into the match.  Since the four minutes we got were decent, I'll give it the same number grade, should have at least gotten three more minutes. Match Rating: 4.5/10

La Resistance defeats Team roids (Steiner and Test)
 This was La Resistance debut and Steiner and Test were about to break up.. so the outcome was a no brainer here.  I wasn't expecting anything , but what we got was an decent average match.  Nothing special though. Match Rating: 5/10

Tajiri and Eddie defeats Bacardi and Cola (Charlie and Shelton) in a ladder match for the Tag Team Titles.
 A pretty good ladder match here.. Both teams tried some news spots, and did some of the normal spots you see in a ladder match.  While not all the spots went smoothly, it was still a good effort and easily the match of the night. Match Rating: 7.5/10

Mr. America (Hulk Hogan) defeats Rowdy Piper in a No Holds Used match.
 Tonight, watch as Hogan and Piper get it on and the crap hits the fan... literally.  This was one ugly match folks. Mr. America wins, and poses while I hurt my check muscles yawning too much.  Maybe if the botched a spot, they would have accidently preformed a good move? Match Rating: 3/10

Tori Defeats Sable in a bikini match.
Hey weren't these two in playboy.. naked? Don't get me wrong they looked very nice in thier attire... But it's a waste of time since like I said before... we have seen them NAKED ALREADY! Segment Rating: 3/10 (Just because they looked nice)

Christian wins IC Belt in a ten man battle Royal.
 6 people were eliminated the first 3-5 minutes in this match... and since it was all the former ic champions in this match.. WHY WAS BOOKER T IN HERE since he never won it before?  Should have been a tag match or fatal four way since the match got better with the last remaining four... until the ridiculous ending.  Bad overbooking at its best. Match Rating 5/10

Kevin Nash Defeats Triple H via DQ in Worl Title match.
 Boring boring boring.  I could have used about a keg of beer for this lousy 7 minute snooze fest.  The aftermath didn't help much either for me as I was already pissed for purchasing this waste of a dvd.  Nash almlost broke triple H's Neck with a sloppy looking Jack Knife Power Bomb through the table.. Just horrible. Match Rating: 4/10.

Jazz defeats Trish, Victoria, and Jaquilin for the Womens title.
 This was actually a pretty good fast paced womens match here...  But at this point the womens division needed more then ""pretty good"". This was really hectic in pace as time restraints were against them.  Nothing too horrible. Match Rating: 6/10

Lesnar defeats Big Show in a stretcher match for the WWE Title.
 Here was the surprise of the night as these two finally put on a better then average match.  The ending saw Mysterio get involved and then Lesnar getting a fork lift and jumping off of it on to the Big Show.  Then puts show on the stretcher, then the stretcher on the Fork Lift and drives show over the finish line to retain his title.  A very good way to end a miserable show. Match Rating: 7/10

So Basically Judgement Day for me Barely reaches a D grade almost getting an F in my book.  This was just a bad ppv. Don't waste your money... infact, make amazon pay you to watch this.",1285200000,,3497,4.462145110410095

The Eddie Guerrero/Tajiri-Team Angle-WWE tag team championship Ladder match was a high-flying,hard-hitting,entertaining,back-and-forth showstealer. The rest were ok.
