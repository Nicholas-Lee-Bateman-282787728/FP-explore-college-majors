8184263,4,B000OCT712,"The film unofficially follows a sequence to THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU.  Boxer Eric ""Kid"" Carson (John Patrick Jordan) along with two female tabloid reporters are looking for his missing brother Roy. The trail takes them to an abandoned sanitarium where they are taken captive by strange experimental creatures who also keep their doctor (Jacob Witkin) captive.

The film is cheesy. It takes place in the early fifties or so and was done gumshoe style with interesting backdrop lighting. Plot wasn't that great. Not a film for everyone.
