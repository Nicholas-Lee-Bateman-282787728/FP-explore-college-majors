7882834,3,6305104662,"A little grainy, a little old school, but the story and plot are a little boring and tend to drag on at times. Still worth a watch for any fan of old school/dubbed over Chinese Kung-fu movies.",1397260800,,192,4.216216216216216
7882835,4,6305104662,It was what expected! Old movie but the picture came out really well. Not to grainy. Glad I made the purchase,1370044800,,109,4.238095238095238
7882836,1,6305104662,Don't be fooled!!!...this is NOT the Japanese Live Super Robot film Supa Robot Maha Baron...in fact it has NOTHING to do with SUPER ROBOTS at all!!!!! This is merely ANOTHER one of XENON's old school low buget kung fu flicks under the WU TANG label...Sheesh I wish AMAZON would get around to having some sort of DESCRIPTION info for obscure releases such as this... I almost ordered the damn thing based on the other guy's review!!!!!!!!!,1065484800,13,438,4.776315789473684
7882837,3,6305104662,"Mediocre, passable, forgettable plot with tho twists, largely forgettable characters make for a little better than average film.  Includes an  extended lion dance segment which always lessens my interest.  Includes a  tedious almost belabored segment in which a team of heroes does battle with  the Golden Formation, a battalion of hundred fighters with shields who  perform a series of group formations while battling the heroes.  The action  picks up gradually.  The climactic fights are pretty good, but not enough  to make this a must see.",967334400,,543,5.2823529411764705
7882838,3,6305104662,"An alright film, some suspect villians, and not alot in common with what  the back of the box would make you expect.  Even thought the movie seems to  be an average picture, it does display some cool styles, like the shaolin  finger strike (iron finger). and a good climactic battle at the end. Not a  must see, but a could see.  won't be too angry with what you got:)",965692800,,368,4.260869565217392
