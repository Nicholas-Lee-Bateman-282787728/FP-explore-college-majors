7866840,2,6304233825,"This movie is terrible. Bad writing, bad effects, bad acting, just bad. If you are a particular fan of one of the cast, though, you might still find it amusing. I love John Piper-Ferguson, and very much enjoyed his over-the-top villain, although he couldn't pick an accent to save his life. He and his giant, lame minion made this movie worth watching once...maybe twice. Now it mostly just lives on the shelf in shame.",1361232000,2,419,4.675675675675675
7866841,5,6304233825,"but still interesting movie - John Pyper-Ferguson , Billy Wirth and Cady Huffman show us a good work. Space pirates,  seizure hostages, release of them - all that needed for the good evening with TV.",1315699200,,199,4.685714285714286
