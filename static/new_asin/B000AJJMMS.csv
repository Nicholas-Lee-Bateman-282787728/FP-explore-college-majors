Back to the DVD on this page, it is the Nativity story, plus two other stories. The three stories by animator Will Vinton are very well done and I highly recommend it. The first title in the set is ""The First Christmas"", it received the Andrew Carnegie Medal for ""Excellence in Children's Video""; and the Crown Award for ""Best Children's Video"". It is made in stop-motion animation, and is very beautiful. I was stunned at the level of detail they uses, and the range of expression and emotion in the characters. They really come alive. A sensitive portrayal of the nativity story, that is worth repeat viewing.
Narration of the show is by Christopher Plummer. It is the Nativity story from the Bible, about the birth of Jesus in the manger at Bethlehem. It includes the innkeeper and his wife, 3 wise men, shepherds. 23 minutes in length.
The next story is based on a lesser known Charles Dickens tale, ""The Chimes"". It is a very touching story about a man that sees so much sadness around him that he feels he has no business being born. But the church bells speak to him in a dream about hope. Also has excellent stop-motion animation, characters, voices, and incredible sets. 23 minutes long.
Last is ""The Christmas Gift"", based on the song ""Christmas Dinner"". Only 9 minutes, but it packs a punch, very touching. All in all, the stories on this DVD are inspiring and well worth viewing. I highly recommend to animation fans, and lovers of quality Christmas specials.",1263427200,14,1660,4.6689419795221845
