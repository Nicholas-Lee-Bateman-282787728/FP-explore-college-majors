6777414,4,B00OZJ2Y38,"""Nightcrawler"" (2014 release; 118 min.) brings the story of Lou Bloom (played by Jake Gyllenhaal). As the movie opens, we see Lou involved in petty crimes, trying to make a buck and simply surviving. Then one night he sees a car crash scene on the 101 in LA, he pulls over and notices a guy shooting footage. Turns out to be a freelance camera man (played by Bill Paxton), who cruises the LA streets and freeways at night (hence ""nightcrawler"") and sells the footage to local TV stations for their 6 am morning newscast. Something clicks within Lou, and before we know it, he is also chasing the next bloody scene, the bloodier, the better. Lou finds a willing buyer for his footage in Nina (played by Rene Russo), the news director at the lowest rated morning news station in LA. Nina encourages Lou to find yet more extreme footage. At this point we're maybe 20 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the feature length debut from director Dan Gilroy (Mr. Rene Russo in the real world), who also wrote the script. Gilroy tackles a number of topics, including the never-ending thirst of TV news for ever bigger ratings, and what people will do within that system to get it (hint: almost anything). I couldn't help but think of the 1976 movie ""Network"" in certain points of ""Nightcrawler"". Second, Gyllenhaal plays the role of loner Lou Bloom with a ferocity and intensity (seemingly at times with bugged eyes) that will blow you away. Gilroy sets up Gyllenhaal's character such that you go back and forth wanting to root for him, yet being shocked/repulsed at the character's coldness and aloofness at the same time. In that sense Gyllenhaal's character reminds me of the Robert de Niro character in ""Taxi Driver"". Third, I hadn't seen Rene Russo in a movie in a long time. She brings the role of Nina brilliantly. In one of the key moments of the movie, Nina 'coaches' the morning news anchors what to say about shocking footage that they are airing, through the ear pieces of the news anchors. Just brilliant. Last but not least, the movie is shot beautifully (mostly LA at night) by photographer Robert Elswit. Bottom line: ""Nightcrawler"" is a bit of an anomaly as it is not a crime thriller, nor is it a TV news drama, not is it just a character study, although it contains elements of all those. I ended up enjoying this far more than I had expected.

I saw ""Nightcrawler"" on the Thursday night when it opened all across the country (yes, Thursday night is the new Friday), and this particular screening was nicely attended. The movie grossed over $10 million in its opening weekend, a very good result for this off-center Hollywood release. If you have a chance to check it out, be it in the theaters or on DVD/Blu-ray, don't hesitate. ""Nightcrawler"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1416960000,36,2915,4.658252427184466
6777415,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"Ive said it before and Ill say it again, Jake Gyllenhaal is one of the most talented and reliable actors alive today. Hes blown me away in more movies than I can name (some of my favorites being Donnie Darko, Prisoners, and Enemy) and his latest role as the sleazy crime reporter Lou Bloom even further proves his genius. He manages to up his first-class standard of acting and single-handedly carry this thrill ride of a film. Nightcrawler is one of those movies that comes out of nowhere and astonishes you, proving that Hollywood can still widely release great films. Its a game-changer, and an entertaining one at that.

The film centers around Bloom, a driven young guy living in Los Angeles that never quite operates on everyones level. Desperate for work and looking for something to occupy his time, he comes across the fast paced world of crime journalism. Quickly forcing his way into the business and filming anything the news stations will buy, he begins to tow the line between observer and participant, all for his own favor. The more dangerous it is to capture, the more money he receives. And as you can expect, things get out of hand (much to the pleasure of the audience).

It moves at an insanely rapid pace from one incident to the next and is one of the most captivating films Ive seen in a long time. I never stopped to check the time once, which certainly says something, and was mesmerized by the mannerisms and dialogue coming from this peculiar character. Everything about this movie enchanted me: the darkly comic moments, dedicated performances, and dynamite writing. Add all that up and you have one of my favorite films of the year. See it, you will thank me.",1416873600,7,1689,4.683501683501683
6777416,4,B00OZJ2Y38,"Nightcrawler was an odd movie. I found it strange, yet strangely intriguing as well. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Lou Bloom, a bit of an odd duck who is trying to get a job. He's a bit of a loner and, while driving home one night, sees a wreck at the side of the road. A women is trapped inside a burning car while two police officers try to pull her from the vehicle before it explodes. Lou, for whatever reason, pulls over and gets out and just stands gawking at the scene. He doesn't offer to help and doesn't say anything to the police officers - just gawks and grins. (Like I said, he's a bit of an odd duck..) All of a sudden, a camera van pulls up onto the scene and two men jump out to film the rescue and wreckage. Jake seems in awe of them and asks one of the cameramen, Joe Loder (Bill Paxton), if he's hiring. Once Joe turns him down, Lou buys his own camcorder and police scanner, hires an ""assistant"", and starts shooting accidents himself. He begins to hone his skills while regularly selling videos to Nina (Rene Russo), a graveyard shift news director.

The movie does a great job of exploring the underground world of the ""nightcrawler"", as these freelance cameramen are called. It was a nitty gritty film, but also pretty comedic. Jake Gyllenhaal did an amazing job in his role. I empathized with his character because he just seemed so alone and was trying so hard at times, yet he was just so weird and off the mark. At times he was a jerk and creepy, while other times he seemed overeager and simply lacking in social skills.

It's hard to describe what's so odd about this movie, other than Lou himself. Again, even though I found the movie a bit weird at times, I also thought it was fast-paced and really entertaining. It pulled me in, and even a week later, I'm still thinking about the movie.",1416873600,130,1812,4.3579881656804735
6777417,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"In Dan Gilroys new thriller, NIGHTCRAWLER, Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) plays an oddball who is desperate for work and a chance to make something of himself.  When we meet him, Lou is a low-level thief, ripping off chain fences and manhole covers to sell for scrap metal.  One night he accidentally stumbles into the world of stringers or crime journalists.  He decides to give himself a shot at this lucrative business, so he uses his larcenous skills to finance some basic equipment.  Aided by his amazing chutzpah and stop-at-nothing attitude, he teaches himself to chase police calls for a chance to sell video footage to the highest bidding local news program.

He soon falls in with Nina (Rene Russo), a station manager teetering on the edge of failure as she tries to prop up the ratings of the lowest rated morning news show in Los Angeles.  After a few successful nights, Lou hires the practically homeless loser Rick (Ris Ahmed) as an apprentice assistant.  Armed with Rick, a video camera and a police scanner, Lou sets out to get exclusive bloody footage and beat the competition in this fast-paced and highly-competitive profession.

We get the impression that Lou is possibly psychotic from the very beginning; he talks fast, seems to know a little bit about virtually everything, and is clearly insecure and neurotic.  All in all, Jake Gyllenhaal turns in a performance that is as unsavory as it is creepy, smiling a knowing smile while hardly ever blinking throughout the film.  Eventually we begin to wonder how far he will go to get some good footage, as he nightly pushes the envelope and steers himself and his apprentice into awkward, dangerous situations.

Rene Russo is convincing as the ruthless station manager and Ris Ahmed is perfect as the wide-eyed Rick.  But it is Jake Gyllenhaals nuanced, thrilling performance that drives the film, together with high-speed chases, bloody shootouts and a piece of sabotage or two.  I was very much entertained by the unique plot and mesmerized by Mr. Gyllenhaal, who reportedly lost several pounds to perfect the gaunt look proffered by his sociopathic character.  The end result is creepy and disturbing.

Definitely recommended.",1416873600,4,2195,5.008264462809917
6777418,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is introduced to us as a theft, a con artist, and a fast talker. He has spent his time in front of a computer digesting information. He knows all the buzz words and phrases and uses them to manipulate people. He has become a bit of a sociopath due to his lack of interfacing with humans, but does not desire to be one, seeking a normal life.

One night Louis accidentally discovers his calling...filming crime and selling it to the news. Louis takes chances while making his film, wanting to create something no one else has. As the film progresses so does Louis as he become more daring, crossing the line for a news shot. The man has done his homework.

This is an interesting film in that Louis represents our future, for better or worse, a race of humans with social skills learned from a machine. The film slowly increases in intensity and takes you to a point of feeling uncomfortable. This is not a film for everyone, but one for those who like things a little dark.

6777419,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"Very unique movie, enjoyed every minute. I heard about it a while back, but never got around to watching it (partially because of negative reviews). I would say this movie is probably not for everyone, but if you're into dark, gritty movies that give you an interesting perspective then it's definitely worth the watch.",1529107200,,319,4.925925925925926
6777420,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"Noir thriller elevated by its themes of pointed social commentary. Jake Gyllenhaal's character, a representation of the most inhuman side of capitalism, is a sociopath driven by ambition. He lives a spartan existence in a cheap apartment and has no personal or family ties. From a life of petty crime, he bootstraps his way to a career in the amoral world of sensationalist TV journalism; he gets ahead by abusing every relationship he develops and through brutal, single-minded force of will. What's truly disturbing is the way the film permits us to relate to the protagonist and maybe even celebrate his success. Gyllenhaal's chilling performance captivates and carries the story. Highly recommend.",1528934400,,701,5.267857142857143
6777421,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"One of the best films of recent years.  Jake gives an Oscar-worthy performance.  His appearance is properly seedy and creepy, even cadaverous at times.  He is the only current actor who could well play Norman Bates (Psycho).  The story is fascinating and has a truly tense climax that says everything about the main character.  The production quality is first-rate.  Love the red Challenger.  Don't miss this film.",1528329600,,414,5.08955223880597

Prove shows the even lowlife scumbags like Louis Bloom can make it as long as he has no heart or soul.  That proved out when he let his partner (employee) die knowing the suspect was still alive.  It is unfortunate that we have people like these scumbags roaming the streets at night, breaking laws to get the story and even the story is manipulated for ratings and not for actual truth!",1528156800,,532,4.29

6777442,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"This movie is suspenseful and unpredictable. I am not Gyllenhaal fan, but I have to admit he plays the maniacal role here very well.

There is a good amount of gunplay and even an exciting chase scene. There is a fair amount of gore, but most should not find it brutally repulsive.

 Bill Paxton has only a supporting role, but his presence gave the film a higher credibility level. Rene Russo is critical to the storyline and does a great job as a struggling news director for the lowest rated news station in the city.

Nightcrawler struck close to home for me as I used to work in a nightshift job in the streets of the city I was born in. Often, I was filming crime scenes, criminal interviews, and witness statements.

I can tell you that this movie, while very weird and offbeat, contains a lot of realism.  If you have ever worked overnight outdoors, you will know what I mean. The nighttime world is DIFFERENT, and this film does a superb job of capturing that weirdness in a realistic fashion.

Riz Ahmed is massively instrumental in making this script work. His role as the assistant to Gyllenhaal brings a sense of empathy and feel good vibes as he goes from a homeless guy to executive vice president of the firm. However, the sweetness eventually turns bitter as the two newshounds experience a clash of egos.

The cinematography is alive and compelling. The story is tight and progresses at a nice pace. I was never bored, rather, I found myself constantly thinking ""what next???""  I love a well-written, acted, and directed movie that is UNPREDICTABLE!",1518998400,3,1567,4.648550724637682

The plot was well managed  as even the most astute Alfred Hitchcock fan will be on his/her toes to predict this one. The blend of roles and  over all interaction of players  helped keep the action moving at a good pace. Again, it was the brief misuse of King's English that almost destroyed the enjoy-ability/thrill factor of the movie.

""Network"" from 1976 and ""Broadcast News"" from 1987 are examples that are still very relevant today. To me, ""Nightcrawler"" fits into this pantheon. It's slightly over-the-top operatic qualities remind me most of ""Network"". Though larger in scale, the characters played by Faye Dunaway and Robert Duvall in that film have similar ruthless approaches to their work as do the characters played by Rene Russo and Jake Gyllenhaal in this one. The storyline here is compact and focused on Jake's brilliant portrayal of Louis Bloom and his very personal step-by-bloody-step career chess moves. Riz Ahmed does a superb job playing Rick the trainee. The whole cast is natural and believable, yet there is always a very subtle undercurrent of humor running through.

The story was about a person making a living filming the worst moments of people's lives- even at the end he says that he likes to say ""if you're seeing me you're having the worst day of your life""  There are plenty of reporters who are on this level and we know of some that were no doubt real life inspirations that contributed to the writing of this movie script.  Jake G plays a VERY UNLIKABLE character and he plays it well, so if you are looking for a movie where you want to root for the main character, this is not that movie. But overall, this movie is good, I did enjoy watching it. I probably wouldn't watch it again but it is a movie that definitely worth watching.",1514764800,5,986,4.360655737704918

6777474,4,B00OZJ2Y38,"The website College Humor put it best when they took a poster for the film and imposed the word TMZ in place of the title. Do we consider the modern news mongrels this pervasive and sadistic? The media, a relatively small percentage of the population, has an incredible amount of influence over the modern culture. The ability to edit video footage is authentic power; one can easily alter the perception of any and everything. Its intentional that Jake Gyllenhaals character, through his specific age is never disclosed, is clearly over 30, making him a member of Generation X - yet he runs around Los Angeles behaving like someone of Generation Y. In todays society everyone has a camera strapped to them, hence its easy to image a cold audacious videographer shooting things he ought not. However to construct a plan sabotaging competition, let along getting rich, is something audiences wouldnt accept from a Generation Y protagonist. Nightcrawler might likely reach the status of a cult classic throughout the decade because it speaks so accurately about the 2010s.",1514419200,,1070,5.0508474576271185

6777506,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"If Drive is a movie about the birth of a superhero, Nightcrawler is a movie about the birth of a super villain. Jake G. (who pointedly describes this film as the rise of a Director of Photography ""DP"") delivers his best performance to date as Lou Bloom, an unhinged sociopath who finds his true calling as a stringer, contributing gruesome videos to a struggling news organization. In a business where you're only as good as your last captured tragedy, Bloom will do anything to be successful, even compromise the integrity of the crime scene. If you're a successful person and see a lot of yourself in Bloom, you might wanna rethink the way you be livin'.

If you're looking for a happy ending that makes you feel good about things, I might stay away from Nightcrawler. This is an unconventional film, but in my opinion it was the absolute best of 2014 -- a year that got overshadowed by Birdman and Whiplash. Also, a sleeper and under appreciated performance by Riz Ahmed that put him on the map, setting him up for later projects like The Night Of.

Nightcrawler is a pitch-perfect comedic thriller that gets my highest recommendation. Script by Dan Gilroy was also among the very best of the year. Really excellent stuff here.",1494892800,,1230,4.689814814814815

6777508,4,B00OZJ2Y38,"Nightcrawler is not about the typical night-time criminal seeking to take advantage of innocent people in the dark. It is about a self-taught sociopath (my evaluation) of a man who is doing so by taking films of event, usually crimes, that interest TV stations, who pay for the footage.
The main character in the film is broke. He steals and then sells what he steals to whoever is willing to buy the item. For example, he cuts fences down and then sells what he cuts. He is looking for a job or, if possible, a profession. Untaught is school, he uses the internet to learn about business. He is a good learner. Among other things, he learns the skill of getting ahead and of negotiating, which he uses to his benefit.
He happens to see a camera man filming an event and overhears that that the man is paid hundreds of dollars for the film. He decides to do the same. Being unscrupulous and ignoring the dictates of morality and the instructions of police to stay back, he is soon able to film events that gain him hundreds of dollars.
He hires a man to help him and cheats the man he hired, and treats him worse.
Soon he steps beyond where he was previously and begins to stage the events he wants to film. He moves a body to get a better picture. He enters a house of multiple murders before the police arrive so that he can film what others would not be allowed to see. He arranges an event that will result in people being killed so that he can sell an unusual film and gain thousands.

Gyllenhaal gives an amazing performance as a lowly working class man driven to make something of himself: he lost weight for this role and comes across with an electric inner energy.  It's nice to see Renee Russo in a great role as the television news production head -- but most of all to see how the public's voracious appetite for violence drives the media to sensationalize events.  It probably goes back to the Stone Age, when young warriors acted out their stories of prowess and animal kills around the camp fire.

6777555,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"Dark, weird and intriguing movie. One of those movies you are not sure why you liked it. It definitely got me hooked and engaged until the end.

Lou (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a very complex character. He is a sociopath: lonely, awkward, weird interpersonal skills, cold blooded. He is very determined, a quick-learner and self-taught type of guy. He seems self-confident too, but his awkwardness just makes his actions and interactions a little bizarre.

One day he came across an accident and witnessed a camera guy documenting the images which later were shown in the news. He seemed fascinated by the whole thing and decided to start doing the same. He first tried to ask for a job, but after being denied he decided to start his own business. He managed to buy a camera, radio equipment, hire a ""helper"", contact the tv news, stat selling images... Slowly but surely (and weirdly) he succeeds.

Jake Gyllenhaal embodied the character perfectly and his performance is impressive. His outstanding acting added to the exposure of a dark side behind a sensationalist and tendentious press make this movie interesting and intriguing. Must watch.",1476057600,,1139,5.015873015873016

I wanted to like the main character, but I could not.  I felt sympathy for him in the beginning, but it diminished as the film continued.  With the changes to his status, came changes in his character that were very negative.  One thing is sure.  Jake Gyllenhaal portrays a man who is Ambitious, Motivated and Driven.

6777612,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"NIGHTCRAWLER is a color movie from 2014, starring Jake Gyllenhaal (born 1980), Riz Ahmed (born 1982), and Rene Russo (born 1954). Jake plays a ""stringer,"" that is, a person who's occupation is that of a freelance photographer who takes video movies of crime scenes and traffic accidents, and then sells the video movies to television stations.  Riz Ahmed plays a homeless Latino who answers a newspaper ad placed by Jake, and then is told that the job is to assist Jake in his attempts to videotape crimes and accidents.  At first, Jake tells Riz that Riz will be an unpaid intern.  But by the end of the job interview, Riz has succeeded in convincing Jake to give him a $30 per day salary.  Rene Russo plays a manager at a television station, and her job is to screen and purchase video footage offered for sale by stringers.  I mention the ages, because it is customary for supervisors to be older than trainees, and Jake is the supervisor while Riz is the trainee.  Riz Ahmed does an excellent job at speaking in a way typical of an uneducated lower class persons born in America.

Jake's earlier job was to be a metal thief.  In other words, he frequented industrial sites, stole copper wire, sections of chain link fences, and stole manhole covers, and sold them to legitimate manufacturing companies in need of scrap metal.  As any viewer of NIGHTCRAWLER will understand, the skills needed for the thief job overlap the skills needed to be a good stringer.  These skills include excellent timing, awareness of police activities, the ability to work independently, and the ability to negotiate prices with legitimate businesses.

MOVIE FOR PHOTOGRAPHERS.  I want to get right to the point why I loved this movie.  NIGHTCRAWLER struck a chord with me because my own hobby is photography.  In portraits, I've arranged props such as a blowing fan (to blow hair), instructing subjects to assume various poses (children making aviator glasses with their hands), and even rearranging the position of a dead animal.  In the year 1987, I saw a dead deer with decaying flesh resting in the shallow waters of a lake in South Carolina.  I pulled on one of the deer's legs, in order to make the dead animal look more graceful, that is, like a leaping deer.  In landscape photos, I've pulled out weeds, smoothened lumpy gravel in stream beds, demolished bushes and cacti, and rearranged boulders.

Okay, Jake's character does the same thing.  At a crime scene inside the house of a family, Jake rearranges the magnets on a refrigerator in order to make a more coherent video image.  Each magnet has a photo of a family member.  (Other parts of the same house have three murdered family members.)  At a traffic accident scene, Jake pulls a dead man's body a few feet, in order to make a more coherent image for his video movie.  Aside from amateur photographers (like myself) and real photographers, these features of NIGHTCRAWLER might appear inconsequential.  But to me, these actions of Jake's character made me love the movie.

NOT A MINDLESS THRILLER.  At first, I thought that NIGHTCRAWLER was going to be a mindless thriller, with plenty of shooting, knife action, gang warfare, and breakneck automobile chases through the vast industrial wastelands of LA.  But NIGHTCRAWLER is not like that at all.  Basically, NIGHTCRAWLER is about career change and career development.  In short, this movie will be an inspiration to all persons interested in a career change or in career development, whether in marketing, architecture, polymer chemistry, or electronics.  The movie shows Jake's step-by-step career development.  First, he is successful in selling his first traffic accident video to a TV station.  Second, a TV station employee recommends that he buy a better quality video camera (thus, viewers of this movie will understand that Jake's career move is being validated).  Third, viewers of this movie will find enjoyment in Jake's ability to negotiate greater fees.  Fourth, viewers of the movie will also be pleased in Jake's ability to enter the crime scene (and take videos) and then leave, all before the police arrive at the crime scene.  And fifth, viewers will enjoy Jake's ability to teach his assistant (played by Riz Ahmed) how to serve as a navigator and as the operator of a second video camera. Also, what I loved, is Jake's video camera technique of slowly moving the camera in a semicircle, that is, in panning the crime scene.  (Most Americans who use video cameras are totally clueless as to even the most primitive of cinematography techniques.)  Again, I liked this movie because of its emphasis on photography.

RIZ AHMED.  Although Mr. Riz Ahmed plays a non-educated young man of the lowest of social classes, who speaks with bad grammar, please note that Mr. Ahmed has an undergrad degree in ""Philosophy, Politics, and Economics"" from Oxford University.  Also, he is appearing in the up-and-coming Star Wars movie, ROGUE ONE and also in one of the BOURNE series movies.",1460246400,2,4994,4.912887828162291

6777626,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"This movie really pegs the cheesy metropolitan news biz. But beyond that, it's a very dark, offbeat film noir jewel. Gyllenhaal gives a ghoulishly bizarre performance as a sociopathic, bottom-feeding camera jockey. Rene Russo is appropriately cynical as an expedient news director. Bill Paxton is perfect as an over-caffeinated rival stringer. Very well-made, beautifully directed, with gorgeous, difficult camerawork & lighting, mostly shot at night, with no tacky digital FX. Savvy, ironic script. Vividly suspenseful score by John Newton Howard. This flick has it all. Highly recommended.

I worked as an EFP camera op for 14 years, part of which as a stringer. But I often had to work with pushy, cold-blooded creeps like this, so I went back to my first job as a carpenter. Not as exciting, but at least I could stand the people I worked with.",1457136000,,848,5.057142857142857

Best acting performance of 2014. A dark sadistic plot, performance and complete eye opening reality that lingers deep inside your thoughts long after it's over.

I love when a movie steps over the ethical and moral bounds of human culture and explores the dark side of human beings. Nightcrawler's, journalists, the paparazzi they all can be inhuman and use that old-timey excuse: ""I am only doing my job"", well, the Nazis simple said: ""they were only doing their jobs"". We are a society hooked on violence and extreme bloodshed. We want the extremely gory stories and as long as there are Nightcrawler's, we will feed our need.

This film is a dark stained and grey atmosphere of emotions. A deeply brilliant plot. I liked how the movie showcased no heroes and no rational peace, only horror and the desire to step away from right and wrong. It's a no holds bar attitude and a dog eat dog world.

Directed by a new comer Dan Gilroy. This is his first directorial debut and all I can say it wowzers. What a start to directing feature films. Gilroy has written many films, but this is his writing and directing gold. He wrote and directed this little dark and deep experience that truly leaves a lasting impression on the viewer.

Jake deserves awards. Gilroy deserves awards for this is a haunting and thrilling experience. An acting masterpiece. A wonderful disturbing trip into the actions of a modern day, everyday psychopath, yet the psychopath is the public that wishes it, the public that watches it. The public that strives to be entertained by the news, the bloodshed and the violence of filmed entertainment is the modern day Nightcrawler.

A perfect crime drama with a rich thrilling experience in the exploration of flawless acting and character development. A tight direction and a dark personal inner workings of the human psyche. A nightmarishly dark ride of film mastery.",1448409600,,2038,4.878612716763006

6777720,2,B00OZJ2Y38,"There was a huge buzz on the internet about this film, because of Jake Gyllenhaal's outstanding performance, but a great performance doesn't always make for a great film. Louis Bloom (Gyllenhaal) is down on his luck, he drives an old car, lives in an disgusting apartment, and doesn't have a job. He drives around at night looking for ways to earn money, when he comes across a film crew taping a crime scene. It seems like easy money, so Bloom goes out, gets a camera, and starts filming the police himself, only, he doesn't follow the same rules that the others do. I will not dispute that Gyllenhaal was terrific, but his character was beyond annoying. Louis Bloom is this O.C.D. guy, who is constantly rambling and talking to himself, something that basically ruins the whole film. This guy gets so annoying it's to the point of frustrating. On top of that, it takes a long time for anything substantial to happen. I was really looking forward to seeing this film and was impressed by how far Jake Gyllenhaal has come, but despite it's looming cult classic label, I found this film to just be one frustrating scene after another. Critics are willing to give films like this four stars and tell you it's a must see, because of an Oscar worthy performance, but what's really the point of seeing something that most people aren't going to want to sit through? Similar to Citizen Kane, it's got a great reputation, but don't let that fool you, this is one of the most nerve racking films I've ever sat through and to be honest, I'm sorry I did.",1445126400,,1544,4.577617328519856

6777737,2,B00OZJ2Y38,"Strap in, folks. This review got very long-winded.

The previews for this film made it look like a really dark, gripping and raw story. You know, scouring the crime-riddled underbelly of the city at night, looking for trouble and maybe causing a little along the way. However, I found Nightcrawler to be lacking in most aspects. Jake Gyllenhall is cast as anti-hero Lou Bloom, a fast-talking crackpot twenty-something who is desperate to make a quick buck, no matter what it takes. Eventually, he simply strong-arms his way into being a freelance cameraman, or ""stringer"" and sells his footage of various crime scenes to Nina Romina, the director of a local news station. Later on, it's implied that Lou also browbeats his way into a physical relationship with Nina.

Lou is a character who is very hard to like because he does whatever he has to in order to get what he wants, but in a way that makes you want to slap him rather than fear him; you can't even love to hate him either because he's not a comedic jerk, blood-soaked nutcase or sociopath. In fact, director Dan Gilroy said he specifically did *not* want to make Lou a sociopath because he didn't want to attach a label to the character. Rather, he wanted Lou to be presented as the product of a damaged society. My problem with this is Lou Bloom is the definition of a sociopath; he's more than happy to take advantage of people and hurt whoever he has to in order to make sure his own needs and desires are fulfilled, and he doesn't give anything resembling a crap about anyone other than himself. This especially shows toward the end of the film when we see what happens to Lou's assistant, Rick (I won't spoil it). But Gilroy doesn't want to call him a sociopath? What exactly would you call him, then? Gilroy wanted Lou Bloom to fall outside the typical diagnosis of a sociopath and didn't want his audience to call the character sociopathic, but that's precisely what he is! What is being accomplished by this avoidance of a label when it's true? So the director can say his character is more special than ""typical"" sociopaths?

Nightcrawler is the first film Gilroy has directed and I have to say that it shows. Don't get me wrong, I think Gyllenhaal is a fine actor and played his role well. The character of Lou Bloom needed work, not the person playing him. Lou's persistence and intensity is both admirable and frightening at times, but I feel as though Lou was not fully developed as a character.

The actual plot started off on a good note, but then it just felt like it was dragging on and on. Lou starts off stealing supplies from a construction site to sell and then assaults the security guard who questions him. From there, Lou slowly becomes a ""nightcrawler"" when he learns that filming crumpled-up cars, bullet holes in windows and dead bodies in rich neighborhoods can earn him a paycheck. He's also very good at what he does, but to be fair, Lou does have the kind of pushy personality a journalist would need to succeed, but something just didn't seem right about the character. This might seem silly, but I honestly thought that Lou spoke much too fast and that it actually hurt the feel of the character. Such a soulless, self-interested person would probably do better with slower, more deliberate speech. He looks creepy, he acts creepy, and then he talks like he's going to give you a great deal on a new or used car. His personality and his voice do not mesh, and while that might sound trivial, I think it made the character less believable. Gyllenhaal does not have a deep, scary voice, but his jabbering did him and his character absolutely no favors.

Also, Lou's assistant Rick seems to be pretty pointless. He doesn't really contribute much of anything to the story. Rather, he's just sort of there to get yelled at by Lou and I guess further demonstrate what a crazy, controlling loon Lou is. There's also a point where Lou sabotages his rival Joe Loder's vehicle and causes said rival to suffer a pretty serious injury, but the part where we learn that Lou actually caused the accident must have been a very subtle detail. I don't ever remember seeing anything about it.

Eventually, Lou gets footage of a home invasion and triple murder before the police even arrive at the scene. There's some legal trouble over the footage because the authorities feel Lou is withholding information, but since they can't prove he's lying, they can't do anything to him. The authorities also cannot seize the footage because it's the property of the news station, so the entire presence of the detectives seemed very forced and served no actual purpose. Lou is never punished or arrested or anything, and his efforts are never impeded by said detectives... or was this done to demonstrate just how ""untouchable"" un-sociopathic Lou actually was? Then the film ends with Lou's handful of new interns boading their shiny new vans, implying that he has been able to expand his business.

I think the entire idea behind the film would have done much better as a television series. The concept has potential for an ongoing story, introduction of new characters and, most importantly, time and room for character development (which was/is sorely needed). Aside from Lou and Nina, the only other characters who were important were Rick, Joe Loder and the two unnamed gunmen who were involved in the home invasion. Maybe this was intentional - Lou doesn't care about very much outside of his own little bubble, so by giving us so few characters, we as the audience have fewer people to give a crap about too.

This is just my own two cents, but there are a couple ways in which I personally feel Nightcrawler could have been better. First, make Lou Bloom an aggressively confident sociopath and don't be afraid of that label. By saying that society is to blame for his nature, Lou's unstable disposition is validated. And when your insane protagonist's behavior can be explained, sometimes that makes for a less disturbing character than if he was just nuts without a discernible reason. Like I said earlier, I think slowing down Lou's speech and not making him sound like a car salesman or a micro-managing office manager would have made him seem more sinister and frightening.

Finally, I would have liked to see the plot evolve into Lou committing or causing crime just for the sake of footage. Every crashed car and dead body is a payday for him, and having Lou regularly play both sides of the journalism field would really have made him much more terrifying. I could very easily see a sociopath going to such lengths for the attention and the money. From there, it could have turned into Lou finding loopholes to escape legal punishment, getting away with murdering seven people and then end the movie with his fleet of interns. But, right before they drive off to scour the city for crime, we could see Lou doing something like sharpening a knife or loading a gun. You know, getting ready to make some business.

Overall, Nightcrawler isn't horrible, but it's not wonderful either. It felt unfinished and underdeveloped, which is a shame because I think it could have been an awesome original film. The movie is a thriller, but at no point did I feel on edge or thrilled in any sense. Jake Gyllenhaal is a great actor, but I'd recommend skipping this film if you're a fan of his. One thing the film got right was the shooting and editing; I thought the camera work, scenes, framing, lighting, music and so on were all done very well and the atmosphere matched the aim of the movie very nicely.",1443312000,,7576,4.685199098422239

6777744,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"Jake Gyllenhaal sure has come a long way since Bubble Boy, the first film I saw him in, and always think of whenever he appears on screen.

Louis Bloom is desperate for work. He steals manhole covers, metal fences and other scraps to sell, and when he asks a construction foreman hes offering the metals to, the guy tells him that he won't hire a thief. The next day, Louis is inspired by a freelance film crew that records a car crash, and steals a nice bike, sells it and buys a camcorder and police radio scanner. Louis first real footage comes when he records a carjacking victims death, moving in closer to film the victim. He is immediately pushed away by the police, causing the other cameraman at the scene to get moved back as well. Needless to say, the guy is irritated with Louis and heads back to his van. But Louis follows him and listens in on the conversation hes having on his phone about selling the footage to a news station. This leads Louis down a path of recording footage for money, turning in what he has to Nina Romina, the director of one of the stations. She lets him know what they're looking for, and he does his best to get it for them. The thing about Louis though, is that the guy is far from normal. He talks weird, never seems genuine, and is obviously willing to do whatever it takes to get the best possible footage of whatever it is hes filming, no matter what it is, and no matter what the cost. Soon, he employs an assistant, Rick, who seems just as desperate as Louis for money, and the two head out to find the real big stories.

Nightcrawler starts out with a weird tone, and picks up fast. The character of Louis is an odd one. He seems like the kind of guy who should be some kind of psychotic killer, stuffing the remains of his victims in a closet somewhere, using them later to make furniture or something. Theres nothing charming or likable about him, and its clear that he has some kind of mental condition just based on how he talks and analyzes things. That being said, its not a handicap. Louis is very cunning and knows how to talk in most situations in order to get what he needs, at least with less intelligent people. There were so many times when he was talking that I was thinking back to when people talked like that to me, and it was so clear that they were trying to scam me. Weve all seen other people be victims of this, but for the most part, it seems innocent when Louis does it, because all he wants is to get better and better at what he does. We see him go from a low-level guy with a cheap camcorder, scanner and extremely old (for what it is) car, to getting better gear, a laptop and a much nicer car after he employs Rick and gets better on his stories. And the whole time, he stays the same guy.

To give you a better idea of how crazy this character is, there comes a point where Louis finds a body in front of a car when he arrives at the scene of the crime. He gets back and starts filming, but after a minute, he gets frustrated because its not the right shot, so he moves the body from its original point, into better lighting, and gets a better shot. He never tries to help the person, never does anything to make the situation better. All he cares about is his work. I won't spoil what it is that he does later on, but there comes a point where we see just how far hes willing to go for that perfect shot, and its something that no person with morals could ever do. I didn't see it coming at all. And thats a big part of what makes the film work- it has an extremely interesting character that you want to see more of. The rest of the cast does a great job, especially Renee Russo as Nina, who is probably just as obsessed with her job as Louis is. All the segments with her at the news station show you things that probably really do go on in the business where they try to scare viewers and put messages in your head while selling their story. As if you needed another reason to not watch the news. Theres also an intense scene later on that Id put right up there with the final showdown in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly when it comes to buildup. Youll know it when you see it. I also have to praise the cinematography, because its one of the only films Ive seen this year where Ive really noticed it.

Normally I dread watching movies that are over an hour and a half just because of how I do things, and don't have a whole lot of time for longer movies. Nightcrawler moves at a fast pace and is over before you know it, even at nearly 2 hours, and is one of the best movies Ive seen all year.",1443052800,,4576,4.1613995485327315

6777749,4,B00OZJ2Y38,"Nightcrawler is Jake Gyllenhaal as Leopold Bloom, a petty thief who steals copper and manhole covers. While he is not engaging in petty crimes, he is looking for a new career and accidently stumbles into the wild and crazy world of photojournalism. It fuels his fancy and he embarks on a manic quest to find the most sensational and lurid events to film and sell them to the highest bidder i.e. a failing nightly news producer Rene Russo.
This journey of his is quite sickening to watch but it is also entertaining. An ambitious man satisfying the curiosity of the viewer with the most horrifying images. While Leopold is ambitious we are not provided with his background. He is depraved in a way but it is also not too hard to like his drive. He delivers some amazing sermons on business and how to get ahead in life, even as he confesses that he studies everything off the internet.
This over the top, crazed character is played with utter conviction by Gyllenhall. Even without a background of the character, you are completely bewitched by this performance. Immorality and unbridled ambition have never been portrayed so convincingly.

6777757,4,B00OZJ2Y38,"Some say Nightcrawler is a thriller or a film noir, and I agree with that, but its mystery is not about the story (which is pretty simple), but the person himself. In Nightcrawler, Jake Gyllenhaal plays Louis Bloom, a freelance video journalist specializing in late-night crime scenes and accidents. When selling the footage to TV stations, he quickly learns that the more lurid the story, the bigger the paycheck.

As Bloom muscles into the highly competitive world, he thinks of a way to get a better story, way that may be morally questionable.

Nightcrawler works better as a character study than as a thriller, with the mysterious protagonist Louis Bloom, who speaks as if quoting from self-help books. Nothing is revealed about this mysterious person  his background, tastes, etc.  except that he is a very ambitious social climber, in this twisted, modern-day rags-to-riches story.

I read somewhere that the films (anti-)hero is probably one of the least likable characters we have seen. He is, and in fact, he is one of the creepiest characters we have ever seen on screen and Jake Gyllenhaal is perfect as that.

As a thriller some part of the film is not really convincing, with contrived situations and incredible coincidences, but Nightcrawler is still fascinating with the central character nearly as impressive as Travis Bickle.",1442275200,,1343,5.081818181818182

6777765,4,B00OZJ2Y38,"We rarely see movies that suck us into an understanding of the dark
side of sociopathy. This piece does so quite nicely. Jake Gyllenhaal
gives a brilliant performance, capturing both the attraction and
mystery one finds in a sociopath. Manipulative, pathological dishonesty
which fits his purpose perfectly. An incapacity for recognizable
interpersonal relationships and a complete lack of conscience or
empathy... All delivered in a very convincing and attractive package.
Finding an existence in what we recognize as a dark, morally
questionable environment (news reporting) and pointing towards an even
darker potential that what is actually delivered.

It is quite easily believable and doesn't splatter us with any moral
lessons, that is left up to the audience. The audience is given plenty
of ammunition.

Beautifully done! I see so many vapid films dressed in over the top
effects and carefully plotted (yet typically absurd) sociological
lessons that it is quite a pleasure to stumble in on actual perceptive
works of art, which is what this movie is.",1441843200,,1060,5.341317365269461

We know nothing about the main character except that he seems to be a psychopath who wants a job. And although Gyllenhal's lines are supposed to creepy, they often come off as canned and even oddly funny (read: campy).

Directed and written by Dan Gilroy.

It is late night in Los Angeles, California. A Full Moon shines high in the sky.
Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is in a restricted area clipping at a chain-link fence. He sees a security car arriving and he quickly puts his clippers in back of his car. The security guard (Michael Papajohn) questions him and Louis say that he is lost. Suddenly, he hits the guard. We are not really sure what happens next, but in the next scene, Louis is driving in his car and wearing the guards watch. A huge piece of the chain-link fence is rolled up in his car. Louis goes to a scrapyard to sell his fence and copper, the manager (Marco Rodriguez) doesn't want it. Louis then asks him for a job. The manager tells him he will not hire a thief.
Later, Louis stops at a police scene on the freeway. A woman is trapped inside a burning car. Louis stands there and watches. A free-lance recorder arrives to get video. he will then try to sell it to a news channel. Louis asks for a job. He was told, (censored) No!.  This gives Louis an idea. He buys a scanner and he decides to become a freelance news recorder too, but he starts arriving to the scene of the crime before the police get there.

6777852,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"Lou Bloom was definitely one unforgettable nightcrawler for he is ambitious and driven person that also possess disturbing qualities such as being a sick and twisted individual. Jake Gyllenhaal stars by portraying him in this film by Dan Gilroy that provides an insight on the news media particularly freelance journalism as well as the nocturnal life at the streets of Los Angeles.

Lou was a former thief who is seeking to look for employment. One day,he decides to work as a free lance journalist by taking footage of crime scenes and accidents that happens at nights in Los Angeles and sells them to Nina,a morning news director of a local news network.

Gyllenhaal did a fantastic performance of the creepy character Lou. We definitely could see how realistic he is in portraying an individual who will do anything in life to become successful no matter how immoral and evil it is. Added to that,we also get to see how news media tries to sell crime stories on TV for ratings and profit's sake instead of showing compassion for crime victims and accidents. It provides the viewer the effects of capitalism in news stories and local news network. Overall,it tries to paint a picture of both the American dream and American greed.",1438473600,,1233,4.838862559241706
6777853,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"This is a brilliant if chilling movie, and Gyllenhaal is sufficiently capable in his role as a totally self-interested opportunist that he is able to recruit his fellow actors and engage them at his level. The film is chock-full of insights into how the media world works in the background --- for example, even ""news"" is not about news, but ratings, and bottom dogs may bend or trample the rules in order to gun their ratings. Gyllenhaal is so calculating in the role that he clearly crosses the line into psychopathy, so this is also an opportunity to gain insight into how an antisocial personality might accomplish his objectives while simultaneously pursuing a career path. I was most struck by how Gyllenhaal never once lapsed even slightly or momentarily from his ""reptilian"" character. While psychopaths can often be charming, Gyllenhaal's character is probably better described as smooth, quick, unflappable and calculating, as he uses intimidation much more readily than say, flattery or charm (which are also common tools in the psychopath's armamentarium). However, the film is much more than a character study of the psychopathic personality, as it also has much to say about the media business, and about human nature generally. Special credit to Rene Russo for matching Gyllenhaal beat by beat as he escalates into increasingly unsavoury tactics and behaviour.",1438473600,,1375,5.198198198198198

6777877,3,B00OZJ2Y38,"How much of the too graphic for some footage on the nightly news has been truly manipulated? How possible is it for a camera guy to be so close to the action?
With chilling effect, Nightcrawlers explores the exciting and sometimes seedy world of stringers, independent videographers who trawl the cityscape and police scanners to win first footage of the latest grisly crime.

Jake Gyllenhall plays Louis Bloomanother in a long string of twitchy, amorally questionable characterswho may or may not be autistic, brilliant like Hannibal Lechter, or just a psychopath, lacking empathy but not ambition. Hes a quick study, blunt and uncomfortably manipulative, apparently having learned negotiation skills online. He rises quickly from petty thief of bikes and construction materials to video mastermind who has no qualms about entering crime scenes, or even creating a crime scene to achieve his goal. When Louis gets the attention of local news producer Nina Romina (Rene Russo), hes encourage to produce increasingly news-worthy footage of sordid tragedies, and soon manipulates her into not only paying dearly for exclusive footage, but literally selling herself to him as well. Bloom quickly hires an assistant, a homeless drifter named Rick (Riz Ahmed), who he also coerces into dangerous and possibly illegal work.

Where Nightcrawlers ultimately fails, despite some thrilling and edge-of-your-seat action toward the end, is in giving zero depth or backstory to its main characters. It clearly relies on the assumed evils of paparazzi/accident chasing videographers, the lust-for-any-news-scoop TV producers, and the so-desperate-on-the-streets gullible guy. The motivations of each characterall well-portrayed, are unexplored. It tells a one-dimensional story with gusto, almost David Fincher-esque precision, but we cant care for these people. Gyllenhalls character is sleazy yet fascinating, but we never know why. After Prisoners possibly autistic, savant-ish detective and Zodiacs possible autistic, savant-ish illustrator (I won't go all the way back to Donnie Darkos possibly autistic, savant-ish teen with the key to the apocalypse), Gyllenhall seems to have created his own typecast, no matter his terrific skills on displaying nuance and a variety of approaches to each character. Hes engaging regardless. Rene Russo is solid in her portrayal of a producer willing to give her all for a ratings bump, and Bill Paxton shines in a small role as a rival stringer.

The most troubling questions raised by Nightcrawler are how real is the methodology here? I cannot recall ever seeing, on the evening news, footage taken via such clearly illegal methods. I can believe its been doneI can believe certain types of nightcrawlers or paparazzi are capable of producing itbut I don't believe any network would risk massive lawsuits, nor police departments effectively ignore the complicity of the cameraman in these crimes. In an age of instant video via just about any personal handheld device, how necessary is it to pursue a livelihood from spontaneous and accidental tragedy? Granted, the media is sensationalistic; exclusive videos get attention, and the more graphic, the better; and the media favors stories of violence when they happen to white people over people of color. But Nightcrawlers seems rooted in the 90s, before You Tube, Instagram and Twitter deflated the evening news as the source for video rubbernecking.

Nonetheless, the movie gives us a taut, visceral and exciting glimpse at how some of this footage gets on TV news; it just cant be bothered to delve into why

CLICHES: news producers are immoral and greedy; you can get anywhere in LA without running into an hours traffic

SURPRISES: this is writer/director Dan Gilroys first film, and despite the character problems, its skillfully made, especially the pacing of the chase scenes

YOU ALSO LIKEY: Network or Broadcast News, for a more even-handed take on news behind the scenes.",1437609600,,3962,5.390953150242327

Cool tidbits about Nightcrawler:
- Jake Gyllenhaal did most of his own driving scenes, including the climatic car chase at the end
- The billboard for eyeglasses that Lou passes is reminiscent of the eyes of Dr. T.J. Eckleburg in The Great Gatsby; both stories address the idea of the American Dream and its flaws
- Jake Gyllenhaal lost 20 pounds for his role. This was Gyllenhaals own idea, as he visualized Lou as a hungry coyote

6777919,3,B00OZJ2Y38,"How Jake Gyllenhaal didn't get nominated for an Oscar last year when this film was released in a mystery. His performance made the movie. As to why he didn't get an Oscar nod, my conclusion is that the character he plays, Lou Bloom, is so despicable, his terrific performance was overwhelmed by the animosity the viewer develops for the character. Bloom is small time thief and unscrupulous opportunist. He's completely amoral, essentially a sociopath. He possesses an oil kind of charm buttressed by extortion when charm falls short of his goal. He becomes an independent news stringer (a nightcrawler) by accident. One night he witnesses a highway accident, pulls over to watch (not help) and notices a film crew roaring to the scene with cameras and a police radio so they can hear about the next tragedy to hit the LA metro area. Bloom decides this is the business for him and his ambition is not inhibited by morality or the law. This is a contemporary film noir, so it's very dark and focused on life's seamy underside. This is not a family film, nor is it escapist. It immerses you in more reality than you may care to experience. I generally buy films I want to see again. I may give this one away to a friend. But notwithstanding my comments, Gyllenhaal's performance sticks in my head.",1436659200,,1295,4.684210526315789

Gyllenhaal lost a few pounds to play a sociopath scavenger (think coyote), who finds love in nightcrawling (filming car crashes and other horrid scenes) for morning news broadcasters. Hell do anything it takes to get ahead. One thing to note is the pacing and how it increases as Gyllenhaals character develops, all coming to an impact ending.

I also thought some of the dialogue was superb...such as some of 1-on-1 scenes with Gyllenhaal and Russo.

An overall interesting dark plot, which also makes a comment on our society, the media, and sensationalism of violence.  For me the plot got a bit over-the-top as the movie went on, which is why it isn't totally a classic for me (i.e. doesn't get a 5th star).",1436227200,3,594,4.91

Jake Gyllenhaal is a sociopathic weirdo who drives around LA at night filming crime scenes for sale to TV news stations. Eventually he starts manipulating crime scenes to get better footage. That's about it. I was expecting this to be the best thing since sliced bread - or at least the best thing since 2011's Drive but no, no, no. It has a couple nice dramatic builds and a great performance from Gyllenhaal, but ultimately this film.. well let me just say this: they blew it with the ending. I was ready to go 4 stars for the first 1.5 hours, but the goofy plot contrivances and one frankly ridiculous plot twist towards the end sunk the ship. I could sit here and comment on the points the director may or may not be trying to make about the ethics and morality of the TV news machine but why bother? Despite what you may have read, this film is not deep enough to merit philosophical discussion. It is rare that I will advise a person not to watch a film even if I feel like it sucked but I have to go there with this one. Watching this film is a genuine waste of time.

6778001,4,B00OZJ2Y38,"Every now and then a film comes down the pike with a plot so new you have to wonder why no one thought of it before. This is one of those films.

Here's the scoop. Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a small time thief trying to get out of being a thief. By chance he happens upon the scene of a gruesome auto accident where an independent cameraman is filming the gore for the purposes of selling it to TV. Bloom sees potential in this line of work so he gets a cheap camera, microphone, and police scanner and goes after it. It all makes sense to him and ends up going to great (and highly questionable) lengths to come up with better and better footage for Nina Romina (Rene Russo) an overnight producer for a news show.

Gyllenhaal's Bloom is a remarkable character. He lost a lot of weight for the role so he looks like a pair of eyes staring out of a skull. He talks as though he's had almost no interaction with real humans, getting most of verbal characteristics from 'self help' or 'how to get ahead in business' tutorials. But he's no dummy. He sees what he needs to do to succeed and couples that with a serious amount of research. When he needs to negotiate dollars with Russo he has his gun fully loaded and he doesn't mince words. Russo's character is interesting as well. Her hair and make-up make her look like a prostitute and she's always on the prowl for the most gruesome footage to keep her ratings and hopefully her job. She knows Bloom can deliver.

Watching Bloom's character progress (or regress) in regard to what he will do to get the footage he wants will make your skin crawl. His actions reach a logical and horrible crescendo where human lives mean nothing. He is a totally soulless individual. The news media often takes a hit because they are just as soulless and will show essentially anything if it means they will profit by it. This movie does nothing to dispel that view of things. This is shot, directed and cut well. James Newton Howard pens a good soundtrack and all the acting, particularly Gyllenhaal's is top shelf.

This isn't everyone's idea of a good time but it's an exceptional outing for anyone who wants to see the boundaries of the art stretched.",1434326400,2,2194,4.4502487562189055

I watched this film solely because I like Jake's acting (and his sister Maggie is talented as well).

Too contrived and on the nose. I didn't buy the relationship between him and the TV executive at all. Even as corrupt as she was, she'd have thrown him out on his behind in no time flat when he tried to psychologically strong-arm her. I did like the nighttime shots of L.A., but it's been done before (Michael Mann's ""Collateral,"" for example).

I felt while watching, some severe inconsistency with this character's intelligence.  He's a victim of not a getting a break who would be a hard worker, he's a bully and blackmailer who uses others to achieve his goals, his character traits fluctuate often.  The film also is pretty unrealistic, Lou drives at ridiculous high speeds around unfamiliar LA streets at night and never crashes or gets pulled over by the police. He can just walk into a major TV studio and into rooms, surely in this day and age they'd have heavy security after the 9/11 attacks and the recent attack on a French magazine.  He constantly trespasses into crime scenes, moves things around and films his recreations yet never gets contacted by the police when the story airs the next day when it would be obvious to both them and the victims (if alive) what he did?  Surely there would at least be a directive, if you see some idiot in a distinctive red car pull up at an accident or crime scene with a cheap camera, keep him from contaminating the scene or getting in the way of emergency vehicles.

But these faults aside, Nightcrawler is an entertaining watch.  Maybe not something you'd bother to watch a second time round but definitely worth your time viewing once.",1433376000,,1496,4.665399239543726

Jake Gyllenhaal gives us one of his best inventions, a creep named Louis Bloom. This Bloom's town is LA, not Dublin.
The film is quite a few things. Apart from being a stage for Jake G and his miraculous talent, it is top of the class for anti TV propaganda. Why would a decent person support such a corrupt industry by working for it? Or by buying its products, by watching TV?
Ok, I admit, the world of TV has also produced outstanding and intelligent work. Such as Breaking Bad, Trem, The Wire, Deadwood, Game of Thrones, and so on. But all that has actually moved away from the genuine TV world towards a new kind of media sphere.
Bloom is a freelance TV reporter with endless ambitions. He becomes a reporter for lack of better options, after failing to make a successful career in other criminal businesses.
He begins at the bottom of the heap, and works his way up, in true traditional American fashion, by ruthless breaking of all rules of decency. What I almost admired more than his total lack of scruples was Bloom's relentless use of business clich language, acquired from online tutorials about self help and management philosophies. What a monster.

Gyllenhaal is unrecognizable (as many reviews can attest) and creepy as a sociopath, albeit driven freelance LA Crime cameraman/""journalist"". He is very talented at ""dark"", and I believe he really does the method approach justice throughout most of the movie.
The best part of the film is his relationship with his intern/assistant, Rick and his competition with rival ""skinner"" Bill Paxton.
It is riveting, and fast-paced, but suspend disbelief if you can - it goes beyond. Which is the point, but it feels like a figurative wagging finger in the face of the audience. A morality lesson dressed up like pulp fiction.

Better films have done it better... see Pulp Fiction or Natural Born Killers...

Rene Russo is miscast as a grave shift network producer for a local news show. I did not buy the chemistry between Gyllenhaal's Bloom and her character at all. In fact, in their scenes together, I felt the ""Actor"" come out in both of them - like bad summer stock.

I think my overall complaint is that I would've preferred the character to not have been portrayed so weirdly in his mannerisms, appearance, behavior. because of his isolation, his assault of others, his thefts, couldn't root for him, and he succeeds in the end because he is willing to step over other people's dead and/or broken bodies and lives, and in multiple instances, helped several people become broken. if you like to see a creepy bad guy win then you might take a look at this film. 2 and a half stars rounded up to 3 for the other actors - the actor playing his assistant is good, Rene Russo is outstanding as an aging, desperate producer who finds this guy repulsive and attractive at the same time (but his behavior was too unattractive for me and I kept telling her to run away as fast as she could, but she was too ambitious). the villain's competitor, I forget his name, is good. the lead guy's acting isn't bad, I just didn't care for his choice.",1430784000,,2012,4.467391304347826

Although for myself I thought the actors did an amazing job with the characters they were suppose to play and I agree with many other reviewers that Jake is a very good actor and thats why I gave the movie a four star rating out of five stars plus good previews on the disc and a good making of the movie with comments from the actors and director.

6778244,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"Nightcrawler was one of my favorite films of 2014. It's cinematography is striking, it's performances are incredibly strong and it's story is twisted and wonderful. I love this movie.

Writer/Director Dan Gilroy weaves together a story about a virus of a human being who burrows his way into the local news scene by manipulating evidence, breaking the law and pushing ethical boundaries in order to capture horrifying images. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance is so unique and off putting that it's hard to look away. His character Lou Bloom finds his way into the freelance news business almost by accident and it grasps him completely.

There's a weirdness to Bloom, and uncomfortableness and a threatening demeanor beneath this greasy haired, ever smiling and seemingly hard working facade. That's what's so odd about Lou, he's incredibly good at his job. He's a scum bag, but he has work ethic. He's a thief but he's a damn good thief, he's a liar but he's a damn good liar and he's a scum bag news hound but he's one of the most hard working in the world. His forked tongue manipulates those around him in a truly sociopathic kind of way. Lou doesn't care about anyone, he lacks empathy which makes every emotion he puts on feel false.

Despite Nightcrawler being a festival darling, having a nearly perfect score on Rotten Tomatoes and being on the top 10 lists of many critics around the world, it only got one oscar nomination... screenplay. Yes it's a well written film, but it's beautiful, well scored, perfectly paced and edited and everyone's performances from Rene Russo as a washed up news director to Riz Ahmed's performance as Rick, Lou's uneducated by witty assistant... it's all perfect.

I love Nightcrawler... it's burrowed into my mind as one of them modern classics the way Lou burrows into the lives of others, by force and with hard work.",1430006400,2,1858,4.851735015772871

6778250,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"Gyllenhaal does it again.  I like the movie roles he lately chooses for himself. I can still remember when he started in a homosexual film called Brokeback Mountain, and afterwards I sort of stopped watching his films altogether...I lost track of him.  But over the past five years I enjoyed watching  him act in End of Watch (2012), Prisoners (2013), Enemy (2013), and now in Nightcrawler (2014)...although Jarhead (2005) and Zodiac (2007) are also worth mentioning.  He is an incredibly well versed and intelligent actor.  On the side-note, Gyllenhaal looks like he is on coke in this one...he eyes, mannerism, alertness and attentiveness is amphetamine-like resembling...unless he was drinking five cups of strong coffee a night during filming...he was definitely taking something.

Nightcrawler is about a Los Angeles small time crook/thief who one night witnesses a car accident and learns of the ""night-life crime journalism"" business.  When a crew of cameramen arrive at the scene and start filming the car crash, Lou (Gyllenhall) takes keen interest in the profession.  Soon he begins freelancing on his own, each night waiting in his car and listening to the emergency/police radio, eagerly awaiting for a gruesome accident to happen so that he can rush to the scene first to film it and later to sell it for profit to a TV- News station...",1429833600,,1349,5.1
6778251,4,B00OZJ2Y38,"The average network affiliate newscast consists of equal parts calamity, sports, and weather with local interest pigeonholed in for a few insignificant moments.  The news honchoes convince themselves that they are offering the bloodthirsty public what they want while reaping the rewards of increased ratings.  Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) has no such pretensions making the natural career progression from common thief to nocturnal journalist.  He's a cold-hearted parasite and makes no bones about his intensions.  What he does want is financial compensation for his artfully constructed videotapes of murder and mayhem and a little bit of legitimacy for his efforts.  His employers need him more than he needs them and he knows it.  The decline of television journalism has been obvious for decades as demonstrated in 1976 with Paddy Chayefsky's ""Network"".  What director Dan Gilroy adds to the conversation is a high tech aura and acknowledgement of the influence of reality television.  The film makes its points forcefully sometimes a bit too bluntly but never redundantly.  Gyllenhaal's work here is a piece with the lovable rogues who've graced the big screen in the past careful not to overplay his hand making Bloom somewhat charming and empathetic if you judged him by his own criteria. Sort of like a devil with a camcorder and police scanner. Gyllenhaal is matched by Rene Russo as Nina, a Diana Christenson type who purchases Lou's ungodly product more from inate knowledge of marketplace than from any moral criteria.  ""Nightcrawler"" reminded me of an underrated film from years ago called ""The Public Eye"" where Joe Pesci played a freelance still photographer in the Forties who took salacious pictures of New York after dark and sold them to the local tabloids at the back door.  Pesci's character parts with Gyllenhaal's in that he was oblivious to the exploitative nature of his activities and regarded his photography as art.",1429833600,4,1944,5.218649517684887

6778255,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"Im not the type to ask for a sequel.  For me, most films should stand alone and remain alone because elongating these stories tends to beat a dead horse and next thing you know its overstayed its welcome.  Im also not one to ever wish that a film were a television series or a mini-series.  I don't watch much television and series can tend to overwhelm me with the necessity to catch every episode each week.  All that said, when Nightcrawler ended I said a silent prayer that it would continue, that the credits would stop rolling and I would be allowed to spend another hour, two, seven with Lou Bloom.

Id take a sequel.  Id take a mini-series.  Are you listening, HBO?  Lou Blooms story is not over yet!

The hype surrounding Nightcrawler was unreal.  Everyone that I knew that saw the film raved it, and they raved, above all other things, Jake Gyllenhaals performance.  Gyllenhaal is an interesting case for me, because it took me a very long time to warm up to him.  I was all in early in his career, really enjoying his performances in things like Donnie Darko, Moonlight Mile and Jarhead.  His Oscar nominated performance in Brokeback Mountain has aged far more soulfully than I initially regarded it, and so Ive settled into really being happy for him and his moment in the spotlight.  Sadly, after that Oscar nom, his career kind of tanked.  He popped up in such horrible film choices and became nothing but a body to look at.  But then he turned in a slow burn of a performance in the otherwise awful Prisoners, and his career began to take new light.  He followed that up with Enemy, which was outstanding, and then his recent Oscar bid (for which he was shamefully snubbed), Nightcrawler.

In all honesty, his slate of 2015 films (Southpaw, Everest and Demolition) are three of my most anticipated of the year, and mostly because I cant wait to see his performance in each.

But Nightcrawler is more than Gyllenhaal.  This is one of the most absorbing films Ive seen in years, and it is the only film from last year that I literally prayed would continue.  Like, what Dan Gilroy does with this narrative, the way he spins each scene, the way he milks the tension, the way he spirals into Lous decent into ambitious madness; all of it is so authentically energetic and brilliantly composed.  This is a director with real vision and promise.  I see very big things for his future, and I really hope he follows this up with an interesting premise.

Im serious; Nightcrawler pt. II!

The basic premise for the film is that of a man desperate for a job who catches onto the idea that TV news programs will spend good money to get on the scene footage of crimes, accidents and the whole gritty truth.  So, Bloom gets himself a camera and an assistant and sets off to make his money, becoming a nightcrawler, a man who scours the streets at night looking for tragedy.  His drive is palpable, and it pushes him to the limits, and passed them as he starts creating his own rules, getting too close for comfort and even creating his own stories, manipulating things in order to create more tension and get more money.  But its not all about the money.  Bloom is a man who needs to be a part of something, to feel like hes a necessity, a valuable tool, and so he does everything in his power to be noticed.

At the heard of Nightcrawler is a story of a man so desperate to be human that he becomes inhuman.

For me, this is one of the films from 2014 that continues to haunt me.  It has become one of the best films of the year, one of the films that I continue to look back on and debate, dissect and ponder.  Like I said, I didn't want this to end, and I would love to take another ride with Bloom, no matter how dark and twisted I know it would be, because Bloom carved out his own story, wrote his own rules and took me on a ride only he could take me on.",1429833600,3,3863,4.373071528751753

The interesting question is ""how far can he go"" without getting arrested or shunned.  I was left with a profound curiosity about just how the female night news producer would negotiate the professional and personal pitfalls of continuing with this wierdo.

Gyllenhaal does a great job at playing the slightly creepy/slimy Bloom and in fact plays it so well; it kind of turned me off to the movie a bit.  The character was weirdly off that it really made the character so unlikeable to me that I felt it detracted from the movie a bit.  The story line has its moments but really I felt was missing something and really failed to draw me into the movie.  The story has way too many improbable moments to give it anything other than an unrealistic rather sarcastic view of TV journalism.  Gyllenhaal is great in the role but the subpar script and that missing suspense that failed to draw me in or be thought provoking.

This movie is a perfect example of what he is fantastic at:  Taking everyman stories that are rather mundane and not all the interesting in terms of the elevator pitch (Computer nerd gets himself into electronic news gathering for a local LA network.  Riveting!), but then drawing you in and really making you care about what is happening, and what's going to happen next.

I also give him a ton of credit for the weight he dropped for this role.  It really adds to the creepy factor.  It would not have worked if he still had his jar-head physique.

6778380,3,B00OZJ2Y38,"This is not your usual movie, it doesn't even touch a typical movie's reality.  Not only that but it's the kind of movie that could get 5 stars or no stars.  First: It's well directed, well cast, great film crew, fine acting, and well made.  The script comes in with- what I describe as- a film noir slant; in that it's final statement is: [for the characters in the screen play] ""nothing good will ever come of this and nobody that leaves will be the better for it.""  That having been said the main character may have gotten what he was after.  In that case he has no soul and is either psychotic or a sociopath.
  Where this film stands out is on the philosophy of: ""If you're not willing to make it, through work and perseverance,  then 'YOU' are to blame, and nobody else.""  Anything less is to create a crutch, so as, to blame others for your failure.  That makes you a loser and not a winner, in modern society.  In this movie Jake Gyllenhaal's character is relentless in his pursuit to become a tabloid-popperotzi film company.  This is an important part of this film.  It seems to actually show you what you need to do to get a job or create a business.  Study at the library and on line.  Learn about your choice, and watch others that know what they are doing.  Copy their actions [that's how Jake learned to use the camera and what shots to go for.]  Use your setbacks to grow and take notes.
  The movie: ""Renaissance Man"" with Danny DeVito Was supposed to show lower income individuals how to get a job.  That was it's premise but it showed nothing, not even how to look in the classifieds.  "" Renaissance Man""  told us that if we read ""Hamlet"" then the world will be our oyster.  ""Nightcrawler"" did all that "" Renaissance Man"" promised, without ever trying to teach us to get ahead.
  Jake Gyllenhaal  plays a creepy guy that will throw anyone under the bus to get what he's after.  But if you want to see a movie that shows motivation, total focus on one's goal, and tenacity then this should be for you.",1428278400,5,2019,4.35752688172043

6778386,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"Jake really makes this movie work for me. He's convincing as a smart fast-learner, although it seems he must have been born at 20 years old (i.e., he hadn't developed much between birth and then).

It's a creepy movie in that it's very plausible. Those are the ones that get me. Not the blood and guts or silly in-your-face attempts at horror. Jake is scary in how far he's willing to go and how good he is at manipulating people, despite his apparent lack of social skills.

This may not be in the league of all-time classics, but it's a very good attempt in a new avenue. I'm surprised this movie wasn't made 15 years ago (time flies!) around the dot-com era. I can see that it's more contemporary, though, in that a lot of new technology is readily available and of good quality, making it more likely for the average Joe able to pursue it.

Watch it and you might agree that this is one of the first good movies in this genre. Probably in another 15 years we might see more movies like this and compare them with this pack leader.",1428192000,,1034,4.347150259067358

And this story is told well, with great direction and to the point. There is not a one filler moment here. While some might argue that our main character doesn't really change all that much during this movie, I would say that is exactly the point. This journey was only possible for this particular mindset, masterfully depicted by Jake Gyllenhaal. It could have only started at that particular point and went to the inevitable conclusion. Support cast is more than up to the task to provide the backdrop and shadowing to the depth of main character's depravity. Rene Russo is as great as ever.
All in all, this venture into everyday psychopathy is more than deserving of a praise, and the layers it hides within are well worth the time and effort to discover them. Are we ourselves all that different from the nightcrawler?",1427587200,,964,4.676470588235294

6778483,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"this is a spooky and mordantly sarcastic film, simultaneously a biting satire of modern local market news broadcasting (""think of us as a screaming woman, running down the street with her throat cut"" -- the paradox of a screaming but cut throat is left hanging in the air), of the shallow puddles of modern business culture (""you took away my bargaining power and used it against me!""), of the pathetic nonsense vended by self help gurus (""a friend is a gift we give to ourselves""), all churning inside a man of limited intelligence who will do anything, including copious amounts of shameless self promotion and unethical conniving, to get ahead in life.

the makeup artist seems to have done nothing with mr. gyllenhaal except accent his eyebrows and slime his lanky hair, but gyllenhaal projects a character that is visually as riveting as an alien invader with slime dripping from its weirdly grinning mouth parts. this  performance equals his work in ""enemy"", where he used very subtle differences in speech, posture and inflection to project two entirely different personalities. he is one of the best actors of his generation.

renee russo is terrific as the aging news director who is at once professionally expert, privately lonely, insecure in her position but hungry for power. she is eventually seduced by the sleazy instincts, manipulative skills and carnal desires of the up and coming nightcrawler. riz ahmed is perfect as the nightcrawler sidekick, a vacant dupe who realizes too late what he has gotten himself into.

the early scene, where a news crew works an actual accident scene much as a film crew would work a movie set, sets up the key metaphor. at first nightcrawler only manipulates the news by overaggressive filming, but he quickly progresses to rearranging crime scenes and hiding evidence from the police. in the superbly choreographed finale, he contrives a shootout and fatal car chase just so he will be able to film it. ""nightcrawler"" asks the old but still disturbing question: when is reporting the news actually creating the news? a dark, fascinating and superbly directed work.",1427414400,3,2116,5.01994301994302

6778604,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"I admire, respect, and sometimes question the sanity of the method actor.  If you are reading this review you probably have at least a vague notion of what a method actor is and does.  But for those of you who are not familiar with the term here is the broad definition: in order to create a character for a movie, a television show, or a play the method actor works from the inside out.  Essentially the actor wants to develop and utilize the thoughts and feelings of the characters that he/she is to portray.  Creating the true thoughts and feelings of assigned characters is a very difficult feat to accomplish; and so, the actor/actress oftentimes goes to extraordinary lengths to create the necessary conditions to cultivate the character.  An actor may intentionally starve, gorge, and deprive themselves.  Others may refuse to drop out of character even when the camera is no longer filming.  Others may insist that the rest of the cast and crew address them as the character that they are assigned to play.  It all sounds insane. Torturing yourself for days, months, or years on end just so a bunch of strangers can watch you disappear into this other person for just under two hours. It is insane, but if you are fortunate enough to watch a well done method performance the experience tends to stick with you.

I read an article in where Jake Gyllenhaal states that he starved himself during the day, and ran 15 miles every night to lose 30 pounds for the role of Lou Bloom in the movie, Nightcrawler.  He also thought of himself as a coyote, traveled almost exclusively after dark, and hitched rides with the paparazzi as a means to prepare. The result of all of this preparation is the transformation from the handsome Jake Gyllenhaal to a ghoulish looking fiend.  And Lou Bloom is a ghoul; he is man, who with his trusty police scanner, prowls around the streets of Los Angeles at night, searching and seeking, until he finds what he is looking for: the most unfortunate and suffering of souls. And when he does find what he is looking for he films the scene, and he lingers, and he leers with those Gollum like eyes of his.  When Lou happens upon the scene of a car accident or a violent crime he revels in the misery of the victims. When those victims of violence are inhaling their last breaths, Lou is imbued with new life, and a burgeoning career of a Nightcrawler (people who film horrific crimes scenes for the television news).

Gyllenhaals performance in Nightcrawler brings another great method performance to my mind.  In 2009, the recently deceased Heath Ledger won an Oscar for his portrayal of The Joker in the Dark Knight.  The Joker and Lou Bloom have similar sensibilities and characteristics.  Both are relentless, winning at all cost characters that intentionally create chaos to achieve their goals.  They are creative, brilliant, misanthropic, entitled and psychotic criminals that see people as disposable means to an end.  They always seem to be one step ahead of the competition (the people who are charged with capturing them); and even after being captured by the authorities they don't seem to care because they seem to know that the authorities are powerless to stop them.  Both are unquestionably evil and villianous; and apart from the Jokers scars, green hair, and make-up their physical appearances seem to mirror each other.

The character of Lou Bloom does not start off as being a successful Nightcrawler. He is just another guy (although a creepy looking one) who is struggling to find work before he happens upon his first crime scene, and meets a future competitive Nightcrawler (Bill Paxton). After that fateful meeting Lou purchases a video camera and police scanner, and before long he is able to successfully film his first crime scene. He shows the footage to a struggling local television producer (Renee Russo), and after viewing the footage for herself, she provides Lou with a $250 payment for his footage.  After Lou sees his footage on the local news he is hooked and Renee Russos character soon becomes hooked on him.

Nightcrawler is a really good movie that is made great by Jake Gyllenhaals performance. You should not miss this film.  Jakes performance stuck with me and I think that it will stick with you too.",1426982400,4,4277,4.789115646258503

He's creepy and captivating, all at the same time as he manipulates an aging news director, gullible street twenty-something, and the king of the ambulance chasers, which he dispatches in various ways with sinister speed.  The dialogue is crisp and just right for adults looking for a great Friday night horror movie.",1426982400,,577,5.052631578947368
6778620,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"Nightcrawler is a new take on an urban sociopath, written and directed by Dan Gilroy. Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) prowls the Los Angeles streets at night and ekes out a living by stealing and reselling various commodities while he looks for a job. One night he pulls over to see an accident by the side of the freeway. Hes quickly joined by a freelance news team that shoots tabloid footage to sell to local television news programs. If it bleeds, it leads. Inspired, Lou sells a bicycle to purchase a camcorder and a police scanner. Then he gets in everyones face at every crime scene he can find. He is able to sell some gruesome footage of a shooting victim to KWLA news director Nina Romita (Renee Russo), who needs sensational product to save her job at Los Angeles lowest rated morning news program. Encouraged by his initial success, Lou hires an assistant (Riz Ahmed), invests in better equipment, and becomes increasingly daring in what and how he films.

Ive always thought of Jake Gyllenhaal as a mediocre talent. He plays an adequate boy next door, but if he reaches much beyond that, he is out of his depth. His performance in Nightcrawler is a revelation. Lou Bloom is desperate, persistent, pathological. All the time. It feels like hes always one second away from snapping and unleashing god-knows-what horror. Yet he is a controlled, disciplined person with intense energy and ambition. Hes scary. We get all of this by the second scene, even though Lou hasn't yet said anything out of the ordinary. Thematically, Nightcrawler is not a character study. It is a comment on the deteriorating editorial standards for news organizations, as they try to hang onto their audience in the face of competition from countless cable and internet news sources. We see the battle over standards fought between Nina and her colleague Frank (Kevin Rahm). As we are repulsed by Lou but curious to see how he will shock us next.",1426982400,,1928,4.78978978978979

The only thing that killed the movie for me was the ending. It didn't quite fit in to the rest of the seemingly realistic movie. It was abrupt and somewhat fantastical.,1426809600,,320,4.836363636363636

6778630,1,B00OZJ2Y38,"If I don't give it 1 star no one will read this.  The move is well written, acted, shot, everything!  I was never bored.  I don't want to give anything away.  The film is worth watching.  Though the ending scene is very short, it ruins much that came before it.

I can buy the argument that the reason  people watch a lot of crime on TV is because they have a pathological blood-lust.  I can't buy the argument that the reason why we have stuff to watch is because pathological murderers, essentially, go get it for us.  This film confuses the two.  I find it difficult to believe someone like Louis would rise to the level he did without getting his wings clipped, if not getting thrown in jail.

The film is unsure what it's about, a very disturbed, and violent person, or about the seedy aspects of the local news.  The biggest crime the filmmakers make is not allowing the audience to feel the catharsis of getting the bad guy.  The film is supposed to be realistic.  But in the end, it tries to make a point which is either unbelievable, or if believable, then really at odds with the story it tells.

A more realistic ending would focus our attention on the issues behind blood-lust and TV news.  Instead, we wonder, would Louis really end up there?  Are the people we see behind a camera really like that?  The film made its point, then it threw it away.",1426809600,2,1361,4.376

6778635,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"I really loved this movie.  The first time I saw it was on my iPad, while on a plane to Las Vegas.  There was a scene late in the movie that had me jump and yelp.  It was an unfortunate move on my part, since I was in the center seat, wearing headphones.  I totally freaked out the strangers either side of me.  The guy to my right gave me dirty looks, like I was insane.  But, none of this has to do with the actual movie...

I thought Jake Gyllenhaal gave an inspired performance, full of nuance & subtle tics. Completely believable. It was wonderful to see Renee Russo on the screen again.  She did not disappoint.  Her eventual compliance with Gyllenhaal's character was portrayed without the need for the obvious and her skewed moral compass always laid just beneath the surface.

The part of Jake's assistant, Rick, was played with an endearing awkwardness.  I completely believed his portrayal and would love to see him in something completely different so I could witness another side to his ability as an actor.

Michael Hyatt, who plays Detective Fronteiri, was convincing as someone who was not at all duped by Jake's character.  Her hard boiled interactions with Jake and Renee was a nice counterpoint to their questionable ethics.

Bill Paxton also turned in a performance that hit all the right notes.

It could've been played by any 2 actors because both main characters were so 1 dimensional and undeveloped, but I'm glad it was the actors you see.  It could have been called ""Nightmare"" if they casted anyone with a ounce less acting ability.  One thing that bothered me was the bizarre, 1980's soundtrack.  For the last few scenes I turned down my sound and put on closed captioning because it was really spoiling the mood.  It was something right out of the movie ""Dune"" or a motorcycle maintenance instructional video.  It would crash in full blast during a car chase scene or linger awkwardly in the background during one of the movies many intense dialogues scenes.  You really have to like Jake Gyllenhaal for this one to work for you.  He's on the screen a lot...  I didn't for a while, til I saw the movie Prisoners.

Amongst the modern, sprawling Hollywood wasteland where every movie has the same beautiful heroes in love with the same beautiful women conquering evil in identical plots with predictable happy endings along comes the story of this weird creep. While the hero of this movie is usually the villain in others, this film is happy to allow his twisted exploits be the focal point for its brilliant and perverse musings on journalism, crime, ambition and morality.

One testament to the complex ingenuity of this unique film is how it defies simple categorization. On the surface, critics might conveniently label it a drama, or possibly a thriller with its numerous scenes of crime, violence and suspense. But on another level, the film even operates as one of the bleakest black comedies of all time. Many of the characters antics are so deliriously debased that the viewer cannot help but guffaw at their ludicrously tawdry decisions and actions.

The subject and premise are fascinating. This film offers a unique insiders perspective on freelance cameramen working with local news broadcasts. Who even knew such a profession existed? But this movie exposes the fantastic underbelly of these seedy, predatory ambulance-chasers and their competitive industry built upon suffering and woe.

Beyond its novel setting, the film is skillfully executed in nearly all other facets. The cinematography is astounding with its majestic shots of L.A. at night. The editing is superb too, as numerous scenes are incredibly suspenseful and perfectly paced. In fact, the entire script is near flawless as it efficiently imbibes even the duller parts with curious and interesting exchanges. The score and soundtrack offer a nice, charging counterpoint to its vibrant visuals.

But of special note too is the acting. The various supporting actors are all superb, but the main star really makes this movie. Jake Gyllenhaal mayve been just pretty-boy Hollywood royalty in his earlier career, but this newest flick is the latest in a fantastic run of powerful films. While End of Watch was quite good, both Prisoners and Enemy are legitimate perfect-10 masterpieces, both featuring sublimely unsettling, intriguing, and unique cinematic experiences. And Nightcrawler might even be the best one of all.

Many misattribute the word ""antihero"" to loosely describe protagonists with somewhat noble intentions but darker methods. But there is nothing redeeming about this scumbag. Most other actors would play such a despicable cretin with typical bombastic aplomb, chewing scenery with over-the-top abandon. But Gyllenhaals performance is wonderfully understated: a soft-spoken, unblinking lunatic with a fiendish intelligence and insensitivity. His peculiar maniac definitely belongs on the Mount Rushmore pantheon of unforgettable psychopaths like Pacinos Scarface or McDowells Alex.

Like one of the gory car crashes the protagonist captures for the morning news, this film too is a mesmerizing spectacle in its audacious and twisted vision. This heavy but entertaining examination of darkness, evil and greed is one of the most magnificently subversive movies ever made. Films this daringly original must be lauded and supported for modern cinema to once again embrace art over commerce, to be intelligent as well as entertaining.",1426464000,2,3357,5.458574181117534

6778751,4,B00OZJ2Y38,"This movie reminded me a lot of Drive with Ryan Gosling, in terms of style and that it mostly takes place in Los Angeles at night. Jake Gyllenhaal gives a very strange but dedicated performance as Lou Bloom a young man with a lot of ambition but nowhere to put it. The movie begins with him stealing copper and fence wire in order to make a quick buck. He eventually falls into a career of recording human tragedies after witnessing a motor accident on the highway and seeing the paparazzi-like reporters catching up close and personal footage of the wreckage which they sell for top dollar. He becomes inspired, feels its his life-calling and begins to record crime up close himself. He finds a news station to sell his footage to and begins a relationship with the head of video clips (played winningly by Renee Russo, great to see again!)who inspires him to dig deeper and find better more graphic footage in order to improve her channel ratings. He does so, loyally (to a creepy fault) and the movie just explores his adventures nightcrawling and making himself a success built from nothing but the ground-up. He's basically profiting from other people's tragedies. He even says that ""if you see me, you're not having a good day,"" so, at least, he has a sense of humor about it. Shes unique because she also considers Lou to be a true talent and is moved by his recordings which, in turn, inspires Lou to do things that makes us the viewer question his morality. Its an interesting, somewhat disturbing movie that speaks a lot about our current cultures fascination with the morbid. The movie has witty dialogue and unusual action sequences that are both frightening
and entertaining while still making you feel bad about whats happening. Jake Gyllenhaal has never been better and Renee Russo matches him every step of the way. It was great watching them interact.

6778754,4,B00OZJ2Y38,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

""Nightcrawler"" is an amazing directorial debut for writer/director Dan Gilroy. The film could best be described as a ""guilty pleasure,"" in that the film's protagonist, Lou Bloom, is far from what you would call a sympathetic paragon of virtue. Quite the contrary, Bloom is a sleaze-bag who you will still (to a certain extent), end up rooting for.

""Nightcrawler"" is more of a fable than a docudrama. I say this because in reality a character such as Bloom could not succeed in the real world of television news. His beating the cops to the punch at a triple homicide crime scene seems most unlikely but even more implausible is that the TV news show would ever broadcast his footage (c'mon folks, have you EVER seen such graphic footage appear on television news?). Let's face it, the station would never subject itself to the liability of broadcasting such carnage anytime of the day, let alone the prime time evening news. Nonetheless, Mr. Gilroy is still making a great point: there's a voyeur in almost every one of us and the powers that be in the media will capitalize on this, for any kind of buck.

""Nightcrawler"" succeeds as a rollicking entertainment due to its deftly plotted script. After Bloom finds his calling as a freelance video journalist specializing in accidents and crime scenes in affluent areas, we immediately see there's something a little different about this self-appointed entrepreneur: Bloom is much more aggressive than his rival Joe Loder, who has been shooting video footage for years.

In each scene where Bloom plies his trade, Gilroy keeps raising the stakes. As a neophyte, Bloom gets in a little closer than Loder does while shooting footage of a carjacking victim; and later, Bloom re-arranges the position of a car crash victim, in order to get a better shot. In his personal life, Bloom raises the stakes with Nina Romina (Rene Russo), the morning news director: he'll give her exclusive footage only if she sleeps with him.

Bloom has a momentary setback when Loder beats him to the scene of a small plane crash but Bloom then takes Loder out of the game by sabotaging his van (resulting in serious injuries to Loder when the van crashes). The penultimate, heart-pounding event occurs when Bloom (along with Rick Carey, the down on his luck assistant, Bloom hires) come upon a home invasion, just as the assailants are leaving the area. Bloom gets footage of the criminals and also videotapes the victims inside the house, all dead from gunshot wounds.

Gilroy ups the stakes even higher when Bloom locates the criminals who were responsible for the murders during the home invasion. Instead of initially telling the police who they are, he follows them to a fast food store and then calls 911, intending to videotape the confrontation the police end up having with the bad guys at the store. When one of the bad guys escapes the shootout, Bloom and Carey follows him in a heart-pounding chase.

Bloom's sleaziness is seen in high relief when he orders Rick to videotape the remaining criminal, who appears badly injured after his SUV crashes. Bloom insists the man is dead but throws caution to the wind, still ordering Rick to get in close for some good shots. Sure enough the bad guy is still alive and shoots Rick in the chest. As he lays dying, Bloom has no guilt feelings about videotaping his fallen employee, who he knows will bring in more income when he offers the footage to Romina.

As it turns out, the footage that Bloom has garnered, is a big sexual turn-on for the now-impressed Romina. Bloom's desire to get ahead is in effect rewarded by society as he now purchases two new vans and hires a group of interns to assist him. While the police have no evidence to prove it, Bloom's unethical behavior is ignored by his patrons, who reward him for his brazenness.

""Nightcrawler"" is a most impressive debut for Mr. Gilroy, whose fairy tale/fable succeeds in its depiction of a charming rogue, who will stop at nothing, to succeed in the television news business. ""Nightcrawler"" manages to not only entertain greatly but in its satirical overview, it castigates a society much more interested in rewarding those who wish to get ahead at the expense of ethical behavior.",1426377600,2,4265,4.815573770491803

6778756,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"What a stellar movie!  The acting by Gyllenhaal doesn't let you pause it or turn away for even a second.  The subject matter is compelling, the relationships are gut-wrenching but very train wreck-ish.  Didn't go into the movie with huge expectations but came out more than pleased.

Russo plays a producer on the wrong end of her career faced with a hyper-ambitious Gyllenhaal struggling to make a name for himself.  The way these two rise together is sick, disturbing, and driven by gore.  A microcosm for modern ""news""; 'if it bleeds, it leads.'  A few friends in media gave this flick stellar reviews for not just the story, but what it tells us about ratings and the commercialism of journalism.  On nearly every level this movie exceeded my expectations.

A few aspects may be unrealistic, such as his rapid success, but in an allotted time it would be hard to progress as slowly as is needed to sell it as honest.  In any case, the cinematography is wonderful, colorful HD- a visually stunning movie.  Gyllenhaal's character is an interesting study in humanity (or lack thereof) in a society driven by money and ratings.  Russo plays a woman that seems reasonable despite her callous disregard for others until she becomes a very sympathetic character.  The transformations that occur add another level to a film which may not receive many awards but is a must see.

Also, for a Dodge Challenger fan, some of the scenes are worth watching whether you're interested in the film or not.  Sweet car ;)! Would not recommend to watch with parents, on a date, or casually. Violence and gore would be repelling for some and you must be into it, as the film is quite intense.",1426377600,,1674,4.724137931034483

6778790,4,B00OZJ2Y38,"Screened the Bu-Ray last night.  I agree that the ending was a bit blunt and obvious, but otherwise
I thought this was a pretty riveting, dark, disturbing, hypnotic film, and of course Jake G.
is just fantastic in his role and the creepiness level is off the charts.  He's equal parts Anthony Perkins'
Norman Bates, mashed up with the desperately sick ""camera"" psycho from the old British movie PEEPING TOM (perhaps still
even MORE disturbing NOW than even Nightcrawler), and Jim Ballard from J. G. Ballard's CRASH.
Add a bit of the amoral Orson Welles' profiteering protagonist from The Third Man and you've got
a good sketch of our scary ""hero"" here.

It definitely updates the darker messages of the classic movie Network to the 21st Century and ups the ante
of blood and guts for ratings and damn all else and ethics, etc., that much higher.
I wouldn't say this movie was any 5-star masterpiece, a tad overrated for sure, but it's
still a solid film and eminently watchable despite its very disturbing subject and
protagonist (anti-hero). There is of course violence here but it's almost done like Cronenberg
might have approached this subject matter in his earlier films or CRASH, in a weird, detached
clinical manner that absolutely matches the subject matter herein and the most chilling thing
is how we, the audience, like Lou, the loner sociopath who finds his true calling by sheer coincidence,
become totally almost inured or benumbed to it, as most of us have done with the nightly TV news
murder sheets and all that for decades now.  Jake doesn't care and is immune to it all right off
since he's a monster that doesn't like people, is up front about it even to his hapless ""partner,""
(sacrificial lamb that he is), and therefore is tailor-made for such a ""dirty job.""

Creepy with a capital C, not for everyone, but mainly a thrilling, gripping, edge of your seat
modern L.A. noir that could, in a ""flipside"" sense, be considered a worthy companion or double-bill
with Refn's recent DRIVE.  Both of our ""heroes"" are really anti-heroes to a large degree, although
in Nightcrawler Gylenhaal's Lou is much more so to the 1000th power.  At least Driver had a sort
of code to live by and knows right and wrong (though he's an outsider and lives utterly by his own
rules/code where ultraviolence is ok as long as it's done to the right parties!), whereas Lou here
has his own code too: I work alone, I don't give a damn about you, and I will hurt you if you get
in my way.  Period.

Some might call this a ""sick"" movie but I think it's utterly not, it's a commentary on a ""sick"" society
and such.  Without a doubt.  Not ""pleasant"" but I think overall it's a very good, if flawed, effort.
It also looks and sounds fantastic, and even though the script isn't always great, in spots
supporting greats like Bill Paxton manage to help bolster the weak bits, making the whole, as it should be,
greater than the sum of its parts.  If you're at all a modern noir fan this movie should enthrall most of you
that love this ""genre.""  No genre film here though: the ""plot"" is obvious, it's the characters, setting, mood,
and message and the film's intelligence that is most crucial here.  No mysteries here, except of human
nature and what drives people to certain behaviors, on all sides of this particular creepy turned-over-rock
that is Nightcrawler.",1426204800,3,3349,4.673469387755102

6778803,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"Brilliant movie.  I loved it.  I thought it was exaggerated, but most movies are, thankfully.  There's some self-reflection in that though.  The appetite people have for sensationalism reflects back on the viewer watching a sensationalist movie about an edgy creepy ""nightcrawler,"" which brings in ratings and money.  One reason I liked it so much is that I agree with one of the general themes which the director speaks about in interviews: really successful people are borderline sociopaths and/or one needs to be a borderline sociopath to be really successful.  I share this observation with the director.  Most of the really successful people I have run across, even mildly successful, managers, small business owners, CEOs, sleep 4 or 5 hours a night, or less, are extremely manipulative, competitive, and morally flexible.  In other words, they will do whatever needs to be done.  Everyone else is weak.  On the other hand, life can be pretty rough without breaking some rules, lying, cheating, stealing, etc, making others think you're better when you're not, etc.

I loved the critique on internships too.  The movie is funny throughout, in a darkly comedic way.  I love dark comedies though, so if you don't like dark comedy, you probably won't like the movie.  Also, if you have a very faithful outlook on life and those competitive people willing to work 100 hours a week and pay you 30 dollars a day while upholding you to the same standards, well you probably won't like the movie.  In their defense, I think these types of people deserve their success, it's just unfortunate that I have to live with them, because they're barely human.",1426204800,2,1649,4.967153284671533

6778808,4,B00OZJ2Y38,"Synopsis:  Louis Bloom (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) is a highly intelligent yet sociopathic loner in Los Angeles who steals to support himself since he lacks a ""real"" job.  After noticing a fire along the 110 Freeway, he pulls over to observe the carnage when a team of stringers - led by Joe Loder (Bill Paxton) - grabs the footage and brags to Bloom that they'll make money through selling the footage to the local news teams.  After Loder bluntly refuses Bloom's assistance, Bloom makes the investment to become a stringer himself - Hiring the homeless Rick Carey (Riz Ahmed) in addition to ill-obtaining a camera, a police scanner, and eventually upgrading both (in addition to his 1984 Toyota) as his business becomes more lucrative.  Bloom's main source of income comes from morning news director Nina Romina (Rene Russo), whom he looks to not only in an effort to elevate his career as a top stringer, but also as a sexual partner (in exchange, he promises to deliver her breaking news before any other stringer can do so - Ensuring that her lowly-rated news program can start increasing viewership and therefore ratings.)  Will Bloom manage to establish himself as the best stringer in Los Angeles, or will his competition or methodology (not to mention the law) eventually catch up to him?

The first thing this movie reminded me of was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Taxi-Driver/dp/B008Y6UOQW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Taxi Driver</a>, and that should be considered an absolute compliment.  The way Gyllenhaal portrayed Bloom was the perfect capture of a sociopath.  Though not much is done to expound upon his past, it's obvious that he's more likely to use his gifts for manipulation than he is for the betterment of others.  If there was any movie recently released that would justify having it's own prequel, it would be this one.

Was the movie violent?  Yes, but it was within the essence of the story as opposed to being blatantly gratuitous.  Perhaps the ending could've been a little less ""Hollywood-ish"" but it ultimately tied itself together rather well (same could be said for Russo's character, who was ultimately portrayed as under Bloom's spell without having a more supportive storyline to explain as to how it got to that point.)

A genuine American Psycho who progresses in a world of unscrupulous and filthy souls (the Media).  Obstacles come his way continually, but he deals with them the only ways he knows how.  Get ready to cringe.

This is a film about an anti-hero (to say the least), a product of our times.  It's an example of the creepy people getting us footage of tragedies.  It's a peek into the mindsets of news organizations which function like businesses and never have the populace's needs at heart.

As the news organization murders its viewers' hopes and psychological stability nightly, the Nightcrawler literally murders some of us to get that footage.  But that is not the worse thing he does, in my opinion.  The plausibility and probability of his actions reflect badly on real Nightcrawlers.  We knew they were scummy people, but this movie cements a deeper disgust for these people.

Get ready for a thrilling, twisted ride deep into the life of a Nightcrawler.

VERY good movie.",1426118400,,1370,4.955947136563877

Jake Gyllenhaal was excellent in portraying a sociopathic nightcrawler...it is hard to believe this is the same man who played such innocent and benign characters as Robert Graysmith and Donnie Darko.  Gyllenhaal, with his crazy eyes and greasy hair, perfectly nailed the creep role.

After watching this film it was obvious that Hollywood seems to hate these guys.  Notice how the camera repeatedly fixates on Gyllenhaal's character's stolen watch, which reminds the audience that he is nothing more than a sociopathic crook.

6778991,3,B00OZJ2Y38,"There are some excellent performances in this gritty flick about the freelancers who shoot the aftermath of car crashes and the taped-off crime scenes on the darkened streets of nighttime L.A.
The camera work is really very good as well, giving the audience a film noir look at a Los Angeles that is often only pictured as a glittery fantasy.
That said, my problem with this movie is that it failed to show me something new. Jake Gyllenhaal gives a wonderful performance as the anti-hero of the movie who is morally flexible enough to do just about anything to be successful but that doesn't make him any different from the men and women of Wall Street who nearly collapsed the U.S. economy a few years ago. They dress better on Wall Street than Gyllenhaal's character does in this movie but they, and he, lack an ethical base and any real empathy with the victims of their manipulations. Because they do it is all but impossible for them to 'do the right thing' when faced with a moral dilemma.
My point:This is not a story, in my opinion, that moves the narrative further; it's just shot in a different venue than those dozen or so Wall Street movies that have made the rounds in the last dozen years. Those Wall Street moves have already shown us that the world is dirty, dangerous and often violent; that many people will lie, cheat and steal to succeed; that they often manipulate the facts to make a point or get ahead.
Knowing that already, as a viewer I wanted a twist in this story, something that made it stand out.
If it was there, I didn't see it.
As I said, Gyllenhaal is excellent in this film and co-star Rene Russo gives a great performance in 'Nightcrawler' as a veteran of the 'crime-scene-exclusive' school of broadcast journalism.
But great performances and excellent camera work can't hide the fact that, for me, the movie lacked that one essential ingredient that would have made it a 5-star film: A fresh perspective.",1425686400,,1940,4.626086956521739
6778992,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"This movie was tremendously better than I expected.  Jake's performances, IMO, have always been ""ordinary"".  I rented ""Nightcrawler"" because it appeared to be the ""lesser evil"" among current new releases.  Boy, was I wrong!  It is gripping right off the bat and remains so till it's finished.  I stayed up 45 minutes past my usual bedtime just because I couldn't wait to see all of it.  Jake's role reminds me of one that Al Pacino would have been offered in his younger days, but Al could not carry the mail in it like Jake does.  This movie is strong in every aspect.  I need to write down the name of its director because that is a name to remember.",1425686400,,652,4.420168067226891

6779075,4,B00OZJ2Y38,Fascinating character study of a sociopath. Gyllenhaal produces the goods effortlessly as we watch him climb the bloody ladder to success in the seedy underbelly that is the LA news scene. We watch him pull one cold hearted stunt after another with such utter depravity that when we reach his ultimate calculated act  of an employee termination - we aren't surprised in spite of the horror.  Renee Russo is well cast as the soon to be terminated news room producer and the lunch date scene we see between the two shows how really odd this news camera man really is as we watch the creepy way he demands sex from his erstwhile boss.  He rationalizes it as job security for her. At the end there is no moral to this story other than that there's no rhyme or reason to crazy.,1425427200,2,772,4.460992907801418

Jake Gyllenhaal chews up the scenery, and steals every shot. His performance is over the top. Gaunt, sharp dark facial
features, plus those trademark eyes are worked to full effect here.
There are lapses in story logic, but I got so caught up in watching, that it didn't matter.

Dark, creepy, intense and mesmerizing, this movie is both an exploration of our national obsession with sensationalized news and fake-reality tv, and a grimly satirical look at our culture of amoral capitalism, which can turn any of us into a sociopath. Gyllenhaal was robbed at the Oscars -- he gives a brilliantly spooky performance, like a cross between a vampire and a python, a grinning, twitchy, menacing human time bomb. Rene Russo is excellent as well as his enabling tv news producer who's as conscience-less as he is. Tightly written and shot, with several scenes that are so tension-filled I almost forgot to breathe. Probably too dark and grim for everybody, but very, very good.",1424908800,3,752,5.024

6779326,4,B00OZJ2Y38,"I'm surprised that Mr. Jerry Lewis didn't get a screen credit as this movie follows the structure of one of his classic comedies almost exactly (Think Disorderly Orderly or the Errand Boy). An outsider who has trouble fitting in with society gets a job in a serious industry (Local TV News which is ripe for parody!) and through a series of mishaps becomes its greatest practitioner!

Then, in homage to Laurel and Hardy, just when you think you've found the biggest idiot, he gets an even more idiotic partner who works for $25 a night. And Rene Russo is the Margaret Dumont who doesn't seem to understand the madcap things going on around her.

Also appreciated the clip of Danny Kaye in Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. It is always nice when young filmmakers tip their hats to their inspirations. Jake Gyllenhaal's laugh at the clip warmed my heart with its genuine hearty laugh.

The car chase scene at the end is worthy of Buster Keaton! LA has never looked more beautiful!

Warning! Like all modern day movies, you have to look past cursing and blood to enjoy the comedy. I wish filmmakers didn't feel the need to ""work blue.""",1424822400,6,1143,4.6716417910447765

6779353,4,B00OZJ2Y38,"Louis Bloom is a small time crook without much of a conscience, looking for a way to advance in life. It isn't about money; it's about status, stability, about being proud of your work. Purely on accident, he stumbles across a veteran crew of nightcrawlers--freelance paparazzi-like cameramen who film violent incidents and sell it to news channels. Louis's interest is piqued. He has a knack for getting ""the shot,"" and it isn't long before he's manipulating scenes to make it look better and more dramatic. Manipulation leads to planned execution. Which leads to the dark madness you'll find in the city at night.

If NIGHTCRAWLER has a flaw, it's that it takes itself a tad too seriously. A sense of dread pervades the film; at times this is a good thing (it's incredibly creepy, almost--but not quite--a psychological horror film), but it makes things seem a little too ""important,"" almost didactic in spots. Especially with Rene Russo's character, a newswoman unafraid to sell her soul to get the best story (even if it isn't entirely true); the character is promising (and the performance is great), but at times she's almost a caricature.

Still, NIGHTCRAWLER has a lot to offer. A lot. Jake Gyllenhaal gives a riveting performance; he's great at playing the creep, even when he's portraying a good guy (check out PRISONERS). Louis is definitely not a good guy. Unsuspecting audiences may find themselves in uncomfortable territory very fast; I'd place NIGHTCRAWLER in similar territory as HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER, in that it's an exploration of the public's adulation of violent and incendiary news. It's solidly written and directed by Dan Gilroy; maybe a little indulgent in spots, and ultimately not as important as it perhaps wishes to be, but it's undeniably creepy and unforgiving.",1424649600,3,1806,5.057046979865772

6779384,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"Excellent movie.  Really holds your interest.  It's two hours long and you don't feel the time passing at all.  We watched it standard definition and were just fine with  the picture quality.  Jake's brilliant monologues about making a business plan and managing his news video business have all of the buzz words that you get in a typical MBA Strategic Management Course.  His monologues were so engaging, so apparently heartfelt that I couldn't help but chuckle as I listened.  Instead of providing his partner that long promised review and raise, Jake informs his associate that he should be glad that he has this unparalleled opportunity to ""get in on the ground floor"" of this unbelievable investment.  It's not a job, it's your career path, he tells his partner.  If you take all of the capitalistic ideology and take it to the extreme and omit all compassion, you get what Jake is inventing in the movie.",1424563200,2,911,4.825806451612904

And the WORST PART: a RELENTLESSLY ANNOYING performance by Gyllenhaal, pretending to be Norman Bates. He's in the film 95% of the time, and I wanted to slap him every minute. He is absolutely PAINFUL TO WATCH!!! If I had to endure one more eye bugging speech from his character, complete with tics and nervous laughter, I was gonna scream!! Three of us suffered through this SUPREMELY OVERRATED MESS, with me being the only one who managed to stay awake. The supporting cast doesn't help much either. Jake's character has a one dimensional side kick/employee that also grates on the nerves. And a heavily weathered looking Renee Russo is tossed in for filler and does some lousy emoting. Oh, and this film is also EXTREMELY PREDICTABLE too. You can see certain scenes and the ending coming from a mile away. AVOID THIS MESS of a movie!!",1424563200,,1098,4.845744680851064

It's all about the utterly sociopathic Lou Bloom. A pathetic loser (briefly) who 'Blooms' after encountering cowboy videographers racing to film gruesome accident and crime scenes to sell to the highest newsroom bidder, recognizing at once that this is the job for him. And Lou Bloom is brilliant at it. Originally, I felt that Rene Russo's character Nina was a lesser sociopath but I think I was wrong. Nina soon realizes who and what she's dealing with in Lou Bloom and she hates it. He degrades and uses her. Nina has an understanding of right and wrong, at least as far as she is concerned for herself. But to get what she wants she reluctantly ignores this and follows Lou's lead. Nina makes a clear choice to literally embrace evil. Lou has neither scruples nor a conscience, for him it's not choosing evil, it's who he is. Ultimately, both will do whatever it takes for the rush or thrill of the chase. Whatever It Takes.

The subject matter in this film is repellent. But the film itself is brilliantly done, brilliantly acted. Kudos to all involved.

Jake thrills, chills and creeps us out as Lou in Nightcrawler!  He was a just a guy who was at rock bottom, struggling to get by.  Many can relate to that, too many.  He has admirable traits, like persistence, persuasion, cool headed, logical, confident, driven, willing to 'go that extra mile.'  So what's not to like!?  Well, he's also a manipulative, disaster orchestrating sociopath with the devil's smile.

I held my breath as other characters annoyed him, thwarted his advances, bullied him and blackmailed him because you never knew if he'd snap at you to you face or make your death look like an accident.  The revengeful part in me liked how he dealt with certain people but at the same time, I feared for his assistant.

I would've preferred Lou to be more passionate and aggressive. Instead, he was robot like. I would've liked to see the intimacy between him and Nina but that was left to our imagination.  He's not even so smooth as to make the news lady desire him, which he could easily have done, having to resort to threats instead. I think I prefer him making threats actually.  I like it when the mask slips.

I did enjoy the ride but thinking back, to me, all the characters were unlikeable.  Lou's side kick was as painfully slow as the movie was tragic. Lou was an unbearable stone cold sociopath.  His competition was a douche bag.  The news lady was ruthless herself but sad too.  I liked the African American police woman at the end because she was on to him.  Someone needed to be on to him. lol.

It was a good thriller.  My favorite line went something like;
Lou: Will you have dinner with me?
News lady: No, I don't want to jeopardize our work relationship.
Lou: What if not going to dinner with me would jeopardize our work relationship?

I got a bit of a chill when he said that.  It was unnecessary.  He's good looking and a lady of her age would love to have a 'roll in the hay' with a young man. ;) You can gauge how re-watchable it is for yourself but I'll probably re-watch it when I feel like seeing Jake be evil again. lol",1424304000,,2073,4.428571428571429

Nothing that happens in this movie is formulaic, derivative, or anything I've seen before.  The movie stands out as an important statement about our times, and Gyllenhaal creates a character that is perfect for making that statement.  His work here is simply amazing.  Creepy, but amazing!

This movie deconstructs the internet, news media, twenty-somethings, concentration of wealth in society, and the ineptness of ""good"" people to deal with the forces created by these other things.  It is a brilliant statement about our times.

Also like any good art, the movie leaves connections, back stories, and the future up for speculation by the viewer.  No trite Hollywood story here.

This grim story with its creepy characters shines light directly on much of what's wrong in our world and, by doing that, suggests where we might focus our attention for improving the human condition.

Jake Gyllenhaal's disturbing performance as creepy Lou Bloom gave me more than a few shudders.  He definitely brought his A-game to the role.

I felt the film gave a scathing, behind-the-scenes review of the type of person that would be attracted to this line of work, and I wouldn't find it at all surprising if the story, as it's told in 'Nightcrawler', bordered on non-fiction -- in the most despicable sense.

In a society that has been mostly desensitized to the media's daily portrayal of the horrors in urban life, this grim look into the seedier side of TV ""journalism"" (if it can be called that at all) captivated me as only the most shocking imagery of televised crime reporting can.

The story is so close to reality  (paparazzi, manufactured crime stories that blast out on the 11 PM news to give us nightmares, shady reportage, the extents to which some people will go for money and fame, etc) that at first the story is painful to watch unfold, but the performances by every actor in the film are so credible and exact and memorable that the film deserves to be high on the list of awards.

When Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal in a brilliant performance), a driven man desperate for work, muscles into the world of L.A. crime journalism, he blurs the line between observer and participant to become the star of his own story. Aiding him in his effort is Nina (Rene Russo), a TV-news veteran and his `hired intern' Rick (Riz Ahmed, in a career making performance). Lou is a guy who's a thief and hustler. He wants to do something else only thing no one wants to give him a chance. One day he witnesses an accident and while the CHP helps the driver, some men (Bill Paxton) show up and record the whole thing. He learns that they intend to sell the footage to a TV news program. So Bloom decides to get into it. He starts small. Eventually the station where he sells his footage to, is impressed with him. Later he comes across a murder and gets there before the police do and records the dead bodies. But he also manages to get the killers on tape but doesn't give it. Instead he intends to wait till he can call the police and record them being arrested. But it doesn't exactly work out that way.

The cinematography by Robert Elswit, the musical score by James Newton Howard, and the brilliant direction by Gilroy coupled with the tremendous cast make this hard to swallow film a winner on every level. Grady Harp, February 15",1424044800,2,1824,4.4879518072289155

It was beautifully shot. The color palette was captivating while the story was not. The character was flat. Crazy and well executed, but flat. Most tend to take the stand point of ""well, he got crazier, and that's why it's good."" Let me lay out the same story in reverse, of a good person becoming more good and tell me how it sounds.

Timmy is a good person who doesn't have much. He buys a powerball ticket and doesn't win anything. Learning his odds, Timmy buys a scratch ticket. He wins $100 and buys a homeless person some socks and some food. With $10 from the winnings he buys two more scratch tickets. This time Timmy wins $5000. He fixes his neighbor's car that hasn't worked 8 months so they don't have to take the bus and can spend more time with there family. With $100 left, Timmy uses $20 from the winnings to buy 3 more scratchers. None of the tickets are winners. Instead of quitting while he's ahead, Timmy spends $60 on powerball tickets because the reward, $405,000,000, is worth the risk. He wins! Instead of disappearing off the face of the earth, Timmy gets a great stockbroker to invest his money so his money will make money. With a solid plan and great start, Timmy begins a non profit organization employing others who are in need and begins a charity to help underprivileged families. Through his charity he also creates scholarships. Timmy is still a good person and will forever remind himself ""you can't win the lottery if you never play."" The end.

Really good, right?

A good person becoming great or a bad person becoming the worst makes no difference.

No change equals no story, just a listing of events. This happened. Then this happened. Then this happened.

It can be argued that the revelation was solely meant for the audience, but in that case, they gave it away in the opening two scenes. To that end, watch the first two scenes and then mute the rest of the movie to enjoy some gorgeous visuals and see how big Jake Gyllenhaal's eyes get.

The movie'story - thanks to Dan Gilroy - has everything: suspense, character development, and dialogues.

Oh, that dialogues! Or rather, Lou's speeches. In Nightcrawler Lou confuses, inspires, lies, sets up with his bureaucratese speeches. And cinematography is perfect. LA's night streets look magnifying and creepy, full of beauty and menace.

It is remarkable to me that Gyllenhaal did not get an Oscar nomination for this. Forget the weight loss, the character he created, and his unwavering commitment to that character was awe inspiring.

This was one of those rare films where it seemed everyone involved wrote the script, and shared the exact same vision. And that ""vision"" was for an intense thriller that didn't let you go for a second. A dark, plodding, unpredictable, and engrossing ride with an incredibly twisted, but NOT simple, character (Gyllenhaal could have butchered the character the way most actors would - by giving us ""the crazy/bad guy"" on a silver platter; but not JG - his portrayal gave the character depth and believability).

6779642,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"How far would you go? Its a cliched phrase or theme used incessantly in almost every thriller ever created, and for good reason. Its an effective way to keep audiences intrigued, constantly guessing the actions and the consequences that follow.

In the case of Nightcrawler, the more appropriate term would be How low would you sink?.

Nightcrawler tells the story of Louis Bloom, as portrayed substantially by Jake Gyllenhaal, and his warped mindset to make something of himself; even if it gets a few people hurt.

From his genesis as a common thief to a slimy, parasitic, degenerate that gains numerous business footholds via the misery of others, his newfound obsession with crime journalism, and the suffocating tension that follows, escalates with every passing second.

Running parallel with Blooms level of passion is not only his egomaniacal personality and the calm, meek demeanor that hides it, but his ludicrously shady business decisions and his total lack of human dignity and empathy. That is, if he even had any to begin with.

However, all of this atmosphere and potential would be rendered useless were it not for Gyllenhaals fine-drawn acting prowess. His interpretation of Blooms characteristics gives off an arrogant, oppressive, and eerie ambiance that is nothing short of staggering and obscene.

But the disturbed nature of Bloom and his actions are nothing compared to the ambitious TV news director Nina (Rene Russo) and her cold, aggressive approach to air anything and everything that will garner a significant boost in ratings. Encouraging Bloom to give her more footage at a high price doesnt really help either.

One thing that isn't as subtle, though, is Nightcrawlers obvious homage (in a good way) to the 1976 classic film, Network. Initially conceived as a satirization of television broadcasting and the lengths one would go to come out on top, Network later became an unintentional future dramatization of modern broadcasting.

Unfortunately, Nightcrawler also emphasizes that theme all too well.

In the end, Nightcrawler not only succeeds as a great thriller, much less a great movie, but it has given birth to another unflinchingly realistic and memorable villain for the 21st century. An entity that represents one of the worst that humanity can offer, Louis Bloom is a prime example of how easily one can claw their way to fame and fortune.

6779662,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"The first thing that can be said about this film is intense. This is a film which is simply about a man, Louis, played by Gyllenhaal, who decides to get involved in independent filming of basically crimes and tragedies that happen at night in the city of LA and sells them to news stations. Gyllenhaal does an Oscar worthy performance as the main character, whom basically is a misanthropic Sociopath. Now when you're talking about an actor playing a character with such a character type, this can be unconvincing in so many ways. But quite frankly, his acting of Louis is some of; if not the best character acting I have seen this year. His portrayal of Louis literally makes your skin crawl as he pushes the edge, and then right over what can be considered moral sensibility for what should and should not be filmed, and does it in a way which over the course of the movie slowly sneaks up on you. In one since I hate his character, he is an absolute sociopathic scumbag, but at the same time I love his character because I cannot praise Gyllenhaal enough for his performance.
This movie made me feel like I needed to take a shower after watching it; it engrosses you in a way that you may find yourself feeling like you yourself have done something wrong just by watching what takes place. And this isn't because the movie is some slasher porn, but because what Louis shoots and goes through with by the end of the film, is so morally backwards, and you can see Gyllenhaal play a character to a T of someone who literally I would define as a sociopath, complete absence of the emotional responses that a normal person should have.
This movie is gritty, original, intense, and action packed. One that has huge re-watch value and should not be missed. If edge of your seat thrillers are your thing. You will do no better than this film. Absolutely amazing!",1423785600,2,1857,4.529761904761905

6779665,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"Jake Gyllenhaal has been an actor on my list of actors to look out for for quite some time now. Not only can he act, but I feel he chooses some of the more unique roles Hollywood has to offer. With movies like Donnie Darko, The Day After Tomorrow, Enemy, and even Prisoners, Jake Gyllenhaal takes an even more surprising turn in the movie Nightcrawler.

After trying to sale stolen copper wire, Louis Bloom encounters a cop which is where things begin to take an unfortunate turn. Later, Louis sees a few guys who are recording while the police are trying to pull people from a burning car. Seeing this as an opportunity for himself, Louis manages to get in store credit from a nearby pawn shop owner which is where Louis gets a camera of his own. And after acquiring his own shots from a recent homicide due to carjacking, Louis goes to Channel 6 news which is where he meets Nina the director of the news. And so begins Nightcrawler.

Jake Gyllenhaal (who lost 30 pounds in preparation for his role) gives Nightcrawler a shocking but almost sinister turn in his role as Louis Bloom. Louis is conniving and especially deceptive, so much to the point that his character almost makes you uncomfortable. He possesses an uncanny intelligence, and while you won't always be quite sure if he's somewhat sane or just plain psychotic, he will persuade you to do what he asks of you-by any means necessary, while later in the movie he explains exactly why he is the way he is. An amazing job by Jake Gyllenhaal. Also impressive here is Rene Russo in her role as Nina. Her character has a vulnerable side but she still has a firm presence in the movie. Bill Paxson stars here in a supporting role as Joe a fellow cameraman and does a nice job. Riz Ahmed plays Rick and does exceptionally well alongside Jake Gyllenhaal.

In terms of story, Nightcrawler manages to keep your attention in a very good way throughout its alloted screen time. Nightcrawler is even better with the detail in the crime scenes which is why I would definitely give credit to how well the movie is shot. I also like the interaction between the characters in Nightcrawler, and the unpredictability of the story which is also likable.

But even more so, Nightcrawler is a very good movie due to the all star cast (the highlight being Jake Gyllenhaal's GREAT performance), the pacing and detail of the script, and the fact that it never fails to keep your attention.

I am glad to see this movie nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, but I would most certainly have like to seen(and expected) Jake Gyllenhaal nominated for his performance in the movie. I did see a lot of movies last year and definitely consider Nightcrawler one of the better movies 2014 had to offer. All this being said I consider the movie Nightcrawler to be

A Very Good Experience

That is exactly what this movie is about. Jake plays a weird character....looking for a job...when he happens to stumble upon a job fit for him....filming human catastrophes....up close and personal for the evening news. His character not only likes the money from filming such encounters.....he likes the accolades as he finds himself rubbing elbows with Television news personalities. However, the movie does take a dark sinister turn....when this character begins to take himself much to seriously and his job much too seriously. You really get a weak stomach thinking about this guy doing it with Rene Russo....(Who still  looks good...has aged well...and hasn't ruined her looks with plastic surgery!).

6779667,4,B00OZJ2Y38,"I thought this was a pretty good flick. Other than the police in real life would most likely not tolerate such behavior. Gyllenhaal looked the part of a desperately ambitious individual. I read that he would work out 8 hours a day to achieve this look. He rarely blinks, which is a method acting trait he used in Donnie Darko. Bill Paxton, or Pullman is it haha, does a good job in his part however it did seem like maybe he owed the director for doing it. Not unlike Renne Russo, who is looking her age now, doing the film written and directed by her husband. Definitely recommend for someone who is looking for a fast paced dramatic ""actiony"" film.",1423699200,2,650,4.425
6779668,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"""Nightcrawler"" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: NIGHTCRAWLER is a thriller set in the nocturnal underbelly of contemporary Los Angeles. Lou Bloom is a driven young man desperate for work who discovers the high-speed world of L.A. crime journalism. Finding a group of freelance camera crews who film crashes, fires, murder and other mayhem, Lou muscles into the cut-throat, dangerous realm of nightcrawling - where each police siren wail equals a possible windfall and victims are converted into dollars and cents. Aided by Nina, a veteran of the blood-sport that is local TV news, Lou blurs the line between observer and participant to become the star of his own story.

The cast led by Jake Gyllenhaal (also produced) (impressive in a transformative and well-crafted performance as Lou Bloom) is brilliant. The directing & story & (Oscar-nominated) screenplay by Dan Gilroy is brilliant.

The music by James Newton Howard is brilliant. The cinematography by Robert Elswit is brilliant. The film editing by John Gilroy (brother of Dan) is brilliant. The casting by Mindy Marin is brilliant. The production design by Kevin Kavanaugh is brilliant. The art direction by Naaman Marshall is brilliant. The set decoration by Meg Everist, set dressings by Matthew Kern Atzenhoffer, Frank J. Camara, Paul McDuffee, Isidora Avila, Gregory Byrne, Penelope Franco Gilmore, Michael Luce & Darren Patnode is brilliant. The costume design by Amy Westcott is brilliant. The make-up design by Donald Mowat is brilliant. The special effects coordinated by Elia P. Popov & supervised by Joe Pancake is brilliant. The visual effects supervised by Connor Meechan & Massimiliano Pareschi is brilliant. The stunts coordinated by Mike Smith is brilliant.

This is a brilliant, well-crafted, well-made and entertaining movie that is interesting and intriguing. Jake Gyllenhaal gives one of his best performances, if not, his best performance of his career, so far, in an impressive, transformative, well-crafted performance as Lou Bloom. He is also supported by two well-acted supporting roles by Rene Russo (Dan Gilroy's real-life wife) (as Nina) & Riz Ahmed (as Rick). Dan Gilroy has made an impressive directorial debut and has written another well-crafted and well-written screenplay (which was the only Oscar nomination that the film deservedly received, although the film itself and its leading actor deserved Oscar nominations as well, too, on top of the other awards contention that it has received), as well, too. This is (or was) one of the best films of the 2014 fall season and also one of the best films of 2014, as well, too.",1423699200,2,2624,5.242857142857143

6779699,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"Jake Gyllenhaal plays one of cinema's greatest weirdos since Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver.  Lou Bloom is a self-improvement junkie who is chronically unemployed and who will resort to just about anything to survive - and thrive.  One night he stumbles upon the shadowy world of nightcrawling - essentially ambulance chasers with video cameras who sell their footage to local news stations.  It is a fascinating ecosystem of mutual dependence driven by economics.

Lou thrives in his new role as upstart media mogul.  He is scrappy, innovative, ambitious and driven.  Gyllenhaal is brilliant in this role.  The weirdest thing about him is his smile:  It's as if he spent countless hours practicing alone in front of a mirror because he found it useful in persuasion.  Everything about Gyllenhaal's character feels calculated.  And he possesses little capacity for empathy.  He manipulates people like chess pieces.  He was born for this world.

The movie deserves points for shining a light on a subculture and an industry (nightcrawling) that is both fascinating and riveting to witness.  And Jake Gyllenhaal deserves credit for delivering a performance that perhaps only he could have pulled off.  The movie also deserves points for not  asking the cliche question:  ""Is this ethical journalism?""  We've seen those scenes in other movies and nobody cares anyway.  The movie assumes, as we all suspect, that journalistic integrity has gone the way of the compact disc.  This is one of the most original and riveting movies that I have seen all year.",1423008000,3,1549,5.12

The movie is an action,  and a mystery, that turns into a manipulated dark plot to control the news. Jake Gyllenhaal is a crime reporter with an amazing ability to be at the story as it develops, which also leads into the consequences of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. The movie has a real amount of action that keeps the movie interesting and appearing like it could be based on a real story. Some scenes definitely seemed like a message about what not to do as an ethical reporter or journalist. The FIRST Amendment has some debatable scenes and some real examples of free speech in the United States in this movie. Nightcrawler is also like a reality television type of movie, which kind of keeps things more entertaining than about a serious legal debate about ethical reporting practices. It also resembles a live documentary about a street reporter chasing down news stories about violent criminals in Los Angeles. The plot is interesting, with some unpredictable news, and also has some after the news breaks kind of surprises. Overall Nightcrawler lives up to its name, and it is an excellent action/mystery.",1422921600,2,1305,4.904977375565611

6779702,4,B00OZJ2Y38,"""Nightcrawler"" is a film about the marginal types who come alive at night to earn their living off others' misery. No, they're not vampires. They are guys with police scanners and digital cameras who wait for reports of murder, fire, automobile accidents, or other human misfortune, and then rush to the scene, camera at the ready, to shoot lurid video and sell it to local network news programs for big bucks.

Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a petty thief whose attempts to find honest work have failed. Stopping by a freeway accident one night, he sees an independent video crew photographing the event, asks a few questions of the two-man team, and becomes convinced that this is the job for him. He obtains an inexpensive camera and takes on an ""intern,"" Rick (Riz Ahmed) to help on his late night quests. Bloom plays up the position and the career opportunities awaiting Rick. Rick agrees to assist at a low per-night dollar amount.

Bloom develops a relationship with Nina Romina (Rene Russo), the news director at the lowest-rated local news program in Los Angeles. She likes the often grisly footage he brings her and, always ratings-conscious,  is willing to pay well for it. Bloom's ability to deliver such footage coincides with the station's desperate need to attract a larger audience.

As Bloom improves his equipment and learns about better camera angles, he begins to choreograph crime scenes to his advantage. He'll move a body to get a better shot, and tail wanted criminals so they can be apprehended in a setting that would be more dramatic for television. We see that he is not merely ambitious. He just might be sociopathic. He is a loner who regards bodies as important ingredients for footage he can sell. He expresses little human concern for others' suffering, misfortune, and even death. But he doesn't cross the line until, instead of merely covering the news, he decides to create it.

In Bloom, writer/director Dan Gilroy has fashioned a central character reminiscent of Travis Bickle (""Taxi Driver"") and Rupert Pupkin (""King of Comedy""). All are obsessed in some disturbing way. With Bloom, it's bloody footage. He equates his worth as a person with the footage he takes. After a while, payment is not enough. He wants recognition, introductions to station personnel, and a relationship with Nina that goes beyond professional.

Mr. Gyllenhaal turns in a cold, distant performance as Bloom. We seldom see the character in the daytime, which is when he says he is in front of the computer learning about business plans, motivational techniques, and rising up the ladder of success. When Bloom speaks, he sounds like a self-help book, but coming from his mouth, you can see he believes completely what he is saying and takes everything literally. What is missing from his character is humanity.

Oh, he will smile, but it's the kind of smile that how-to books suggest for making useful business connections. That we first see him stealing metal fencing and expensive bicycles indicates his lack of a moral core. When he gets into the business of shooting crime scene footage, he is just as amoral, thinking only of how he can enhance the value of the footage he will attempt to sell.

Ms. Russo plays a tough businesswoman who finds herself in a difficult position. Nina's job security strengthens with each piece of grim footage that she airs, but when Bloom lays out what he'd like their relationship to be, she is caught between personal life and career, with Bloom successfully and creepily jockeying himself into both.

""Nightcrawler"" is aptly named. The movie focuses on a job that many people would regard not only as distasteful but exploitative of victims. Bloom makes his livelihood from these people. The greater the misfortune, the more TV-friendly it is, and the greater profit to be made.

Rated R for graphic violence and strong language, ""Nightcrawler"" takes the viewer to a world of the unglamorous, the pathetic, and the violent.

6779711,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"I sparingly heard things about this film when it first came out. It seemed okay. Gyllenhaal isn't my favorite actor, but he's been in a few things that I liked and I think he's better than average. I think this performance catapults him into a great actor. I liked his performance in End of Watch, but this is an absolutely great performance. He genuinely comes off as a psychopath and is played perfectly and I hope this role leads him to similar roles in the future.

If you don't know what this movie is about (and there might be minor spoilers ahead), it's about a guy that goes around stealing to get by. He steals whatever he can and sells things to pawn shops, scrap metal places, etc. until one day he sees a car crash on the highway, stops to look, and sees freelance cameramen video recording the accident and overhears how they are negotiating the footage with the local news channel. This piques his interest about becoming a freelance cameraman to make money instead of stealing things. Of course he steals a bike to get his camera equipment, then the movie really begins. Naturally, he stinks at first, and with his low budget equipment (compared to the other freelance cameramen) he gets bad footage at first. Eventually he gets better and is willing to go above and beyond what the other cameramen will do. This leads to him doing whatever it takes to get the best shot to sell to the news station. The station manager he negotiates prices with eventually gives into his demand of ""being intimate"" with him so she could have all of his exclusives instead of other channels, which he threatens to do if she doesn't give into his demands. Thankfully there were no sex scenes, as I think this would have taken away from the film. Lots of ""adult"" language though, so that's why it's rated R (and some violence).

I don't want to give away too much else. You must watch this movie. It seems like a dumb plot, but his acting is superb. It's a 2 hour film but it did not drag and honestly I could see this becoming a type of TV show, but I don't think that would interest Gylenlenhaal too much, and I don't see anyone else playing the part. A truly fantastic film I wouldn't mind watching again. I'm too skeptical of 99% of movies that come out because the trailers make them out to be great movies, but they eventually end up stinking.

6779712,4,B00OZJ2Y38,"Jake Gyllenhaal, very convincingly, plays a real creep in this movie who has no conscience or moral compass of any kind.  That oddly did not stop me from smirking several times right back at Jake and enjoying his unabashed, unapologetic portrayal of a true sociopath. (The character Lou maintains a creepy smile though out even when he is making veiled threats, manipulating and worse--pretty much all the time)

Lou is determined to achieve success by any means possible all the while outwardly trying to appear to be a rather harmless unassuming guy. The inappropriate constant grinning lets us know early in the movie this is no nice guy.  He is very arrogant, another marker of a sociopath and chooses an employee he know he can manipulate. He also bends Rene Russo to his will who plays an older, struggling to remain relavant producer of a local TV station.

I suppose this story is supposed to be taking a jab at photojournalism but I took it more as a character study about what a sociopath is willing to do to get what he wants. There were some holes to the story but I was able to overlook that due to the very strong performance by Gyllenhaal.

The movie is about a struggling thief that is trying to find a way to earn some cash, and one night stumbles upon a nightcrawler capturing video footage of an accident and realizes it might be a good way to earn money. The main character is Lou who is a highly intelligent lunatic, he has no moral compass and is willing to do whatever it takes to capture video footage and is willing to take advantage of anyone and everyone to get ahead. Now the movie itself has an interesting concept behind it, and I give the director and the studio credit for originality, but overall while watching this movie I didn't find it mind blowing like all the hype everyone has built up for it. I don't think it's a bad movie just not an amazing movie, it felt pretty average watching it, and at times dragged. I believe the movie could have been better by somehow drawing the viewer in to feel more empathetic for Lou's partner, and the ending of the movie, I'm not going to ruin it, but let's just say that I felt that it was very lacking. The movie just didn't seem to draw me in, after watching it, I didn't feel like it was one of those movies that I would want to watch again.

Gyllenhaal is amazing, and deserves an Oscar for this role.  It is like nothing I have seen him in before.  I read reviews before watching it and many compared his performance to De Niro in Taxi Driver.  It has that ""everyday psycho"" sort of feel to it, but it is very much the detached element that people seem to love.  As a movie it is entertaining and gripping.  I was worried there would be lulls that would overpower the ""action"" but Gyllenhaal's performance as Lou Bloom is so cold and calculatingly simple, that it actually works, and it instantly made me think of people in the industry that probably started the same way.  It is extremely believable.  Maybe it is just because we believe what we see or are told on TV, but the movie was extremely ""real"".

The relationships he develops with his employee and Russo's character are awesome!  Really open's up the character of Lou Bloom.

Jake Gylenhaal is excellent at two things: being handsome, and playing intense weirdos. Hes serving the latter in Nightcrawler, and its definitely one of his creepy best. This is the kind of movie that will make you feel so morally uncomfortable at what you see happening that youll need to take a shower. That being said, its amazing. Its the kind of movie that you keep thinking about for days afterwards. I can still kind of feel JGs giant eyes staring at me",1422144000,,600,4.588785046728972
6779723,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"If there's one thing that fiction, written and visual, has loved to display over the years, it's the idea of the quiet loner. Some are misunderstood prodigies, some are romantic yearning lovers, some are isolated because of society's prejudices, some are God's lonely souls, and some are the sociopathic bottom-feeders. Writer/Director Dan Gilroy's electrifying NIGHTCRAWLER, anchored by what is easily Jake Gyllenhaal's best performance to date, focuses on the latter option of quiet loner.

One of the first things that the audience sees Louis Bloom (Gyllenhaal) do is stealing chain link fence, and brutally beating a security guard and taking that guard's watch. A trophy of conquest, or another way of making money? Two things become clear about Bloom from then on; one is that he is driven, and the other is that he, despite his nice and polite demeanor, is a brutal bastard. During a nighttime drive around Los Angeles, he sees a car on fire with firefighters trying frantically to rescue the person still trapped inside. A van speeds up, and two cameramen speed out trying to get a good angle on the rescue attempt. Louis becomes transfixed on the cameramen. He approaches Joe (Bill Paxton), one of the cameramen after they finish shooting and asks if he could learn the business, but Joe isn't looking for any help right now. But his fascination with this business venture isn't hindered by Joe's refusal. He purchases a camcorder and police scanner (with the proceeds from a stolen racing bicycle) and begins his foray into the nightly world of death, fires, and destruction that help news stations get ratings. When he finally does get something worthwhile, he sells it to the lowest-rated news broadcast in L.A., run by Nina (the great Rene Russo). He then takes on a paid intern, former street hustler Rick (Riz Ahmed), and the two of them rise through the rank-and-file of the other ""nightcrawlers"". But Lou's obsession with becoming the best in the field, with being Nina's ""lover"", and holding Rick under his thumb all comes to a head with a murderous home invasion that culminates with a pulse-pounding high-speed chase that will change Lou's life forever.

Initially, when viewing the trailers for this film, I thought it would be an edgy satire of the ""If it bleeds, it leads"" mentality of network news, but that is just one of its parts. When NIGHTCRAWLER is satirical, it's the darkest sort. More than anything, NIGHTCRAWLER is a plunge into the Nietzscheian abyss of a sociopath who has armed himself with a wealth of knowledge from the internet, some self-starting business seminar doublespeak, and a camera to allow him to settle into what is his natural habitat. Lou is a denizen of the night; an almost gleefully amoral protagonist who will stop at literally nothing to get what he wants. Gyllenhaal is utterly fantastic as Lou. He obviously committed to this character emotionally as well as physically. He looks like a sleazy ghost with his greasy hair and gaunt frame. His eyes always look sunked, making his look and demeanor even creepier. This is not the Jake Gyllenhaal of LOVE AND OTHER DRUGS or even BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. When you look at Lou, you don't see Gyllenhaal, and that's an astounding feat. Russo is also excellent as Nina, a seemingly hard-nosed news producer who is gaining success yet losing her soul and self the more she deals with Lou. The real revelation here is Riz Ahmed as Rick, someone else caught in Lou's web of deceit and amorality but still remains the audience's proxy throughout. As one of the stars of the horrifically hilarious satire FOUR LIONS, he impressed, but here, he flat-out amazes.

Dan Gilroy displays an urgency to both his writing and directing that belies everything that he's done before. From his work writing some moderate to pretty terrible films such as the Pacino/McConaughey vehicle TWO FOR THE MONEY, Tarsem's THE FALL, Hugh Jackman's robot boxing REAL STEEL, as well as working with his brother Tony (of the BOURNE films and MICHAEL CLAYTON) on the sadly anticlimactic BOURNE LEGACY, and NIGHTCRAWLER marks his first foray into directing since the 1992 Emilio Estevez/Mick Jagger futuristic actioner FREEJACK (which also co-starred his wife Russo). Almost every filmmaker has one really good film in them, and this is, at least for now, certainly Gilroy's. The directing is stark, with a great sense of movement and creating suspense, and the writing is fluid, maintaining a terrific pace, some extremely bleak humor, and some meaty moments for almost every cast member. Another crew member deserving praise is editor John Gilroy who really helps piece this together.

While largely ignored by the major awards with only Gilroy getting an Oscar nod for Best Original Screenplay and Gyllenhaal getting a nomination for Best Actor at the Golden Globes, NIGHTCRAWLER remains one of the very best films of 2014 with what is possibly its best male lead performance as well.",1421884800,,4952,4.991525423728813

6779727,4,B00OZJ2Y38,"`'Nightcrawling"" is a term of art for paparazzi who nocturnally trawl the urban underbelly, shooting footage of mayhem for TV news (to be breathlessly shown as an exclusive, after the sanctimonious preliminaries warning ""viewer discretion is advised""). Jake Gyllenhaal (see: ""Donnie Darko"") co-produced and stars in this intriguing film as Lou Bloom, a cross between Travis Bickle, Rupert Pupkin and Carl Kolchak, surely selector's choice for Creep/Worst Employer of the Year.  To paraphrase Harold in 'The Boys in the Band', Lou doesn't have charm; he has counter-charm.

With no back story as such, Lou is clearly a sociopath, and rather naive, considering. Yet he triumphs through being bright, following his business plan, discarding middle class morality and exploiting anyone and everyone. The film does not pretend to focus on crime and criminals other than through the narrow lens of popular culture, and in this limited optic it succeeds. From small corruptions (moving fridge photos in a victim's kitchen), Lou moves up the greasy pole through major obstructions and perversions of justice, his success made believable by Gyllenhaal's terrific grinning, swivel-eyed-loon malefactor. Also note: Rene Russo, cast again as the `strong older woman', impressive as the TV exec. who realises the glass ceiling needs constant hammering, even if it means spending time with Mr. Wrong; an unrecognizable Bill Paxton as a cynical competitor and Riz Ahmed, playing Lou's sad-sap outworker wannabe.

It might strike one as easy to demonize the voyeurism of modern culture but it is there, it flourishes and in a land of free speech, debased mores, diminishing conventions and relativist ethics, who's to stop it?  As Lou Blooms rise and rise, that question becomes not only urgent but more important.",1421020800,20,1798,5.365248226950355
6779728,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Nightcrawler""

1. This darkly beautiful film is hard to categorize.

2. It's a character study of an... intense young man.

3. It's also a scathing critique of ratings-hungry news media.

4. And it's a midnight-black satire on the ""fight to accomplish your dreams"" concept.

5. Jake Gyllenhaal absolutely owns this film as Lou, an intense but aimless man who discovers he can make money by filming crime and accident scenes and then selling the footage to a news station. As the news station demands more graphic footage, Lou decides to step his game up, which leads to unpleasant consequences.

6. Some people are upset with the ending of the movie, but I thought it was well-played and consistent with the rest of the film.

7. The beauty (and terror) of Gyllenhaal's performance is that he never shows exactly what's going on inside Lou's head. Lou is a smooth, awkwardly friendly young man. But every now and then his mask slips, giving us a glimpse of what he's really like. And it's not friendly. Gyllenhaal rides this razor thin line brilliantly.

8.  The cinematography is gorgeous, showing nocturnal Los Angeles in a shiny darkness, reflecting the personality of Lou.

9.  From the unusual opening scene to the unconventional ending, ""Nightcrawler"" is dark drama with elements of a thriller and a crime film. This one will stay under your skin for awhile.",1420934400,3,1393,4.885106382978724

You would meet this guy and want to forget about him cause he's so strange, but in a movie, it's fun to watch someone like this. It works brilliantly and the movie is often a tense one, taking the viewer into the night world of camera men at accident scenes as they fight to get worthy footage to make a buck. Kind of morbid this really goes on, money being made off bloody footage & tragedies. A few scenes were repetitive with Rene Russo in the news room, but on a whole this is solid entertainment. I'd compare it to Falling Down as far as character development goes with the main lead. The movie will pop back in your head weeks later.",1420416000,2,853,4.2392638036809815

6779732,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"With Nightcrawler, Oscar season has officially kicked off! Jake Gyllenhaal is an actor whose career I've been closely following ever since the release of End of Watch in 2012, one of my favorite films of that year. Usually, I'm much more attentive to the writer/directors of films as opposed to the actors, but Gyllenhaal is someone whose talents I take an active interest in. With that, I'm excited to say that he may be at his very best in Nightcrawler.

He stars as Louis Bloom, a freelance video journalist who specializes in filming bloody crimes that take place in LA and sells them to a news station directed by Nina (Rene Russo). Bloom's business success is by far his top priority and he will literally do anything to get the footage he needs, even if that means tampering with crime scenes and unlawfully entering private residences. It's obvious by his actions and general lack of emotion that Bloom is a sociopath, or something close to it, which makes him a very interesting kind of anti-hero to spend a couple hours with. The audience roots for him simply because he is the most fleshed out character in the film, but it seems Dan Gilroy's main objective is to make the audience hate Bloom by the time the credits roll. Yes, he's socially stunted, and many of his exchanges with Nina and his assistant are quite awkward, but therein lies the surprising humor of Nightcrawler. Bloom can make you laugh, which goes a long way in keeping him within the realm of audience association.

Gyllenhaal is truly brilliant as Bloom, and not just because of his weight loss, hair, and haunting eyes. He plays a sociopath like a champ, and doesn't deprive the character of a personality like many actors may. Jake, with Nightcrawler, Enemy, Prisoners, and End of Watch as his latest movies, is on a hot streak that will hopefully continue for years to come. Rene Russo, who just happens to be the director's wife, is also the best I've ever seen her. Her strange chemistry with Gyllenhaal is one of my very favorite parts of Nightcrawler. Riz Ahmed and Bill Paxton also give memorable turns as Bloom's assistant and competitor, respectively.

This is Dan Gilroy's directorial debut and he impresses with very good looking visuals, dark and grainy, that are reminiscent of a 70's crime drama. Gilroy had the privilege of working with cinematographer Robert Elswit, who is PTA's frequent collaborator as well as a DP for a couple films directed by Dan's older brother, Tony. The film was also edited by Dan's other brother, John, so I guess that he got quite a bit of help from his family and their connections. Nightcrawler is an excellent, tense piece of filmmaking, but it does have a few faults that keep it from being a straight-up classic. The score simply does not fit the movie. The atmosphere of the film begs for a soundtrack similar to Drive, something droning and meditative to fit the material. Instead, we get of mixed bag of distorted guitar, and what sounds like songs by Thomas and Randy Newman. I'm actually upset that Gilroy didn't capitalize on the amazing potential of a somewhat ambient score. The other flaw is the very ending. Up until the very last scene, Nightcrawler is edge-of-your-seat intensity. Then they tacked on a scene at the end that just feels out of place and unnecessary. If that one scene was dropped, and the music was changed, I'd consider giving  Nightcrawler a perfect score.

Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) makes ends meet by stealing, but when he encounters some freelance videographers at a late-night car accident, he sees that becoming a nightcrawler who provides footage of crime scenes and accidents to local news programs might be the right line of work for a man with no scruples.

A key scene at the beginning of the movie shows a security guard discovering Lou as he prepares to steal some copper wiring.  Lou attacks the guard and we later see the stolen materials in his car, but we are never privy to what happened to the guard.  Did Lou just knock him out, or did he kill him?  In other words, we know that Lou is an empty human being with no empathy for others, but just how far can he go?  This question hangs over the film as we watch him begin his new career in show business.  Before long, he is becoming a distraction to first responders and even rearranging an accident scene when he finds that he is the first to arrive.  But thats only the beginning  This is a smart, perceptive film that obviously comments on the media, but also makes points about how pitiless and cruel the drive to better ones position can be when it is unleavened with compassion and simple human decency.  Gyllenhaal should be remembered at Oscar time.",1419120000,5,1309,4.508474576271187
6779734,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"Jake Gyllenhaal absolutely owns Nightcrawler, delivering the kind of electrifying, tour-de-force performance that, if you're anything like me, you probably never imagined him capable of.  It's so overpowering in fact that it threatens to overwhelm the rest of the movie, and for awhile anyway, it does just that.  Fortunately, the movie is not only conducive to this, it relies on it to keep the audience hooked, allowing the plot to gradually build to a rolling boil.  And this is no small feat as the plot initially evokes memories of those preachy Ace in the Hole knockoffs that began sprouting up in the 90s and early noughties (think Natural Born Killers, 15 Minutes and the like), most of which were more interested in sermonizing against the evils of media sensationalism than they were in entertaining.  Say what you will about Nightcrawler, it's nothing if not entertaining.  Lou Bloom (Gyllenhaal) is introduced as a petty thief before quickly graduating to a violent, petty thief, uncommonly smart, driven and incredibly creepy.  Bouncing around from one odd job to another, he's the sort of self-taught, anti-social underachiever who exhibits many of the traits of a serial killer, and the movie plays on this tension, putting the audience off-balance by the character's murky motives and sheer unpredictability.  Eventually stumbling upon a camera crew filming the scene of a highway accident, Lou steals/barters himself a camcorder and sets about worming his way into the world of local TV news, shooting the most grisly crime scene footage he can find.  Beginning as a passing self-interest, this evolves into an all-out obsession as he begins to direct crime scenes, at one point even going so far as to stage the placement of a dead body for dramatic effect.  So with the help of an equally ruthless news director (Rene Russo), Lou barrels headlong through one ethical boundary after another.  Eventually, he takes on a partner, who becomes a sort of surrogate conscience, but this relationship, like all others in Lou's life, resembles a power struggle more than a typical friendship.  This sets the board for what becomes a rapid escalation of stakes as Lou finds himself beating the police to the scene of a triple homicide.  At this point the plot finally catches up with the performance, drawing an almost unbearable sense of unease from the lingering question of, how far will he go?  This perpetual sense of limbo hangs over the last half hour of the movie, applying a vice-like grip through to the heart-stopping climax, which is at once both tragic and satisfying.  And so, leaving the theater I remember being struck by the impression that I'd just seen an instant classic, a movie that could one day stand alongside Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy or anything by Patricia Highsmith as an example of genre perfection.  Perhaps most amazing about all this is the fact that it was directed by a first-time filmmaker (Dan Gilroy) with a remarkably underwhelming filmography (his previous credits include the boxing robot movie Real Steel and the Matt Damon-less Bourne Legacy).  Not only has he drawn what is possibly the best performance of the year, but he's harnessed it in a way that even seasoned filmmakers struggle to do.  All this and I haven't even mentioned Robert Elswit's striking, big screen-friendly photography, which allows the rest of the movie room to breath.  Basically, it's a perfect marriage of a riveting story, outstanding performance and assured direction that makes this one of the best movies I've seen all year.",1419033600,3,3565,5.023769100169779

6779736,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.

I stopped watching the local 10 or 11 PM (depends on your time zone) decades ago.  I just got tired of watching the murder and mayhem that dominate the broadcasts.  Those stories may be important, but I prefer to just acknowledge them in the newspaper without the sensationalism.  If this film has any accuracy, little has changed.

Jake Gyllenhaal gives a performance that might gather some Oscar interest as Louis Bloom, a physically lean sociopath looking to make it rich `by any means necessary'.  He makes ends meet by stealing copper wire and selling it at a discount to those in need.  One night he comes upon a shooting and takes a few pictures with his smartphone.  At the scene he runs into a photographer played by Bill Paxton.  He is what the industry calls a ""stringer,"" a self-employed video photographer who sells the film to television stations.

Louis if nothing else, is a determined guy.  Not likeable, but aggressive and focused.  He takes his pictures to a local station whose news director, Nina Romina (Rene Russo) has late night responsibility.  She pays Louis a couple hundred dollars and a career is launched.  Louis buys a video camera and a police scanner and hires Marcus (James Huang), a young homeless man to assist him with directions as Louis races to various bloody and gory events around L. A.  Nina continues to buy the content.

At one point Louis and Marcus arrive at a scene in a wealthy neighborhood long before the police arrive.  He records men running out of the mansion, getting in their SUV and racing away.  Louis goes inside the house to discover 3 bloodied victims and records it all.  Nina, nearly as despicable as Louis, buys the video but only after a lengthy negotiation with Louis which includes veiled sexual favors.

Directed (""The Bourne Legacy"") and written by Dan Gilroy (and Russo's husband), the film is creepy in a creepy way.  Obviously meant to skewer the local news - at least in big cities - ""Nightcrawler"" would seem to be a perfect title.  The film includes one of the most effective car chase sequences that I can remember.  It is beautifully shot using what appears to be a variety of cameras and styles.  There is a memorable score by Pete Anthony and Sven Faulconer.  And Gyllenhaal gives one of his best performances.  Highly recommended.",1418774400,,2354,4.776674937965261
6779737,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"Wow! You will not find Jake Gyllenhaal in a more transforming role. His acting in this role is totally believable and the role is way beyond anything he has done to date.

The scramble for ratings and how distorting the news this causes. I can recommend seeing this movie. I have seen it only recently in the theater.",1418601600,2,454,4.6875

Dark, creepy, and on the verge of becoming a sociopath, Lou wants to make it big and enjoy the American dream. His only problem is that he wasn't born with the social framework to make that dream possible in the traditional way. Instead, he embraces criminal behavior to rise above the competition in the gritty surreal world of freelance videography.

Honestly, I can say this about only a handful of films: YOU have NEVER SEEN anything like NIGHTCRAWLER.

6779739,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"Before I saw Dan Gilroy's ""Nightcrawler,"" I had thought ""Gone Girl"" would be the scariest portrait of a sociopath I would see this year. But ""Nightcrawler"" at very least is a match for ""Gone Girl."" Jake Gyllemhaal plays a nocturnal thief and scavenger in modern-day Los Angeles who comes across a freelance photographer shooting videotape of a horrific traffic accident and decides he should get in on that action himself. Soon he obtains a camera (no fair saying how) and goes on the prowl for whatever car crashes, fires and murder scenes he can find. Nina Romina (Rene Russo), the TV-station news manager to whom he sells his videos, is appalled by Lou--Saddam Hussein would be appalled by Lou--but also fascinated. Nina senses in Lou the same sort of hunger she had when she was a rookie reporter. And besides, she desperately needs the videos Lou provides to boost the station's sagging ratings.

""Nightcrawler"" is a mesmerizing, pitch-dark thriller. Many critics have described it as a bitter satire of 24-hour news operations and their never-ending need for sensational stories, and indeed it is that. But, even further, it is one of the most searing condemnations ever of the American way of doing business. Lou Bloom has a commodity to sell, and he can provide it faster than anyone else. If a few people, or a few dozen people, have to die for him to provide it, it's fine with him, and also with his customers. ""Nightcrawler"" is one of the scariest portraits of a sociopath--and of the sociopathy that lurks just underneath the surface of our world-- I've ever seen.",1418256000,4,1577,4.840740740740741

I liked this movie tremendously. It dealt with a man who was highly intelligent and also driven to succeed in his chosen career. While at the beginning of his career he is shown to be a stumbling, bumbling klutz with his camera. Along the way he becomes erudite and astute in dealing with his friends and enemies. He even becomes ruthless in dealing with those who would thwart him.

I liked this movie because I identified with the protagonist. I too am an amateur videographer and I too have come into conflict with the men in blue. While I abhor their attitudes and their profession as a whole, the movie showcases their true sides with aplomb. I was pleasantly surprised to see the way the film ended.

Buy this on DVD when it comes out. I know I will.

6779741,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"Hollywood has always had a complicated relationship with the news media, and in particular freelance photographers. Studios and celebrities need them, they use them, but they also absolutely f***ing hate them. They don't stop filming when you scream 'CUT!' They get pushy and they don't believe that 'private moments' exist for movie stars or rock bands or athletes. There's no doubt that they're morally objectionable, in a way that I could never even pretend to get indignant about with a straight face. WTF do I care about George Clooney's privacy? It makes his fairly comfortable existence less so, at times, but treating it like a social concern which needs to be addressed is laughable. Should it rate higher than homelessness? As far as 'problems that don't affect me personally, but still demand a furrowed brow' are concerned, the paparazzi don't come close to making the list. 'Nightcrawler' is a brilliant film, and it takes the disgust that most stars feel for the paparazzi and extends its targeting range to include the freelance videographers who exploit not just the most painful 'perp-walk'-type moments of the rich and famous, but the everyday tragedies borne of cars and guns. It makes the viewer feel what it might be like to see their loved-one's bloody corpse on the 11 O'clock News. It also cleverly 'plays up the racism angle', as an LA news producer might say; white victims in affluent neighborhoods make the cut, while African-American or Hispanic victims do not. Is that still true? It might be, and I have to confess, when I finished watching 'Nightcrawler', I think I believed it. This fictional film feels more true than 99% of the scripts claiming to be 'based on a true story'.

'Nightcrawler' is Hollywood hatemail of the highest order, fulfilling a function similar to Brett Easton Ellis's 'American Psycho' -- which was an over-the-top satire of Wall Street and the faceless, manicured savages in bespoke suits who ruled New York in the mid-80's. This too, is glittering gold-plated propaganda, and it also works as excellent film-making. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Lou Bloom, perhaps the most terrifying anti-hero since Christian Bale's dead-on portrayal of Patrick Bateman. Gyllenhaal manages to short-circuit and re-direct his natural charisma, mastering the manufactured smile and dead-eyed stare of a psychopathic con-man, addicted to Weegee-style snuff-shot death art; he is one of the most unforgettable movie monsters I've seen in years. Spouting business-school basics and clichd self-help mantras with the kind of conviction that only a lunatic or extremely gifted liar could pull off, he takes insane risks to beat the competition to whatever blood-spattered horror-show advertises itself on the police scanner. Then he beats the cops to the scene, and whatever he finds is just raw material, to be manipulated and edited by the auteur. Rene Russo co-stars, providing an excellent performance as the soul-less news producer who encourages Bloom's predatory exploits; Riz Ahmed plays the weak-willed assistant, whose moral compass loses north in the presence of his boss's magnetic personality, his fearlessness, ambition and unwavering self-confidence.

This is writer Dan Gilroy's first directorial effort, and with 'Nightcrawler' he lives up to the stellar accomplishments of a very talented family. His mother was an artist and writer; his father, Frank D. Gilroy, was a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright; and Tony Gilroy, who was nominated for Academy Awards as the writer and director of the acclaimed 'Michael Clayton', is his older brother. There's something to be said for sibling rivalry and living in the shadow of genius, I guess, if 'Nightcrawler' is any indication. Tony is one of the film's producers, and a third brother -- John Gilroy -- offered up his services as editor, his chosen profession. Editors are the unsung heroes of any successful film, and Brother No. 3 does the family proud.

Gilroy has created a thriller that is more concerned with the way other characters react to the anti-hero's remorseless, shark-like personality than trying to explain the enigma that is Lou Bloom. When we first meet him, he's a violent thief, and there are no explanations given for his a-moral, obsessively business-minded world-view. He remains as much of a sub-zero cypher as Anton Chigurh, but without the epic and near-elemental menace at his command. There is no pretense of character development or growth; Bloom is still a predator who exists in his own moral vacuum, driven by wants and needs, limited only by what he can and can't get away with. If Bloom represents freelance journalism in America, it's not a subtle commentary, but it might be apt. Should we all be horrified by the 'if it bleeds it leads' sensationalism and callousness of TV journalism? Sure, why not. I'll add it to the 500-page Atrocity Index I cry myself to sleep with every night. But 'Nightcrawler' is a great film, whether you view it as high-test propaganda or a horror-movie featuring the monster that celebrities see in their worst nightmares. This is unique, fascinating stuff, and a future classic.",1418083200,132,5139,5.174278846153846

6779744,4,B00OZJ2Y38,"'Nightcrawler', while nothing related to the X-Men character, is full of suspense, strong performances, and surprising insight about the state of news media and one man's pursuit for personal success. While it is not all that modern as it doesn't delve on blogging or vlogging, for instance, it does delve into the concept of 'citizen journalism' where people are responsible for bringing out the news they see fit before the news stations can. very strongly and almost seems like it is mocking it or promoting it.

Jake Gyllenhaal (Louis Bloom) plays as an independent TV journalist who uncovers deaths and bizarre happenings in Los Angeles pretty much as a get-rich-quick scheme after being a crazy beggar once. He's the kind of person who would likely con you into thinking he's genuine or rude enough to where you want to bite his ear off.

Without giving too much away, Gyllenhaal's performance is that of a deluded, lonely, know-it-all overachiever who looks to exploit the TV journalism business for his own gains. He will not break the law while uncovering grisly footage but there are many instances were his journalism crosses the line between dangerous and deadly.

Aside from Gyllenhaal, Rene Russo, an actress who hasn't been in the business since the 1990s, shines with a Sigourney Weaver-esque demeanour in her character as the news director who watches and sends cheques to Bloom's footage. And as well, Riz Ahmed does his first American film with confidence as he plays an impoverished guy working under Bloom's nighttime news footage runs.

More importantly, the film's script alone is something to marvel at in modern times. Not only does media criticism or insight intrigue me but the way in which the self-aware Bloom character knows so much about the industry and the work culture baffles me in glee. The cinematography is sharp and moody with no faults. The atmosphere capturing the seedy life of nighttime L.A. is suspenseful and grim and the scenes involving Bloom gets into confrontations with law enforcement are teeth-grinding. The soundtrack/score is tense and very much similar to what was done on 'Falling Down' (1993) which was also set in L.A., had a dark, misanthropic tone to it, and the same composer behind the two scores, James Newton Howard. I am also very proud to announce that it stamps its claim to originality with a wickedly good heart as it's not based on a novel.

Finally, while not as important unless you're a film boffin, it pretty much felt like you were watching 'Network' mixed with a wide sprinkling of 'Taxi Driver'. The media news satire is just the one thing that's not only appealing but looking into the life of a mysterious loner just hustling for money is too.

On the negative aspects, the film doesn't have many problems but the ending alone is a bit safe. Louis Bloom is shown to be delusional and power-hungry but he never really pays for his actions too much here.

'Nightcrawler' is a force to beckon with. It's full of surprises, twisted insight and humour into media itself, extreme self-awareness, and suspense that even 'Gone Girl' and definitely not 'The Rover' and 'Purge: Anarchy' at times alone couldn't rival. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance is the finest of the year and you'll begging yourself to want to go great lengths to make quick ""bucks"" while risking your sanity on the job and your stance with the police.",1417824000,4,3390,4.916083916083916

6779748,4,B00OZJ2Y38,"Acclaimed director Dan Gilroy (The Bourne Legacy and The Fall) sets up an endlessly fascinating commentary on the level of sensationalism that has hit the media and the length of perversity, and the ease with which some may individuals may abandon any sense of morality within them he or she may go through to achieve a moment in the spotlight with his terrific new thriller, NightCrawler. The commentary on this subject is beautifully done from both the perspective of the man, Lou Bloom, who finds himself filming increasingly graphic scenes for a local news program and from the perspective of the anchors who are desperate to keep their audience clinging to the television with the real life scenes of horror and atrocity Bloom captures. What makes this stinging social sentiment all the more potent is that the film is dominated by realistic and believable characters spouting authentic dialogue throughout and, despite the occasional bout of dark humor which is used marginally and wisely enough that it only highlights the motion picture's grim view of its subject matter, and this cinematic work lingers in the psyche because of how genuine every aspect of what is on screen appears to be. We are haunted and continually fascinated by the personalities which populate Gilroy's film and this makes Bloom's gradual descent into madness all the more unnerving, engaging and undeniably plausible.

  Jake Gyllenhaal is perfect with every facet of the robotic mannerisms, endless discourses on the minute ins and outs of every conversation that comes into his path and gradually maniacal performance. It may not be as quietly explosive as last year's masterful work of cinematic art, Prisoners, but it is multi- layered, merciless in the brilliant way he triumphs over all the quirks which dominate Bloom's mannerisms and there is a wavelength Gyllenhaal is tapping into with his portrayal that is clearly reminiscent of Robert DeNiro in Scorsese's timeless work: Taxi Driver. He is a pitch-perfect choice for this role as is Rene Russo's role as Nina Romina, the head of the news department which aids Bloom's obsession with nightcrawling, Bill Paxton as Joe Loder, an expert in Bloom's profession who taunts and inevitably aids Bloom in developing his skills in recording tragedies for the news programs and Riz Ahmed,as Rick, is incredible as Gyllenhaal's assistant.

  Gilroy's thriller slowly reveals itself and where it is going with a sly confidence that is an example of sheer craftsmanship on Gilroy and his cast's behalf. This is complimented by the dark and sleek cinematography which perfectly captures the spirit of those who are on screen and the atmosphere of the cinematic duration as a whole but it is in the pacing, the authenticity on display (not a moment of this film's 118 minute duration feels false) and in the way it successfully delivers a genuinely gripping and original tale (which in itself makes this motion picture recommendation worthy) where Nightcrawler finds its footing and rises above the cinematic competition this year.

  Sure the issues of the dark underbelly of the media and the human hunger for the spotlight have been well-harped upon since the inception of social conscious into mainstream cinema but rarely has it been done in such an entertaining fashion and with such a delicate craftsman's hand. Gilroy displays a vivid attention to detail, a passion to speak of the maniacal capabilities that could be writhing within any of us and brought to the surface when unique circumstances prevent themselves and we can feel his desire to speak and tell a gripping narrative in the beating heart of every frame.  This is proof that no subject has ever been exhausted as long as there is a new angle to peer at it through and with the dark world of nightcrawling Gilroy has found a tremendous focus to put these tried and true subjects back in a manner that is mercilessly gripping for its audience.

  What also makes this work is that the central character is never portrayed as a straight out maniac. We've all encountered these personalities somewhere at some time in our existence and therefore, whether we mention it or not, we relate. That makes Gylenhaal's increasingly irrational behavior (especially when the picture settles down and focuses on a specific life-changing event in its second half which not only ups the ante of the intensity on screen but amplifies our interest tremendously) and his actions have a strange clarity that we may not have as bizarre as if it were another situation altogether.

  This is a smart move, as it draws us deeper into Gyllenhaal's world far more as the scenes wind down to its impeccably haunting climax where Gilroy drives home every statement about moral corruption in us and in broadcasting which he presented beforehand, and Nightcrawler is just as intelligent as a motion picture as a whole. Gilroy has crafted a masterpiece that could have easily turned into another conventional cinematic display of violence with any wrong turn in the script or false action from its characters but, luckily, it never breaks out of the art imitating life feel of the theatrical production. Though it often walks the line of what is acceptable and unacceptable in what given situation it gets us to examine ourselves and easily we glide into the narrative and ask ourselves how we would react in specific circumstances and that is another reason Nightcrawler works so well.

  Movies that make us think are rare. Those that make us contemplate ourselves, those around us and who we are and amuse, spellbind and bring social commentary to life on screen is a nearly extinct species. That makes Nighcrawler's ambition all the more admirable and presents even more reason to support these silver screen gems by putting it at the top of your must-see list.",1417564800,4,5836,5.016546018614271

The film is shot really dark and the subject matter is just as dark.",1530662400,,249,4.928571428571429

8685727,5,B00OZJ2Y38,"Jake is fantastic!  Great suspense thriller! I've been hanging onto this bucket list film and I'm glad I took a couple of hours out of my afternoon to watch it. I've always been a Jake Gyllenhaal fan and this one shows him in a totally new light...a jobless genius who stumbles into and masters the art of being a freelance videographer for television news. But he doesn't settle for the mundane. He goes the extra mile and breaks all of the rules. Rene Russo and Riz Ahmed join him on this chilling ride. Full of twists, suspense and nail-bting action. All 5 stars.",1529452800,,566,4.495145631067961
