8045614,4,B000780B5Y,The movie cast of actors brought back memories of the Old Days. The location was great. I enjoyed it very much.,1396569600,,111,4.333333333333333
8045615,5,B000780B5Y,"The theme song  'Lisbon Antgua'  by Nelson Riddle was outstanding.
And the story lines were humorous at times. The role played by
Claude Raines, as usual, was outstanding.",1386547200,,171,5.071428571428571
8045616,4,B000780B5Y,"An American smuggler (Ray Milland, who also directed) in Portugal is hired by a professional thief (Claude Rains), who in turn is being paid by a wealthy American woman (Maureen O'Hara) who has a trick or two up her sleeve, to smuggle the woman's elderly husband (Percy Marmont) out from behind the Iron Curtain. This amiable romantic thriller is reminiscent of those Warners exotic international capers that combined romance and action, think CASABLANCA or TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT but, of course, not as good. Still, it's a serviceable late show entry if you don't have high expectations. Rains, in particular, brings an urbane quality to his charming sadist (he kills birds with his tennis racket and feeds them to his cat). The handsome Portugal locations are shot by Jack Marta (CAT BALLOU) though, unfortunately, the transfer I saw was compromised by the wide screen (2.35 aspect ratio) cut down to 1.85. The score by Nelson Riddle incorporates his top 40 hit Lisbon Antigua as part of the underscore. With Yvonne Furneaux (LA DOLCE VITA), Francis Lederer and Jay Novello.

The DVD from Art House Media in Spain is a colorful and vivid transfer but as noted above, the film's original wide screen ratio (2.35) has been cut down to 1.85 which compromises the cinematography. It is not anamorphic.",1328227200,2,1297,4.922374429223744
8045617,3,B000780B5Y,Bought this movie because I'm a big O'HARA fan. Didn't care for it as MAUREEN was in a thankless role.,1261699200,2,102,4.15
