8130124,1,B000GAKJTQ,I too ordered Volume 6 and received Volume 4. That seems to be endemic with this order. The task at hand is how does one get volume 6?,1198627200,,134,3.8214285714285716
8130125,1,B000GAKJTQ,The other reviewer is correct. The packaging and CD sticker says volume six but it is actually four. I sent Caiman an email and never heard back. This product should be removed until the problem is fixed.,1187913600,,204,4.54054054054054
8130126,1,B000GAKJTQ,"I have tried two different sources to obtain this DVD.  While the case and disk are labeled ""Kata 6,"" the actual material is Kata 4.  Be warned.

The quality of the series is OK -- although instruction is in spoken Japanese, without subtitling.",1171497600,,244,4.627906976744186
