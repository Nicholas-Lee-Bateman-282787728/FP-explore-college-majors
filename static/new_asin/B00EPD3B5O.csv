5932455,5,B00EPD3B5O,Great film for those who want to learn all about Justin Timeberlake's rise to stardom. Man that guy has swag!,1387238400,,109,4.5
5932456,2,B00EPD3B5O,"I'm a huge JT fan, but this a biography that doesn't play a single song or movie clip, I'm guessing they don't actually even have the rights to any of his work. This bio is basically 3-4 writers making comments about his career, a monotone narrator and the same handful of clips from red carpet events, along with a few tabloid photos. The only actual video of JT speaking looks to be from a speech he made at an award show. I enjoyed seeing his life from start to finish and picked up some new info but overall was inspired to share my reflections in the form of a 2-star review.",1409529600,2,580,4.2342342342342345
5932457,1,B00EPD3B5O,If you are a huge fan of JT - you probably already know a lot of the information in this video.  And you will probably enjoy seeing all the clips of him.  Personally this was not for me.  I was bored and this was not what I wanted to watch.  I did not chose wisely this time.,1409097600,,275,3.7719298245614037

5932463,1,B00EPD3B5O,"This movie is pretty boring and FULL of inaccuracies. I've been a fan since *NSYNC so I didn't learn anything I already didn't know. Right in the beginning, they show the wrong person as JC Chasez. A simple internet search would clear up a lot of the problems in this movie. The commentators in this also seem to not like pop music and think it's a joke. Don't buy this. If you happen to have Amazon Prime, watch it for free but its really not worth the time.",1388275200,6,459,4.2272727272727275
5932464,3,B00EPD3B5O,"This ""movie"" is simply a collection of video clips without any meaningful dialogue.  It provided a nice summary of his career but the film is overpriced.",1387497600,,153,4.884615384615385
5932465,5,B00EPD3B5O,"Learned a lot about Justin Timberlake from this film.  I knew he was talented but I didn't realize how smart a business man he is.  With all his talent and business sense, it's no wonder he has climbed so fast in popularity and album sales.",1387238400,,240,4.311111111111111
