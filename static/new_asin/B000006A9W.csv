7904199,4,B000006A9W,"""The Turn On""  is based on the Italian language graphic novel ""CLICK"". Illustrated by famed Italian erotic artist and writer Milo Manara. An adult comic released in the US during the mid 80's by Catalan Communications. Milo Manara's stories and art have been featured in Playboy as well as many other prominent international publications. During the credit sequence of this film  they use some of the comic panels as graphics.

Needless to say the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Click-A-Woman-Under-the-Influence/dp/0874160553/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Click: A Woman Under the Influence</a>is far superior to the movie. Both are full of erotica and sexploitation. But the book has much more of a deeper story going on. The idea of a remote control  to stimulate a  woman's desires is a silly premise for a film  I'll admit, but every guy has thought of it at one point or another. As the video cover points out: Every man's fantasy becomes one man's reality. Anyway, I've seen a lot worse story lines when it comes to soft core. Unbearable ones. So, I guess it is a compliment  to say that this one is watchable even between the nude scenes.

If it weren't for Florence Guerin in the lead role. I'd say check out the graphic novel and forget the movie. However, her amazing form in nude is a serious sight to behold. Definitely not to be missed here.",1224633600,,1396,5.173333333333333

The movie is based on Milo Manara's comic strip ""le declic,"" and the box has a typo claiming the comic is ""le dedic."" It must have been designed by someone with poor eyesight and the ""c"" and ""l"" blurred together to make ""d.""
Dr. Fez creates a device that can make any woman turned on. He tests it out a bit around town before going after his real target. He wants to get a little revenge for how a man treated him and makes the man's frigid wife deal with getting overly aroused.
No Oscar performances here. I have seen worse. Don't expect much adult material. What's there is not very graphic. There is alot of story here, and it's not totally mindless. It can be enjoyable depending on your reasons for watching it.
The box says it was produced by the same person as the Emmanuelle films. I haven't seen any of them so I can't compare the works. Only one photo on the box is actually from the movie. I don't recognize the other women. If they're in it, they look very different. They aren't dressed like that in the movie.",995673600,5,1126,4.266355140186916
