8145197,5,B000ICM5A8,The Diaz family are very incredible Martial Artists. I do a similar style of Kajukenbo and it was really fun watching these guys perform and seeing how they adapt and generate power. As for the other reviewer who stated that it didn't work in any US players... I have not had this problem. It has worked in my DVD player as well as my PC.,1348358400,,338,4.2153846153846155
8145198,1,B000ICM5A8,"This is not a dig on content. This is just a warning as I bought two of these DVD's and they were not playable on any USA DVD players, or computers I tried them on. I believe these maybe for non US DVD players only! Please don't get caught in the same trap I did. I wish I had a post like this to read before I bought two of these. If anyone knows more of the story, please post it. Thank you.",1224374400,,393,3.746987951807229
