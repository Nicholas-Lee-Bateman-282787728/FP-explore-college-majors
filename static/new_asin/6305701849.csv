1066215,5,6305701849,"I have bought this video on DVD and I am now purchasing the same title in VHS so that I can play my own Celtic Music CD's along to the television with the volume shut off.  The combination of Irish music and excellent photography of the beautiful coastal area, countryside, and towns of Ireland is powerful.",1034121600,3,307,4.482142857142857
1066216,1,6305701849,I just returned from being in Ireland for a month.  I drove over 2000 miles.  The year before I drove 1000 miles.  This DVD is not a good example or illustration of Ireland the Beautiful.  I do not recommend this.  There are much better DVD's of Ireland.,1010188800,5,254,4.319148936170213
1066217,5,6305701849,"This is an outstanding video....the picture quality is first rate and the music is perfect for the video....Enya, James Galway and the Chieftains. If you are a fan of Ireland and of these musicians...it doesn't get any better than this. I have owned this video for nearly 10 years...and I never get tired of it...very relaxing.",996019200,3,327,4.857142857142857
1066218,5,6305701849,I bought this video about 9 years ago.  And I never get tired of seeing it...I even bought this video for my Mom and my daughter's teachers for St. Patrick's Day...It is a very relaxing tape. Just curl up in front of fire and enjoy it. The music is very magical and moves with the beautiful landscape of Ireland....,983059200,,315,4.338983050847458
1066219,4,6305701849,"This DVD takes you on a journey to the mystical land of Ireland, were you are accompanied by the wonderous music of Enya, the Chieftans and James Galway. This is not a documentary that gives you more insight into the  history and culture of Ireland, but an audiovisual journey through the  country that lets you experience the emotions and feelings of this country.  From the green fields in the southern part of Ireland to the rocky clifs in  the northwest and the beautiful streams that can be found throughout this  country, you will experience them all, including some beautiful sunsets and  sunrises.
This DVD release is the same as the video release, no extras  provided. The video quality is okay, but could have been better for a DVD  release. The audio is plain stereo (but that is what could be expected of  this music journey) but good.
This DVD is of interest to everyone who is  interest in Ireland, has been to Ireland or would like to go to Ireland.",961286400,5,964,4.617647058823529

7893941,5,6305701849,"I owned a VHS copy of this for several years and it was one of my favorite videos.  It introduced me to Enya and other Irish groups at the time and helped me to see Ireland in a different way as an island because it circled from one end of the island to the other and showed the different sides to the steep cliffs on the west and more gentle ascents on the south, the rough seas of the west and north, then it would go in on fields and photographic pictures of monastery hallways or swoop over castles or stop in on people at a village pub or working in the fields or show the thatch on a house.  Now most of this is showing picturesque and not urban centers, but I loved how it took a photographic approach without narration, so it was like a quilt or slideshow of Ireland.  It spoke for itself and I found it at the time ahead of its time and still do.  I loved bicycling to this at home or using the treadmill with it.  The motion was perfect for that.  I gave the VHS to the library when I moved, but still love this particular video.  I would own it again.  It was the first of the Tapestry series.  The one on Africa was also good.  What you see about it is the land and the people that goes beyond countries and narration.  Africa can also look like an Island.",1431302400,,1268,4.052208835341365
7893942,5,6305701849,This video is so relaxing because of the beautiful aerial photography and music.  I think I bought it because a DVD wasn't available at the time.,1430179200,,145,4.576923076923077
7893943,5,6305701849,"I purchased the original VHS release years ago and wore it out. The DVD has not disappointed me; Very relaxing, great music and video.",1364601600,,134,4.625

7893945,5,6305701849,"After seeing the sister album ""Portrait of England"", I tried this DVD.  It is another excellenly photographed aerial guide through the beautiful and sometimes harsh landscape of the Emerald Isle.  Wynton Marsalis provides the music that will enthrall you through your journey through Ireland.",1357603200,,292,5.613636363636363
7893946,4,6305701849,"I have just moved up to BluRay, and this video, shot in 1989, is not available in that format. And given the date, would probably not give better results unless the original were shot on film.

The disturbing thing about this video as it is shot is the speed of the airplane footage; the frame refresh just cannot keep up with it, and it's somewhat blurred and dizzying. The plane even swoops and dips. Probably in its day, the footage was revolutionary, but now other similar videos use steadier shots at a slower pace. This is not video of a ski slope, not a thrill ride.

I have a few dozen ambient nature videos, some I made myself, for background in my caregiver ""sick room"" situation. Where it's nice to have something on, but that one does not have to pay attention. most of these ambient videos have choices of a half dozen generic music soundtracks that are not specifically synced to the visuals. This video, however, does a nice job of making the visuals connect more to the music. There is a sequence of a man weaving on a hand loom, and the music matches his rhythm. Sometimes the plane flies over land and it suddenly opens to reflection of the dramatic clouds in a lake, and the music swells. Nice job in that respect.

This is also a nice video music wise in that it has Name performers like James Galway and Enya.",1278892800,,1330,4.420408163265306
7893947,5,6305701849,I have had this in my old laser disc collection for many years and finally getting it on dvd. The sound to picture editing is quite wonderful and really captures the magical feel of Ireland. A nice relaxing ride.,1167264000,,212,4.461538461538462
7893948,4,6305701849,"I own the Portrait of Ireland on DVD.  The photography is superb and that alone makes it worth watching over and over.  This is photography as an Art form and I often play it with the sound turned off, enjoying the silent countryside and the soaring views of Ireland. I love Celtic music, but it does get tedious afer dozens of replays.
  This video would have been enhanced by small subtitles telling the viewer what they are seeing. (Preferably Subtitles that can be turned off.) It does leave one sadly adrift and longing for information.  This video would also have been enhanced by having the natural sounds of the countryside instead of drowning us in music.  Or perhaps we could have a choice of soundtracs -- either music or nature.",1058918400,8,740,4.653846153846154
