From Sigung ( Master, or 'Grandmaster' in Chinese Martial Arts ) Tak Wah Eng. Complaints on how there's no instruction on application of the Kuen ( 'Form', or 'Set' in Chinese Kung Fu ). There is a reason for this practice. You see, in Kung Fu, this is done on purpose. The student must practice the form, over and over again. And not just practice with mindless repitition, but actually learn and glean something from the practice! By obeying the Sifu ( ""Teacher"" in Chinese Martial Arts ), this showed him, or her, that the student was dedicated. And later on in training stages, would have the application knowledge revealed to them. Obviously, it would help if anyone, besides myself, would have formal training. But, used in conjunction with the many written books on the subject of 'Southern Chinese Kung Fu'. These videos can be an invaluable training aid. Please -- get them, learn from them!! You'll regret not getting them sooner!",1449792000,,1097,4.871657754010696
