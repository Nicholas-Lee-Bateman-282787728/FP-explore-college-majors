7865892,5,6304253168,My son is 15 months and he loves it.  He dances to it and is starting to imitate some of the things that John Farrell does.  He is very active but the video really holds his attention. The melodies are catchy and easy for  an adult to listen too also.,944870400,3,251,3.98
7865893,4,6304253168,The ageing on the vidio says for ages 2 - 9 years.  After viewing it at Gymboree I bought it for my granddaughter knowing I might never see it again.  After watching it once she was absolutely inthralled.  I think John  Farrel is her first true love.  The whole vidio holds her attention and she  is only 6 MONTHS old.,939859200,3,318,4.216666666666667
