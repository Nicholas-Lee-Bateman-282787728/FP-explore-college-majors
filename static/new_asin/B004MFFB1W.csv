8435989,3,B004MFFB1W,"1951 indie 'Chicago Calling!' isn't a bad movie-- Dan Duryea, one of the noir era's most prolific character players (usually as a heavy), is refreshingly tender as leading (loveable) loser Bill Cannon, director John Reinhardt has a decent eye for urban landscapes and composition, and there are moving moments in this oddly convoluted drama that make it compelling-- but what keeps it from being a b-grade classic is its schizophrenic sense of tone.  It tries to be suspenseful, as framed by its ticking-clock plot; it tries to be socially conscious (post-war malaise, alcoholism, poverty, etc.); it tries to be lighthearted and touching (elements of a mismatched-buddies film); and it is at times all of these things.  Yet it is ultimately so tragic thematically these other components come across almost as red herrings when all is said and done.  I'm keeping it in my collection because it has more good points than bad, Duryea's performance being one of the former.  The Warner Archive print shows signs of age-related wear, but picture is reasonably sharp and audio clear.  DVD-R with no extras.  Movie rates 3-plus stars, as does presentation.",1477008000,6,1149,5.117647058823529
8435990,1,B004MFFB1W,I love Dan Duryea.  Am trying to work my way through all of his movies.  This screenplay was awful.  The story line was very one dimensional.  Don't rush to view this movie.,1469404800,2,173,4.3125
8435991,5,B004MFFB1W,This is a fantastic classic that I'd seen as a little boy and never forgot. Quality is great. Received it quickly. Great product and service.,1431043200,3,141,4.68

8435993,5,B004MFFB1W,"Yes--and it works! Known for portraying sleazy guys in film noir, Dan Duryea is the man we root for in this drama. His character has made mistakes but wants to do better--loves his family. His wife has had enough of his drinking and takes their daughter and leaves.  At this point, he is pretty much at the end of his rope. He receives bad news that there has been an accident and his daughter seriously injured. Updates will be by telephone. This is the very day the telephone company sends a man to take the phone out for non-payment. Now it's up to Dan's character to raise $53 to keep the phone so he can get the update on his daughter. Can he do it?",1370390400,6,654,4.232
8435994,5,B004MFFB1W,"Chicago calling was a great movie.  I think this is Dan Duryea's best movie and performance.  Anyway the plot is good and not predictable.  The picture and sound looked good.

Highly recommended.
