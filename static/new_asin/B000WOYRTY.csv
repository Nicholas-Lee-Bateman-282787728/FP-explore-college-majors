8297839,5,B000WOYRTY,"This is an overlooked gem!  Thirteen years ago the two prodigiously talented Flannery sisters, Amy and Mary headed to Mississippi with a brand new video camera to find and record what they could of real blues in the Delta.  The announced destination was the 19th Annual Delta Blues and Heritage Festival. But they found the real thing along the way as is often the case in life.  Not the big ticket, stadium concert blues but the back road, pint bottle, roadhouse blues.  They interviewed T-Model Ford before he became a blues legend and recorded him in a back road juke joint.  For that alone it's worth the price.

The style is pure one camera documentary as practiced by experienced video professionals who also happen to be professional musicians as well.  It's a major dose of  the juke joint circa 1996.  Many of the places and people they recorded no longer exist except in the footage shot by Amy and edited by Mary Flannery.  They have done all of us a service.",1233187200,2,970,4.619883040935672
