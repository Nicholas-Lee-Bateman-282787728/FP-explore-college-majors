8654561,4,B00JXZGPJS,"As you might expect, this is fine performance by the great Vince Price. This movie was directed by Reginald Le Borg in 1963. The story is located in Paris, where Judge Simon Cordier (Vincent Price) is curious about the criminal mind. He guesses to what extent criminals are born or made by the circumstances. In that context, Simon Cordier visits a condemned prisoner, Louis Girot condemned to death penalty. Cordier does not believe Girot who claims his innocence insisting that he has been taken over by a spirit that forced him to commit his crimes. Girot's death is caused accidentally by Cordier during a struggle with Girot at his prison cell. After that, Cordier begins to face strange occurrences in his home. Eventually, an evil, invisible spirit drives him to kill. Overall, this is not among the very best Price films, but it delivers a good story a fine performance by our eternal horror actor. Until recently, this movie was available only from VHS or DVDr copies.

Technically, this DVD transfer by Regia Films is excellent, with a clearly better than VHS quality. Color tones are very nice. The film transfer is PAL, region free, and comes in nice widescreen format. The audio comes in either English or Spanish. Spanish subtitles are provided with the English audio, my choice if you appreciate the ""nasal"" voice of Price. The movie runs for 92 minutes. The only negative issue with this release: NO extras, not even the trailer.",1421971200,,1445,4.873983739837398
