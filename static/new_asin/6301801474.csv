7815399,5,6301801474,"This was a post-Little House Movie-of-the-Week for Melissa Sue; it was made in 1983 and Missy ended her LHOP run in 1981. She plays a young college woman, Toby King, who is hired as a babysitter by her professor Jane Simon (Loretta Swit of TV's M*A*S*H). Toby is on scholarship and needs money to help pay her expenses. Toby meets her professor's husband, a successful architect who is secretly unhappy in his marriage. She develops a crush on him when he drives her home from babysitting jobs. Sparks seem to fly between the two; he returns her feelings and the two embark on an illicit affair. They throw caution to the wind and are seen in many public places; but of course they get caught and then there's hell to pay. Jane Simon is forgiving of Toby, knowing that she was young and inexperienced with adult relationships; her husband doesn't fare so well.
For such a tawdry topic, this movie handles it tastefully without any sensationalism; then again, it was a made-for-TV film, and the more adult aspects of this relationship could not be shown on TV. Melissa Sue did an excellent job as Toby; even though her character made a mistake, you don't dislike her, because Toby does show regret and remorse after she's caught. Loretta Swit is great as always as the strong professor. Amanda Bearse has a small part in this film as one of Toby's friends. If you're looking for a good Saturday night movie to watch at home, you'll enjoy this one. Too bad it's not out on DVD.",1433289600,,1475,4.590909090909091

for better picture quality.  Sound quality often irregular.  Picture quality fair.",1368057600,,153,6.190476190476191
7815401,3,6301801474,"This made for TV movie is not going to change many lives or make many lists as one of the best pictures ever made.  It is a pretty prosaic story about a Radcliffe freshman's affair with her English professor's husband.  The film is noteworthy in part because it features a young Courtney Cox before she hit the big time on Friends.  More important, however, is the fact that the film is the first on-screen appearance of the Harvard Din and Tonics, possibly the best collegiate acapella singing group in the nation.  Connoisseurs of the acapella scene should check out this snapshot of the early Dins.......",1159833600,3,607,4.752380952380952
