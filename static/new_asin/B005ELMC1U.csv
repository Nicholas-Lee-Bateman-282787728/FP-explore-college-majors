4665655,5,B005ELMC1U,"When most sequels or follow ups or whatever this is considered comes out 34 years after the original they don't do any justice to the original, And we have plenty of examples of those from disney, but this is not one of those. This movie is almost as good as the original. it is perfect for the young ones since it is only a little bit more than an hour long and it is packed with laughs for the kids and the adults alike. The movie is a fantastic follow up to The Many Adventures of Winnie The Pooh. I highly recommend it for every age whether new fans of Winnie or old fans who were there for the original.",1312934400,2,608,4.075
4665656,4,B005ELMC1U,"Like many other people, I have fond nostalgic memories of watching the original ""Winnie the Pooh"" shorts when I was a little kid. However, the Disney Corporation then spent many years systematically RAPING my childhood by putting out increasingly awful Pooh adventures, whitewashing all the characters, adding a bunch of NEW ones nobody liked, and even erasing Christopher Robin. SACRILEGE!

Fortunately, the 2011 ""Winnie the Pooh"" movie is a much more satisfying experience, especially since the story hearkens back to the original A.A. Milne stories. It has the slight tweeness that comes from TRYING to match the original's charm, and the musical numbers are pretty disposable, but it recaptures much of the atmosphere and childish chaos.

While on the hunt for honey, Pooh finds that Eeyore has lost his tail, leading to a contest among the Hundred-Acre Woods' inhabitants. The tail remains missing, and none of the substitutes really work. The next day, Pooh also finds that Christopher Robin has gone mysteriously missing, leaving behind a note: ""Gon Out Bizzy Back Soon.""

Since Owl doesn't read nearly as well as he thinks he does, he interprets the note to mean that Christopher Robin has been abducted by a monster known as the Backson. So Rabbit organizes an elaborate trap to catch the Backson, Tigger begins teaching poor Eeyore how to be a second Tigger, and Pooh continues his quest for HONEY. Chaos ensues.

Anyone expecting something as effortlessly charming and nostalgic as the 1960s/1970s Pooh adventures is going to be disappointed. ""Winnie the Pooh"" is consciously trying to capture that charm, so it sometimes gets twee. Also, the musical numbers are pretty much 100% padding, and are thoroughly mediocre.

However, the movie does feel like an earnest, genuine attempt to return to everything we loved about Pooh -- the omniscient narrator, the opening sequence, the movable letters, and the feeling of childish chaos (the ""trap"" for the Backson is a bunch of random objects leading to a pit). It's not a deep or intricate movie, but it is a pretty decent kids' movie.

As for the characters, they're mostly as you remember them. Piglet seems more terrified than timid, and Rabbit is a bit manic, but Owl is an endearingly pompous know-it-all, Eeyore is perpetually gloomy, Tigger is bouncy and wild, and Pooh is honey-obsessed and stuffed-with-fluff (especially in the head). Also, Christopher Robin is veddy veddy British.

""Winnie the Pooh"" won't topple the original adventures as a classic anytime soon, but it does have considerable charm and energy -- little kids will probably enjoy it, and adults might not be too bored.",1312934400,,2651,5.108545034642033
4665657,3,B005ELMC1U,"I have always been a big fan of pooh.  Three years ago, I was blessed by God with an amazing little girl and this got me back into the hundred acre wood for the first time since I was a kid.

We started with ""My Friends Tigger & Pooh"" on Disney.  It took me a short while to get used to that but it was really well done (the voices are great, many of the stories are good, not sure why they cut the show).

Still, longing for ""old-school pooh"", I went to amazon and ordered the ""Friendship Edition"" (the very best pooh DVD available) which includes ""The Honey Tree"", ""The Blustery Day"", ""Winnie the Pooh & Tigger Too"", in addition to the bonus ""A Day for Eeyore"" (a classic) and one of the first ""MY Friends"" episodes.

The good thing about this movie is that they tried to pay homage to the ""old school pooh"" and in that they did very well.  I wasn't wild about some of the voices (the ones on ""My Friends"" are better and I believe Jim Cummings could have done more of them and we'd have been better off) but the hand-drawn animation and return to some of the characterization from the original poohs were great.

The only thing really lacking was a good sweet interesting story.  I liked the part about Eeyore's tail but didn't like the whole bit about the ""Baxson"".  I believe the whole Baxson story line was done better in ""Pooh's Grand Adventure"" (where Owl misreads another note left by Christopher Robin...this one saying he's gone to ""school"" and ""help yourself"" which Owl misreads into saying ""he's been taken to 'SKULL'"" and needs 'help'""...much better done story in my opinion).  I appreciate them using original stories from the book but someone should have told them that they've already done that story and that it was written better last time.

The songs were pretty good.  There were no ""Little Black Rainclouds"", ""Lullabees"", etc. but they were pretty good.

I love what they did with returning to ""old school pooh"" but they should have tried a bit harder with the writing and used the voices from ""My Friends Tigger & Pooh"" (since the voices of the 1970s stories captures in ""The Friendship Edition"" are mostly dead).",1312934400,5,2135,4.528645833333333
4665658,2,B005ELMC1U,"My fiancee and myself are both 21 years old.  We grew up on Pooh.  I can remember watching the Blustery Day until the tape gave out.  I admit, even now I still go back and watch the old cartoons for the sake of nostalgia (my favorite episodes are the one about the Wishing Well and the western one were everyone is in fear of getting ""trounced"".  When a new Pooh movie was set for a theater release we just knew we had to go see it.  We really wish we had not.

First, there is no structure.  Sure, Pooh is out for honey as always, but the movie gets so easily sidetracked with sub plots, straying from those sub plots, and then bringing them back into the picture at the worst times.  The whole thing seems as if it were written by 5 different people at different times and they decided to cram it all into one small movie.  A lot of disorganiztion makes the movie bothersome to watch.  Not only that, but it is extremely short! I knew not to expect a 3 hour ordeal but come on?  Barely passing the hour long mark?!  When you add the spastic storyline the movie seems to breeze by in half that time.

The characters have all changed.  Their personalities are completely different.  Owl is now a complete know-it-all smart mouth who you just want to punch the entire time.  Pooh is very dark.  Sure, he seems friendly at first, but somewhere he lost his love for others.  He only cares about himself and his needs now and will do anything to satisfy them, such as disregarding Piglet's safety and shoving him head first into a bee hive and then beating it up.  You can clearly tell their is a lack of compassion to Pooh now.  Rabbit is odd, Piglet is different, its just not the same.  Something went wrong.  Eeyore is the only one close to his original self.  Oh, and where was Gopher at?!

No heffalumps or woozles?!  That is classic Pooh but they are never mentioned.  That alone was enough to ruin it for me.  Instead you get this Backson crap.  Owl makes up some monster called a Backson and scares everyone into thinking it got Christopher Robin.  Not only that, but the scene in which Owl is ""describing"" this beast is particularly creepy to me.  Not scary, but something that a demented 14 year old would draw in the psych ward.  So you have this weak attempt at an antagonist rather than the outside characters that made the old movies great.

Lots of scenes where Pooh is walking on a white blank screen ontop of black text.  Good for enhancing the effect *or to save money ::cough cough::*

At first, I said to myself ""its because you are older"".  I figured being 21 Pooh had lost its appeal.  But I started noticing the kids.  All of them crying, kicking, playing with toys, etc.  Clearly bored with the movie.  Some little boy stood up at the end and said ""Thats it?!""  Bare in mind this kid couldn't be more than 7.  So that tells me the audience this was aimed at did not like it themselves.

Had this been a straight to DVD release I would have understood.  But they played this up like it was Pooh's triumphant return to the big screen.  All this was was an attempt to put out a summer movie that every parent and babysitter would take the kids to see.  2 and 3 year olds, yeah they will probably like it but I'm going to guess 4 and up won't be too excited about it.  I have to say pass this one up.",1312848000,18,3317,4.27741935483871
4665659,5,B005ELMC1U,"This film is one of the best movies of 2011. No joke. Winnie the Pooh is extremely faithful to the original books, and the original Disney films. They don't include Darby, which was in the abysmal my Friends Tigger and Pooh, and bring back Christopher Robin, we get the ever-famous live action opening, the characters are just about the same from the original movies and shorts and spinoffs, and we get one of the happiest endings ever made reinvented into the big screen. Winnie the Pooh is a masterpiece, and I loved every minute of this film, even though it was 70 minutes long.

The Ballad of Nessie, the preceding short, is also a fantastic piece of art. Nessie has never been more cute and adorable until now.

Rating: 5 stars/5 stars",1312761600,5,740,4.598484848484849
4665660,5,B005ELMC1U,"I have to say that Winnie the Pooh haven't been much appealing to me like other Disney films and characters have. Mostly relegated to direct-to video market, Pooh is somewhat kiddie fare without much transcendance. Still, The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977) remains an endearing classic with excellent stories and appealing characters. The Many Adventures approaches Pooh in a very low-key manner but this is an excellent way to envision Pooh, a low key affair that nontheless provides good quality entertainment for everyone and that's why this film succeds where all the other Pooh films have failed.

When I heard that Winnie the Pooh was returning to theaters this year, I approached the news cautiously, as I said before, Pooh is not my cup of tea and aside from The Many Adventures is just not appealing to grown ups. Here in Latin America the now simply titled ""Winnie the Pooh"" premiered on May 6 (it opened in the States on July 15). I have to report that Disney Animation Studios did an excellent job with this film. Instead of a compillation of short films like its predecessor, this one takes some A. A. Milne original stories and mesh them in one single long film (although long is not the appropiate word because the film runs barely 70 minutes). Although it's not a compillation of shorts, the film feels a little episodic with Pooh & Co. stumbilng into one problem after another. I won't give away any spoliers but let me tell you that this film not only feels true to its original source, it also feels true to the original film. The same low key approach is seen here so don't expect a grand spectacle like last year's Tangled. The animation is remiscent of the original film with of course a newer quality on it. The characters are endearing and not obnoxious (except for the Owl but only in some scenes) and the Hundred Acre Wood retains that magic quality of the first film. Also the characters address the audience and the voice cast is remarkable. Kids will surely enjoy it and grown ups will also smile looking at this level of innocence and simplicity that will remind them what was to be a kid. The new songs are not memorable but serves the film right.

Video & Audio
Winnie the Pooh looks absolutely spectacular in HD. Detail, colors and contrast are exquisite in every scene, in every character. This is another top-notch transfer from Disney.

The 5.1 DTS-HD MA is also excellent. This is not a bombastic film but sound is great with no signs of compression and good directionality.

Bonus Material
Winnie the Pooh does not come as packed as other Disney titles but has some good bonus material including:

""Winnie the Pooh and his Story too"" is a kind of making of featurette of the film that is too short but still informative.
""Deleted Scenes"": You have five deleted scenes each one with an introduction from the director.
Bonus Shorts: This BD comes with two shorts. The first one is ""The Ballad of Nessie"" that accompanied Winnie the Pooh in theaters, the other is Mini Adventures of Winnie the Pooh: Pooh's Balloon that features Pooh, Christopher Robin and a blue balloon.
You also have a sing along option, Disney's song selection and a featurette of how to create a Pooh nursery.

A DVD and a Digital Copy are also included.

Closing Thoughts
Winnie the Pooh is a great film that breathes new life to the old bear. It has a lot going for it and I really recommend you give Pooh a chance especially if you have kids, you won't regret it. The BD features an amazing presentation of the film with stellar picture and sound and a healthy collection of bonus material. Highly Recommended!!",1312588800,61,3632,4.665625
4665661,5,B005ELMC1U,"I went and saw Winnie the Pooh in theaters a couple of weeks back and it was wonderful. I really like this song So Long (also known as It's Been So Long) from Zooey Deschanel. I listen to it all the time. I really want to see the movie again. But I'll wait and get it on both DVD and Blu-Ray. It has now become another of my all-time favorite Disney Animated Classics along with 1977's The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. I used to watch the crap out of it when I was a kid. I love Winnie the Pooh. I used to have the 1977 film on VHS, but unfortunately, I don't have no more. But fortunately, I have the movie again on DVD. The ones that I have is the 2007 Friendship Edition (also known as the film's 30th Anniversary Edition). I hope they re-release it on Blu-Ray soon and I will not be hesitated in buying it.",1311811200,,817,4.049382716049383
4665662,5,B005ELMC1U,"Winnie the Pooh (2011) is NOT for every movie-goer.  This is NOT the work of Pixar, Dreamworks, or any other CG studio vying for the average family's hard-earned movie-going dollars.  This is classic Disney hand-drawn animation, classic Winnie the Pooh ""G rated"" sweetness and humor, and when compared to some of the family movies out today.. there *IS* no comparison.  If you are a fan of quality and entertaining films, then you need to watch this movie!

The animated short before the main movie about Nessie (the Loch Ness Monster) is very appropriate and cute.  The Winnie the Pooh plot is simple and typical enough (Eeyore losing his tail, Pooh craving honey), but the execution is flawlessly timeless and entertaining.  The songs from the movie, soundtrack songs ""inspired"" by the film, and the new version of the Winnie the Pooh theme song by actress Zooey Deschanel all fit beautifully.  There isn't a single second of this 70-minute film that is wasteful or unnecessary; this is THE perfect family film... THE quintessential telling of a story about a boy and his imaginary 'Hundred Acre Woods.'

The colors in this modern-day rendition of the classic seem more vibrant and leap off the screen (I was curious about this, so I made my family watch the other Pooh movies afterward so I could compare).  The voices are obviously NOT the same as the Disney original.  Jim Cummings has played Pooh and Tigger (as well as other Disney voiceovers) for decades and does a stellar job as both.  Craig Ferguson (voice of Owl) and Tom Kenny {aka Spongebob Squarepants} (voice of Rabbit) and all the other voices do an amazing job at giving life to these beloved characters.

Fingers crossed that the DVD/BD release includes great extras like the 'how to draw Pooh' blurbs that have been running on the Disney Channel; I'm also hoping for an interview or two about the making of the film, why Disney decided to release this movie in the theaters instead of straight to video (as has been the norm), etc.

All in all, highly entertaining and simply good.",1311724800,2,2051,4.8091168091168095
4665663,3,B005ELMC1U,"I love 'The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh' but Winnie's return was kinda weak for me. This movie had the spirit, but not the soul of the original. It had a few cute scenes and I loved Zooey Deschanel's version of Winnie's theme. Zooey has such a beautiful singing voice! I didn't like Christopher Robin's voice, he sounded too childish. Throughout the movie, Pooh and his pals help find a tail for Eeyore, search for honey, and rescue Christopher from a fake monster believed to be called the 'Backson' because they couldn't read his note in saying that he'd be back soon. If you love the original, you might enjoy WINNIE THE POOH!!!",1311724800,,638,4.605263157894737

4665689,4,B005ELMC1U,"That is the question that I have in mind, which to my mind this movie was not necessary for Disney to make. Consider that the run time is really short, 63 minutes long, the end credits start less then 1 hour into the movie. While it is short and sweet, compared to some of the other Disney animated movies that have been coming out that is 1 hour and 40 minutes long, or more. What I think the movie lacks more of is being original then other Winnie the Pooh movies. It does have original songs ion the movie, and some one things that are original, but there are things that we have before in other Winnie the Pooh movies, like Eeyore loses his tail, and Pooh finds a note from Christopher Robin that he is gone but we will be back soon, Pooh can't read it, so he brings it to Owl, and he misreads the note leading Pooh and friends to believe that Christopher Robin is in trouble. The movie opens with the Narrator this time voiced by John Cleese starting his narration that a bedroom could be the bedroom of any small ball, but this one is the bedroom of Christopher Robin, and then you have the theme song that is sung by Zooey Deschanel. And then the movie finds a sleeping Winnie the Pooh (Jim Cummings)  with the narrator trying to wake up Winnie the Pooh and the book is shaken to wake him up. Winnie the Pooh wakes up, and the narrator informs him, that he has something big to do, and Pooh asks him what it is, and he refuses to tell him as it will spoil the story. And while thinking, and goes to get his honey he finds out he is out of honey, so he goes out to find more. And while doing so notices that Eeoyre (Bud Luckey) has lost his tail, and goes to Christopher Robin (Jack Boulter) for help and they make signs to hand out to Piglet (Travis Oates ), Rabbit (Tom Kenny), Owl (Craig Ferguson), Kangra (Kristen Anderson-Lopez), and Roo (Wyatt Hall) saying something important to do. And they attend a meeting that Christopher Robin announces a contest to find a replacement tail for Eeyore. And that for there will be a prize for the winner, that Winnie the Pooh suggests a pot of honey as the prize, hoping that he will win. The first thing that Pooh finds that they try is a Cuckoo clock, which does work, and each more attempt finds a character being awared and losing the pot of honey. The various items that are tried are a yoyo, an umbrella, a dartboard, misc toys, a vane, and a concertina). Kanga even suggests a kite as a tail, and it unravels, and when Pooh goes to Christopher Robin for help, and finds a note from Christopher Robins that says that he is busy which is misspelled, and that he will be back soon. And of course Pooh can't read it, and takes it to Owl, and with as bad of a reader he is, he misreads the note, and says that he has been captured by a creature he calls the Backson. And the rest of the movie is the gang including Tigger tries to capture the creature to rescue Christopher Robin. The movie features Jim Cummings that again also voices Tigger, as the only Winnie the Pooh voice actor in other movies, to return to voice this with replacement for actors or actress that have voiced the characters in previous movies that died, or I guess they choose them not to voice them for this movie. If you are a big Winnie the Pooh fan, I bet that you will love this movie, but you also have to wonder if this movie is also worth the time that Disney took to make this movie.",1491609600,,3416,4.2312404287901995

It is classic pooh characters, and very funny. The condition of the movie was just as described. I'm very happy with my purchase. It was a great price and arrived early.",1483920000,,335,4.508196721311475
4665702,4,B005ELMC1U,"I love this movie. I can't say it is as good as The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, but it is a worthy reboot.

The only thing I don't like is the packaging. This Blu-ray/DVD combo, unlike most of the others I've seen, apparently only comes with the DVD packaging and not the Blu-ray packaging, so it sticks out like a sore thumb in my neatly organized and alphabetized collection of Blu-rays.",1483488000,2,397,4.438356164383562

My only (very small) complaint is the change in Pooh's personality toward Piglet ... he comes across as kind of self-absorbed and selfish...
But it's probably not noticeable to kiddos.",1483401600,2,248,5.073170731707317

4665707,3,B005ELMC1U,"The last of the studio's hand drawn animated features, Winnie-the-Pooh is a delightful and innocent tribute to the snuggly old bear we all know and love. The charm of all the characters are captured in exactly the same way that generations adored, and the way they interact with the storybook setting is both hilarious and imaginative. It's a shame that it's not even an hour long, though. If more time was spent on letting the characters live in the hundred acre wood, then this could go on to appeal to more than small children.",1481241600,,530,4.648936170212766

4665754,1,B005ELMC1U,"Giving it one star for a few reasons - it is no where near as charming as the classic or even the modern releases (Tigger movie, piglet movie etc). The songs lack the catchy toddler friendly refrains and made me wish for earplugs - the one main number about an imaginary monster was accompanied by some less than cute animation. My kid loved the heffalump and wooden song in the classic -  no animation scares there -  but this one had her hiding. I think maybe a song (and overall plot) suggesting monsters might kidnap your friends (or little children) just isn't as child friendly as their previous stories. We finally cut it off, she's never asked to watch it again. Also I agree with another poster about the dialog - in one scene roo pretty much throws piglet under the bus saying ""send the pig""  when they think they're facing a danger. Nice. Real classy disney magic right there.

Maybe fine for older kids - adults in my house didn't  enjoy sitting through this one -  scared my toddler. Thank God it was just a rental.",1457222400,8,1028,4.470588235294118

It hit some of the nostalgia targets, and was a decent story line based on the stories from the books. It was updated, so the jokes were slightly more edgy than earlier versions - whether that is because the audience was expected to be older, or because they are the children of the 21st century, I'm not sure. It was cute, though, and I hope it captures the imagination of the younger kids and imparts to them the magic that is Pooh Bear, like it did for me and others of my generation.",1452124800,5,587,4.25

4665803,5,B005ELMC1U,"I grew up watching Winnie the Pooh.  My first dog was even named Pooh-Bear! Those movies will always remain near and dear to my heart, as will this one.  I'm now 31 years old, and I still pop in a good Pooh movie every now and again.  Since this movie came out a few years ago, it has been my most watched Pooh movie (being great company on days like today when I'm stuck inside with a cold) The jokes, especially the scene when they fall into the hole, never fails to make me giggle and I'm always sad when the movie ends (and have even watched it repeatedly) Great lines to break out into in daily life, which my friends and I do quite often.
The characters have been modified, but only slightly.  Their expressions get a bit comical, yet their voices and virtues are still the same.  The songs are more new to the Pooh Bear world, but they aren't nearly as bad as those one and two star reviews make them out to be.  I love the Bakson song, and the Tigger One Tigger Two song the best.  If you're an adult like me, might I suggest reverting back to your childhood to fully enjoy this movie.  Put you self in a child's position and just forget about adulting for an hour.  The movie will be that much more enjoyable if you do.  Scrutinize and expect too much, and yes, you may be disappointed.",1432684800,,1295,4.206477732793522
4665804,5,B005ELMC1U,"As big a Disney fan as I am, I've never been a huge fan of their Winnie the Pooh films.  Heck, I haven't seen the last few they've done at all.  So when they announced they were doing a new one, it wasn't on my list of films to see.  But a friend really wanted to go, so I decided to go with her (after all, she's gone to several unusual movies for me).  I'm glad she talked me into it because it was a delightful film.

Our story opens on a typical morning when Winnie the Pooh (voiced by Jim Cummings) wakes up to a rumbly in the tumbly.  Shocked to realized that he is out of honey (or hunny as they spell it in these movies), Winnie the Pooh sets out into the Hundred Acre Woods to visit his friends, hoping to get some breakfast.  His first stop is Eeyore (Bud Luckey) who is missing something - his tail.  And so the friends band together to try to come up with a suitable new one for him.

As the search goes on, Winnie the Pooh makes the discovery that Christopher Robin (Jack Boulter) is missing.  All they have is the note he left behind.  Owl (Craig Ferguson) reads it and determines that Christopher Robin has been kidnapped by a Backson, a horrid beast that wakes babies in the middle of the night and messes up your Christmas lights.  Can they trap it and get back Christopher Robin?  Will they ever find a tail for Eeyore?  And will Winnie the Pooh ever get some honey?

One of my biggest issues with the old Winnie the Pooh movies was the use of the book format for telling the story, including a narrator who interacted with the characters and us going into and out of the pictures on the pages.  And yet, that was probably the biggest thing I was glad to see they'd kept.  The movie even opens with a modern arrangement of the classic theme song.  They did leave Gopher (whose not in the book, you know) out of things.

As for the plot, it was interesting because they started a story, interrupted it with another, resolved that one, and then resolved the first one.  That makes for a different structure than we're used to seeing, but they actually tied the elements from these two stories together well enough that I think it works.  What I find most interesting here is I remember the story of the missing tail from the books, but I believe the Backson is a complete invention for this movie.

Speaking of the Backson, I think very few children will have trouble with him at all.  The showing I saw today was filled with young kids, and I didn't hear any of them crying during those scenes.  He's always played for laughs even when some of the characters are scared of him.

The songs written for this movie are okay.  I don't think they are the classic stuff that the Sherman Brothers wrote for the originals, but they are entertaining and progress the story.  If the movie has one weakness, this is probably it.

I also had some problems with the voice cast.  I'm not talking about their acting because they all did great jobs with that.  But some of the voices, Christopher Robin and Kanga especially, are different from how I remember them.  That was jarring at first, but soon I got used to it.  Again, it's minor.

One thing I always admired about the originals was how closely they captured the spirit of the illustrations from the book.  They have recaptured that feeling.  Granted, it's been years since I watched the movie, but this seems to be an almost identical match for the style from almost 45 years ago.  That includes some details lines to the backgrounds that are beautiful.  It makes me want more hand drawn animation.

What surprised me was just how funny the movie was.  My friend and I were laughing the entire way through it.  And it really is cute and charming.  This is a movie that you can take your kids to and know they will enjoy.  Adults?  Well, you've got to remember the target audience, but if you can sit back and recapture your inner child, you'll enjoy it, too.  This isn't great cinema, but it's not trying to be.  It's trying to be a movie that's a little over an hour of light, fun entertainment.

Before the feature, there's a short that tells us ""The Ballad of Nessie,"" of Loch Ness fame.  Like the feature, it's cute.

You'll want to stay through the credits.  Not only are there fun bits of animation with the characters as the credits roll (and some great stuff with the stuffed animals, too), but there's a scene after the credits play that is hilarious.  Trust me, you don't want to miss it.

So I am glad I went to see Winnie the Pooh.  It surpassed my expectations with it's charm and wit.  It's a movie that the kid in everyone will enjoy.",1432339200,,4610,4.356051703877791

4665883,5,B005ELMC1U,"Since childhood, I have been a huge fan of A. A Milne and Ernst Shepard's classic tales of Pooh Bear, Christopher Robin, and all their friends from the Hundred Acre Wood. When this movie came out, I was ever so excited to relive childhood, although admittedly I was a little nervous, like ""what if it's not how I remember the stories?"" Thankfully, I had no need to fear. This is one of my all-time favorite movies, and I am not ashamed to say so.

From catching the Backson, and accidentally catching Pooh, to losing Eeyore's tail and holding a contest to find a replacement, to finding honey for Pooh's tummy, the story in this movie is just as cute as any of A. A Milne's originals. The plot is based on three stories that A. A Milne wrote. I fell in love with the song they used in the trailer and it is now one of my favorites (Somewhere Only We Know by Keane). It's perfect for a weekend film to watch with the whole family. As it is Winnie the Pooh there is absolutely nothing in this movie that children of any age can't see or hear. I recommend this movie to anyone who grew up (or is still growing up) with Winnie the Pooh, or anyone who just needs a smile from an adorable movie.

I'm not sure if this movie is even kid friendly. The only good thing I can think of is the animation but that alone is not enough.

4665892,5,B005ELMC1U,"Full disclosure: my wife is a Winnie the Pooh nut. Like ""lock her in a hunny-colored room"" nut. So I've seen a lot of Winnie the Pooh movies, shows, figures, stuffed animals, shirts, hats, coats...  Anyway.

The classic adventures and the original stores have always held a special place in my heart.  But over the past years, Disney has expanded the Pooh-neverse into tales of Heffalumps, Tigger families, new children, and adventures that weren't even imaginable in the 100 Acre Wood.  And I'll admit: I've laughed along with some of these tales, and still get a kick of seeing Eeyore hung up in a Christmas tree with angel wings, droning his ""fa-la-la-la-la."" But for the most part, these weren't really Winnie the Pooh stories to me.

But a ray of sunshine came in on this film.  Inspired by (and drawing from) the tale of Eeyore's missing tail, lovingly animated in a glorious 2D style, and written with care and understanding of each of the characters, this film nailed it for me.

From Pooh's sentient tummy, to Piglet's not-knot jokes.  Kanga's ""I'm with Child"" and Roo's ""Send the pig.""  I found myself remembering, loving, and appreciating the characters more than I had in years.  Suitable for ALL (literally) ages with plenty of subtle and overt humor, this could be the last Winnie the Pooh story I ever see, and I'd be content.

Bonus: Watch through the credits for a fun easter-egg scene.",1395100800,2,1403,4.780082987551867
4665893,3,B005ELMC1U,"Disney Studio's 51 st Full length feature film Winnie The Pooh is a return to one of the studio's most beloved characters. The original The Many Adventures Of Winnie The Pooh was actually three shorts sewn together for a theatrical release, so this is the first time that Pooh gets a true theatrical released movie. The film is rather short at 63 minutes and while entertaining(more for small children) I didn't see the point of this being a theatrically released film considering the string of great films that immediately proceeded it.

The Blu Ray looks fabulous though and while a lot of the original voice actors are gone now, they did find some amazingly close sounding voice talent for some of the key characters. The animation looks like a perfcet continuation from the first film and I love the addition of Zooey Dechannel's music. It's a cute movie that is probably more well received by children, but being a collector of all Disney theatrical films I could have done without this one. The 3 disc Blu Ray is short one with a 63 minute film, 2 shorts and some bonus material that won't take long before all is exhausted. I also find that since there are so many complaints in these times about bad role models for kids in animated films(Vanelope from Wreck It Ralph etc.), it seems laughable that no one seems to mind a lazy, begging bear who will connive his way to a free lunch of honey any chance he can get!

During the event they gave us a goody bag that included a Winnie The Pooh DVD [aff link], and of course my kids wanted to watch it. Once I read the following on the back I was a little bit more interested to see what they did this time.
""Inspired by five stories from A.A. Milne's books and created in Disney's legendary hand-drawn style, this all-new classic introduces one of the world's most cherished characters to a whole new generation.""

We actually sat down as a family to watch it [Daddy had other things to amuse himself with on his iphone], and ended up loving it! It started out as the very first one does - in Christopher Robin's room. I love that they once again made it look like the book pages come alive, that the letters and words become part of the story, and that the characters interact with the narrator. We all laughed out loud at some point or another; the humor is well done.

4666001,5,B005ELMC1U,"Winnie the Pooh and friends return to the big screen in Disney's 2011, hand-drawn animated feature, Winnie the Pooh. In the film, Winnie the Pooh's attempts to get some honey and a group effort to find a new tail for Eeyore, who has lost his own, are disrupted by a mission to capture a scary creature called the Backson, who the gang believes has taken Christopher Robin prisoner.

Charming, relaxing, extremely visually appealing and very refreshing to the animation fan these days, not to mention being very funny, ""Winnie the Pooh"" is a delightful and much appreciated treat from Walt Disney studios in an age of far too much, far too similar computer animation. The movie plays out as a clear continuation of 1977's ""The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"", and pretty much bumps ""Pooh's Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin"" (which had some similar plot points) as well as some episodes of the animated TV series ""The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" out of the realm of continuity, but when all is said and done, this is the only post ""Many Adventures"" Pooh work that is on par with the first film (granted, all that other stuff is still mostly great). What I mean is, this is no ""Piglet's Big Movie"" or ""Pooh's Heffalump Movie"". Maybe I should think about ""The Tigger Movie"" for a moment though. That one was REALLY good, and it also plays out more like a solid, and reasonably lengthy feature. Still, ""Winnie the Pooh"" is much more similar to the classic, original film in every way, and if that's important to you, well, there ya go. This Pooh film IS short though. That is one of its FEW negatives. The film is barely over an hour, making it practically a featurette. Luckily, when it was released in theaters, it was accompanied by an all-new animated short which the Blu-Ray also includes.

In addition to the many compliment I've given the film already, I also want to say that I adore the use of singer/actress Zooey Deschanel here! Even as a guy who usually prefers Minnie Mouse-voiced girls, Zooey's singing is angelic when she sings the RIGHT songs for her. I don't usually feel she does. I mean, anything with a real beat just doesn't seem to go with her voice well. I like her much better with the simpler, slower, more soulful stuff, like ""Baby, It's Cold Outside"" in ""Elf"" (which just makes me melt), or, in this case, her perfect rendition of the Winnie the Pooh theme song! I LOVE that! She also sings another song in the film well, though it is brief, but she is unfortunately brought back in the end credits for one of those songs I just don't feel suits her. Still, she was brilliantly selected for the other two!

If I was to try to come up with anything else that bothered me in the film, I can only say that Craig Ferguson as ""Owl"" took some getting used to. I mean, he did an admirable job, it just was a very different sounding Owl than I am used to, and even a very different acting Owl. Owl is usually a bit more stuffy and haughty in my mind. Not extremely, but a bit, and not so energetic and even youthful sounding (yeah, Ferguson sounds pretty youthful as Owl, or at least higher pitched). I seem to be used to it now though, as it didn't bother me as much when watching it recently as the first time I saw it. Speaking of, the date I was with that day actually only complained about Christopher Robin. She felt he sounded too young, but then, she was a lot younger than me and may have only been familiar with the animated TV series version of Christopher Robin, who not only sounded older but was also American. Incidentally, despite being around 36 when I saw this, that was my first date, so this is a special film for me. Though, it's also a bit painful, because I was just recently ""let go"" by that girl for someone who is basically just like me but was better at playing it ""aloof"" (I wear my heart on my sleeve) but I digress. Two years! And just a few closed mouth kisses! Sorry... I actually was really in love with her. I know it usually doesn't work out with the first girl, but the first girl is usually not the girl of your dreams, either.

Where was I?! (I never said I was mature) Ah, the Blu-Ray. Well, naturally, the film looks and sound PERFECT. And, being that it is a NEW film, Disney actually gives us some nice bonus features here! For one, there's the aforementioned animated short, which was actually about the Loch Ness Monster! It's called ""The Ballad of Nessie"", and though I wasn't too impressed with it the first time I saw it (storywise, I did love it visually; a very retro look), upon recently rewatching it, I really enjoyed it much more. The only issue I have with it is that Disney already had a hand-drawn Nessie character from the 60's featurette ""Man, Monsters, and Mysteries"", available on the original, Gold Collection release of Pete's Dragon on DVD. Sorry, I get annoyed when Disney does that. Let's say the Nessie in this new short is the mother of the male, modern day one from the old featurette... Anywho, besides the lovely new short cartoon, we also get a nice behind the scenes featurette that gives us a pleasing look at the origins of Winnie the Pooh as well, and  there are also some great deleted scenes, a sing-along viewing option, and this shortened version of an old Pooh classic that I guess is some new gimmick for showing the film to short-attention span viewers on the Disney Channel, much like the butchered ""Have a Laugh"" cartoons they introduced a while back. DO NOT support that Have a Laugh stuff.

And, that's about it for this one. If you LOVE Disney and Winnie the Pooh, you NEED to own this on Blu-Ray. If you don't, well, not sure why you'd want to, but it's great stuff anyway. If you only liked the original Pooh cartoons/feature, this is the one that is still worth your time, but I can't help but put in a plug for ""The Tigger Movie"" too. The other stuff varies in quality, but it's still generally pretty good, but this is on a whole other level, like the original animated works. Highly recommended!",1369612800,,6030,4.4772727272727275
4666002,3,B005ELMC1U,"This is an intriguing film.  I'm not sure if it should be considered a sequel to the original pastiche from the 1960's, or something new and unrelated.  It seems very much like a sequel in that Christopher Robin is a little older and very much a schoolboy now.  Pooh is still Pooh, same for Kanga and Roo.  Eeyore is little changed.  Owl, if anything, is even more vividly drawn and highly entertaining.  The one rather serious miss is Rabbit.  In the original film from the 1960's, Rabbit is a fussy old fuddy-duddy who likes his peace, quiet and order, and whose apple cart is continually (and riotously) upset by Tigger, who's just the opposite.  The two are clearly a yin and yang set.  In the new film, Rabbit's character is nondescript, he has become a trifle militaristic, and there is no apparent motivation for anything he says or does.  He reminds me much more of a secondary Warner Brothers cartoon figure.
There are some cute songs, the animation is gorgeous, and the overall story, while a little silly, does have a nice moral aspect about putting friends first.
But in many ways the 1960's film is simply better.  The new Rabbit is a big problem.",1369440000,,1160,4.609756097560975

4666050,3,B005ELMC1U,"I bought this movie, not having seen it in the theater, because of all the raves I read about how faithful it was to the style of the original. Now that I've seen it, I'm not that impressed. It's good that the story is based on material from the original book, and visually it's mostly there, but the dialogue and the jokes are decidedly modern. It's all stuff that I wouldn't mind at all in another movie, but in this context it constitutes a failure to recapture the spirit of the original stories. In fact, it makes it seem like they weren't even trying that hard. The movie falls victim to the modern ""edginess"" which I think is the opposite of the charm and innocence that made the original Pooh stories so special.

I think the example that stuck with me the most is the scene where Pooh is stuck in a hole, and the others are arguing over who should investigate whether he was the monster they were trying to catch. At one point, Roo says ""Send the pig"", referring to Piglet. That just strikes me as far too callous a thing for little Roo to say.",1358467200,68,1053,4.318181818181818

4666079,3,B005ELMC1U,"I was very excited when I saw the previews for this movie. Finally, I thought, Disney was going to do a truly ""classic"" remake based entirely on the books, themselves. Unfortunately, this was not the case. It's a reboot, yes - but more so a reboot of the Disney Pooh World and not a reboot of CLASSIC Winnie-the-Pooh.

The animation was tight and charming, which was a plus. I also greatly enjoyed the ""book"" portions, where characters meandered on pages and walked across sentences. The letters even fell from the pages to interact with the animated portions. Genius stuff there. Very cute and very likeable and an obvious nod to Pooh's beginnings on the written page.

However, instead of rebooting the series to remain truer to the original works... They've rebooted the series to basically change it even MORE so from the original works in order to, apparently, be less of a retread. Well, Disney, you can't have it both ways. You can't both ""reboot"" a series AND present unknown material. Had this movie stayed true to the original book stories and kept the charming portions that Disney did add orignally (namely, those wonderful SONGS), this could've been an epic reboot. As it is... I feel it's even worse than the originals it was meant to ""refresh"".

The songs are terrible. Really, truly terrible. Don't even get me started on the ""Everything is Hunny"" song portion, which has Pooh biting into a Pooh made out of hunny. Yes. Life-sized Poohs made of hunny spring out of a giant jar... and then Pooh EATS HIMSELF. Is this cannibalism? What is this? This is weird. That's what it is.

Then we have the Backson. Now, I was happy to see Owl's classic mis-reading of Christopher Robin's ""back soon"" note... but it quickly degenerated into utter and complete nonsense that never occurred in the book at all. Then this nonsense started sucking in other tales and chapters from the books, covering them in gooey nonsensicalness and spreading the nonsense even further. Disney basically took a small portion of ONE tale and turned it into the entire basis for several tales' existences and... Well, suffice to say, this basically turned what I THOUGHT would be an authentic re-telling of the classic stories into an exercise in how many ways you can change classic stories so they retain only the barest framework of what they once were.

Also, Winnie-the-Pooh would never stick his best friend Piglet's head into a beehive and then hit it with a stick. Come on now, Disney. That's entirely out of character. I did get some laughs from ""Tigger Two"" but that whole part was just ridiculous nonsense that never happened, either.

Ultimately, this was a cute and charming movie... if you're a child or a fan of Disney's rendition of Pooh. However, even then, I would imagine this film would feel a bit... familiar in that ""haven't I seen this before?"" way, only with worse music this time around and some unfortunate dabblings in eating food that is shaped like yourself. But since this IS ultimately a children's movie and I think children would be amused by it, I'm giving it 3 stars, instead of the 2 I would've given it otherwise.

This feature-length animated movie is really cute. (I've never read the original stories by A.A. Milne, so I can't compare; however, I do have some fond memories of watching the television series on ABC in hospitals as I'd sit in the waiting room whenever I went in for a doctor's appointment and reading Winnie The Pooh And The Blustery Day in my room when I was a kid). There are many chuckle-inducing moments, none of which are laced with the crude humour found in many ""Family"" films not made by Walt Disney Pictures. I recommend this film. And Ms. Deschanel is a very good singer. (I'd skip the pointless TV series New Girl that she stars in though; definitely not family-oriented. I stopped watching it in mid-March because I got frustrated with the shallowness of it). The voice casting for this movie is also spot-on. And stay through the end credits for a surprise. If you loved Piglet's Big Movie, you'll love Winnie The Pooh.

4666090,5,B005ELMC1U,"I do know that some reviewers may have reservations about seeing another Disney installment of the Pooh story.  Yes, there are ""purists"", like myself, who grew up watching Uncle Wally's original series with love and adoration.  I, as others, have been highly disappointed by Disney's output of Pooh stories in recent memory, including the awful Heffalump movie (had very little to do with the book).

I feel that Disney did great work with this installment.

It is a simple story (or two) about the need for the gang to find Eyeore's tail, but also the need to capture the ""Baksun"" - which is nothing more than the reworking of the Heffalump story.  I will not spoil the story.

I first watched this movie in the theatre with my youngest, and we were both laughing out loud.  Not only did the narrative have funny lines, but the script was written for children AND parents.  John Cleese does a great ""Narrator"" job.  Although many (if not all) of the original voices are from now long-deceased talents, the voices here were quite good.  The use of the book pages and the letters upon them made me feel somewhat nostalgic.  The story did not insult my intelligence, either.  I was bothered by the fact that Mr Gopher was not involved, but that is a small problem.

The chalkboard animation in the ""Baksun"" discussion is reminiscent of many early Disney works, including ""Donald (Duck) in Mathmagic Land"", and the musical ""Honey"" dream is also done well.  My family greatly enjoyed the scene in the ""hole"".  I am sure that there are other stories from other Pooh tales in the film, but I didn't obsess on that.  I also liked the backgrounds in the ending credits (you'll have to see the backgrounds to understand what I mean).

I must note that I bought the DVD so my family could watch the movie, which was only seen by my son and I the first time around.

I believe that Disney has redeemed themselves - as far as the Pooh story goes - especially after the much lesser ""Pooh's Heffalump Movie"" (2005), a movie I found insulting and poor.

Strong 5 of 5!  Even if, as a ""Pooh Purist"", you dislike this movie, your children should love it.  Mine certainly did, and it's not anywhere as bad as many Disney features.  It's quite tame and faithful to the early stuff, in my opinion.",1340236800,2,2277,4.57037037037037
4666091,1,B005ELMC1U,"I have loved Winnie the Pooh for a long time and was excited for the prospect of another good movie. I purchased this movie on DVD and have finally gotten around to watching it and am completely disappointed in this movie. The story line is completely unoriginal from previous Winnie the Pooh shows/movies which would not be horrible if the move was done well but this one is not. None of the characters look quite right compared. The changes to the story line are horrible at best. They have even gone so far as to change the personality of some of the characters which I find ridiculous. The songs in the movie are also atrocious, the one that have been used previously were changed for the worse and the new ones were no better. This movie put me off so much I couldn't even stand to watch the full 60 minutes of it. I guess for kids who have never watched any of the previous Winnie the Pooh movies it might be entertaining but for someone a little more dedicated it is a complete waste of time and money and I probably wouldn't even give it one star.",1339200000,13,1055,4.333333333333333
4666092,4,B005ELMC1U,"Being inarticulate enough to say what's wrong exactly, I'll try to give my impressions. It didn't feel right, and didn't leave the same satisfaction that Pooh normally would. Some of the songs were... weird? Modern maybe, or pointless? They just didn't fit with my idea of Pooh, but maybe they fit the movie fine because I got the same impression there. I don't know if it was pacing, or feeling, or exactly what, but instead of the mental tactile image of a fluffy bear I got more of a sleek or sandpaper bear. I think the attitude was just off. Probably they are trying to compete with all the other movies being made. So either it worked for them and they can now keep up with all the other loud and fast, gruff and fly by night fads out there, or what used to be different and special is gone, and instead of gaining something we lost something. It's still a decent story, with cute songs, and memorable characters - even if they are slightly distorted. I can't think of anything more pooh-like to recommend than Pooh, but as far as Pooh vs. Pooh, I think he was having one of Eeyore's bad days.",1337644800,,1099,4.392156862745098

The movie really does a great job of showcasing Eeyore's pessimistic attitude. At one point, he says ""We're all going to die"". But, it was done brilliantly and in a way that it was most amusing. As Eeyore is my favorite character, I might be a bit biased :)

My daughter found several parts very funny and enjoyed the story as a whole. I do think she got a bit bored at times. But, that went away after viewing it again at home.",1335312000,,725,4.034722222222222
4666095,2,B005ELMC1U,"I don't understand why everyone is giving this movie such high reviews?! This ""Winnie the Pooh"" movie isn't like ANY of the others Disney has created in the past. I will agree that the plot and story of the movie are fine. However, the characters aren't anything like the original characters. Rabbit is animated and, quite literally, acts like a ""Looney Tunes"" character with over exaggerated and unnatural facial expressions. Kanga and Roo have pointy ears...when they have always had round ears. And Kanga is super animated in personality when she is usually a calm character in the movies. And Christopher Robin looks nothing like any other previous movie either.

The movie seems to be written to over entertain kids with goofy jokes and being super silly, just like all of the other movies being made now. ""Winnie the Pooh"" movies have always strayed away from that, being calmer than regular kids' movies and relying on the characters to be funny themselves. This movie was trying way too hard to fit in with the general genre, and lost everything the series is known for in the process.",1334534400,13,1093,4.8449197860962565

What I loved about the trailer was the fresh new music they used - it was a soft indie rock track with kind male voice (""Somewhere Only We Know"" by English alternative rock band Keane). I also thought the movie bits in the trailer were cute, fresh and funny. I bought the movie on Blu-ray, and we made popcorn for a movie night at home. As I sat through this movie, I grew more and more disappointed. The music in this movie was baby-ish and even my kids were bored by it, and not once did they play the cool song from the trailer. When the movie ended, I felt completely ripped off. The plot was thin and devoid of emotional diversity built entirely around Pooh searching for some honey. There was zero character development. Educational value was zero. This movie had no soul. They used the old handwritten animation production style, which was kind of neat. In summary, I was so disappointed with this new Pooh movie, that I regretted spending the extra money on the Blu-ray version.

4666106,3,B005ELMC1U,"Unfortunately our 3-year-old wasn't held by this movie's charms...or by the lack of them.  The charms of this movie include the hand-drawn styles, a couple of clever songs (including the pretty voice of Zooey Deschanel), of course the classic character's were mostly handled with respect, and the interactions with the wording on the book's pages was at least clever.  But I felt that Eeyore's having lost his tail and the woods' denizens looking for it wasn't the best story to put up on the big screen.  It had some fun moments to it but it lacked the touch and overall deftness that a good Pooh story has with these iconic characters; it felt shallow.  That Tigger didn't dominate the movie was a pretty brave choice too (and a welcome one from my perspective) but it could have been so much better, as a children's movie, to have these characters overcome something that was truly frightening (as opposed to the notion that there are frightening things).  And since when did Owl become so dumb?

This movie, made for children, is inoffensive and clever at times (by far too clever as young children won't get the jokes of the characters misunderstanding each other or what is going on because of how different words can sound the same), and it won't turn off any Pooh afficionados but I can't see it making that many new friends for Pooh and his friends.  Still, there's certainly far, far, far worse out there to which we can subject the kiddies.

One last thing: as an adult watching this fare I appreciated the voice cast (never pin-pointed Craig Ferguson! as Owl) as it didn't take me out of the movie with an ""Oh!  I know who that is!"" type of moment except when Deschanel sang.  She has a winsome, lovely voice but she has been so all over TV and movies for the past few years all I could do was see her in my mind's eye when she sang.  But maybe that's just my own issue...  ""The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" was far better.",1330992000,,1942,4.517142857142857

Of course, I wanted to see both films, however, I wish Pooh was released a few days before Potter. It probably would have been recognized a bit more. Disney should have known Harry Potter was gonna outdo every other film at the box office. But, that doesn't matter now. I thought the animation was stunning, and Zooey Deschanel has the most beautiful singing voice. The DVD is pretty good. Glad Jim Cummings was back to voice both Pooh and Tigger. Bud Luckey (an animator at Pixar) voices Eeyore, and Tom Kenney (the voice of SpongeBob SquarePants) voices Rabbit. John Cleese (of Monty Python) was a perfect choice as the narrator because he sounds similar to Laurie Main (who was the narrator for ""Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore""). Despite that the film was short, it was the best film of 2011 that I've seen. Yes, I liked it better than Harry Potter (and HP fanboys/fangirls, yell at me all you want)!

The DVD has some good bonus features like ""The Ballad of Nessie"" (a short film that proceeded ""Winnie the Pooh"" in theaters), a couple ""Mini-Adventures"" shorts where they basically dub over previous Pooh projects and shorten them, which I'm not really a fan of.

It's less than 90 min making it feel like you just watched a short marathon of episodes on TV.  It doesn't stop abruptly--the pacing and flow of the story is fine--but when you reach the end you're left wanting more.  The voice of Rabbit bothered me a little because I am so used to the old voice of Rabbit, but that shouldn't stop anyone from buying this DVD.

It starts with Owl misreading one of Christopher Robin's notes leading everyone to believe he has been captured by the ""Backson"" (when CR said he would be ""back soon""). well...that has already been done, hasn't it? It is just filled with...filler.  Unmemorable songs, inconsistent characters, (rabbit is a soldier and Tigger wants another Tigger? what happened to him being the only one? and pooh's daydream that everything is honey with seems to be a knock-off of the ""Heffalumps and Woosels"" segment) And there's the side story with Eeyore losing his tail and whoever finds him a replacement wins a pot of honey.  I was also expecting familiar voices for the characters from the movie description.  Pooh's and Tigger's were the only ones that were the same! Eeyore, Rabbit, Piglet, Owl and Christopher Robin all had voices I did not recognize.  And Christopher Robin is taller and much skinnier than he used to be....sort of looking like a lanky teenager.  is he older or is he supposed to be super-skinny now? I was very unimpressed with this movie.  The only redeeming point is how the characters interact with the words in the book like the original movie.

Learning that the animation was hand drawn and that many of the songs were co-written by Robert Lopez (co-writer of the musicals&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Avenue-Q/dp/B0013D804G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Avenue Q</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Book-Of-Mormon/dp/B004ZCLL16/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Book Of Mormon</a>]) increased my anticipation and I was able to use Mr. Lopez's participation to sell my teenage daughter on seeing the movie.

There were times when I didn't think the new Pooh quite got the magical tone of the classic Pooh of my childhood, but it never strayed far. And, really, what can live up to idealized childhood memories?.

4666129,3,B005ELMC1U,"The genius about the original Winnie the Pooh series was the way the creator's captured innocence.  The makers of this new film seem to have lost their grasp of this innocence. The character's once cute-little-quirks have become more of a nuisance than lovable idiosyncrasies.  I do love Rabbit's character in this movie- they seemed to have replaced the ""angry hare"" with a more supportive, encouraging, and motivational friend.  However, Piglet's character wasn't so much timid as it was pathetic.  Eeyore is down right depressed, rather than what used to be just an occasionally pessimistic- baritone.  Owl is not just smart- he's a pushy know-it-all with a pinch of psychosis.  Some points of the movie seemed insulting to the characters.  It's a good movie, sure- but I give it three stars because I would have liked the characters to stay true; and the innocence to have remained.

4666130,4,B005ELMC1U,"I wanted to like this film. It does so many things right. It opens and closes with the cozy, bookish feel of the original Winnie adventures. The characters tumble out of Shepard's lovely, evocative illustrations (or ""decorations"" as they were quaintly called on the original dust jackets). The warm golden-honey/earth tones that are maintained throughout this all too brief, barely full-length animated sequence, invite you to nestle in, all snug.

Most of the plot elements are also taken directly from episodes in the books. There's Pooh's perennial search for honey. There's the search for Eeyore's tail. There's the concerted effort to foil the dread ""Backson"" (shortened from the dread ""Spotted or Herbaceous Backson"" that owl conjured for his less literate brethren in the original).

But something is lacking here. It's hard to say what it is. However, I don't think you'll be eternally charmed by the Pooh band if this is your only exposure to them.

Maybe Tigger is a big part of the problem. He's voiced like an old codger, instead of like the roaring, good-natured rumpus of a character he is in the books. What's more, he engages in some over-the-top fisticuffs that really turn almost brutal, breaking the spell of Pooh's enchanted woods. Perhaps the producers/writer for this film felt the original Pooh books were too tame and static for modern audiences of children - and so they injected some violent action into the proceedings, and tried to turn Tigger into an action-figure. But it doesn't work.

Then there's something a little forced about Pooh's frequent mispronunciations. They are a little too frequent here. Pooh begins to sound like Archie Bunker in the later days of ""Archie's Place"" when the writers for that series spin-off had run out of plot ideas and relied instead on Archie's improbable word-manglings for most of the humor.

Whatever it is, something is a little off in this translation of the books to screen. Of course it could be that I'm coming to it with the world-weary eye of an adult rather than with the wide-eyed innocence of childhood. Perhaps I, like Christopher Robin was fated to do, grew up and left the world of the Wood too far behind. But I don't think so. So I'd still issue that clichd advice that movie reviewers are always issuing. Better to ""Read the Book.""",1325548800,,2316,4.913043478260869

4666134,2,B005ELMC1U,"As a lifelong lover of both the original A.A. Milne Pooh stories and the original fully animated Disney Pooh short subjects, I am sorry to report that I found this latest effort falling far short of the mark both literally and figuratively.

The writers and directors here have tried so hard to create a light and airy trifle that they have succeeded only in producing something quite dull and leaden.  Striving hard for whimsy, they have lost the wit and wisdom that also informed the Pooh stories.

I think this effort made me laugh once in the course of what wound up being a very long hour.

Many things are wrong here.

Milne's Pooh, though a bear of ""very little brain,"" had more than his share of heart and common sense.  He would often save the day in his thoughtful, methodical way while the more self-absorbed Owl, Tigger, and Rabbit would fail in their wild schemes.

Above all, Pooh was a philosopher, motivated by much more than the grumblings of his stomach (which in this movie sound like Tigger growling, a disconcerting effect).  He was most of all loving and caring, seeking to help his friends with their dilemmas rather than just helping himself to honey.

This sense of selflessness is all but lost in this film, which starts on an off-note by focusing on Christopher Robin's penchant for collecting things, stuffed animals key among them (wink, wink, nudge, nudge, Disney Store shoppers!)

Though a line at the end of the credits notes that ""No stuffed animals were harmed in the making of this film,"" indeed these immortal characters have all been done a disservice, being reduced here to rather silly and vapid one-dimensional icons.

The listless plot, a concatenation of Milne stories, meanders off the path of logic as well, notably when the critters fall into a pit they have dug for the fearsome beast they believe may have kidnapped Christopher Robin -- and Owl flies out, as birds will, only to return to the pit without explanation and wait to be rescued with the others.

The traditional hand-drawn animation is rather plain and flat, and a number of the new voices fall flat as well, notably those of Tigger, Owl, Rabbit, and Kanga.

So parents wishing to share their love of Pooh with their young progeny would do better to read the Milne stories to their children -- or buy the DVDs of the ""classic"" Pooh short subjects from the sixties and seventies.

And if anyone at Disney still cares for the Pooh property as anything more than a profit center, they would be well advised to replace the creative team responsible for this lead-footed affair with some who are far more inspired.  I never thought I'd agree with Dorothy Parker on this, but this latest Pooh film made me too want to ""fwow up.""",1325462400,5,2731,4.69601677148847

4666141,4,B005ELMC1U,"While there is a long history of Winnie the Pooh stories, both books and films, I have never had much exposure to the character as a child.  Created by A.A Milne, the first collection of stories was released in 1926.  Disney adapted Winnie the Pooh into short films in the 1960's with Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree and Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day.  When previews for the 2011 film were released, my wife became very excited as the Blustery Day was a childhood favorite of her's.  Most importantly, my one and two year old children seemed entranced by the music and animation.

In fact, this is the first film either of my children have been able to watch start to finish. The series features Christopher Robin and his imaginery stuffed animal friends and their adventures in the Hundred Acre Wood. Story wise we see Winnie the Pooh's search for Honey, Eeyore's search for a new tail, and the whole crew's search for a missing Christopher Robin - who may or may not have been kidnapped by a mysterious creature called a Backson.

The animation is absolutely beautiful. I'm a fan of Pixar movies like just about everyone else, but it is nice for a change to see a film that isn't CG.  The voice work is equally well done.  Jim Cummings, a voice actor I recognize from just about every cartoon I watched as child, is Winnie the Pooh and Tiger.  Late night host Craig Ferguson is Owl, a casting choice that seemed odd to me, but works very well.  Additionally, John Cleese does a fine job as the narrator.

Actress and Singer Zooey Deschanel sings several songs on the soundtrack, including the theme song.  My children have the soundtrack as well as the film, and it's a toss up as to which one they enjoy more.

There is a lot on films/shows for children that are very difficult for adults to watch.  This is not one of those films.  It's entertaining and heartwarming for people of all ages.  The set has the Blu Ray, DVD, and a digital copy.  There are a few special features available, but I felt it was a bit light.  I'm surprised older Winnie the Pooh films such as the Blustery Day weren't included, or released separately at the time of the release of this film.  Having never seen them, I would like to watch them with my children. This film is only an hour long, an appropriate length for a film that is intended for a young audience, but some additional content on the disc would have made the price tag on this set seem more reasonable, as this set was $25 - $30 when released.  Given the amount of content, $15 - $20 at most, would be better.",1324771200,,2566,4.430703624733476
4666142,4,B005ELMC1U,"Returning to the style of the original Disney Pooh featurettes, this new movie has that same hand-drawn animation look with the classic warm watercolor backgrounds. Additionally, the movie opens with live scene set, a view of Christopher Robin's bedroom filled with toys. But what I appreciate the most is the storybook narration and wonderful integration of the book pages into the film. The characters interact with the text; they climb on the letters and walk on the pages of the book while the narrator (John Cleese) talks. It feels exactly as if the story has come to life. And there's enough subtle humor to amuse adults as well as children. Some of the hilarious scenes come directly from Milne's book like one where owl says they must ""issue a reward"" and Pooh thinks owl is sneezing. I think the film brings something special to the bantering dialog, making it even more humorous than the original text.

In usual Disney fashion, the plot of the movie is inspired by books but altered with a Disney twist. On an ordinary day, Pooh sets out to find some honey but gets sidetracked and ends up helping out his friends. Pooh discovers that poor Eeyore has lost his tail and the all the friends -- Tigger, Rabbit, Piglet, Kanga and Roo -- engage in a contest searching for a replacement. The group suggests all sorts of silly and inadequate replacement tails including a cuckoo clock, accordion, and dart board but nothing suffices. While thinking of a way to win the contest, Pooh discovers a note from Christopher Robin but, unable to read it himself, he takes it to Owl. Owl misinterprets the note, ""Gone out. Busy. Back soon."" With great concern, he remarks that Christopher Robin has been captured by a ""Backson."" The group then switches their focus on a way to capture the Backson, and Eeyore's tail eventually turns up. The film retains all the elements of the book chapter ""In Which Eeyore Loses a Tail and Pooh Finds One,"" but also expands on the idea, making the search for the tail into an elaborate contest, with a pot of honey as the prize. The Backson comes from ""In Which Rabbit Has a Busy Day"", though Backson is much more of a monster in the movie. Parts of the Backson hunt remind me of Piglet and Pooh's attempts to trap a Heffalump in the book.

There are two unusual song sequences in the movie, ""The Backson Song"" and ""Everything Is Honey"" where the animation departs from the traditional. In the Backson sequence, the animation looks like Owl's chalk drawings. And the ""Everything is Honey"" sequence, done in all honey-hued, golden colors, was interesting but was probably my least favorite part of the film because it just seemed out of place, with a retro synchronized swimming quality. Overall though, musically the movie shines, and I adore Zooey Deschanel's version of the signature ""Winnie the Pooh"" song and the happy go-lucky end credits song, ""So Long.""

*Blu-ray Bonus Features: Unfortunately, unlike many Disney films, I'm a little sad to report that this film does not seem to include any sort commentary, a behind-the-scenes bonus feature I typically enjoy. However, the backstory behind the film development is briefly discussed in the Blu-ray Bonus feature, ""Winnie the Pooh And His Story Too."" Directors Stephen Anderson and Don Hall also introduce 5 deleted scenes. In addition there's a Sing-Along as well as two different bonus shorts, ""Mini-Adventures of Winnie the Pooh: The Balloon"" and ""The Ballad of Nessie.""

Share your favorite Winnie the Pooh characters with a child and revisit the world of the One Hundred Acre Woods with this lighthearted family film. And then, once you're done watching, crack open one of Milne's books to compare and contrast the storyline. Whether found in the films or the books, Winnie the Pooh is and will always be the perfect prescription to satisfy your own urge for a smackerel of something sweet.

This adorable little movie was a very nice return to the quaint, classic, storybook-style Hundred Acre Woods, complete with interactive text. Many of the voices were, unfortunately, while not bad, too different to feel comfortable transitioning from the ones I'm used to. I dearly wished for the old Rabbit, Owl, Kanga, etc. Even Tigger sounded somehow slightly different from his usual self, although it was obviously still Jim Cummings. Pooh himself was the one who sounded the most like he always has--which is to say, completely the same. I love Bud Luckey, and he was a good choice for Eeyore, but there's simply no replacing the originals. I kept picturing the Jackalope from ""Boundin'"" the entire time, lol. (Or Chuckles from ""Toy Story III,"" or Rick Dicker from ""The Incredibles""...) It wasn't their fault, of course, that things couldn't be kept perfectly consistent--and indeed, these characters have changed voice actors before. Somehow, though, for the most part, all of the older ones felt more similar, more right, more appropriate, and more readily acceptable.

A few moments struck me as feeling slightly out-of-character, such as Roo's ""Send in the pig""--which was a funny line, regardless. Otherwise, the movie didn't feel very ""modern,"" which was a good thing. (And as a side note, I am convinced that Piglet is at least an armadillig, if not a ""purebred"" armadillo, despite his name and the frequent references to him being a ""swine."")

The songs were quite cute; I actually found myself humming or singing a few of them later on! They may not be the best or most memorable songs ever written for Pooh (those are still nearly impossible to equal), but they were good, and got my seal of approval. Zooey Deschanel's lovely, lilting tune that plays during the end credits is an added treat; in fact, she has a great musical talent, on par with her pop star doppelgnger. ;)

The movie IS rather short, perhaps just barely a full-length feature, so I am somewhat glad to have watched it at home, but I think that it still would have been a very worthwhile and enjoyable theater experience. The three basic storylines (Pooh's quest for honey, the search for a new Eeyore tail, and the ""Backson"" problem) were absolutely classic Pooh, and kept the film flowing along nicely. It had the cozy, warm, fuzzy quality of old Pooh--which is exactly what I was expecting, and the reason you should see it.

Its animation is marvelous--warm, old-fashioned, richly detailed, and true to the classics, although very exaggerated at times (e.g., Rabbit's facial expressions while trapped in the hole. Nothing wrong with this; it was quite amusing...just a tad surprising because it seemed more extreme than what I anticipated.) I always miss Gopher, whom rarely appears in newer Pooh movies.

It must be said that the ""Backson"" storyline was very similar to the plot of ""Pooh's Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin."" Owl misreads a harmless note left casually by Christopher to let his Hundred Acre Wood friends know that he'd be away for a spell, and works everyone up into a tizzy because he interprets it as a cry for help. Conjuring up images of deathly peril for Christopher and epic adventures for his friends as they try to save him, he leads the gang in a song, ultimately chickening out of the whole thing himself. Sound like way too much coincidence? Oh, definitely. There is no way they weren't intending to create another version of this, a variation on that theme. Why would one not expect Owl to do such a thing twice, or for the others not to be just as vulnerable to his sensational errors again? These characters, even the more intelligent ones, have never exactly been creatures of very much brain. ;)

So, yes...as Pooh is forever seeking his beloved ""hunny"" (but ultimately caring about nothing more than his friends), and Eeyore will probably never stop losing his tail and his house, this movie was primarily based upon things we have seen before. It really went back to the roots of Pooh, which is great--rather than being disappointing because we'd ""seen it before,"" it was refreshing to watch such pure, awesome Poohness again, in a different way. The ""swimming in the giant pot of honey"" was definitely reminiscent of past dream/fantasy sequences. ""Pooh's Grand Adventure"" is, however, one of my favorite movies and, I believe, a superior one in just about every way. Its story, songs, animation, script, characterization, etc., are utter perfection; I give it a full 10/10. This new 2011 film gets a solid 8 from me.

What this really makes you want to do is watch the all-time best Winnie the Pooh productions:

*Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree
*Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day
*Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore
*Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too
*The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (including holiday specials such as Winnie the Pooh and Christmas Too or Spookable Pooh, and the adventure- and learning-based video collections)
*Pooh's Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin

I mean, I could not possibly stress enough how every line, song, scene, scary bit, moving moment, and other memorable element of those episodes and features just sticks with you forever and floods you with happiness each time you think about it, no matter what. I can't imagine calling a childhood complete without growing up on those until they, like the thousands of other threads that make up the quilt of mine, are indelibly ingrained into one's mind and memory. Yeah...they are just that amazing.

More recent movies such as The Book of Pooh, Piglet's Big Movie, Pooh's Heffalump Movie, or The Tigger Movie, have all been cute and worth the watch, earning 6s or 7s from me...maybe one 5.

Bottom line: ""Winnie the Pooh"" is strongly recommended!!",1323561600,8,5858,4.894153225806452

4666185,5,B005ELMC1U,"Disney's return to the Hundred Acre Wood could also, in some sense, be considered a reintroduction of Winnie the Pooh to contemporary audiences. The new film takes its inspiration from three previously told stories written by original author A.A. Milne, one of which has already been made into film. Produced in traditional hand-drawn animation and featuring the talents of Jim Cummings, who has voiced Pooh since the late 1980s, and a cast of other accomplished voice actors, Winnie the Pooh finds the honey-loving bear on a dual mission to retrieve Eeyore's missing tail and to rescue Christopher Robin from a creature the gang has surmised is called a ""Backson."" Winnie the Pooh is an earnest throwback to the Pooh tales of old, filled with sweet nostalgia and gentle whimsy. Though it's aimed primarily at the young ones, those who grew up with Milne's classic tales should also get a little trip down memory lane out of the film, which makes it an enjoyable film for the whole family.",1320710400,,989,4.892857142857143
4666186,3,B005ELMC1U,"While I wasn't a huge fan of Winnie the Pooh when I was younger, I did enjoy the animated series that ran from 1988 to 1991, and of course I have fond memories of the old films. The gang getting lost in the woods, Poohsticks, the mystery surrounding Heffalumps and Woozles, Piglet being treated as a king in the Land of Milk and Honey...I can still remember it all 20+ years later. I felt really bad for this new movie when it came out and bombed in theaters. Here Disney was going back to a beloved franchise, sticking with traditional animation and keeping things simple, as they should be...but something seemed off. When I saw the trailer, I could just tell that all the best parts were shown in it, including the ending, and I wasn't too thrilled about the drastic change in a few voices (Owl and Christopher Robin in particular). Still, I gave it a chance, and the movie ended up being alright. It's just barely over an hour, has no objectionable content, and features most of the characters that everyone loves. But my problem is that they played it so safe that there's nothing that makes this feel like it deserved the theatrical treatment. If anything, this is an extended episode of the New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.

Once again, Eeyore has lost his tail, and it's up to Pooh and the other residents of the Hundred Acre Wood to find it. But in the process of finding it, another problem pops up- thanks to Owl's poor reading abilities, he reads a note from Christopher Robin (that reads 'Gon Out Bizy Back Soon') and thinks that a creature known as a Backson has taken him hostage. This leads to everyone trying to figure out how to deal with the monster and get CR back. Tigger thinks he needs a sidekick, and recruits Eeyore against his will, dressing him up as another Tigger. Pooh and Piglet dig a pit and cover it with a picnic blanket with a trail of things that Backsons like leading right to it. And of course, while this is all happening, Pooh is desperately trying to get his honey fix, having delusions of the world being covered in honey and other crazy things.

Since the movie is a little over an hour, it moves at a fast pace, with the story never really dragging on. But it's just so plain that it was hard for me to get into like the older Pooh films and episodes. I've went back recently and watched a lot of those to see if they hold up, and sure enough, they do. To me, this movie felt like an attempt to just win over people with a 'old school hand drawn animation equals good, right?!' mentality. I was really hoping that the story that was rumored a few years ago, about Christopher Robin growing up and not needing his stuffed animal friends any more, was going to be used here, but maybe that was too emotional for a Pooh movie? What's here works though, with a lot of fun plays on words (literally and figuratively- the storybook layout is used quite a bit), some memorable facial expressions from Rabbit, beautiful animation and art direction, and a lot of time spent with most of the characters. Tigger isn't featured very much, and Gopher isn't in the movie at all, but all the other regulars are here in full force. The movie definitely isn't bad, but it's not memorable either. I just watched it about 6 hours ago with my daughter, and I can remember more about the episode of Dexter's Laboratory we saw yesterday before dinner...and that was 1/3 the runtime of this movie.

Overall the movie looks great and the clarity on the blu-ray is stunning. You can see every detail perfectly here, from the scratchy look of Pooh's eyebrows when he thinks, to the black lines on Rabbit's fur getting riled up when something bad happens. Since the animation style for this movie is a slightly updated take on the way it was animated in previous Pooh movies, it's sure to visually please everyone. The audio gets good treatment as well, with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix. Winnie the Pooh sure doesn't need a booming track like this since it's mostly dialogue-driven with a couple of songs here and there, but it certainly gets the job done.

The special features are lacking compared to most other Disney releases this year, but it's still better than say, The Fox and the Hound's. There are 5 deleted scenes with introductions for why they were cut (ironically, it was usually for pacing), and some of them are complete while others are in sketches and storyboards. There's also what's pretty much a commercial for Disney goods that shows how you can set up your baby's nursery to have a Pooh theme. Yeah, you'll be skipping this one. There are also a sing-along feature and an option to jump to the songs in the movie. The only good special features here are the mini documentary that covers Pooh's journey from the original books to the short films by Disney, and the two bonus shorts 'The Ballad of Nessie' and 'Pooh's Balloon'. The documentary is great for Disney fans and the shorts are just plain nice to have. But apart from those, there's not much else to check out here.

It's certainly better than Cars 2, but for me Winnie the Pooh doesn't even come close to the likes of Rango or Kung Fu Panda 2. Those were both incredible movies in their own right, animated or not, and had plots and characters I cared for. This...is just a longer episode of Winnie the Pooh, using its good ol' Pooh formula. If this were a tv movie to kick off a new Pooh animated series on tv, that'd be cool, but this was a theatrical release. I can't stress it enough- this movie isn't bad, but it could've used a lot more effort instead of just going by the book. Rent it before buying unless you're a huge Pooh fan.",1320537600,7,5640,4.477162293488824
4666187,5,B005ELMC1U,"It wasn't loaded with special effects, blaring music, big splashy stars or explosions. Summer 2011's Disney theatrical release, ""Winnie the Pooh,"" was exactly the kind of animated film Walt Disney was making in the late '50s/early '60s -- not sweeping epics, nor pop music short packages, but simple, glowing stories packed with rich characterizations (both in writing and animation), superb voice work and hummable tunes.

Some found this film to be too much of a throwback, but how many modern films can truly rekindle the texture and charm of a classic without succumbing to the present day trappings and trends? Like the TV series ""Seinfeld"" was in its deceptively self effacing claim to be ""about nothing,"" Pooh's power lies shines his basic plotlines, only without the cynicism. A.A. Milne's books had slim storylines, too, and attempts to clutter them have met with mixed results.

First and foremost, ""Winnie the Pooh"" is one of the funniest movies of the year. I don't say this with any hint of irony or sarcasm, it's just true. Without messing around with the characters or updating the humor, you find yourself laughing at the clever ""who's on first"" wordplay. Pooh and pals may be guileless, a bit deluded and sometimes clueless, but they're not stupid or held to ridicule. This is very, very hard humor to pull off successfully.

The most clueless character of all is Owl, a character never fully realized in past ""Poohs"" but brought to scene-stealing fervor by the sharp vocal timing of Craig Ferguson, who with narrator John Cleese and Zooey Deschanel, are as far as the voice casting ventured into celebrity (but with respect to suitability, not just fame). Cheers to the creative team for retaining the seemingly endless talents of Jim Cummings as Pooh and Piglet rather than hiring a marquee name and wrecking the character for an easy marketing hook. Tom Kenny also does a wonderfully neurotic Rabbit, and my kids got a kick out of hearing wisps of his Spongebob voice peeking out within the characterization.

The musical score by Robert Rodriguez and Kristen Anderson-Rodriguez (she also voices Kanga) is a tribute to the Sherman Brothers' art of the deceptively simple and infinitely singable song. I can't help but assume that the chorus singing ""hunny, hunny..."" was a nod to the Wonderful World of Color theme (""color,  color..."").

The Blu-ray looks marvelous, but I was a little let down by the lack of extras. No commentary, not much behind the scenes stuff, pretty lacking all around. Most interesting were the deleted scenes. Charming as they were, the scenes were cut because, it seems from the explanation, to keep the story focused and evenhanded. Although Owl is a scene stealer, he's never the complete focus. Each character gets a sufficient time to shine, even ""B'loon."" The filmmakers even resisted padding the feature to make it longer, instead adding on The Ballad of Nessie (another film that could have been released in the early Disney/Pooh days). Historically, ""Dumbo"" was a short feature too, but it's a gem at its ideal running time.

I can only hope they're saving some additional features for a reissue in the future, because this Pooh should not get lost in a sea of direct-to-video movies. Not to slight them all (many were very nice), but it's pretty crowded out there with Pooh videos. Maybe that's why the title is simply ""Winnie the Pooh"" with no subtitle, in order to set it apart from the pack.",1320278400,18,3450,4.927710843373494
4666188,4,B005ELMC1U,"I will openly admit that I was enchanted by this film.  It was such a wonderful theatrical experience for me, so nostalgic and heartwarming, and to be able to share it with my daughters was such a joy for me and my wife.  Watching their faces light up as the characters I grew up loving personally caught their eye and entered their hearts was such a wondrous experience and one that I will remember always.

It is with such strong sentiment that I write this review.

Personally, `Winnie the Pooh's greatest asset is also its sole weakness.  It is pristinely `simple' in texture.  There really isn't any thematic depth at play here and so it instantly captures your attention but it lacks any and all poignancy or profound depth of development to warrant rapturous praise.  That is why I mention the fact that I review this on the grounds of sentiment, because it is that sentiment that will endear this film to you; nothing else.

The film brings nothing new to the table, unless you consider its rustic roots `new' in today's modern take on animated features.

The film is constructed in such sharp contrast to animated features of today.  It is narrated, it is hand drawn, it is told in storybook form and feels outdated yet surprisingly polished for a film so steeped in the qualities of yesteryear.  The plot is fairly simple and somewhat pointless.  A misunderstanding turns into panic that is easily resolved.  Nothing more; nothing less.  The love here stems from the beautifully fluid way in which the film is conceived.  It is done almost dreamily, capturing the effortless ease with which these characters live their lives and it captures the boyish imagination (simple and honed as opposed to wildly bizarre) and takes you back to a place and time when life wasn't so complicated.  This is a youthful and beautifully charmed children's movie that is as much FOR children as it is ABOUT them.

And with vocal talent Zooey Deschanel on board, the musical accompaniment is an added bonus.

I thoroughly enjoyed this.  The running time was perfect (not too long, not too short; just right) and the overall satisfaction I received (as well as my family) was as much as I could really hope for.  It is not as smart as a Pixar film, sure.  It will not leave you with the emotional lump that `Up' would, and it won't visually stimulate you as much as `Finding Nemo' will and it won't excite you in the way that `The Incredibles' will, but it will put a gigantic smile on your face, and thankfully this one won't go over your children's heads!",1320105600,,2547,4.6532438478747205

Love this new Pooh movie which features Eeorye this time (they're had a Piglet and Tigger movie in case you've missed those).

As always the Hundred Acre Wood delivers a heartwarming story of friendship as the gang - Pooh, Tigger, Rabbit, Owl, Piglet, Kanga, Roo, Eeryore, and Christopher Robin - face hurdles in life. On October 25th you'll feel more than just a little rumbly in your tummy Pooh style as you hunger for the newest Winnie the Pooh movie on DVD. This newest theatrically featured movie has all of your most loved A.A. Milnes characters in their Disney made-over form on a lost and found hunt. In this tale Eeyore has lost his tail, and Christopher Robin has gone missing. Though Eeroye's tail is a definite mystery, the friends are sent on a wild goose chance to find him a new one while in the middle of their quest Christopher Robin is captured by the Backson monster.

I have to say my 4YO ""scaredy-cat"" is afraid of the Backson. He'll bite his nails through the movie hoping the Backson doesn't get his beloved friends of the Hundred Acre Wood; so he especially hates the end when they show an actual Backson.

4666195,5,B005ELMC1U,Winnie the Pooh has never looked better! I'm happy to re-introduce Disney's Winnie the Pooh to my kids. Such a wonderful and sweet movie that the whole family loved. Can't wait till it releases on Blu-Ray. My kids will be so entertained again...and I will as well. ;),1318636800,3,267,4.583333333333333
4666196,3,B005ELMC1U,"Winnie the Pooh is an animated film made specifically for children, with none of the innuendo or adult humor commonly incorporated into animated films to keep parents entertained. Effectively, the material isn't dumbed-down to completely alienate anyone under the age of four like the recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yogi-Bear/dp/B002ZG99WW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yogi Bear</a>. For children, Winnie the Pooh is, in some respects, the perfect movie. It has familiar characters, a simple story, beautiful, soft colors, and parents will likely hear no complaints from their children about it. However, children aren't the ones reading reviews. For the average adult, Winnie the Pooh is certainly not ""bad,"" but there are some inconsistencies and imperfections that can't be overlooked.

The film draws inspiration from three stories by Winnie the Pooh creator A.A. Milne and is narrated by John Cleese while following a storybook format in which the stories appear as if being read from a book. The gang is looking for the perpetually depressed Eeyore's missing tail, although Pooh is mostly preoccupied with his quest for honey. Meanwhile, they're trying to avoid confrontation with the ""Bacson,"" a monster whom they believe has kidnapped Christopher Robin. The film has a couple musical numbers, but nothing bombastic. The most memorable music comes from actress Zooey Deschanel, whose old-timey crooning underscores several scenes and adds to the classic, throwback feel of the whole thing.

Winnie the Pooh, in book, movie, and television form was a staple of my childhood but one with which my familiarity has waned since. There are elements of these stories that I look at differently now and things I was unaware of as a child. In some ways, the enjoyment I took from this film spawned from the nostalgic trip through childhood it provides. Seeing Owl (voiced by an unrecognizable Craig Ferguson) as an egotistical, pseudo-intellectual and Eeyore as clinically depressed and in desperate need of counseling adds a different perspective to the whole thing now that I'm older. It's worth noting that Eeyore is the scene-stealer here, with some great voice-work by Bud Luckey and some very emotive expressions in the animation.

It's nice to see Disney return to their roots with varying levels of success and not making any attempt to modernize Winnie the Pooh, which is how it should be. There is nothing that is downright bad, nothing that should've been scrapped from the film and replaced. The good completely outweighs the bad. The film is undeniably charming and adorable. It's refreshingly hand-drawn and looks beautiful, with CGI that is hardly noticeable mixed in for effect. Children will be delighted by it, while adults will enjoy the nostalgic trip down memory lane and the good message about helping others. The film is definitely a children's film through-and-through, but it's not so offensively childish that it will turn away an adult audience.

The biggest problem is that it isn't quite up to theatrical film standards and is like high-quality straight-to-video fare. Running a mere 51-minutes, not counting credits and an amusing post-credits scene, it's underdeveloped and half an hour shy of ""feature-length."" With plenty of stories to draw from, it's inconceivable that the running time couldn't have been stretched to at least 80 minutes. Winnie the Pooh will be most enjoyed by children but won't waste your time if you decide to watch it with them. It could have been a fantastic success, critically and financially for Disney, as it features one of their most beloved characters and is a 2D, mostly hand-drawn film in a time of excessive 3D and almost exclusive CGI. With a strong critical reception and box-office records that indicate it broke even with its budget, it's probably not a failure in their eyes nor a great success. I see it the same way.

4666197,4,B005ELMC1U,"We took our two oldest children to see this movie in the theater. They are 4 and 2. They really enjoyed it. I have this movie on pre-order because of that fact. But it quite possibly is the most boring movie I have ever seen. And I LOVE watching documentaries and educational movies, Disney Oceans, and March of the Penguins fascinated me. But this was just too much. I also zone out when I watch TV, I get so into it, but I was counting ceiling tiles in the theater with this one. Thankfully it was blessedly short, under an hour. Perfect for the younger crowd, but you have to be pretty nostalgic to be able to watch this more than once as an adult. Hopefully it still keeps their attention when it arrives, and wasn't just the novelty of going to the theater that captivated them.",1314921600,,783,4.333333333333333
4666198,5,B005ELMC1U,"We took our 4 year old to see this movie in the theater.  It was so cute!  We read the original stories at home and it was neat for him to see them come to life on the screen.  (Albeit with a few tweaks and changes.)  He enjoyed the play on words and seeing the words on the screen.  He has since been trying to sound out words more and asking how to spell things.  The movie theater had people of all ages in it and we heard more laughter during the movie than we did at the theater during Cars II.  It was refreshing to see a kids movie without explosions or violence.  I recommended this movie to a lot of friends and for once I didn't have to say ""it was a great movie except..."".  There was nothing in the movie that scared our little one at all.  We will be purchasing this DVD as soon as it is available.",1314057600,77,811,3.950617283950617
4666199,5,B005ELMC1U,"We took our two children for a super extra special treat - a trip to the theater to watch Winnie Pooh, a character they had previously only seen in books. I had high hopes for this movie - and they were exceeded.

I love the animation. I love the styling and the fact that it looks like they are in a book.

I love the story. I love the plot and I love the character development and I love how close to the original books they are.

I love the length. One hour is just long enough to be a sit down movie but not so long my children completely lose interest.

Overall I loved this movie. It was nostalgic, classic, clever, and funny in all the right ways. I don't buy a lot of videos, but this one is definitely going on my shelf!",1313107200,27,729,4.006896551724138
4666200,5,B005ELMC1U,"I've watched this movie 3 times in the theater with my 5 year old son,
and ordered the pre-release for him.  While this movie my not be entertaining for young adults
and older children, my son loved it. The movie was short and the credits were long. Upon watching
the film the third time I decided to stay and wait out the leaving audience and finish off the
credits, and was rewarded with the previously missed ending. The star of the obnoxious
song ""The Backson"" makes an appearance at the film's end in a somewhat funny manner. Sure there
wasn't much of a plot to the movie, but there was enough action and interaction between characters
to entertain my 5 year old. This movie is definitely targeted at younger children and Pooh Fans,
but it was a lot more tolerable than a lot of the other stuff out there like Toy story 3, Polar Express
and Shriek 3 to name a few. Good safe family fun seems to fit pretty well.",1313020800,5,916,4.356725146198831
