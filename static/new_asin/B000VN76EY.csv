8323546,1,B000VN76EY,"This DVD will get 1 star. I should have known this DVD was gonna be trash. Amazon really needs to watch the false advertisement, because this entire DVD is in black and white, but the description says color. The footage is grainy and very low quality. The voices are distorted, someone thought it would be cool to chop and screw the voices.  I love documentary's but this is straight trash. PLEASE BE ADVISED FALSE ADVERTISING!!!",1323734400,,429,4.72
