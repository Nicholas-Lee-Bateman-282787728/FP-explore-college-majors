2438675,4,B000BR9SA0,"I personally did not watch the show much when it first came out, finding it a bit light and lacking in ""edginess,"" if you know what I mean.  I was psyched about the more science-y details (a ship with water-filled corridors for a dolphin shipmate, cross-species communication, cool sets, etc.).  I did watch it in re-runs much later on the Sci-Fi Channel and thought then that I was an absolute idiot for not just sticking with it the first time around.  Especially when it got the the third season.  (I did the same thing with Earth:2, a show I would put on par with this one quality-wise, though Earth:2 never made it past its first, rather engrossing, season.)  When I think of SeaQuest DSV, I think of that third season first, and then my soft spot for the first season.  Though, as a real sci-fi nerd who has a soft spot for anything science-tinged and including any amount of special effects, I have to say I really enjoyed this series from start to finish.  I personally was pretty psyched about the second-season ending alien story arc with Luke Skywalker along for the ride, though some posters here apparently felt it was a bit over the top.  Me like sci fi . . .

Anyway, if you're like me and have even been bottom-feeding off cheap DVD sets of shows like Starhunter just because you can't resist anything with a spaceship and a CGI budget of any size at all, boy are you in for a treat with this show.  It's underwater and it even has spaceships (kind of).  This show was done with vision, good character actors, a major network budget, and actual story arcs in mind.  I do believe this was a brainchild of the producer who eventually brought us the beloved Farscape series.  Though that level of quirky genious is not present in this show (it was, after all, 7 or 8 PM Sunday night NBC fare, if I remember correctly), you get a feeling there is some real loving work crafted into SeaQuest that is not present in a lot of genre work.  Is this worth your sci-fi dollar?  Yes, it is.  While not on the same level (in my mind) as epics like Babylon 5 (I am a JMS devotee) or even Farscape, it competes with the last few years of Start Trek:TNG and certainly holds its own against Voyager or Enterprise.  It certainly is not something like Battlestar Galactica as re-done on the Sci Fi Channel (it's just not that edgy).  But, there are a couple of characters  in here that you will enjoy spending time with and some eye-candy your CGI-craving brain will pull you toward.

In fact, skip a couple of those cheaper sets that might get you more episodes for your dollar and sink the cash into SeaQuest DSV.  You won't be disappointed with the investment.",1132617600,,2660,4.454545454545454
2438676,5,B000BR9SA0,"Best show in it's genre, be it Sci-fi, Drama, or adventure.

It's premeire on DVD is long past due. Season One is the Best of Three. Blessed be to those that have past Jonathan Brandis and Royce D. Applegate, long life those who live on Roy Scheider, Stephanie Beacham, Don Franklin, Stacey Haiduk, etc.",1131840000,4,303,4.611111111111111
2438677,4,B000BR9SA0,"I really enjoyed the first season of the show, but then it slowly fell (like it's 60's predecessor 'Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea') into silly storylines that had nothing to do with undersea exploration and -- quixoticaly -- a lot to do with space aliens.

I wonder if they delayed releasing it this long because they were considering redoing the undersea CGI effects. Those were notoriouly difficult then, and there was a rumor that production was slowed because they didn't have the computing power to do a sequence lasting more than about 15 seconds.

But the best fun was Bridger and Westphalen (Scheider and Beacham having a grand time), and the handsome crew of Ford, Lucas, O'Neill, Ortiz, (and later Brody and Piccolo -- what was their target audience?) with stunt guest stars Mark Hamill and Kent Cord.

I personally have worn out my VCR tape of the pilot, with Shelley Hack chewing the hell out of the hull scenery, so I am looking forward to seeing the DVD quality.",1131494400,3,978,4.674418604651163

2438680,5,B000BR9SA0,"I would have to say that seaquest dsv was my favorite show of all time. I remember back in 1993 watching every episode from the first season fathfully the production value of the show was very high, probably the highest ever for a tv show. I could not wait to see the second season but much to my suprise the second season was less than steller it made me not even want to watch any more episodes, lets admit it the second season stunk! it was nothing like the first season. But then came the third season and oh my god! they were really on to something! micheal ironside the new captain, yes!! but I guess it was to little to late as the series was cancelled after only 13 episodes into the third season (I was pretty much destroyed at the time) the show finaly got better and then they pull the plug! from what I hear the cast and crew were having lots of problems and the producers basicly just gave up on the show. well it's nice the see it finaly coming to dvd and now my dvd collection will be one step closer to being complete. If you haven't seen this show give it a try you won't be disapointed.",1130284800,4,1104,4.163551401869159
2438681,5,B000BR9SA0,"I cannot tell you how long I have waited to have this show on DVD.  I am going to be waiting by my mail box in the snow on December 26th in hopeful anticipation to see SeaQuest finally in my DVD collection.  When this show was on television originally I waited every week with excitement to see what would happen next.  I was young at the time and this was the first television show that made me feel that way.  This was the show that hooked me on sci fi.  A talking dolfin, a hot rebellious teenager who was a genius and great story plots that sucked you in immediately.  It is about time that seaquest came out on DVD and joined the ranks of its fellow comrades that were cancelled way too soon.  Although it did have more of a chance then others.",1130025600,3,749,4.159722222222222
2438682,5,B000BR9SA0,"Come on. The show had a talking dolphin with his own scuba gear. It should have been released onto DVD much sooner than this!

I, for one, am overjoyed that I will soon be able to enjoy the wonders of Darwin, Bridger, and the late Jonathan Brandis in the comfort of my living room. If entire seasons of The Bachelor are out already on DVD, Seaquest was way overdue. I'm glad this oversight has finally been remedied.

I loved this show when it was a weekly series and I am glad to have this set.  The plots are both simple and intricate but I love the peace message of the show and the fact that we don't have a lot of killing and bloodshed.  It seems if we don't see gallons of blood today and super fast action, the movie doesn't appeal.  Well Seaquest DSV doesn't need the blood or the super fast action and it is a great show for young and old alike.  The DVDs are of good quality.  I found one in the set that had a slight glitch in it but it was only a few seconds and didn't really affect the quality of the movie.",1491436800,,705,3.9645390070921986

2438752,2,B000BR9SA0,"We are 3/4 of the way through Season One and enjoy the episodes.

We can ""rewind"" back to the skip and often go through the problem spot (and all that was skipped) without issue, but this little exercise happens four or five times in an episode. This is why I rate this 3 stars. I rate the stories themselves as 5 stars.

I hope to be able to return season one, but have not attempted to do so yet. I have read other reviews of other DVDs that report similar problems and say that they found out the problem with their DVD set when it was too late for return. I now will not purchase any DVD set where reviewers make note of these kinds of problems, mostly based on my bad experience with the viewing of DSV season 1.

2438757,5,B000BR9SA0,"I loved this series in its first season. Roy Scheider was perfect as the submarine's captain/designer, Nathan Hale Bridger (though I kept thinking of his line from Jaws: ""You're gonna need a bigger boat"").

The SeaQuest was definitely a ""bigger boat."" My son suggested the series might have been inspired by another TV series from thirty years earlier, Irwin Allen's Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. I don't know if that's the case or not, but there are certainly some basic similarities.

The first season cast were all spot-on in their roles, including Jonathan Brandis as the quirky young genius; Don Franklin and Stacy Haiduk as the by-the-book officers; John D'Aquino as the resident scoundrel with a penchant for getting himself and his shipmates into trouble; Royce Applegate as Bridger's old friend and security chief; Stephanie Beacham as the SeaQuest's chief science officer; and Darwin the ""talking"" dolphin.

Unfortunately, some of those cast members departed and the series jumped the shark at the beginning of the second season. By Season 3, it was so unwatchable it was begging to be removed from life support and allowed to die with what little dignity it had left. My recommendation: buy the first season DVDs and skip the rest.",1379808000,,1245,5.004830917874396

It could work in reality. Then after a successful first season the writers caught the Voyage to the bottom of the sea disease. That is straying too far from reality to space monsters, flying saucers ect. So star Roy Scheider departed and the series was soon cancelled after season 2.

This is one of those series that is a hidden gem that somehow I missed when it was on back in the early 90's.  If you are a fan of science fiction or even just a fan of Roy Schieder then you will enjoy this series.

I think I saw another reviewer say something like this is Star Trek under water and I have to say that's a really accurate description.  There is a great deal of the human element involved in these episodes and there is a ecological undertone to many episodes as well expressed with an attitude of innocence that is rather charming.

Perhaps one other part of this series that struck a chord with me is what I would call the ""Galaxy Quest"" intro.  I thought Galaxy Quest was a very good parody and now having seen the introduction to Seaqust DSV I know that they weren't just parodying Star Trek, but this series as well.

There is much to watch here and the efforts of many good people to watch as well.  Stephen Speilberg, Roy Scheider and a great supporting case are a few that should be mentioned.  It was even a pleasant surprise to see Dom DeLuise in one episode(and his sons in many others).

DVD Case had to be replaced due to over-lapping discs.

I first saw seaQuest on the Sci-Fi channel (back when it was the Sci-Fi channel) in daily syndication.  Since I had missed the show when it aired, it was nice to catch-up with it then.  But, the show was like three different series with almost the same name (Seasons 1 and 2 were ""seaQuest DSV"", Season 3 was ""seaQuest 2032"").  The first season, and the best, was a show more based in science -- with an optimistic outlook and an emphasis on exploration and incredible undersea rescues.  Second season, which I'm currently re-watching, had more of an science-fantasy approach.  If your memory of seaQuest is of lots of bad CGI sea monsters, and Roy Scheider with a full beard - you saw second season.  The third season was a disaster on wheels - almost the entire cast was pulled from the series (including Scheider, who only shows up in a couple eps. as a guest star).

The Set-Up (First season):  In 2018, following a series of geopolitical conflicts and wars, ""The Peace"" has been established.  Economic confederations rule the globe - and have turned to the Oceans, for farming, living and working under water, research and discovery, etc.  The peacekeeping force for the Oceans is the UEO -- United Earth Oceans, charged with defending the fragile eco-systems of the Earth (several ecological disasters have also occurred), as a central organizing force for the world's scientists and explorers, and, when needed, a military force - set to keep the peace.  As the ""police of the Oceans"" the UEO also runs rescue operations for the new civilian operations in the oceans: farms, mines, manufacturing, etc.

The seaQuest, is the flagship of the UEO - her biggest, fastest, best-armed, and capable of diving the deepest submersible.  She's the brainchild of Nathan Bridger, a man interested in science and a member of the Navy and the UEO.  During the first season, Bridger is called back to be captain of the seaQuest.  Bridger had left the project when his son was killed in action, and retired from the Navy and the UEO.  He had moved to an island with his wife, but she soon passes away as well, leaving him alone.

In the pilot, seaQuest's captain (Shelly Hack) has a nervous breakdown and nearly starts a war, or at the very least a international incident.  The UEO desperately tries to get Captain Nathan Bridger (Roy Scheider) back.  The SeaQuest was Bridger's baby -- he designed her, and meant the ship to be an exploration and research vessel for science.  The boat is also equipped for and expected to handle rescues in the ocean.  So when UEO (United Earth Oceans, a paramilitary peacekeeping force) contacts him to command seaQuest, Bridger says no way.  But, as these things do, he's convinced to come back and take the helm.  However, Bridger's management style is not typical Navy brass, and he doesn't approach things from a military viewpoint.  Yet, he is able to use the ship's power and weapons when needed.  A few episodes into the first season, it's revealed that Bridger has a high psi rating -- which gives him an advantage in negotiating.

The first season crew form a nice ensemble group - and I missed that in the second season.  And yes, this is the show with the talking Dolphin (Darwin) -- Bridger's ""pet"" whom he rescued and nursed back to health.  Darwin had been caught in and washed ashore in a fishing net.  However, the ""talking"" is given a scientific explanation for this futuristic series (set in 2018) -- Lucas Wolenczek develops a ""voc-corder"" which takes Darwin's clicks and whistles and translates them through a computer, after a basis of words are established.  Frank Welker of The Real Ghostbusters provides Darwin's voice.  Hey, it's no worse than Babel fish translators on-line.

The villains in the first season were always people, or corporations, and not angry sea monsters.  The issues sometimes vaguely environmental, but not over-done.  Other episodes, such as ""The Good Death"" dealt with human rights issues.  Still other episodes dealt with providing deep-sea rescues in impossible (and big) situations.  The SeaQuest was the biggest, fastest, and had the ability to dive the deepest of any ship or sub in the UEO fleet -- so it was only sent to the worst disasters.  In other words, this show inherited part of it's make-up from another of my favorites:  Thunderbirds.

I liked the character interaction as well.  Bridger, a widower, slowly begins to fall for Dr. Westphalen, a divorcee with grown children.  Bridger also became pseudo-father to 16-year-old Lucas, wunderkid and computer genius, but not nearly as annoying as Ensign Crusher.  So Bridger, the man who had lost his wife and son at the beginning of the series, was beginning to form a new family -- on seaQuest.  And, in a sense, the entire crew could be looked as a family, though it's almost cliched to say it.  I also liked Krieg, the morale and supply officer (think Klinger without the dresses) who had been married to the ship's third in command, Katie. And the wonderful Ted Raimi plays the ship's communications officer, who is also an expert in languages.

The first season of seaQuest had a wonderful optimistic quality to it.  The boat, seaQuest, was a research and exploration vessel that participated in rescue missions as well.  It many ways, it was an undersea Star Trek.  I wish the show had stayed that way!

The show was fun -- and I wish they had kept the first season cast and concepts for the entire three years.  I flew through watching this series -- watching four discs in a weekend, and having two marathon sessions of watching a full disc (4 episodes) on Monday and finishing up on Tuesday - even after worked a full 8-hour day at work.

A note on versions:  I bought the PAL set because it's single-sided discs in a six-disc set.  According to the notes on Amazon, the US version is four double-sided discs.  I hate double-sided discs!  Copy quality was nice and crisp -- I love actual film, as opposed to videotape!  However, to watch the version I bought one does need to have a region-free and multi-system DVD player that's capable of correctly outputting a PAL signal to a US (NTSC) TV.

DVD Extras are minimal and  consist of deleted scenes on nine episodes.  Also, Dr. Robert Ballard's sea facts/comments on the ending credits are intact.",1332633600,,6563,4.798394290811776

I was expecting to not be as excited about the show, since I watched it originally through the eyes of a teenager, but I still very much enjoyed it. And am now re-watching with a friend of mine who has never seen it.

The character relationships were nicely developed, and continued to be as the series progressed. As with any series, there were some good episodes and bad. The acting was good, notably Roy Sheider, Stephanie Beacham and Jonathan Brandis, but, really, they were all good. Either they were well directed, or they were just very talented actors who knew just the right amount of emotion and depth to give to a scene.

The show mixed science fact with science fiction and for the most part was quite believable as something that could really be manufactured 12 years from now.

As with most early 90's shows, the CGI isn't perfect. You probably don't want to watch on an HD tv. But I can get past it because I really like the characters and most of the stories.

2438795,5,B000BR9SA0,"seaQuest DSV had a tragically short running (at two and a half seasons), but managed to be clever, unique, and entertaining. As a hard-core sci-fi fanatic, I enjoyed the fresh perspective this brought to the genre, exploring the fantastic world of the oceans, rather than deep space. While sometimes a little heavy on environmetal issues, this futuristic underwater saga had a good heart, and a strong cast, particularly in the first season. Roy Scheider shines as the unwilling captain (an amusing turn after his understandably hydrophobic role in 'Jaws'), and the role generally filled by the requisite alien is instead filled by a dolphin rigged with an English communication device. Often pigeonholed as simply Star Trek: TNG under water, I think this show actually carried itself to inventive heights of storytelling and interpersonal interraction. The mentor/father/son relationship developed between Captain Bridger and Lucas, the ship's 16-yr.-old computer genius, was done particularly well, and is a type of relationship too often overlooked in most recent entertainment. I personally particularly enjoy the performance of Ted Raimi as Lt. jg. Tim O'Neill, the serious-but-jumpy, multi-linguistic communications officer. If you are a fan of anyone in the cast, or are simply looking for a different take on science fiction, I would highly recommend this series.",1176249600,4,1371,5.502369668246446

2438798,5,B000BR9SA0,"I was a HUGE fan of seaQuest when it first came out. I loved that show. It was the best original sci-fi series on TV at that point. It really became something of a phoenomenon, because sci-fi shows traditionally did not fair well on the mainstream networks. This DVD set contains the first season, and it is a treat. I miss rushing home to watch it on Sunday nights. The characters in this season are amazing. I thought that Roy Scheider was born to play Captain Bridger. Jonathan Brandis was also wondeful as Lucas.

This show was amazing, until for some riduculous reason, they reworked the premise. They expanded the show to include subpar characters, dumb situations, and they even moved the thing out of the sea (what is the point to naming the show seaQuest if it happens in outer space?). In the end, the writers and producers tried to fix something that was not broken, and led to the demise of what could have been a long-running, epic show.

2438805,5,B000BR9SA0,"In regard to the first season, the plot was intelligent, entertaining and besides the x-files... it was also the only good thing on tv. The show still has a cult following, with all-day marathons occasionally showing up on tv.

One of highlights of this series, is the heart-warming interaction between the fatherly Nathen Bridger & Lucas Wolenczak, who's parents have sent him away to board the Seaquest DSV (Deep Submergence Vehicle). There is also the strong and unusual friendship between Lucas Wolenczak and Darwin the talking dolphin.

The following seasons were dumbed down somewhat and less unique, appearing to have barrowed their plots from from myths, urban legends and even paranormal phenomena.

From the beginning, the series had already been futuristic, taking place around 2012 but the final season took the SeaQuest into outer space where the crew dissapeared until 2032. In a show that emphisized the ocean as the ""final frontier"", the leap into space created an entirely new television series with none of the original charm.

I highly recomend the first series to anyone of any age. I'd recommend the following seasons to die-hard SeaQuest fans and if you're crazy for anything starring the former Jedi Mark Hammill, maybe you'll enjoy 2032.

2438808,4,B000BR9SA0,Thanks for making the product available. I'll buy the second season just get it out there. Fast delivery. Loved every episode. It was the only good sci-fi show in the '90's. The fact that I can watch 10+ years later says something for the writing/acting. I found that a couple of the disks skipped during random episodes. I don't know the end of one episode on the first disk because it stopped and would not continue. Other than that I love it and like Firefly will watch it again.,1151539200,3,482,4.426966292134831
2438809,4,B000BR9SA0,"I like Seaquest DSV. It was an updating of the classic Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. What amazes me is the adventure show (which was done in  1993) does not date itself.

Roy Scheider (Captain Bridger) reminds me of Richard Basehard's Admiral Nelson. The updating is similar to the 60's series, but this show is more high tech and eco sounding. The ship seem to look akin to the Seaview. That where the updating ends.

Voyage's crew was mainly men. The second in command is a woman and so is the ship's Doctor, which parelleled Star Trek Next Generation casting . It works for this series as it did for Next Gen.

The guest stars are a who's who of talent-Such actors as  Roscoe Lee Brown, William Shatner, Charlton Heston (a rare TV appearnace) to a pre-buffy Seth Green and a pre-ER Kellie Martin

The DVD have only deleted scenes as the extras. I wish Universal  would have spent a few dollars and got someone to do option commentary. Even if it would be the producers

The plots are good. The shows holds up. So when is Universal releasing season two and three?

2438812,3,B000BR9SA0,"It's a great show, and I love it, but this boxed set was disappointing. I didn't buy it on amazon but at a local store. They had it maked up to 60 dollars, but since they were going out of business, I got it for 35 bucks. And of course amazon is cheaper than 60.

However, usually the price tells you a bit about the quality. This set doesn't even have decorated dvd's because they're two sided. This is annoying because after two episodes, you need to get up and flip the dvd over to it's other side. I felt this was a way to save cost, but really, I have the Stargate SG-1 season sets and they're about the same number of episodes per dvd and the SG-1 sets are equal in price to amazon and decorated. And they aren't two sided which allows you to watch all the episodes on a dvd at one time with no interruption.

Seems to me the makers of this set didn't think this was going to sell. So they jacked up the price to get money from the nostalgic buyers while keeping it cheap to produce the sets. The product's appearance isn't worth the list price and maybe not even amazon's price either. But of course, the ability to watch all the episodes at home in good quality does count a lot. Definitely buy, but don't expect anything special design/appearance wise.",1146873600,3,1261,4.2719665271966525
2438813,5,B000BR9SA0,"Oh, my, what warm memories this brings back! This show's first season was its' best (what many ""purist"" fans consider its' *only* season, before it turned into 21 Jump Street).  It features, among others, the wonderful Roy Scheider as Nathan Bridger, captain of the seaQuest, Stephanie Beecham as Dr. Kristen Westphalen, Ted Raimi as Communications Officer/Translator Tim O'Neil and the late Jonathan Brandis as the young genius Lucas who bonds with Bridger and assists both of them in emotional healing.  And of course, the dolphin, Darwin, an appealing character himself, who talked, with the help of Lucas' ingenious computer program and vocorder. (Never mind that the dolphin was actually mechanical; it worked.  I challenge anyone not to smile every time that dolphin showed up!) The cast was unusually competent and possessed wonderful chemistry and appeal together. They also managed to attract some top-notch guest stars, including Charleton Heston, William Shatner, Jonathan Banks, etc., no doubt due to the fact that Spielberg's name was still attached to the project at this time.

This show actually holds up quite well, considering the fact that it was being made at a time before the internet, before 9/11,when computers still took up a room.  It was futuristic, but still maintained a nice familial feel with sweet shows, science fiction, intelligent shows, and shows that still speak to issues of today, such as the episode Whale Song, which dealt with retaliation from activists for illegal whaling. (one of my favorites)

The only drawback to watching this collection of dvds is the bittersweet sense of nostalgia I have when I see them.  After this season, nothing was ever the same, everyone over 30 was removed from the cast list (except for Scheider, who became so fed up with the banality of the eps that he asked to leave), and the sense of familial bonding, particularly between Bridger and Lucas, was lost forever.

Not to mention that watching the young, vibrant, natural, oh-so-likable and beguiling Brandis, and knowing what his fate turned out to be, is heartbreaking.

Highly recommended, very satisfying entertainmnet. Just wish there were a few extras included on the dvds.",1145923200,3,2206,5.174157303370786
2438814,5,B000BR9SA0,"SeaQuest was one of my favorite shows from the day it premiered on TV, and now that I have the opportunity to own all the episodes on DVD, I'm ecstatic!

This wonderful show stars Roy Scheider as Nathan Bridger, who is convinced to return to the SeaQuest after his protege (and former SeaQuest captain) Marilyn Stark (former Charlie's Angel Shelley Hack) goes mad and hires a crew of mercenaries to lay waste to not only her former command, but to the underwater colonies administered by the United Earth Oceans Organization (UEO).  Later on, Bridger begins to take on a more active role as Captain of the SeaQuest.

Don Franklin was a good choice for the role of Nathan's second-in-command, Jonathan Ford.  He plays Ford with the right mixture of dry wit and humor, and he does a great job of it.

My favorite member of the cast, however, was the late Jonathan Brandis as Lucas Wolenczak, the young computer genius who designed the system that allows Bridger to communicate verbally with Darwin, a Navy-trained dolphin who was rescued by Bridger after having been caught in a tuna net.  Placed on SeaQuest by his father, Lucas is resentful at first, but gradually warms up to the crew.  I was saddened to hear of young Brandis's death a few years ago; he has been, and still is, among my favorite actors.

As for extras, there aren't any except for deleted scenes and a plot summary for each episode in the episode guide.  I'm not too terribly disappointed, though; I hate commentary tracks (aside from the fact that they're distracting, I invariably end up turning on the subtitles so I can know what's going on in the episode), and extras can be a distraction anyway.

One thing that I like most about the SeaQuest 1st Season DVD set, though, is the fact that they kept Bob Ballard's educational spots in the end credits.  Normally I dislike it when the end credits are pushed off to one side to make room for some talking head to bring up the latest news headlines, but because Ballard brings up topics that are informative (and also because he's not a Talking Head, lol), I like listening to him.

All in all, I would definitely recommend this DVD set, even to those who are not fans, or those who might have been too young to watch SeaQuest back when it was on.",1144022400,4,2267,4.584158415841584

It's a good thing these DVDs came out because I don't know how well those tapes are doing these days. The set does not come with many bells and whistles, just some deleted scenes that I swear I've actually seen before. This is also the first television series I've bought on DVD, so I don't have a standard for comparison.

I was about 13 years old and instantly became a huge fan from the start of the first episode. It's like an underwater Star Trek with loveable characters and season one is definitely educational as well as entertaining!

Some would probably say I love fantasy a little too much or that my taste in movies and television shows is too broad because I remember liking SeaQuest even in the second season when it changed to be based more on fantasy than scientific fact. (And, if I remember correctly, I think I enjoyed the third season as well.)

I absolutely love season one! Watching it brings back fond memories of my early teenage years and I really hope seasons two and three are released on DVD as well for the die-hard fans who loved the show even when it changed.",1140393600,4,872,4.477987421383648
2438820,5,B000BR9SA0,"I fell in love with this show during its original airing, and now that it's on DVD I can watch it as clearly as I did in the early nineties.  I enjoy at least as much, maybe more, now that I'm not gawking single-mindedly at Jonathan Brandis.  Okay, I still am, but for different reasons.  We appreciate things most when we no longer have them, and Jonathan was an amazing talent.  I miss him, as I know all of his fans do.

""SeaQuest DSV"" is more than underwater ""Star Trek"".  It's a vision of what we in the early nineties dreamed the twentieth century might be like, a world of incredible scientific advances, a place where we could speak to dolphins, make contact with extraterrestrials, explore the deepest places of the world.  Like ""Star Trek"" in its various incarnations, it's a vision of hope for what we might accomplish if we can all just begin to work together.

The writing, though some may find it a bit dated now, holds up incredibly well over time, as do most of the effects.  The characters are well-rounded and fascinating, from the nervous O'Neill (who went on to be the mighty Joxer of ""Xena: Warrior Princess"") to the devious Krieg to the frustrated genius Lucas, and leading them is the wise father-figure Captain Nathan Bridger, who holds his crew together as a family and contributes his gentle wisdom to every exciting adventure.

2438831,5,B000BR9SA0,"This was by far the best of the three seasons this show ran. Upon first airing - this show was going to be a ""Star Trek"" under water. The sub was a research and exploration vessel and episodes were written to teach the viewers with the clips at the end. The developing interactions between the crew members were not unlike that of the well written ""Trek"" series.

  Shamefully, the producers of this show wanted to focus on demographics and tailor the show to attract different viewers. The largest blunder was putting so much emphasis on the Lucas character as they attempted to make him the ""heartthrob"" of the show and get the teenage girls to watch simply so they can swoon over him. Unfortunately, he was not a pivotal character and focusing on him ruined the show as it rapidly was ""kiddiefied"".

  The second season abandoned the educational angle and took on a more science fiction theme - sadly it failed as it was handled poorly. They tried to make it more ""Trek"" and got a tragedy more in the lines of Blake's 7 (a good show itself but for the dark themes). The third season drove the final stake in Seaquest's heart as it took a totally different path. Now, it's no longer a ship of exploration but one of war. It was no surprise the show was finally canceled and put out of its suffering.

  Drastic cast changes also contributed to the show's demise. Seaquest producers broke the unwritten, Golden rule - never kill off major cast members (making them mysteriously disappear with no explanation is just as bad). Losing your captain is just as bad and was a sizable nail in the coffin.

In summary, Seaquest DSV - Season 1 is the only one worth preserving - Seasons 2 and 3 will come out eventually, I will consider getting 2 if not just for the fianl episode with the Hyberions (decent looking aliens) but I do not want the 3rd season - it's pathetic.

To the powers that be: if a series is to be remade - this one deserves it. I would recommend remaking the first season with its format intact and then NOT deviating from it. Introduce some sci-fi but in little doses - we all love that. Get the original crew if possible and leave it intact.",1138492800,3,2157,4.463104325699746

2438837,5,B000BR9SA0,"Ill warn you like others that seasons 2 and 3 are no good. They really arent, but Season 1 was one of the best Sci-Fi shows ever produced.

Unlike most, SeaQuest DSV had many science driven story lines its first season (this, along with the balance of season one characters, were missing for 2 and 3 and it doomed the show). Dr Robert Ballard, discoverer of the Titanic wreck, and famed deep oceanographer was tech consultant for the show this season, and even does monologues at the end of each episode.

I was 9 years old when this show premiered, and I ate up every bit of it. This show is what TV used to be and should be like. My parents raised me with old Star Treks, and Irwin Allen Shows, the 1960's Batman and others, but this show was the first time that my generation really had a distinctive adventure show of its own, brand new, and original to the core. Its only the shell of Star Trek (the only similarity is an adventurous Captain and a Ship) but its inventiveness on all other levels was unequalled, it has its own, clean, futuristic feel that lacks in many of todays shows. It was just after Jurassic Park came out, and Universal was tinkering with CGI and anamatronics and was one of the first TV shows to move away from the old way of doing things (cameras and models).

Its an optimistic science and adventure driven show created by Speilberg and the pros at universal, and it was great while the writing lasted. Unfortunately it succuomed to too much tinkering, but as far as this season is concerned, its some of the best TV of my childhood. (Hard to believe its 12 years old). It still looks fantastic and is fun to watch.

I recommend this set (beware of later ones) to anyone.",1137283200,,1702,4.410828025477707
2438838,5,B000BR9SA0,"""SeaQuest DSV"" originally aired in 1993 (I was in junior high at the time). A futuristic show set in the mid-21st century, it followed the adventures of the SeaQuest, a peacekeeping/ research submarine, and its crew, headed by Nathan Bridger (Roy Scheider from Jaws). Much like Star Trek, SeaQuest was devoted to the exploration of unknown worlds in the form of the mysteries of the ocean: black smokers and toxic bacteria, mysterious minerals on the ocean floor, and battling new viruses. The crew was also called to rescue missions and to defuse hostile situations between various factions.

The first season was by far the best. Although elements of the supernatural and extraterrestrial were explored, it was done in a scientific, believable manner. Seasons two and three (dubbed ""Voyage to the bottom of the barrel"" by some critics) degenerated into a Xena-like world of Greek gods, giant robots, and aliens that had little to do with the dignity and wonder of the first season. The futuristic military and scientific technology was always believable, grounded in modern design and aesthetically beautiful (look at how much background detail is in the SeaQuest sets).

The cast, headed by Roy Scheider, was a tightly-knit ensemble that was always believable as a military family: there were rivalries, outbursts, and crew romances,  but they all came together in times of need. First season standouts in addition to those above include Lieutenant Commander Katherine Hitchcock (Stacy Haiduk), Dr. Kristin Westphalen (Stephanie Beacham), resident linguist Tim O'Neill (Ted Raimi from Xena Warrior Princess, brother of Spiderman director Sam Raimi), and teenage prodigy Lucas Wolenczak (Jonathan Brandis, who committed suicide in 2003). Notable guest stars include William Shatner, Charlton Heston, and Seth Green. The show was fairly unique for the time in that multiethnic characters played major roles onboard the SeaQuest (Commander Jonathan Ford (Don Franklin) and Sensor Chief Miguel Ortiz (Marco Sanchez).

Though the CGI special effects certainly appear dated thirteen years later, they were fairly advanced for the time (1993). The video quality on the DVD set is very good, much better than the original broadcasts. The soundtrack by John Debney brings to mind work by John Williams, and the show's writing (at least the first season) was a fine balance of humor, drama, and camaraderie that never felt stilted or forced.

My collection has finally come full circle: I'm now the proud owner of the DVD set in addition to SeaQuest models, soundtrack, a T-shirt, all three paperbacks, a calendar, bookmark, and the video game. I'm so glad to finally own a DVD version of SeaQuest (I was left with disintegrating VHS tapes), and this version was worth the wait! The box design and cases are beautiful and functional. There are four two-sided discs housed in four slim cases listing each episode. Menus are very limited and give a brief summary for each episode, along with chapters. The only extra is half an hour of deleted scenes available for several episodes (filmed but not finished, no background music, etc., which explains the eerie silence) and closed captioning, but this is a beautiful tribute to one of my favourite TV series of all time.",1137196800,9,3260,5.190114068441065

2438840,4,B000BR9SA0,"SeaQuest DSV - Season 1 brings the audience to the depths of the ocean, a place just as foreign as distant galaxies.  In the light of Abyss (1989), it might have been a good decision.  However, the initial criticism of SeaQuest DSV promised a disastrous science fiction tale that brought to mind the notion of sinking ships.  The problems started before the shooting of the TV series when producers and other involved parties could not come to a mutual agreement on the show.  SeaQuest might never have been green lit if it was not for Steven Spielberg's interest in the project, as he also served as executive producer.  With all the tumult around the show including an earthquake, it is not odd that the series started off a little shaky, but once the sci-fi show had begun to air its underwater adventures in September of 1993, it received a warm welcoming by the American TV audience.

The 90-minute pilot episode, To Be or Not To Be, rapidly introduced a futuristic society that has exhausted almost all of earth's resources.  In order to continue life on earth people sought themselves to the ocean floors where resources still existed.  However, it does not provide the safety and tranquility that many expect, as hostile factions seek to control areas of the earthly underwater domain.  To protect the people and help solve the conflicts under the sea level, Captain Nathan Bridger (Roy Schneider) takes command over his mammoth creation, the high tech mega-submarine SeaQuest DSV 4600.  SeaQuest DSV also provides interesting scientific notions together with each adventure, as it also portrays the importance of protecting the environment.

Through the adventures of SeaQuest and a number of characters, the audience finds themselves experiencing a TV show that slightly resembles Star Trek.  Some of the episodes also bring back some notion of the old sci-fi show Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, but it clearly avoids the corny atmosphere of the 60s show.  What truly sticks out with the first season of SeaQuest DSV is the quality of the episodes, as it drastically deteriorates in the following two years.  It is clear that it had some potential, but after the final episode of the first season, the producers made it very difficult for the show to maintain the same level of quality.  Ultimately, this first season of SeaQuest offers a decent science fiction drama intended for television, but it never had the opportunity to reach greatness due to its struggling dynamics behind the screen.

SeaQuest DSV - Season 1 has several interesting aspects incorporated into the show such as a strong concern for the environment and science.  It also has some good episodes with suspense and entertainment, but it does not reach greatness.  Yet, the show has its charm with the talking dolphin Darwin and its cast.  Now after the release of the first season, the viewers can avoid the massive amount of bootlegged copies on ebay, and instead get a chance to see all 23 episodes of season 1 with terrific sound and visual quality.",1136764800,5,3036,4.9060665362035225

2438842,5,B000BR9SA0,"Finally, after all these years of waiting and hoping, my favorite television show EVER is on DVD! I have to say, nitpicking aside, this is a wonderful set and a MUST OWN for any seaQuest fan. My only nitpicks are that for some reason they didn't use the original seaQuest logo on the DVD cases and menu, the navigation of the menu is a little confusing (if you select 'play all' instead of individual episodes you may start to wonder where the deleted scenes are.  They're in each episode's own screen when you select an individual episode to play), and there are no commentaries or behind the scenes.  Other than that, I couldn't be happier!  The episodes are crisp, clear and cleaned up, and it's a delight to see deleted scenes.  Thank you, Universal, and all the fans, for finally getting this long beloved show, onto DVD.  Let's hope seasons 2 and 3 are close behind!  Journey Into The Unknown!  And may the memory of Royce Applegate and Jonathan Brandis live on!",1136332800,3,968,4.593023255813954
2438843,4,B000BR9SA0,"I have to admit, I was a bit frustrated when reading posted reviews. All of the reviews I read were for the show, not this release. In fact, loads of them had been posted before the DVDs were even released. I wanted to read a review someone had written having actually watched these DVDs. So, when I got the DVD as a gift, I watched all the episodes, and decided to write my own. Here goes.

I, like the other reviewers, really enjoyed this series. It was my favorite show when it was on, and I still watch VHS copies I made of it when it was on. In fact, I probably enjoyed it more than many of the other reviewers here.  Let me 'splain. I watched this show. I enjoyed it. I went to college and studied Marine Biology and Oceanography. I started keeping reef aquaria. I learned how to use computer-aided design software and designed my own undersea habitats and minisubs. I became a certified SCUBA diver. I'm a big fan of Bob Ballard. See what I mean?

Anyway, for those of you who don't know the series, it's set in the near future when mankind has colonized the oceans. There are farms, power plants, resorts, even prisons in, on and under the oceans. And with all this expansion comes some strife. The SeaQuest was built as a deterrent for those who might seek to wreak havok in the seas. Over time, the ship has taken on scientific research responsibilities as well. Nice plot. One thing I always liked is that the characters were 'fleshed out' well. They seemed like real people. You got to know them, and that's something I really like. Something else I found about this show is that the characters always do 'the right thing'. Even when it's not popular, or could get them killed. Like not counter-attacking an aggressor sub, but instead evacuating injured people from a damaged power station.

As far as this DVD set goes, there are four of disks that contain a total of 23 episodes. I'd have to say that these first season episodes are excellent, although after getting the box set, I started trying to find a couple of my favorite episodes, only to find that they were from the second season. I guess I'll have to wait to watch them again.

The reason that I didn't give this set 5 stars is that the bonus features are very sparse.  There are really only a few deleted scenes from about a third of the episodes, which don't really add anything to them. I had hoped for something cool, like crew bios, schematic layouts of the ship, something. Anything! I was told by a studio insider that originally, this set was slated for release sometime in 2006, but that they were pushed to try and make the 2005 holiday season. I guess they decided to leave out any additional bonus features in order to try their best to make it. They ended up missing it by one day, releasing on Dec. 26.

Another reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it seemed a bit, well, cheap. The disks are double-sided, and have two or three episodes per side. I'm a big fan of pictures and stuff being printed on the top of my DVDs. You know, pictures of the ship, the crew, the dolphin named Darwin, anything. I just think it's the details that make it seem 'classy'. Call me weird. I accept that.

The DVD transfer is as good as can be expected from a show that aired in 1993. The video quality is far better than those bootlegs that have been available on auction sites for several years. It's much better than the VHS recordings I've been holding onto for the last twelve years. The audio is also quite good. It's even in Dolby Digital 2.0, which was a pleasant surprise. I would have loved if they'd reworked it and done it in 5.1, but hey, you can't have everything.

One other thing that I wished they would have done was a dedication to the memory of Jonathan Brandis who played the character of Lucas, the ship's teenage genius. I could have overlooked everything else and given 5 stars had they done that. That, to me, would have shown a great deal of compassion and class.

This is a great show, and a very good addition to anyone's DVD library.",1136246400,96,4036,4.405369127516779
2438844,4,B000BR9SA0,"When ""SeaQuest"" first aired, I lived in a small isolated town whose cable reception looked like what it was probably ""beamed"" to them as:  bad TV reception.  With the heavy ghosting of the picture, it was difficult to see what was happening, particularly in the dark exterior underwater scenes.  I taped the show every week in spite of that, and since I've never bothered to catch the show in reruns on the Sci-Fi Channel, I was looking forward to purchasing the DVD set to get my first look at a crystal-clear image of each episode.

The simple fact that these episodes have been released on DVD, and in their original unedited versions, gives this set 5 stars.  The unfortunate lack of any behind-the-scenes featurettes or, as I was hoping, a tribute of some sort to the late Jonathan Brandis, knocks two stars off the rating (science-fiction shows are, arguably, the most fertile ground for bonus features on DVD releases).  But I give back one star for what I thought was one of the most enlightening parts of the show: the original end credit sequences, which featured oceanographer Dr. Robert Ballard giving a 30-second lecture on the real-world science which played a part in each episode, have been brought to the DVD transfers intact.  I am by no means a ""science buff"", but I've always found random tidbits of science trivia interesting, and in the venue of a science-fiction show, it only adds to the production's integrity, in my opinion.

The first season of ""SeaQuest"" was, in my opinion, the only real season.  It contained the best cast, playing the most dimensional characters, in the most realistic stories.  The writers integrated real-world science into this series with a skill and inventiveness not seen since ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"".  I eagerly looked forward to the show every Sunday night for those next nine months, and now I'll be able to enjoy these episodes over and over again for years.",1136246400,6,1926,4.841463414634147

The first season is truly extrodinary. Granted the show took a major turn for the worse after the second season, and hit the bottom in the third, but any true SeaQuest fan will take what they can get. In fact, I can't wait for the rest to be released as well.  Roy Scheider and Jonathan Brandis truly make this show marvelous. This show truly captures the imagination.

AND IN RESPONCE TO

""John Q. Public"" who wrote your review on December 30th 2005:

Before you mock the once and only attempt of prime time television to bring science and the theme of curiousity in the natural world, take a look around you. Name one other show that is on prime time that inspires kids to think and wonder!

Please take your cynical views elsewhere, because they are not appreciated here. Granted this is a free forum where you can give your own opinion, don't knock the work of Spielburg, the cast or the writers because I doubt you could do anything as worthwhile to the greater good.

Also a man of your supossed age and wisdom should relize that space and the ocean are very different realms, so don't even think about comparing fiction(s) of SeaQuest with Startrek.

Oh and last! -- To correct you, there where three seasons, not two! The third season lasted 13 episodes and was titled SeaQuest 2032  --- try googleing it?!?

2438848,5,B000BR9SA0,This is an excelent set of DVDs.  Finally this series has been released on disc.,1136073600,,80,4.333333333333333
2438849,5,B000BR9SA0,"Finally seaQuest DSV out on DVD.  Like everyone has already said, season 1 was the best.  I was bearly a teenager when it came out and already a hardcore fan of the sci-fi of Star Trek:TNG and Quantum Leap; and seaQuest mirrored much of Star Trek.  Just as Star Trek did much stories reflecting conflicts and such of our present time in the future, seaQuest did the same under water.  Even more paralleled with TNG was the character of Lucas, the Wesley Crusher of the boat.  It was also neat how the ship was only 30 years in our future, there was much science fact mixed into the science fiction--as was explained each week at the end during the credits.  My favorite episodes would have to be the one where the found the Library of Alexandra and when the board the haunted ship.

Season 2 started the slow decline of the show.  The first thing I hated was the replacment of the ship's doctor--more mirroring of TNG (Dr. Smith mirroring the telepathic & empathic Lt. Cmdr. Troi).  I loved the original doctor, her passion for medicine and research was the heart of the boat.  The introduction of Dagwood and Tony could almost be seen as a prequal/crossover to the Star Trek time line.  The ""Eugenics Wars"" have been suggested to have been the result of Earth's governments experimenting to create the perfect soldier that went bad.  This season had it's good episodes, my favorite when they discover evidence of Atlantis.  But it had it's bad ones too, when the stories seemed to for lack of a better word crap--like the one when the plants of a colony come alive and eat people.

Finally season 3.  Taking place 10 years after the end of season 2 in 2032; it really sucked with the loss of Capt. Brigger.  Why did Ortiz have to be killed by the aliens from the season 2 finally?  As a hispanic, I was really pissed off about the death of a fellow countrymen.  Just as in the 60s young Whoopi Goldberg was filled with pride when she say a black woman on the bridge of the Starship ENTERPRISE and ""...she ain't no maid,"" I too was happy that role of Ortiz.  But back to the show, the focus of exploration and resarch continued to dissappear as in season 2, plus there is a war going on between the UEO and other factions.  I guess this story line too can be considered a prequal/crossover to the Star Trek time line of the WWIII, ""went on for bloody decade after bloody decade"" until it's end in 2053 (according to ST:FC).

In closing, if your still reading this--I thank you, season 1 was the best. Don't know if you'll go on to collect the other two seasons, i will only for my devotion to certain beloved characters.",1135814400,5,2620,4.450733752620545
2438850,4,B000BR9SA0,"Seaquest DSV was on NBC for 3 seasons.  I didn't watch the third season at all.  Why did Scheider have to be replaced by Ironsides??  Ironsides makes a terrific villian (see ""Total Recall"" )  but he is no good guy, and certainly NOT the captain of the Seaquest.

  The first season is the best.  The second season is okay.

  In the mid-21st century, man has explored the oceans and made dumb clones like Dagwood.  The mascot of the show has to be Darwin, the talking dolphin.  Seaquest is the Star Trek of underwater.",1135814400,,518,4.440860215053763
2438851,5,B000BR9SA0,"In the history of television there has been little intelligent Science Fiction... ""seaQuest DSV"" is one of those shows.

In 1993 NBC did a show about a super-sub in the near future... starring Roy Scheider (""Jaws"", ""Blue Thunder""), Don Franklin, Stacy Haiduk (""Luther the Geek"") and the late Jonathan Brandis. While it does have a decided ecological, liberal slant to the stories - save the whales, pollution in the oceans, underwater mining - it is exceptional SF. Probably the first modern series to explore the undersea world.

Airing on Sunday nights, ""seaQuest DSV"" kicked SF into the modern age... this wasn't some SF series about aliens in the far future; it was about what could possibly happen just around the corner.

The first season of ""seaQuest"" is very much worth it... the episodes may have been hit or miss, but there was an overall beauty to the scripts and the acting.

Don't bother with seasons 2 or 3... at the end of season 1, NBC decided that since it wasn't getting the numbers it wanted, it would go with a ""younger, sexier cast"" (as if you could get either without Stacy Haiduk), and fired four of the cast members - the second season introduced psychics, genetically-engineered clones, aliens and space battles. The stories in the following seasons were of the Berman type (poorly written).

The first season is definitely worth it - there was some great writing in there (co-produced by Steven Speilberg), and pretty decent acting. Good plots. Nice tension. Sure, it got a little silly at times, but for the first modern undersea series since ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"", it was great.

Get season 1, ignore the other two seasons.",1135728000,22,1663,4.817543859649123

If you've read the posts, its true: Season 1 is the best of the 3 seasons in terms of storyline and cast. At least buy this set if in the future you have to choose a season to buy ( I have no idea whether the other seasons are even being planned for release or not). I just wish the dvd had some extras beyond deleted scenes-like a cast commentary or a blooper reel. A cast reunion would be great.

2438853,5,B000BR9SA0,"Your dreams come true.  I have been an on again, off again seaQuest fan since the show first aired in the early nineties.  I remember watching the first two seasons, and falling in love with the show, and crying when I saw the third season.  Much of the fantastical elements were removed, and even Darwin, the dolphin, wouldn't speak anymore.  When the show was cancelled, I was still sad.  It hadn't run long enough to be put in syndication, and I knew I would never see it again.

Then came the wonderful Sci-fi channel.  For a few more years, I was able to get my fix.  And I remember as I saw series after series of older TV shows being released in DVD boxed sets, I started looking for seaQuest.  After all, they had released Quantum Leap.  Why not seaQuest as well?  But for years, it seemed like it was just a dream, a dream that would never come true.

And yet, now it has.  I am eagerly awaiting the chance to watch all my favorite episodes of the show, as first season is my favorite, though I still enjoy second season.

2438854,5,B000BR9SA0,I watched this show faithfully when it was on and then they cancelled it and you were lucky if you could find it on syndication.  Also with Jonathan Brandis being gone I can watch what I feel is some of his best work.  Plus I love Roy Scheider's character in it.  I'm just so glad it's finally on DVD now.,1135641600,4,305,4.05
2438855,4,B000BR9SA0,"When Seaquest DSV premiered on NBC, I watched it because at the time good Sci Fi was still rare.  It commanded a cast  with some serious acting chops.  but after the first seven episodes, you were kind of left with the impression ""My god, this is trying too hard to be Star Trek.""

Then episode 8, ""Knight of Shadows"" aired.  You hear a brief discription; The crew discovers a haunted wreck; and you think ""Please, put this thing out of its misery.""  But watching the episode, you are blown away by the depth of the story and the preformances of Roy Scheider and Stephanie Beacham.  It made you think the show finally found its own voice.  From that point on, it became less and less Star Trek underwater, and more serious science fiction/fantasy of its own.  Drawing you into the world of the UEO.

But unfortunately, it also sufferd the problem Star Trek: TOS suffered.  After a stellar first season, NBC wanted the show a little cheaper and to try to aim it to kids. (Maybe NBC should just give up on sci fi, because most of it they put on is crap; i.e. Manimal, or when they do get a piece of good adult drama they either bounce it around so it never gets a chance or they put it in a suicide time slot.) Steven Spielburg, the shows executive producer, gave in and started to dumb down the show.  Which we can all thank god, Roddenberry didn't.  it slide fast during second season to the point where when you get to the third season premire, you look in pitty at the silliness of the huge Seaquest being transported to a freshwater river by six chinook helicopters.

You have Rockne S. O'Bannon (writer and producer of Alien Nation: the series and Farscape)is in full control of first season, and it shows.  Intense, tight writing, and funny in the right spots.

2438856,4,B000BR9SA0,"I remember when this show came out, I watched two episodes. It didn't grab me. Having been a big ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"" fan, I was surprised. Talking dolphins and wise-guy teens seemed too reminiscent of ""Lost in Space"" and ""Star Trek:TNG"" with Will Robinson and Wesley Crusher. However, I caught the re-runs on the Sci-fi Channel, and actually got into it. Some. But the show was neither fish nor fowl- it had science fiction and espionage elements, but it also had ghost stories, too. Obviously Roy Scheider got tired of this, and got out in the third season to be replaced by Michael Ironside.

The whole show did a 180 when Ironside came on board. The easy going atmosphere under Scheider was replaced with a hard nosed military attitude. Some of the best stories were in the third season, including one where the SeaQuest gets involved in the Cuban Missle Crisis.

The biggest problem was the show started to center around boy genius Brandeis. It became stories of a boy and his dolphin, or a boy, his dolphin, and his developing hormones as he oogled older female crew members.  I wouldn't be surprised if that's one reason Scheider chucked his role overboard.

The SeaQuest itself was an oddly designed boat (submarines are considered boats, not ships). It never really grabbed me, either. I built a model of it, and still think it has no real ""grace"" to it, unlike VTTBOTS's Seaview.

Incongruous as it may seem, I still give it 4 stars, because I think the producers had their heart in the right place. They just couldn't seem to get ahold on what they wanted the show to be.",1135209600,8,1595,4.6219081272084805

I managed to get a bootleg copy of the series, but unfortunately, when I had to switch DVD players, the new machine wouldn't play those discs.  Now I can finally get a REAL SET!!!  I'm already putting in my preorder!

The series begins in the year 2018, when Earth has turned to the oceans in a spirit of exploration, cooperation, and commercial exploitation, with a UN-type organization called the UEO (United Earth Oceans) overseeing things. But to keep the peace, they have built an amazingly advanced submarine as a science and peacekeeping vessel, the seaQuest.  Unfortunately, the sub's first captain proved to be a lunatic, and she was relieved of command. 18 months subsequent, the UEO manages to recruit seaQuest's original designer, Nathan Bridger to command seaQuest.

Starring 'Jaws' veteran Roy Schieder as Captain Nathan Bridger, and Jonathan Brandis (may he rest in peace) as teenage genius Lucas Wolenczak, among several other great actors and characters, as well as a dolphin which can talk with the use of a computer program.

The brainchild of movie director-great Steven Spielberg, this series had amazing potential, as something of an underwater Star Trek (which may be why I like this show so much, as I'm a hard-core Trekker), but unfortunately, even back in the early 90's people were already beginning to drift away from quality stories and drifting in the directions of the horrible reality shows that now plague our society.

I'm eager to add this series to my collection, and fully intend to add the other two seasons as well.  SeaQuest was a brilliant series, and should have had a longer time on the air, but fell victim to the ratings of drunken bumpkins who like Wrestlemania and Monday night football instead of quality imagination and storytelling.

8091435,4,B000BR9SA0,"Billed as the next Star Trek: the Next Generation when it launched in 1993, seaQuest DSV never quite lived up to its potential with too many shifts in direction and too many cast changes. The first season holds up pretty well after a quarter of a century thanks in part to Roy Scheiders excellent performance as Cpt. Nathan Bridger, the commander of the flag ship of the United Earth Oceans. The first episodes are a little more realistic as Bridger and his team explore the ocean depths and try to keep peace while protecting marine life and resources. But the series does take an odd turn as the teams dolphin starts popping up in dreams and ghosts and aliens appear. There are some interesting cameos and guest spots including Charlton Heston and William Shatner as a Croatian dictator (which works better than you would think).

Granted the show is dated. The optimism about the future--another page from TNG--fits 1993-94 but doesnt hold up well in the 21st century. Nor does the technology. Want to take computers offline? Cut the wires! But its not a bad show when its grounded and  Dr. Robert Ballards work as a  technical advisor shows. Still, the writing is--at best--uneven and some of the special effects simply don't hold up.

There are some strengths and that includes the cast. Scheider shines as Bridger while Don Franklin performs solidly as his second in command. Stephanie Beacham is delightful as Dr. Kristin Westphalen who gets closer to Bridger as the series continues. Royce Applegate and Stacy Haiduk also put in solid efforts. The late  Jonathan Brandis is cast as a poor mans version of Wesley Crusher as  Lucas Wolenczak and, while there are some fine moments, it comes off as too TNG inspired. Having said that, Brandis has chemistry with Scheider and Beacham and their scenes still hit home. The dolphin starts to get annoying, especially when he commands more attention that humans on the ship.

The show has some fine moments and the first season had a lot of promise though the ratings did not impress. That wasn't enough for NBC which made radical changes and Beacham, Applegate, Haiduk and eventually Scheider himself would exit the show. The scripts got even more fantastic and fantasy elements took over, bringing out the worst in the series. Still, the potential of this first season continues to show after all this time.
