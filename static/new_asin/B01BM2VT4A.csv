7664241,2,B01BM2VT4A,"Yeah, yeah, I get it: this is a back-to-basics, slapstick Bugs Bunny for younger (much younger) viewers, a bunch of six-minute episodes inspired by the old seven-minute theatrical Looney Tunes we all know and love.  Bugs's trickster-god demolition of bullies and pompous authority figures is front and center, as is the over-the-top violence. The highly stylized figures and backgrounds are easy on the eye, too. So why doesn't WABBIT work? Why isn't this series the least bit funny?

We're not stuck in the bad old days of ANIMANIACS and TINY TOON ADVENTURES, when the animators were field hands and the writers (who couldn't draw) were the straw bosses. The animators are clearly having fun with what they're doing, but is it possible that, given a mandate to honor the spirit of the old cartoons, no one realized that the new crew simply wasn't very good at writing slapstick gags?  Bugs needs other characters to play off of, but in WABBIT he's saddled with characters so bland he might as well be alone onscreen. His new, painfully unfunny sidekicks -- the moronic Bigfoot and the generic Squeaks the Squirrel -- barely register, and the older Tunes seem miscast.  Wile E. Coyote is now a condescending tech geek who won't shut up; worse, he doesn't have anything particularly funny to say. Yosemite Sam, formerly one of Bugs's most reliably funny sparring partners, is a shell of himself: just another blustering, personality-challenged fool for Bugs to destroy. The new villains, with the possible exception of the Grim Rabbit (Death...with bunny ears), are instantly forgettable. Gags from sixty-year-old cartoons are recycled, to little effect.

 What went wrong with WABBIT? Why is this series so depressing to watch?",1462838400,3,1727,5.084805653710247

* Some shorts are better than others.
* I can't stand Squeaks & Bigfoot. They're unnecessary characters in my opinion.
* Baddies I like: Shameless O'Scanty, Jack, Claudette, Vera, Barbarian & Cal.
* Baddies I hate: Carl the Grim Rabbit, Slugsworthy, Ninjas & Tooth Fairy
* Disappointed Lola Bunny is not in the show",1459468800,3,347,4.704918032786885
7664244,5,B01BM2VT4A,"2015 saw a big surprise for Looney Tunes when Wabbit premiered on Cartoon Network and Boomerang. What followed was critical acclaim and high ratings and it truly deserves it, because this has got to be Warner's best Looney Tunes show yet! As you probably guess, the show follows the further adventures of Bugs Bunny (voiced once again by Jeff Bergman) using his wit and comedic ability to thwart his enemies and tackling situations. Things are the same like dealing with Yosemite Sam and Wile E. Coyote on an occasional basis while things are different. For example, Bugs has 2 friends; Squeaks the Squirrel and Bigfoot (you read right!). Another; taking place in the 21st century, you can expect some of today's technology like a smartphone (don't worry it's not in every single episode). Third, new villains such as Carl the Grim Rabbit and French fox spy Claudette Dupri and  Vera the Vulture. None of these additions bother me and add more to the fun, which speaking of, the show (like Disney's new Mickey Mouse shorts by Paul Rudish) is definitely true to Bugs and the classic shorts we all know and love (and also delivers a cute design for Bugs).

Warner has delivered a hit that is sure to please. So, if you're a Looney Tunes old or new or young or old and even enjoy the classic shorts (and even enjoy the new Mickey shorts), you'll definitely love Wabbit! I highly recommend it.",1458345600,15,1389,4.688524590163935
