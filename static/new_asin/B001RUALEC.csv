It was the hit of the Edinbugh Festival that year - a year's tour followed and it marked Ian Mckellen as the new up and coming greatest classical actor of his generation. He was then 27 years old - I was 22",1346976000,,256,3.9423076923076925
3781105,5,B001RUALEC,"This is not a television adaptation, but a televised stage performance.  This production of Marlowe's play premiered at the Edinburgh International Festival in 1969 and toured for a few months in repertory with Richard II.  It was Ian McKellen's breakthrough performance and it featured the first kiss between two men on British television.

Edward was said to be tall and well built, like his father, and something of an athlete.  McKellen is rather slight in stature and plays the early scenes in an effete manner.  So the transition to a warrior king bravely defending his realm is a difficult one for the actor to execute and the audience to credit, but McKellen proves (just) actor enough to do it.

Historically, we cannot be sure whether Gaveston and Despenser ('Spencer' in the play) were actually Edward's lovers or simply close companions that he favored too much.  Most dramatic depictions have retained that ambiguity, but Marlowe goes all out for an openly homosexual interpretation and this production emphasizes that aspect.  Edward and his companions kiss each other full on the lips.

The play is something of a sprint through the 20 years of Edward's reign.  Edward and some other characters age rapidly from one scene to the next, with little or no break between scenes.  These sudden continuity shifts will, I suspect, make some details of the plot confusing, if you are not familiar with the history itself.  But the central story - a king more interested in his male lovers than in pleasing his wife or running the country, thus making more enemies than he can handle - is clear and simple enough.

The crucial thing, with Elizabethan and Jacobean drama, is to remain true to the language, to let the dialogue carry the play.  This production does that, magnificently.  This was the performance that made McKellen a star, and rightly so.

Robert Eddison won an award for his performance of Lightborn.  He appears briefly but memorably, toward the end.

There is a technical problem with the sound, in that the initial dialogue of characters entering from backstage is often lost.  Nonetheless, this is an essential production.

3781107,5,B001RUALEC,"I was suprised to find that there was a DVD of this play. I did it for my A levels forty years ago and saw the theatrical performance at the time. Excellent cast,performances and production values. If you are a fan of Jacobethan drama you will enjoy it.",1261958400,,253,4.291666666666667
3781108,2,B001RUALEC,"Boring, not because of the story, but too theatrical or to say it in a different way is that the actors seem 'phony'.",1259280000,2,117,4.130434782608695
3781109,5,B001RUALEC,"Christopher Marlowe's masterpiece, Edward II, is the first major English History play/tragedy in the renaissance canon, predating and providing a model for Shakespeare's Richard II and other plays of the genre (for that connection, see Charles R. Forker's magisterial introduction in the Manchester U Revels Plays edition).  It's also an important work in the lgbtq literary canon, as the love affair between Piers Gaveston and his king is the first open and unabashed representation of gay characters on the English stage, and the poetry of that love affair is marvellous.  The play also features a villainous cadre of Machiavellian lords and churchmen who despise Gaveston for his lower class beginnings, his and Edward's wasting of the nation's treasury, and for Gaveston's sexuality.

As a film, the play is already known to many through Derek Jarman's 1992 experimental version of it, featuring good performances by an angry, spiteful Gaveston (Andrew Tiernan)and Queen Isabella (a young Tilda Swinton).  Its chief feature is a peculiar cutting and pasting of text and plotline, interlarding the play with a song performed by Annie Lennox and modern gay rights demonstrations and police brutality.

That said, the 1969 BBC Edward II starring a very young and gorgeous Ian McKellen in a filmed stage performance of the play is a wonderful surprise, a delight in every way.  McKellen is more passionate, spontaneous, and utterly possessed by his role than I have ever seen him; he has obviously learned his chops, but there's a sense that this performance is 90% ""going on nerves"" in the best sense.  James Laurenson's Gaveston is more nuanced than Tiernan's, and the film itself is less polemic than Jarman's: it focuses much more closely on the depth of their love.  The supporting cast is uniformly excellent, and one should not be put off by the fact that this is a film of stage performance; the work is so good that one quickly overlooks the difficulties of transition.  Costumes bring one a humorous reminder of the colorful sixties, but they aren't too intrusive, and the film quality is very good, given the fact that this is a product of that decade.",1255824000,22,2163,5.053370786516854
3781110,4,B001RUALEC,"Mostly well-staged and well-acted version of Marlowe's Edward II sometimes hampered by technical limitations of 1969 studio recordings: color variations and ghosting not too bad, but unfortunately the sound boom operator often misses covering the actors--the variable sound quality isn't ""drop out""--just the guy holding the pole not moving fast enough.
For some reason the ""Three poor men"" sequence with Gaveston is trimmed in the beginning (you'll note the bad cut a few minutes in)--yet the actors names appear in the credits.
A strange ""Marlowe Coroner's Inquest"" narrated by Patrick Stewart is an extra.
Performances mostly 5 & Technical aspects mostly 3 = 4 overall",1247616000,24,671,5.4
3781111,5,B001RUALEC,"Wow, have I been hoping against hope that this production would one day make it to DVD.  I just gasped out loud when I saw it popup! I've had an old VHS tape that was taped off broadcast in 1975!  Needless to say, it is very worn out by now.

If you are a fan of McKellen or great classical theater, you've got to have this.  Now, if the BBC would only put out their great ""Wars of the Roses"" series from the 60s (those old VHS tapes are nearly worn out too!), I would be grateful forever!  Thanks again, BBC!  Your collections of Chekhov, Ibsen and Noel Coward were fantastic, and the fact that they are now putting out this Edward II is very admirable.",1236816000,38,654,4.150793650793651

8338895,3,B001RUALEC,"This is a VERY 1960s production of Marlowe's ""Edward 2"".  There are no furnishings on the set, which is a simple ""marble"" floor of concentric circles, with curtains of chains around the perimeter.  The costumes are pseudo-medieval, but with psychedelic touches such as tie-dye capes and tabards.  Weird!
The acting is too-earnest for my tastes.  I normally like Ian McKellen, but he and his colleagues are rather over-blown here.
The story has strong homoerotic overtones and is quite violent: for adults only.  I can't say as I enjoyed it, but it was interesting to finally see.

The best part of this DVD is an 80-minute supplement entitled ""The Marlowe Inquest"".  It uses excellent actors to play the roles of three barristers who subscribe to the three most prominent theories of Marlowe's death, along with ones playing Marlowe's contemporaries (Thomas Kidd, for example) who were involved in the ""Star Chamber"" investigation. The contemporaries of Marlowe are in period costume, while the inquest itself is set in modern times (the 1980s).  It's really a fine production -- far better than I anticipated -- and alone worth the price of the DVD.

8338896,4,B001RUALEC,"Well acted, but it was filmed right off of the stage play. It was not opened out for the camera at all",1380672000,,102,3.6818181818181817
8338897,5,B001RUALEC,"I cannot say too many good things about this play, as it seems to have all the best aspects of Elizabethan drama that may have been ""overdone"" in Marlowe's more famous ""Dr. Faustus"". The jewel in this setting is the performance of a very young Ian McKellen, almost unrecognizable compared to his Gandalf and Magneto roles, and even to his Shakespearean roles such as in King Lear.

The staging is cramped. Everything happens on what appears to be a circle not much more than 30 feet in diameter, and McKellen seems to be in the middle of the stage for the entire performance. Actors enter or leave the circle from the four points of the compass. The plot swings between Edward II's two male favorite (probably lovers)Piers Gaveston and Spenser, both commoners. The nobility seem to be more upset with the fact that they are not nobles than the fact that they are not women.

Edward II was the son of the powerful king Edward Longshanks (See ""Lionheart"")and father to the equally powerful Edward III. But Edward II's reign was a disgrace. And even thought Edward II was two kings before the beginning of the War of the Roses, which Shakespeare covers in eight plays, from Richard II to Richard III, Edward II takes advantages from its small scale, and its focus on one very strongly played part, done to a tee by McKellen. I read that this was a performance by which McKellen's reputation as an actor was made. I believe it.",1379808000,,1423,4.620553359683795
8338898,3,B001RUALEC,"Kenneth Anger's ""Edward II"" is a reaction to the Thatcher via the play, and it is a commentary on Marlowe's play -- a secondary reading. What we did not have, though, and do not have, is a middle of the road standard reading of the play. This 1969 staging is all there is, and it's eccentric.

The interpretation is not tragic. Edward is played as insane more than mistaken, and his lines are run through at an antic pace for two acts before the deposition scene -- as if the producers and directors were waiting for The Important Bit. Given that James I was coming to the throne and that we now read Renaissance authors and their works as poses and politically charged, we need to read this play as a tragedy, and a warning on par with Shakespeare's warnings in Macbeth.",1362528000,5,771,4.429577464788732
8338899,5,B001RUALEC,"Most of the previous reviews are spot-on. Basically, this production is quite well done, if a little dated, but if you don't like to watch classical theater then you probably won't enjoy it. I really enjoyed it.

What hasn't genereated much reaction in these reviews is the bonus piece: The Marlowe Inquest. This is a part theater, part history, part ad-lib (there is no script) video that intends to explore the mystery surrounding the death of the playwright. The set up is 3 barristers with 3 different theories about Marlowe's death question a series of actors playing various people involved. All of the answers provided by the actors are promised to be true according to the facts as we know them, and yet what emerges is a murky past in which anything could have happened, and the ""official"" version seems to be the least likely to be true. I almost turned it off, but I'm glad I gave it a chance because it turned out to be fascinating.",1354579200,,944,4.619047619047619
