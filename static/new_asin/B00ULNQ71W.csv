7052073,5,B00ULNQ71W,"I'm a gay man, and I was threatened with death by two complete homophobic strangers. With that in mind let me say this DVD was very helpful. I learned enough basic techniques that give me peace and confidence that I can defend myself if I need to. What comes to mind is the palm strike for someone in front, the elbow strike for attacks from the side, and the importance of posture to de-escalate a tense situation. I know how scared I was when those guys were threatening me, so the purchase price of this DVD is so well worth the confidence to feel safe walking down a public street again. I can safely say, if I met those guys today, I could escape the situation or f them up if it came to that. This is a good training DVD, believe me.",1374969600,10,739,4.174825174825175
7052074,4,B00ULNQ71W,"Good book, great content, clear, understandable, good basic guide to confirm if want to continue in these dicipline or technique.",1370390400,,129,5.5
7052075,3,B00ULNQ71W,Good start up DVD.  Shows the very basics...Assists with technique which is vital to doing the moves correctly.  Slow enough to allow you to stay with the video.  I would recommend this video to my friends.,1361836800,6,206,4.666666666666667
7052076,5,B00ULNQ71W,"I have been practicing the martial arts for 38 years and have been teaching for 23 years and I found this and the other Krav Maga DVD produced and taught by Michael Hodges to be excellent resources for the practice of Krav Maga and for anyone who wishes to learn the basics of effective and efficient self-defense. I am also a police instructor and full-time police officer and I am integrating some of these basic, yet effective, techniques into my training program for the officers who serve on my police department.

Mr. Hodges' teaching style is very straightforward and is appropriate for students and instructors who learn from a variety of learning modalities such as Visual (Mr. Hodges shows you the techniques), Aural (hearing - Mr. Hodges explains the techniques), and Kinesthetic (Mr. Hodges has the student actually do the techniques with him).

I am also a university professor part-time and a researcher and have a Ph. D. in Education and from my professional background and experience I am aware of what effective learning methodologies looks like; Mr. Hodges has hit the nail on the head with his instructional techniques.

Overall, the cost is fantastic and an outstanding bargain! Do yourself a favor if you are a Krav Maga practitioner, enthusiast, or a martial artist who wishes to add some basic and solid techniques to your training program and purchase both of Mr. Hodges' Krav Maga videos; you will not be disappointed!

7052077,2,B00ULNQ71W,Have much better technique on youtube for free.  Sorry I bought this.,1424044800,2,69,4.75
7052078,4,B00ULNQ71W,ok.,1422835200,,3,3.0
7052079,5,B00ULNQ71W,"I ordered this DVD inorder to gain a beginner orientation while taking Krav Maga class instruction at the same time.
1.  What I have found is that for my beginner purposes what/how he teaches is reasonably consistent with the class room.
2. Additionally, the methods taught in this DVD appear to CLOSELY correlate with the methods shown/described within the texts entitled ""The Complete Krav Maga,"" as well as, ""Krav Maga for Beginners.""
3.  In mapping Michael Hodge's instructions against said instruction manuals I found that this DVD addresses some of both Level 1 and Level 2, but not all.  Meanwhile, I did not expect all of Level 1 and 2 to be covered.  For my purposes, I would have been happy if merely some of Level 1 was all that was taught.
4.  There are a few of his techniques that I could not find in either of the above texts.
5.  His verbal communication is clear.
6.  His multi-angle and repetitive movements are well videoed.  In many of the techiques he uses a partner for additional visual clarity.
Based on my degree of satisfaction with this DVD, I just purchased his other two DVDs: Combatives and the Workout.",1416355200,3,1133,4.658291457286432

8707320,5,B00ULNQ71W,They take the time to break it down for at home training. Let me say that this is not the same training you would receive if being taught in a dojo. Make sure you stretch and make sure your GP (DR) is aware if you have any physical conditions,1523664000,,242,3.9591836734693877

8707324,3,B00ULNQ71W,I learned maybe a few moves in this video. A lot of the scenes seemed like a repeat for the most part and I wish the video was longer.,1463529600,,134,3.6551724137931036

8707326,5,B00ULNQ71W,This training video is very good for a beginner to Krav Maga or as a refresher for someone who has trained with Krav Maga previously.

8707328,5,B00ULNQ71W,"Having taken Kempo for years I wanted something new. Unfortunately there are no Krav Maga studios near my location, so with a bit of research these instructional videos seemed the next logical step - all other DVD's are dated as hell. In any case, there are multiple steps and examples for each particular block, strike, etc. with thorough and practical elucidation. I suggest buying the Total Krav Maga video they offer as the DVD's are as good as it gets outside of the dojo - at least that's my next step drawing from the quality of the Beginners DVD.",1432857600,12,554,4.606060606060606
