8682014,5,B000CBCJOM,"I have had this tape for quite some time and as someone who yo-yo's (on both diet and exercise), this is a great video to return to when it's time to shape up.  It also makes for a great workout when you are in the midst of an exercise regime.  I like the various components that Kathy Smith has brought together from her various videos.  Yes, it looks dated by today's standards.  You may even find yourself strolling down memory lane with some of the outfits and styles.  Who remembers when they wore pantyhose or tights with their workout wear?  How about legwarmers?  But put that aside and it's a good workout.  This one is especially good for beginners because it offers little pop ups during the workout to show you how to stand, what foot position, etc.  She also stops after every segment for a pulse count, again, helpful to the beginner to know if you are working too hard or not enough.  So buy it and enjoy!",1153872000,5,920,4.390532544378698
