8019466,3,B00020HA9M,"This is a terrible film that has camp MST value.

In the another ironically named town of Harmony, Mayor Howard Bains (Martin Landau) is using strong armed tactics to take over the businesses. He has his eye on the oriental restaurant and uses Rudy (Don Swayze) to bully people because Patrick Swayze would want too much after his ""Roadhouse"" gig. Then suddenly a stranger (David Heavener) comes to town to save the merchants from the evil mayor. About 5 minutes from the end of the film his identity is revealed.

The stranger plays his own harmonica to provide his own swagger music. The Troma version opens up with a bit about celebrity brothers. The fighting choreography  was noticeably bad as there were frequent mini-pauses during the fighting. The dialogue was all cliche and plot was strikingly unoriginal. It was like watching a train wreak. I had to keep watching. Joe Estevez has a minor role making for a famous brother (Martin Sheen)theme.

Guide: No f-bombs. Sex and nudity (Sally Kirkland, Wendy Pan + Troma extras) 3 STARS because I did like it although it was bad.",1416960000,,1082,4.801075268817204

8019468,4,B00020HA9M,"When it comes to B movies of the 90's one fact is always evident: If it stars Don Swayze it's a four star rating no matter how horrid the movie is. That is one of the rules we've lived by since stumbling upon cinemas finest creation,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Ring/dp/B00069QD74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Ring</a>&nbsp;in 1994. Since that fateful night we just viewed movies in a much different light. And this is the reason we could find Eye of the Stranger actually watchable, which was a very big stretch even for us. Despite it's nightmarishly written dialogue acted out in the driest fashion possible, we found a way to get a fair amount of laughs and a huge dose of bewilderment. This was all due to the movie combo powerhouse of Estevez and Swayze. We haven't seen this duo together since Money to Burn and was pleased to see they didn't lose their on screen chemistry. To 99% of the worlds population (even including Don Swayze) Eye of the Stranger is beyond unwatchable. The only way to get through it is to focus all your energy on the distorted face and inaudible dialogue of Patrick's younger, far more talented, brother. We were in shock (oscar winning) Martin Landau was in this movie. His agent must have gotten him high off peyote and dragged him to this set without him knowing.

If one could try a muster up a plot synopsis this would be it. A small town is ripped off by the low life mayor who uses Don Swayze and some fat drunk guy to intimidate them (much like Brad Wesley's tactics in Road House). Out of nowhere this weird guy known as ""stranger"", whose always lighting a smoke while x files sounding music play, shows up in to town. He says ""My name a Stranger I new in town"" and starts to overthrow the current Mayor by having the guy who owns the Chinese Restaurant take him on in the election polls. That's it, that's the story stretched into an hour and a half of torture. This was clearly a movie that started with an idea written on a cocktail napkin which turned into a free for all half way through. They were obviously coming up with the plot as the movie was rolling. Even Estevez, who plays the drunk town sheriff, disappears 25 minutes in with no explanation. Estevez realized how horrible this movie was and ran for his life after the first day of shooting. Not even Swayze himself could persuade him back. The only saving grace was the old boy Don and his sleeveless plaid shirts. He must have reused the wardrobe from Money to Burn which was furnished entirely by Knights of the Round Table.

Eye of the Stranger is one of the most convoluted movies we have seen in our entire lives. This whole bizarre town election idea made zero sense being the same 14 people were in the movie the entire time. Seriously, there were only 14 people in the whole movie. Wherever they shot this had to be in an actual ghost town. It had no signs of outside life apparent at anytime, it was hilarious. In its defense the movie had an exorbitant amount of Swayze on screen time and a good 15 minutes of Joe Estevez, making it well worth the watch. A normal person would consider jumping out the window before they'd sit through the entire movie, but we're committed to the B and owe it to John Blackwell after he stole our hearts in Death Ring. The best part of the movie BY FAR was when Swayze met his maker. In the final scene he gets thrown off the roof, and due to extremely poor editing, you can actually see a part of the airbag he lands on come into the bottom of the screen. They didn't even attempt to cut it out. It was reminiscent of the time we saw the stagehand and his ladder in a frame of the Ginegerdead Man. Just fantastic.",1331942400,2,3723,4.538690476190476
