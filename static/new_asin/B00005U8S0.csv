7954286,5,B00005U8S0,My son is obsessed with trains! This dvd is a huge hit! Contemporary and educational. Not fuzzy and out of date like some other train DVDs that we have. Thanks Fred Levine!,1495670400,,172,4.40625
7954287,5,B00005U8S0,"My son loves this DVD so much, he wore it out!!! We actually purchased his first one at the Conway Scenic Railway, where this DVD was made.  Hence his love for the DVD. The trains in the DVD are just as stunning as they are in person. It really takes you there.",1493424000,,261,4.019230769230769

7954289,5,B00005U8S0,"These movies are intended for children and they do a superb job entertaining my 2 and 4 year old children.  I love all of Fred Levine's movies because they are free of the messaging that is so prevalent in modern cartoons and children's programing that streams in through the Disney, Sprout, etc networks.  The content is simply learning about different jobs and types of work to which children are naturally drawn.  I can't praise them enough!",1427587200,3,444,4.815789473684211

7954293,2,B00005U8S0,Seems well intentioned but unfortunately better films are available for free on Youtube.  Lots of off the front and off the back rail shots with zero trains in view along with an annoying bit where some action in the cab of a steam engine is fast forwarded with some sort of Laurel and Hardy music.  Save your money.,1416960000,,316,4.431034482758621

The story of ""All Aboard for Eureka"" takes place in modern day Japan on the Kyushu island. When the kidnapper of a bus opens fire, all but three passengers got killed. The three survivors are: Kozue, a ten year old girl; her twelve year old brother Naoki, and the bus driver himself, Makoto. The tragedy's everlasting aftershock made them outsiders, because neither the children's parents nor the bus driver himself can deal with the situation. The children's mother leaves them, their father dies shortly after. Makoto too leaves his home and wanders around for two years. Now orphans, the young kids reject every form of communication. They are barricading themselves in their house and refuse to go to school anymore. After almost two years, Makoto returns home. At the same time, a serial killer is on the rampage in Makoto's hometown. Makoto gets suspected. When even his very own relatives turn their back on him, he joins forces with the two young kids. The two kids are now living with some sort of a guardian, Akihiko, their 22 two year old cousin from Tokyo. Tired of their life, the four of them decide to go on a journey that will change their life again.
Shinji Aoyama's ""All Aboard for Eureka"" is one of the most daring movies I've ever seen and I guess my english is just too bad to describe this movie accurately.
The beautiful black & white photography (with a stunning color sequence at the end), the tremendous performances, and the breathtaking cinemascope images are overwhelming. The script (written by the director) is perfect in every sense of the word, considering the film's epic length, there is no single superfluous moment in the entire picture !
""All Aboard for Eureka"" is a triumph for its creator and stars, it is a masterpiece of world cinema, both poetic and philosophical. And it is also one of the most unforgettable spiritual movie experiences I've ever had !",1011225600,2,2065,4.7229916897506925
