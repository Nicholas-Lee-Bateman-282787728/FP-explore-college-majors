8464850,5,B005C6FP0C,"I love this dvd. As an ""IC sufferer"" myself I highly recommend it. I tried all medical options I could get in this country and nothing really worked or helped, so I had to turn to holistic medicine. Catherine's books were first to show me the way and her dvd is more like a nice ""conclusion"". 4 years after the beginning of this hell I am so much better but I had to turn to alternative medicine and I don't regret it at all. Thanks, Cat for this dvd, it really makes big difference in ""ICers"" life.",1323561600,,499,4.154639175257732
8464851,5,B005C6FP0C,"I was very impressed with this CD.  I am a 21 year old man and have been suffering with IC for about 2 years now. I actually diagnosed myself 5 months ago. I went to the doctor to tell him im 95% sure this is what i had and he looked at me like i was nuts. Saying i was too young, and it only affected women. He thought i had prostatitis prior to this. So he did a cysto w/ hydo and that was definitely the worst experience in my entire life. I went home and i could hardly pee. Everything that came out was just gushing blood and it hurt so badly. But i did eventually get all that blood out, and a good outcome from this is i was diagnosed with IC. He gave me elmiron and i am currently taking them. I have noticed a VERY small improvement so thats good. I decided to give this thing a year, if i am not better by then, then i will definitely try catherines approach.",1317081600,,869,3.9096045197740112
8464852,5,B005C6FP0C,"I am not sure there are words that can give due justice to what Catherine Simone has done for my life and so many others with IC.  From the first time I spoke with her, she has done nothing but give me compassion, hope, and healing in so many ways.  This dvd is no exception.  I am a recovering IC patient that without reading Cath's books and communicating with her, would be nowhere near where I am today..There is no way any of us could ever re-pay her enough.  I found so much help in her books alone and I recommend all 3 of her books equally to anyone who has IC or wants to understand it fully. After watching this DVD..I learned even more.  My favorite part was to see Catherine most of all..to hear her talk about IC and to actually SEE her HAPPY and truly HEALTHY.  You can tell that she IS HEALTHY and fully recovered from IC.  This gives me even more hope than reading her books.  One of the more important things that Catherine addresses in the DVD is that there are ""root causes"" of IC and that until these ""root causes"" remain in the body, we will more than likely have a rough time fully recovering from IC.  Something else that really caught my attention in the dvd is that ~ its not only important to get rid of internal physical toxins, but it's just as fully important to remove toxic people and situations from your life. To be happy in spirit is important in recovering from IC.  You can find more information about the mind-body-spirit connection in Catherine's  3rd book ""Awakening Through the Tears"", which I highly recommend. My absolute favorite part of the dvd was the lovely music.  In the music it correlates hope and relaxation for our mind and body to focus on healing from the illness and then being able to form a healing plan once the dvd has ended.  It's also important for loved ones who do not have IC to sit and watch because it gives a real sense of reality and hope for them as well, which I could tell my mom was very hopeful and excited for my healing after watching it. All of my family who has seen the dvd is truly supportive and believes that I am able to recover  from IC now.  For people that are either too busy to read or just in too much pain for it, this DVD is nothing short of informative and gives you all the perspectives of IC from many people who are recovered from all around the world.  Catherine helps to make it easy with this DVD.  When you have an illness where the medical community gives you no hope and there is not much understanding, this dvd does give hope and helps you to easily formulate a plan for your healing path with all the information that the medical community does not address.  After watching the dvd IC hope, you will fully understand what it means to have IC, how you may have got it, how to address these root causes, and lastly how to recover.  Don't live with IC, recover and get your life back.  This DVD will help YOU.",1312761600,6,2909,4.293040293040293
8464853,5,B005C6FP0C,"I have read Cathrine's books, spoken to her on the phone, and watched this DVD. She is someone who has dedicated her life to helping people heal from IC. Today, I had a particularly tough day and this DVD arrived in the mail. It made me cry and it made me feel connected with all the other patients who have suffered with IC and are now better. Words can't begin to describe what it's like to see people like you, who have suffered the same way you have and are now better. The name is very appropriate for this DVD. It is all about giving hope. The DVD is informative as well, but you can find more in depth information in Cathrine Simone's books. She has written three books which I read and reference on more than one occasion. THIS DVD IS A MUST for ANYONE suffering with IC or knows somebody who does! As long as Cathrine is writting books or making DVDs, I will be the first to purchase them. They are an INVALUABLE tool to an IC person's recovery from Interstitial Cystitis. I am trying to follow Cathrine's advice about a holistic approach and believe with all my being that I will get better and you will too! It is inspirational. Thank you Cathrine!

8464854,5,B005C6FP0C,"This DVD is amazing. You hear the stories of those who have suffered and are on their own healing path through Catherines help. It walks you through all of the suffering and tells things that they did to ease the pain of IC. Simone has such a heart for IC sufferers and you can see it seep through this DVD. She gives advice on how she healed herself and how you can heal too. It is wonderful to see so many people come together to make this DVD possible. All the stories show those who have suffered and were tired of being told that their illness was ""invisible"". Most refused to believe doctors saying that they couldn't get better and choose another path. The healing path. This path works and this DVD shows just how it works. It worked for me! I was in such awe watching all the faces of those who have suffered and couldn't help but think of those still out there suffering. This DVD can give those people hope and help and maybe even that push they needed to try something new. IC Hope can be a lifesaver if you take it in a follow the advice and listen to your own body.",1311984000,,1079,4.217391304347826
8464855,5,B005C6FP0C,"It gives me great satisfaction to commend Catherine Simone on her latest creation. I did not think it was possible for Catherine to top her books, but she has!!! This DVD gave me chills and had me tearing up at times. It was great to hear testimonies from different IC patients and how they have all healed through alternative therapies. This DVD, along with Catherine's books should be a staple for every IC patient. Catherine is a wealth of knowledge and these items are invaluable to us.

Often times, doctors and medical reports make you feel as if there is NO HOPE and that life is over, however, she brings us hope and faith that IC can be cured and it WILL be..and not through conventional medicine or treatments. She has said time and time again that this is NOT just a bladder disease and that we all have to find the root cause, which will be different for each of us.

I can see myself watching this throughout the course of my healing when I am having a down day or even having a friend or family member watch it to have them gain a better understanding of what IC really is. I wholeheartedly recommend Catherine's DVD and books, they are so encouraging.

To all my IC friends, please remember, victory and defeat are born in the mind..& WE WILL ALL HAVE VICTORY!",1311897600,,1275,4.44017094017094
8464856,5,B005C6FP0C,"For anyone suffering with I.C., I definitely recommend you get this DVD.  It was extremely informative and was a great way to get multiple perspectives from multiple people who have suffered from I.C.  The DVD chronicles a number of people with the disease and they discuss their struggles, obstacles they faced, and paths they took along the way.  Along with I.C. sufferers around the world, you also get to see Catherine Simone speak on the subject of I.C.  She discusses the struggles she faced with having I.C., things she discovered along her path to healing, as well as tips on how to get going in the right direction.  This information combined with the information provided by other I.C. sufferers around the world made for a truly informative/uplifting message.

Being an I.C. sufferer myself, I literally got goosebumps watching each and every person talk and discuss the struggles that I.C. has brought in their life.  It really touched me knowing that there are people out there that are going through the same struggles as me and fighting to get better.  I truly can't say enough about this DVD as it is a one of a kind tool for I.C. sufferers around the world.  Best of luck to you all in your healing process!",1311379200,,1224,4.735849056603773
8464857,5,B005C6FP0C,"Catherine Simone was first diagnosed in the early 1990s with IC, and while healing herself of this horrible `dis-ease', she simultaneously helped thousands of others do so as well. In her three books, she shared natural and alternative therapies and practical and inexpensive ideas for maneuvering through this tricky illness that is more than just a bladder disorder. This CD is almost a culmination of that work, as she and others who have suffered through IC share their journeys and successes with their fellow IC sufferers.  You'll see and hear from people who have used her healing path and come out healthier and stronger. Catherine also outlines specifics of how to begin the journey to health, what to avoid, and how to stay motivated along the way. This uplifting yet informative CD will give you hope that you, too--or someone you love--can heal.

Because of Cath, I can now happily report that I am a FORMER IC sufferer. With the help of her books and her website, and now her DVD, I am pain free and have my life back.  It took about three years to COMPLETELY heal, but I felt better within a couple of weeks of reading her books.  And if you suffer from IC, weeks can seem like forever, but just know that this complete healing process is so worth it. You will get your life back.  Thank you to Cath for helping me and so many others to heal--fully. She is truly a lifesaver.",1311379200,2,1389,4.584677419354839
8464858,5,B005C6FP0C,"The entire presentation of the DVD is perfect from the diverse faces representing IC to the opportunities to read especially important points allowing the viewer to process within themselves.  While viewing the DVD the first thing I thought was this DVD would have been so much less overwhelming than diving into all of the literature on IC.  I was so scared and overwhelmed when I was sick that my husband actually read Catherine Simone's books first because I was having trouble believing or trusting anyone.  Watching the DVD allows you to see normal people that you can relate to and most importantly see and hear Catherine Simone who has such an amazing ability to explain, educate, and support IC suffers in such an honest and raw way.  This honesty which is written all over her face is what I find so hopeful and I know will inspire and encourage others. Thank you Catherine for being so brave in telling your story and determined, intelligent and selfless to learn what you have and share it with all of us.",1311206400,,1016,4.691011235955056
