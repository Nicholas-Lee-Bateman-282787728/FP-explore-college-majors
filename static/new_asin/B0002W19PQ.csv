8033584,5,B0002W19PQ,"I was at this concert in Central Park, NYC, back in June 26, 1993. Great performance by LP. He look like  an angel was singing on earth. I will strongly recomend this cd to any one who likes LP",1427760000,3,193,3.948717948717949
8033585,5,B0002W19PQ,"when asked about the White Album, ""It's the White Album. It's The Beatles. Shut up.""  This DVD is sublime, it's beyond beautiful.

Just buy it. Make your children and grandchildren watch it.  if you don't have any, make your neighbors watch it.  Or strangers.  Play it loud on the subway or bus.

Or, shall I say, it's Pavarotti. It's the Phil. Shut up.",1380499200,3,353,4.523809523809524
8033586,5,B0002W19PQ,I've wanted this DVD since I saw it on tv some time ago.  It's better than I hoped.  Great close-ups of Pavarotti give you a look at how much power he had in his voice.  He sang so many of my favorites.  I'm so glad I bought it!,1373068800,3,228,3.6875

8033588,5,B0002W19PQ,It's really one of the best filmed concerts of his. He had just recovered from surgery and some other ailments and there's an earnestness that is deeply moving on Lamento di Federico,1370390400,2,182,4.71875
8033589,4,B0002W19PQ,"Never disappointed in Pavarotti, the greatest tenor of our time.  I enjoyed the DVD but the addition of the modern Harlem group was a real anticlimax to the gorgeous Verdi music, Pavarotti's voice and the flutist and orchestra. I did not care for the mixture of genres which is what took away the one star which would have made the experience a perfect one for me.",1365292800,2,364,4.515151515151516
8033590,4,B0002W19PQ,"Sorry, but I have to disagree. I find nothing wrong with Pavarotti's voice - it's the quality of sound that's lacking. If one is expecting the lushness of the '90 & '94 3 Tenors Concerts (also done in ""open air"") it's not here. Neither is Zubin. The combined orchestra in Rome was huge and perhaps the ruins had something to do with the acoustics. The L.A. Philharmonic was also large and sounded wonderful in Dodger Stadium. I'd have to guess that this somewhat smaller orchestra is only part of the N.Y. Philharmonic (or is awfully crammed together!), and just doesn't have the flair, crisp definition and drama Zubin is able to coax out when he directs.

As for Pavarotti, his voice is fine - although I do wish he'd stop munching on things while singing - has to be a distraction! There are a number of arias I'm not familiar with and some of these do not seem to be his strong points. However, when he sings arias from the '90 & '94 concerts (his as well as arias from Domingo and Carreras) he's great. His E lucevan le stelle could use a bit more drama in the second half, I didn't care for the arrangement for 'O sole mio and he sings Nessun Dorma a little faster than usual. But OH, those high notes at the end! He takes a deep breath and hits his high B effortlessly, holds it for a loooong time, then drops down to the A and holds that, too. Actually, he hits ALL of his high notes in this recording well. The N.Y audience certainly loved him - MANY standing ovations. I almost didn't buy this because of the previous review, but my sister saw it on television, recommended it, and now I'm glad I did.",1200873600,,1611,4.3344370860927155
