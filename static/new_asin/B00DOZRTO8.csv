5839531,4,B00DOZRTO8,My 1yr old absolutely loves Yo Gabba Gabba. Every time I turn it on she gets so excited. The only differences about this Dvd from the other Gabbas I have is that it's not made by Nickelodeon and it's much shorter. Still very cute though.,1476835200,,237,4.288888888888889
5839532,5,B00DOZRTO8,Great DVD for the price for any YGG lover in your household! Both my kids are Yo Gabba Gabba fans and my little boy is always requesting to watch it.,1474675200,,149,4.0

5839537,5,B00DOZRTO8,"I love Yo Gabba Gabba. I wish the program was more widely available. It was on Netflix and we watched it all the time. The toys and the party gear are hard to find. The clothes are extremely hard to find, and even if you have Amazon Prime you still have to pay for episodes. My wish would be for all the seasons to be available on DVD, but until then, we will settle for these compilation DVDs to sing along with the Yo Gabba Gabba gang we love so dearly.",1465344000,,455,4.010989010989011
5839538,3,B00DOZRTO8,"Only two episodes, it's ok, but not great. Didn't keep my sons attention for long and he loves Yo Gabba Gabba. But I purchased it for $1.99, so I can't complain too much.",1465257600,,170,4.181818181818182

5839542,4,B00DOZRTO8,"With our toddlers, we can never go wrong with Yo Gabba Gabba. It's a fun and funky show to say the least. This Christmas DVD is a great addition to our holiday collection, but as entertaining as it may be, it isn't near as good as their regular shows. This DVD also isn't as long as some of their others. But for the special occasion and lower price, it is totally worth it.",1459123200,,374,4.136986301369863
5839543,5,B00DOZRTO8,"I'm not going to lie i bought this because of the MCR appearance and because it was only $2 but it is actually incredibility entertaining to me! I have played it 3 times already since I've gotten it yesterday, keep in mind I am a child-less 20 year old. It's just plain fun!!",1458259200,,275,4.2075471698113205

5839565,5,B00DOZRTO8,"This DVD is very age appropriate for little kids, ideally toddlers. The whole theme is festive and happy without any political indoctrination. There are singalongs, which my kids especially loved. Even at 55 minutes run time, it seems quite short - that means it is fun to watch, in general.",1444780800,6,291,4.84

5839604,5,B00DOZRTO8,"I bought this dvd because my son loves yo gabba gabba. This dvd has only two movies which is the downside, but it's both the Christmas shows and if you've been to the yo gabba gabba very awesome Christmas concert you don't know what you're missing. This dvd pretty much follows the concert so it was pretty awesome to be able to watch the dvd at home and then able to go to a very awesome Christmas concert was very AWESOME. I would recommend this dvd to any gabba fan.",1389139200,,469,4.222222222222222

5839607,5,B00DOZRTO8,"Seen the face of my 2 years old daughter, jumping and shouting Gabba, Gabba is priceless. On Christmas day we saw the DVD and it's geat except for all the commercials at the beginning of it. I strongly reccomend it if your child it's a big fan of this show as my little girl.",1388361600,,275,4.111111111111111
5839608,5,B00DOZRTO8,This is a wonderful DVD for those Yo Gabba Gabba fans. It was fun to see the familiar figures in the Christmas setting.,1388275200,,119,4.217391304347826
5839619,5,B00DOZRTO8,My toddlers love the Christmas videos. Anything Yo Gabba Gabba is great.  Their programs are always high quality entertainment and educational.,1388188800,,143,5.809523809523809
5839620,5,B00DOZRTO8,I rated this dvd five stars because the dvd was sent quickly and my son loves Yo Gabba Gabba and especially this dvd is a christmas one.,1388016000,,136,4.074074074074074
5839621,1,B00DOZRTO8,I looked for a couple of days for the Yo Gabba series.  All others were a little more expensive.  I liked the price and variety available.,1387756800,,138,4.269230769230769
5839622,5,B00DOZRTO8,"So far she loves it and watches it over and over and over and over, so I would say she likes it.",1387411200,,96,3.409090909090909
5839623,2,B00DOZRTO8,"I only bought this because I have all the other YGG DVDs for my daughter but, really, I should've known better. It only comes with 2 episodes; A Very Special Christmas and Christmas. While I still enjoy the show and it still entertains my daughter, the value of having this in our collection is lost. The DVD is not made like the others. It doesn't continually run/start on its own. I have to manually start it every time after both shows are finished (50 minutes). It gets annoying after a while. The advertisements for other shows and DVDs are what fill up the rest of this shameful DVD. I am not pleased at all with this purchase.",1387238400,,633,4.418803418803419
5839624,5,B00DOZRTO8,"This DVD is a lot of fun! My three year old son is the big Yo Gabba Gabba fan of the house, but my 6 year old who usually isn't interested in this show regularly asks if he can watch this one too. My personal favorite part is when Mark Mothersbaugh does a song about making Christmas gifts. In the regular show we usually don't get to see very much of him. It's a catchy song too. DJ Lance sits down to the piano and plays a song which we also don't get to see during the regular show. Leslie Hall is in this video too... man, she lost a lot of weight, didn't she?! If you have a Yo Gabba Gabba fan in your house, this is a ""very awesome"" way for them to get excited about Christmas.",1385856000,5,683,3.920863309352518
5839625,4,B00DOZRTO8,"A little bit cheesy, but a welcome change to the regular DVD we have been playing on repeat for months. Tori Spellng is super annoying as a guest. My son loves the two episodes on this DVD.",1385856000,,189,4.135135135135135
5839626,5,B00DOZRTO8,"Our 8 month old LOVES this video, and I'll be honest, mommy and daddy love watching it too. My only complaint is the Wiggles commercial between 2 of the episodes. The volume is about 10 times louder than the rest of the DVD, so of course we put him to sleep with Gabba and then BAM, that darn Wiggles ad wakes him up. Otherwise, we LOVE gabba!",1385424000,,343,4.134328358208955
5839627,5,B00DOZRTO8,This is a great episode -- my DD loves it (and so do I).  I highly recommend it!  Great special guests also!,1385424000,3,108,3.8636363636363638
5839628,5,B00DOZRTO8,We are a Yo Gabba Gabba household. I knew when I saw this DVD that we had to have it in our collection. My three year old is obsessed with these quirky characters. The Christmas DVD is a great addition to any YGG collection,1385078400,4,223,4.090909090909091
