5708656,5,B00CA3M7H4,Veggie tales delivers again as the kids love these movies. It's great that they come out with different ones so the kids can learn different things about life and God!,1381104000,,167,4.6
5708657,3,B00CA3M7H4,"I have done A LOT of Veggie Tales reviews through the years.  Our family has EVERY Veggie Tales ever released as well as books, toys (oh, so many toys) and so much more.  If you are a fan, you are going to want this in your collection.  While it is by far not the worst Veggie Tale video they have made it is not the best either; definitely not in the top ten.  It has a great story line & some really great gags for kids & adults.  It just kind of fell flat; honestly, the music (especially the silly song) just wasn't up to Veggie Tale standards.  It was nice to see Bob in a more prominent role. (he's my favorite veggie)

If you are a huge Veggie fan, you will be glad to get this one.  If you are not or new to the Veggie world, look elsewhere.",1378684800,7,749,3.9466666666666668
5708658,4,B00CA3M7H4,"It isn't bad, but the movies usually hold my interest as well as my kids. This one just didn't. It is also quite short compared to the other movies. My 2 and 3 year olds seem to like it though.",1377907200,,193,3.85
5708659,5,B00CA3M7H4,"MacLarry and the Stinky Cheese Battle tells the tale of two rival cities who prank eachother. Starting out as a friendship gone bad, there's a sub message about kindness and friendship - I think it's a great way to introduce (or rehash) the topic of bullying to your kids. It opens the door to talking about how 'having a little fun' can go wrong and quickly escalate into something more.

The only thing I found wrong with this movie was that the lesson they were trying to teach - That your talents, though different, are special and needed - wasn't conveyed very well if at all. It was more of the Veggie Tales version of How To Train A Dragon. MacLarry never really appeared to struggle with his love of inventing - only the fact that his father couldn't accept him for who he was. It was still an awesome, wholesome film - and there were takeaways, just not the ones they claimed.

As always, we loved the silly song with Scottish Larry - Though, we don't wear kilts here in America... Oh well, my bonnie lies over the ocean and we received a free copy of this movie in exchange for an honest review.",1377820800,,1105,4.385365853658537
5708660,5,B00CA3M7H4,"We love all the Veggie Tales movies, and this one doesn't disappoint either!  Definitely recommend it for a fun family night.",1377216000,,125,4.9523809523809526
5708661,5,B00CA3M7H4,I've already watched this movie a dozen times and think it's hysterical. It has a good balance of humor and sentiment. I loved the characters and the setting as well. I've already given it to my niece! The message that each person has a gift and God gave us those gifts for a reason is something I wish for every child & adult to believe and embrace. Another win for VeggieTales in my book! Keep them coming.,1376870400,3,408,4.311688311688312
5708662,3,B00CA3M7H4,"The intelligent humor of the first several years of Veggie Tales has been all but left behind in ""MacLarry & the Stinky Cheese Battle"". Part of what made Veggie Tales a success was their ability to appeal not just to young children, but to the college students working in bible book stores across the country. Engaging stories, well-written dialogue and Scriptural truth combined with genuinely funny humor led to twentysomethings being the second-largest consumers of Veggie Tales. That creativity and humor was next to killed in ""The Easter Story"", and is effectively buried in MacLarry.

MacLarry & The Stinky Cheese Battle seems remarkably similar to what Phil Vischer mentioned as a problem dealing with ""Jonah"": Attempting to cram in too much stuff in far too little time...only this time, there was no two-hour movie possibility to allow time for development.  The jokes fall flat, the rushed delivery style makes everything seem irrelevant, and young kids will have a tough time empathizing with characters who (despite the 3D animation) are notably 2D in personality. The characters are more of a ""Bob the Builder"" ensemble in this movie- audiences will find it nearly impossible really cares about any of the characters except MacLarry (Archibald Asparagus doesn't even speak a word, despite being referred to throughout the episode).  As a Veggie Tale, this seems like a cheap knock-off of ""How To Train Your Dragon"", only without the budget, time, creativity or humor.  Nothing intelligent here to keep the attention of the adults watching, and a blur of messiness drains the value out of a formerly worthwhile set of videos.

Terribly jumbled, non-memorable songs about nothing. Badly-done Chuck Norris jokes. Story exposition spit out rapid-fire by side characters for no reason other than saving money on animation.  This DVD views as a cobbled together collection of cheap VT book pages aimed at 3-5 year olds. (The same type of books, by the way, which were a complete flop when marketed by the original Big Idea.)  Sadly, Mike Nawrocki and Chris Wall are simply not the same creative team as the much more dynamic combo of Phil Vischer's intelligence and Nawrocki's humor. Veggie Tales jumped the shark sometime ago, and despite bagpipe music and frenetic kilting, MacLarry and the Stinky Cheese Battle simply serves up another slice of rotting bovine lactation...otherwise known as Stinky Cheese.",1376611200,15,2415,5.176923076923077
5708663,5,B00CA3M7H4,"Cute, good lesson. Even with my boys getting older, they are still enjoying veggie tales and relaying the Bible lesson to others learned in school. Great movie. Wish they were longer.",1376524800,3,183,4.935483870967742
5708664,5,B00CA3M7H4,Wow!  This Veggietales movie is sooo hilariously funny; I couldn't stop watching it!  It seems like this is one of the best movies Veggietales has ever created!,1376092800,,160,4.888888888888889
5708665,5,B00CA3M7H4,"Unlike many of their features, this one seemed much more pointed toward the kids than many of the others when they cleverly include humor for all ages.  Nonetheless it is still a great story and as with all their material, worthy of educational value and clean entertainment.  So it still gets 5-stars despite the younger appeal of the focused audience and such.",1375660800,6,362,4.82258064516129

5708677,5,B00CA3M7H4,"Don't ask me why, but I was less than thrilled when I saw that the summer VeggieTales release would be MacLarry & the Stinky Cheese Battle.  I just didn't think it would that that good.  But, fan that I am, I bought it anyway.  And I must say I enjoyed it.

In answer to a letter the VeggieTales gang has received from a kid whose interests are different than his friends, Scooter steps up to tell a story.  That's right, Scooter the Scottish Carrot.  So is it any wonder that the story takes us back to ancient Scotland?

Well, okay, as they freely admit, it's an alternative universe Scotland where The Barber-barians are just a gorge away from the Romans.  While the two areas used to be friends, harmless pranks got out of hand and now the two sides feud.

Into this world comes MacLarry (Larry the Cucumber as voiced by Mike Nawrocki).  His father is Chog Norrius (voiced by Henry Haggard), the leader of their clan.  But all MacLarry seems to do during his initiations is mess things up.  That's because he's not a good barber or prankster or definitely not a good prankster barber.  Instead, he wants to be an inventor.  But even his inventions don't seem to work right.  Discouraged, he sets out to find his hero, Archimedes.  Will he find him or will he cause an even bigger crisis in this war?

There was nothing especially noteworthy about the story.  It pretty much followed the plot points I was expecting.  But what made it fun was the return of the trademark Veggie humor.  There were site gags and puns aplenty.  Several of them were throw away lines I just loved.  And some of them would even go right over the heads of the kids but be caught by their parents.

The official theme according to the front of the box is ""A lesson in getting along with others.""  I can see that, but it is rather broad.  Instead, I think the lesson is more about accepting others for who they are.  The lesson comes through in the course of the story without preaching, always a plus in this series.  And the Bible verses they share at the end talk about how God has given us each gifts.  Very true.  And learning to accept others as compliments to us is always a good thing no matter what age in life we are.

Yes, there is a silly song.  It's even appropriately themed.  ""Kilts & Stilts"" finds Larry singing in a Scottish accent from atop a pair of stilts.  I didn't think it was that great, but then they kept changing the style Larry was singing in.  All this upsets poor Scooter, which was a real hoot to watch.

The animation and voicework?  It continues to be good.  It's still not big budget, but it is good enough to pull us into the story and that's all it really needs to do.

Really, MacLarry & the Stinky Cheese Battle is just a fun story with a moral we can all learn from.  I'm definitely glad I went ahead and bough it.",1433808000,,2832,4.342256214149139

5708691,5,B00CA3M7H4,"You know how sometimes you're all excited, you get a new CD, listen to it for the first time and think, ""eh...it's ok."" Then you put it to the side. After a long while, you pull it back out and are blown away by how much you love it. Yeah, this movie was like that for me. We're long time Veggietales fans and the first time I saw it I didn't really laugh much or think it was anything special. As I started seeing it more and more, the songs are very catchy, I found the humor that was lost on me the first time, thought the storyline was very clever and lesson endearing. The silly song with Scottish Larry was pretty funny too. So it's now a beloved addition to our Veggietales collection and gets quoted frequently.
