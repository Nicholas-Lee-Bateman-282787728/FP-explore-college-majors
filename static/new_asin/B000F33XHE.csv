2549993,3,B000F33XHE,"I am totally new to the workout video scene, and I bought this one because it was a good price and it claimed to do what I was looking to do--tone.  I, like the other reviewers, found Allie to be cheerful and peppy, but not to a fault.  However, I also found that she moved really quickly from move to move (especially at the beginning, it seems) and I couldn't keep up.  She has all these names for her moves, but I had no idea what they meant until she did them.  We'd do four reps, and then be on to something else!  Also, I wonder if both sides of the body are worked out equally?  It seems like she'd do one move on the right side, and then move onto something different without doing the left side.

As I said, I'm a beginner, so maybe I just need to do the video a few more times to get into the rhythm of it.  It was definitely a good workout, though--my legs a still shaking!",1200960000,8,884,4.011428571428572
2549994,5,B000F33XHE,"Along with the other highly positive reviews, this is a truly excellent workout. I do look forward to it and there are lots of creative moves I've never seen and Allie is just an excellent instructor who is genuinely motivating and generous and lots of fun. I'm a Firm workout user and have them all, but several of hers have become my top favorites, and this one is currently at the top of the stack. Great work!",1200614400,,413,4.376623376623376
2549995,4,B000F33XHE,Out of all of these new Firm dvds this one is my favorite and honestly the only one I will continue to do occasionally.  I got the Transfirmation set and those were terrible.  This dvd is good though. Enjoyed it.,1200182400,6,212,4.275
2549996,5,B000F33XHE,"I haven't got many of The Firm workouts because their older ones didn't do it for me and so I didn't give many of their newer ones a go.  This however, appealed to me as a straight toning workout and I really enjoy it a lot.  Allie Del Rio Pointer is a new instructor to me, and I found her to be very good, not annoying and easy to follow along to.
The entire workout uses weights and to get maximum results, nearly every fast paced exercise works multiple muscles in one go.  She also starts with a basic routine and then adds modifications to increase intensity.  I also like this because all you need is two sets of weights and you're good to go.
This is a good 40 minute routine to really do almost every muscle in your body and based on this workout, I'll definately give The Firm more tries.  I enjoy this and highly recommend it.",1199491200,109,837,4.20625
2549997,5,B000F33XHE,"I just finished this workout and loved it.  It's a complete body toning workout that's not too hardcore.  I have a lot of the older Firm videos, and while I do like the fact that they provide a solid workout, I don't really look forward to doing them because they are so intense.  I regularly do weight training videos, and while this one isn't as tough as the rest, I felt I really got a good workout.  Not only that, but the moves are unique and interesting.  Alli is also a very good instructor (not annoying in any way).  This is a workout I'll look forward to doing again.  Just for the sake of providing details, it's a 40 minute workout and includes abs as well.",1198886400,69,669,4.261904761904762
2549998,5,B000F33XHE,"I recently purchased the three newest Firms (Total Body Toner, Cardio Sculpt Fusion, and Cardio Inferno.)  This is the only one of the three that I'll be keeping.  I really like Allie as an instructor ... she is not overly peppy, nor is she patronizing ... her instruction is clear and concise, and the exercises are ""spot on"" for total body conditioning!  The exercises are structured to work the upper and lower body together (i.e., lunging to the side, then standing up to reach overhead with a light handweight) and the moves are fast enough to give a light cardio workout.  Then its on to the floor for some intense and effective oblique and ab work.  This is a great head-to-toe workout in just 40 minutes!",1198800000,83,712,4.619047619047619
2549999,3,B000F33XHE,"I am a firm junkie and especially like Allie Pointer, but this was a little bit of a letdown.  I think this would be a good beginner video for someone NOT looking for a cardio video.  This is definitly more of a cross-trainer.  I really would like to see more of the old transfirmer upper body moves integrated with some tougher plyometrics like in Allison Davis bootcamp video (which is tough )now that would be the total package!
I hope they can make my wish come true since the last few videos have been not so good.(sculpt and burn, time crunch, killer legs) they just don't have that old muscle exaustion I love.

2550011,5,B000F33XHE,This is the 3rd time I have purchased the firm! I love it that much. Apparently the people I have exercised with an introduced them to the firm love it too. They keep taking mine and I end up having to replace it. Best workout ever!,1476576000,3,232,4.065217391304348
2550012,4,B000F33XHE,"I am a fan of TheFirm work outs and this workout is just as enjoyable as others I use.  Instructions are clear and moves quickly for a nice cardio workout.  You will need light weights to maximize the workout(I use 1,3,5lbs) however it workout is demonstrated without weights as well which is nice for a beginner.

2550017,5,B000F33XHE,Good all around workout.,1453075200,,24,5.25
2550018,5,B000F33XHE,"I have been a fan of the Firm for over twenty years, and they have changed quite a bit in that time.  This workout is from the group sometimes referred to as the ""Pink Firms"".  I have tried quite a few and simply don't jive with them, mainly because there is so much going on.  I understand that compound movements are an effective and time efficient way of working out but sometimes for us choreographically challenged folks, it's overload.

Not the case with Total Body Toner, yes there are some compound movements, even a few that border on too much for me personally but I find it very easy to modify or just leave an option out.  The moves are built gradually and pieces are added on, I simply leave the last add on off.  This 40 minute routine hits everything, though I would have liked to have seen a little more chest work as there is only push ups present.  The workout is mostly weights, though there are a couple small cardio segments and a 4 limb aerobics segment which I consider cardio mostly.  I appreciate the fact that the pace is slow enough that you can heavy up if you want, and there isn't an overdose of reps.  You see all the tried and tried exercises here, squats, lunges, plie squats, bicep curls, tricep french press, back rows, shoulder raises and even one of my favorites, deadlifts.  There are not many Firms that include these so it's a special bonus when they do.

Allie has been a Firm leader for a long time, and this is my favorite workout that is led by her.  She is joined by a few background exercisers, one of them which modifies the moves for beginners.  I consider myself to be a forever intermediate and I will sometimes follow the modifier.  Regardless, I appreciate the fact they have one, just gives us more options to consider.

Overall,  I rate this workout 4 and a half stars.",1451692800,,1823,4.42942942942943
2550019,5,B000F33XHE,Back in 2007 I bought this DVD and was in the best shape of my life! If you want to get lean and fit this is the workout for you! And best of all you can do it at home!!,1450656000,6,169,3.25

2550023,5,B000F33XHE,"This is a great overall weights/ toning video. I really like Allie and she didn't disappoint. Good length too- 40 min. Not too long so I can squeeze it in before work. No real ""cardio"" segments but I wear a heart rate monitor and I was in ""fat burning"" or cardio level the whole time. Use heavier weights to increase intensity. You will sweat!",1439769600,6,343,4.375

2550026,5,B000F33XHE,"I'm not really one to write reviews for things, but I feel as though these workouts deserve recognition. My first experience with The Firm was a few years ago when I decided to buy and try the Transfirmer series of workouts. I wasn't necessarily a beginner at that time, but man..those workouts kicked my butt! I then ordered the previous body sculpting series videos to rotate to avoid boredom. I had great success with them but for whatever reason, I ended up joining a local gym and the The Firm videos/step began collecting dust. Fast forward to present, a husband and almost 2 year old daughter later, I decided I needed something that worked for me at home bc trying to coordinate a toddler to your desired gym schedule isn't necessarily the easiest task (not to mention wasting so much gas). It dawned on me to re-order some of The Firm workouts, new and older DVDs; no more driving 30 minutes to the gym for me! Let me tell you, as someone who is by no means a beginner when it comes to fitness, these workouts are no joke. I got a better workout with these DVDs than I did at any class or time on the treadmill/elliptical. I HIGHLY recommend them to anyone who wants to get in shape and get there FAST. I can tell a change in my body already-they promise results in 10 workouts, but you'll see it before then. Trust me. What's also great is that you can make them as easy or as challenging as you desire-increase or decrease your weight. Either way, you'll get a great workout!",1431993600,5,1486,4.427007299270073

2550044,5,B000F33XHE,"I bought this DVD because I believe the FIRM DVDs are for real women who just want to look like a better version of themselves. I like this DVD because it helps me get tone, but not bulky. I am NOT a cross fit girl! No offense to anyone who is.  This DVD has helped me tone those stubborn mommy areas.  It does a lot of work on the triceps for those mom wings and helps with those thunder thighs and flabby buns.  Now that. My kids are 2 and 4, I can easily squeeze in the 45 minutes  I need to get this DVD done and the time is well spent!",1401494400,5,540,3.794642857142857

2550050,5,B000F33XHE,"I bought this video when it first came out.  It sat in my workout library for awhile. I used it once or twice before I became pregnant.  I didn't truly appreciate this DVD until today.  My two year old keeps me very busy so working out dropped by the wayside.  While my son was watching his movie, I plugged this in my PC and actually completed this workout.  There is no complicated choreography.  It hits all the right spots.  I worked my lats, biceps, triceps, glutes and abs.  This workout is perfectly timed at 40 minutes.  There isn't a ton of instruction which may bug some people.  I am a long time video exerciser so I can honestly say that you don't need much instruction with the routine here.  It is perfect.  I am happy with the fact I worked out my whole body without killing myself over some complicated aerobic routine.  This is a meat and potatoes workout which includes all the basics.",1387843200,2,903,4.432926829268292

I started using the Firm workouts when BSS 2 (with the fanny lifter and sculpting stick) was released.  I've done them off an on and just got back into really working out this year. It was an adjustment for me to get into the newer firms that don't use the fanny lifter or sculpting stick, but more and more I find that I am beginning to like the newer ones better.  I have done this workout a few times already since I got it and I really, really like it.  It is a good workout and I definitely feel it.  I would have put 5 stars, but in all honesty, there are many times during this workout when I wish there were MORE reps of a certain move.  I'm sure that if I upped my weights, I wouldn't feel that way, so I need to try that.  Overall, I am very pleased with this workout!",1354060800,7,947,4.103260869565218

Beginner modifications are clearly explained (by Allie) and demonstrated (by Emily).  Also Allie explains which muscles you are working so you can tell if you are doing the moves correctly and how to make the moves a little more difficult if you choose. The best part is that the running time is only 40 minutes which means you get a full body workout in a compact amount of time.  I highly recommend this video.

Good workout videos gradually introduce movements and then proceed to incorporate those movements in a creative and yet logical way into a full, robust workout. This video confusingly introduces a bunch in a small space and then never builds on them; we kept looking for a second chapter entitled ""workout,"" but alas, it's not there. Very disappointing. p.s.

I have also done the TransFIRMER workouts and have seriously looked into the Wave system. I work out four to six times a week depending on my schedule doing either a workout tape or running on the treadmill. I love this particular DVD because it focuses on the weight training more than the cardio or the cardio-weight combination that The Firm is known for. If you follow the ""advanced"" weight suggestions the first time, even as someone who has been working out consistently for a while, you are going to feel this one in the morning. I really like that this DVD has advanced and beginner moves and the instructor is very upbeat with awesome cueing. She does give a lot of pointers on proper form which isn't always discussed in Firm workouts, though. Overall, I consider this one of my favorite workouts from the Firm and I think it is one of the most effective if you are looking to sculpt your muscles more than burning fat.",1260144000,4,1051,4.507853403141361
2550078,4,B000F33XHE,This got my heart pumping and I feel great afterwards.  I'm starting to lose inches which was my goal.,1258502400,2,102,4.368421052631579
2550079,5,B000F33XHE,"I did this DVD for the first time this morning and have to say that this is one that I am going to use often. I loved it! I have bad knees myself, having had surgery on one 5 weeks ago with a second on the other in a few months. Due to other reviews of ""bad knees"", I debated long and hard whether or not to get this one. I have to say that I am so glad that I decided against many of the negative reviews all over the internet by buying this one. In fact I loved it so much, I have 14 more Firm Pinks in the mail now! I was totally against the Pinks as I once thought they wouldn't be nearly as effective or fun as the BSS1-4 Systems (Fanny Lifters & Transfirmer Sets). They seemed easy, and ""lacked"" the personality that the other systems have. Not true; I am eating my words...I loved this one!

Now since I am getting back into exercise after being down for many months, this DVD did present some challenge using 3s, 5s, and 8lbs dumbbells and not going as deep in the lunges/squats; followed beginner modification for that. Many advanced exercisers may frown upon this due to the ""lack"" of challenge factor that some have talked about. To correct that issue, heavy up!!! You have to make a workout work for you. You get out what you put in. After today, I know that I can go heavier on many of the exercises and will be better prepared for the next time I use this. I have read elsewhere that there are ""too many squats & lunges"". Not so. If you have done any of the Fanny Lifter or transfirmer DVDs, you'll get just as many, if not more lunges, especially when you include ALL of the work on top the 14 inch box. That right there is harder on the knees, my knees, than this DVD. I felt no pain and no discomfort in either knee whatsoever. That's huge considering I have days were they swell just by going up and down my stairs to do laundry.

The movements are creative, many something I have not seen in the BSS1-4 DVDs. Now they may be similar to the other Pinks, but since this is my first Pink...it's different. Her cueing is spot on, she's not overly chatty or talking as if we're 5 yrs old. My abs are pleasantly sore right now-a few hours after working out, and I really felt it in my hips/butt/thigh region. I will say my biceps didn't feel worked, but again, that is bc it was my first run-thru and I know to use heavier next time; my fault, not hers or the Firms. I felt just great after this DVD! I was sweaty and a little winded, but I felt worked out, not fatigued. I had the energy to do what I needed to do without feeling sluggish like I have after certain other DVDs/instructors. There is NO CARDIO in this workout as the description and title state. So if you expect intervals, you will not get it here. Now, there are tempo changes, but not cardio with the exception of the warm up. That doesn't mean you will skate through this. If you use the proper amount of weight, you WILL feel it and you WILL sweat!

Nothing I can complain about or would change! I love that it is only 40 minutes long!! I have so many DVDs weight lifting, cardio, and both that are 50+ minutes and it's nice to have a solid workout that gets you in and out in minimal time. Not a wasted minute and no body part left untouched. Just 40 minutes of solid toning/weight lifting and I loved every minute of it. It went by quickly and I am so thankful I purchased this. I wish there were many other 40 minute toning DVDs as good as this. We don't have to kill our bodies or spend 60-90 minutes lifting weights to get an effective workout. No gym memberships required here; just a good attitude, several sets of weights, a mat, and your best effort.

You swat, bend, pump weights, sqeeze gluts, crunch the entire time. I feel guilty when I skip a day.

I don't like ALL the ""pink"" FIRMs (the ones produced lately by Gaiam) that have come out. However, I do enjoy the moves in Total Body Toner, many of which are varied and different at least for me (pushups touching one shoulder when coming up, rotating the hip with a weight in one hand and pull, etc.) combined with other traditional moves (lunges, squats, french press, bicep curl, etc.)  Of course it does not use the Fanny Lifter or any other step, but surprisingly I have sore hamstrings and glutes for two or three days after doing the workout, which I like a lot!  I have been using 3, 5 and 8 pound weights, with this and many other workouts, which I plan to increase soon.  I think it will be pretty easy to go heavier with this DVD.  Allie as usual cues really well and is motivating and pleasant. The only thing I would change about her is her hairdo.  She needs a makeover! (I saw her in the new Wave infommercial with a different look and she looks very nice) But that's just off topic.
Usually, I don't care much for the music in fitness DVDs, but I have to say the music selection for this workout is lame.  Fortunately, it's not too loud, so I can put a CD with a much better music and still can hear Allies voice.
The other thing I don't like much is the final stretch.  It's way too short for the kind of workout one has just done.  It really is a total body workout, but I need to add my own stretches to really feel stretched.  I know, it is only 40 minutes, but I wouldn't have cared to spend 3 more minutes stretching a bit longer.
Overall, I do like Total Body Toner and feel worked out at the end of each session using it.  I sweat a lot too!

I found this to be an excellent workout that seems to go quickly.  The instructions are clear.  You can feel the results immediately.
I have bad knees, and there are lots of lunges in this DVD.  I find however if I am very careful I can do most the excercises.
I would suggest to watch the excercises before doing them.  When I tried watching the DVD while twisting, I hurt my neck!  This is probably true for any workout and not a reflection on this DVD however.

2550099,5,B000F33XHE,"I LOVE these new Firm DVD's that are back to the basics - cardio + sculpting, with just simple hand held dumbbells - none of the gimmicky stuff that is expensive and awkward and sometimes shameless (hello, ""sculpting stick"" - i.e., just a means to make money). Maybe Gaim, who now owns the Firm, is responsible for this back-to-the-basics move, and I am extremely pleased. It's simple, and it delivers. I think the workouts are much more fun to do when you're focusing simply on your body and the weights - not lugging around a fanny lifter, a bench-press thingy (can't even remember the gimicky name for that), or an unnecessary sculpting stick. I always thought the Fanny Lifter seemed a little dangerous, too...it works your legs REALLY hard, to the point of loss of muscle control, and you're teetering precariously on top of these stacked boxes...for someone like me who has to be precise and careful with her movements due to a repaired ACL (knee ligament) from an injury years ago, this is not the way best way to go. Furthermore, the Fanny Lifter always got my knees (both of them) - crunching. Literally. Making an unpleasant crunching sound. Ahem.

Nonetheless, I've stuck with The Firm over the years, because I've tried so many different brands and instructors, and The Firm seems to me to be the most efficient, effective, straight-forward, pleasant, uncomplicated (despite the use of a couple of the tools mentioned above, which aren't nearly so bad by a long shot as some of the needless fancy-footwork utilized by other instructors/brands), and un-embarrassing (barring their now nearly obsolete 80's videos with big hair and weird outfits; these are EXTREMELY hard, and long, with heavier weights and millions of reps, but they were rewarding because of it [and they focus entirely on cardio + weights too...but I think these videos were probably simply TOO HARD for the average exerciser]).

Anyway. As for this particular DVD, I am really happy with it. After a long pause of NOT doing DVDs, I am in average shape, and mainly need to shrink a bit and tone up. I find this DVD challenging enough that I feel worked out when I am through, and am sweating lightly while working out, with a light - medium raised heartrate (which is the best zone to be in for burning fat). My muscles feel tired when I am through. HOWEVER (and this is key), I don't feel so exhausted that I don't look forward to doing it again the next day. I also love that this new series seems to focus on a 40-45 minute workout (I have 3 of the new series, including this one). Perfect amount of time. Feels much more do-able. With these new DVD Firm series, it is the first time in a LONG TIME that I have worked out many days CONSECUTIVELY - I am really happy about that. Otherwise I tend to be a sporadic exerciser. So that is probably what I love most about this new series - it is challenging, but I feel that I CAN conquer it, and CAN look forward to doing it again tomorrow.

Finally, I love that they incorporate a few oldie-but-goodie moves that I've seen used on some older videos by different instructors, namely, the embarrassingly-slightly-creepy Brad-Somebody from the Look Great Naked series and Tamilee Webb from her individual sets of Great Arms, Great Legs, Great Abs series. Both of these instructors had these really effective sculpting series....only problem is, it wasn't incorporated into an entire workout. They were for 15 minute bouts of sculpting, focusing on one particular area.

2550106,5,B000F33XHE,"I am a huge fan of The Firm's workout programs.  Even so, this workout surpassed my expectations.
Using 3 sets of weights (light, medium and heavy; you decide what is what) and good old-fashioned gravity, you can get gym-level results in just 40 minutes a day.
You begin with a fast-paced warmup that is approaching on cardio (quick stepping from side to side, jacks, squats, lunges, push-ups while touching one shoulder - man are those tough!- and use of your light weights).  The warmup alone will definitely get you sweating!
The program itself is very fast-paced, and allows you just enough time between exercises to switch your weights and set up in the new position.  Because of this, your heartrate will stay elevated, and, you guessed it, you will sweat and burn calories!
The moves are different and challenging (such as raising from a backwards lunge into a shoulder raise and glute lift...on the ball of your standing foot!), and like most of The Firm's workouts, you will often be engaged in four-limb movement, in which you will be working your upper body and lower body simultaneously. Even if you aren't so coordinated, don't worry! Allie Del Rio Pointer is an excellent and encouraging instructor who will guide you through the more complex movements one move at a time, in a layering approach. With the exception of doing a few moves on one side and then again on the other, there is virtually no boring repetition of moves here.
Because it is sculpting (but fast-paced sculpting), it is pretty much low-impact with a lot of lunges, plies and squats of all sorts.  However, there are 2 sections with plyo jumping, but of coarse, there is a beginner modification exerciser who shows you how to keep it low impact.
Though many ""total body"" exercise programs skimp on certain parts of the body (even some Firm titles are guilty of this), this is truly what it claims to be.  You will feel this in every inch of your physique: arms, shoulders, back, biceps, inner thighs, outer thighs, upper abs, lower abs, buns, calves, waist...it misses nothing!
The cooldown is active, with one of the best abs sections around and great total-body stretching.
This DVD is, in my opinion, one of the BEST total body sculpting workouts out there.  The workout is great, the music is quite good and the instructor, Allie, is one of my personal favorites.  The only thing that would make it better would be a more exotic location!  :-) When doing this workout, I preceed it with 20 minutes of light cardio and come away with basically the perfect 60-minute workout: ultra-effective, super-fat-burning and fun!
And if you want to see a preview of this and other Firm DVDs, check out The Firm's official site.
Highly recommended!",1213660800,46,2723,4.803418803418803
2550107,5,B000F33XHE,"This is my second ""Firm"" video that I have worked out with.  It's awesome.  I love that this viedo uses weights throughout.  You need three sets of weights; light, medium and heavy.  This is truly a ""total body toner"" workout.  I recommend this to those who are seeking something new because it is not the same thing that everyone else is doing.",1212969600,,345,4.5
2550108,5,B000F33XHE,This is a great workout DVD.  Allie is a good instructor with good cueing.  The workout definitely works up a sweat but is not too difficult and unsafe.  I am seeing results after 8 workouts.  I use the Firm DVDs with a variety of others and like the Firm the best with 10 Minute Solutions a close second.  Neither get boring or slow.,1212710400,2,334,4.238095238095238
2550109,5,B000F33XHE,"I have a ton of FIRM DVD's as they are my favorite series of all.  I've tried just about every other series, and I keep coming back to The FIRM.  Of the FIRM DVD's in my collection, the ones with Allie are my favorite overall, and this one is my very favorite.

I am a daily exerciser, so I am always looking to challenge myself more and more, and this is probably the most difficult DVD in my collection.  I would only recommend it if you are looking for a serious, hard workout. This one is definitely not an easy one.  I am waiting for Allie to come out with a follow-up, more challenging routine as the really challenging DVDs seem hard to come by.",1212624000,,652,4.184
2550110,5,B000F33XHE,"I love this sculpting workout. Its easy to follow. Allie gives her cues really well. You'll need 3 sets of weights, light medium and heavy. I love the upperbody moves especially. This one is strictly sculpting, no cardio. Great for strengthening!",1212537600,,246,5.024390243902439
2550111,5,B000F33XHE,"As a FIRM fanatic for the last 3 years, I had to take a moment to share my opinion on this DVD.

Allie, in my humble opinion, is the very best of the FIRM instructors at preparing the user to smoothly run through the workout without a level of sheer frustration.  She gives you proper form, breathing recommendations, and a smooth transition throughout this workout.

You never stop moving from one set of weights (if not a beginning) to another to work different muscle groups.  I have only used this DVD once, so far, but I already know that it will become a well used workout.

Well worth the money and time!!!!",1210809600,4,614,4.446428571428571
2550112,5,B000F33XHE,"I have several of the newer Firm videos that are both cardio and toning, which I do like.  This workout is only toning, but it is great!! Alli keeps you constantly moving and is really good at explaining proper form.",1210550400,2,216,4.4
2550113,1,B000F33XHE,"I love the Firm and particularly Allie, but I'm very disappointed with this and the other new Firm DVDs. Some of the four-limb segments are good, but I find the aerobics segments unnecessarily complicated and they don't even raise my heart rate. With my older Firm DVDs, I always feel like I've had a workout; with these new ones, I don't. Also, these new routines feel harder on my knees (because of twisting more than impact) and back. I have minor back problems, and I find myself modifying the moves in these new DVDs to protect my back from being strained/""put out."" And I miss the fannylifter/transfirmer. I don't know if these changes are because Gaiam now owns the Firm, but I really hope they go back to the more intense, more straight forward routines. I would return this one and get my money back if I could. Sorry Allie!",1210204800,19,833,4.56
2550114,5,B000F33XHE,Bought this dvd a month ago & I love it! Several friends have asked me what I've been doing because they've noticed a difference! I have several of The Firm's dvd's & this has become a favorite. Allie is my favorite of the Firm instructor's.  Her queing is right on & she is so easy to follow.,1207267200,,293,4.140350877192983
2550115,4,B000F33XHE,"I like this new firm toning workout. It is great to pair or alternate with another cardio based workout. I like Alli as a firm instructor and she is great at cuing in this workout. I love doing cardio but know the importance of strength training, so this is a great addition to my other firm workouts. This is a definite keeper in my rotation of new firms and the transfirmer series workouts. I think this one is worth a try if you are looking for a good total body strength training workout.",1207094400,,492,4.301075268817204
2550116,3,B000F33XHE,"I enjoy Allie as an instructor. She is easy to follow and very motivating. This particular workout is good for toning but I don't feel that I work out quite as much as with some of the other Firm workouts. I rotate between several Firm workouts so when I do the Total Body Toner, I wind up doing a second workout that day.",1207094400,4,322,4.126984126984127
2550117,5,B000F33XHE,"i love workingout with allie del rio,and this dvd is not an exception. i'm looking forward to buy more dvd's like this, with allie as the instructor. you can feel the energy and the sweat of a good workout. try it you won't be sorry.",1206576000,2,233,4.2
2550118,2,B000F33XHE,"I'm really disappointed with this video.  I thik Allie's queuing is much better than some of the new Firm instructors but the video was still a bit tough to follow, mostly due to the really poor camera work.  Most of the time the shots were very tightly zoomed when I really wanted a whole body shot so I could actually see how to do the moves.  This seems to be a problem for all the new Firm videos.  I won't be buying another one.  As for the music, I'm not sure who it was trying to appeal to; it goes from rock to electronica, to disco and isn't right at all for the pacing. The only good part about it is that the music is so soft you can tune it out.",1205625600,7,657,3.946969696969697
2550119,5,B000F33XHE,"This is a great workout, what isn't to like? The warmup is thorough and interesting (the push up variation isn't one I've seen before) and the variety of moves and different weights is fabulous. I like that they use their own weights and not the cardio weights. While there really isn't any cardio, it definately gets your heart rate up with the changes in moves and resistance.  I really enjoyed the ab portion in this workout, more so that the ones in the other Firm dvd's I have- I liked the weighted bridges and the variations on working the obliques.  The modifications are good if you don't like bouncing around or going deep into lunges/squats. Allie is an awesome instructor- she's informational and motivating without being annoying and her cuing is impeccable. Definately worth the $$ and worth including in a rotation.",1205280000,4,829,4.830985915492958
2550120,5,B000F33XHE,"A really great workout, great instruction, nothing annoying. Great for beginners in my opinion be cause the moves are easy to follow and you don't have to use weights and also great for more experienced people because increasing the weight makes it much more intense. All around dependable workout!",1205020800,3,298,5.1020408163265305
2550121,3,B000F33XHE,"As far as FIRM workouts go this is a pretty good one.  I use it on days I don't feel like doing a serious workout but want to do some kind of workout to get my blood circulating a bit.  As with most FIRM workouts, there isn't enough of any one thing to really make a difference(make muscles, etc.) but, like I said, it has just enough ""fun factor"" to not let it gather dust on ""light days"" and it's hard not to like Allie even though all Firm workouts are scripted.",1204675200,3,465,4.043478260869565

2550125,5,B000F33XHE,Allie at her best! Results in less than 10 workouts.  Great when paired with the Cardio Inferno for alternating days.  You won't get bored with this one.,1202428800,,153,4.62962962962963
2550126,5,B000F33XHE,I just purchased the firm transfirmation and was interested in adding a few more of the newer firms to my rotation.  I basically bought this due to the positive feedback on amazon.  The workout was a great total body workout that got my heartrate up and kept it up during the entire workout.  I love when I can get a good sweat in while doing weight training.  The moves are mostly compound moves so you are getting a total body workout in the compact 40 minute time frame and working more then one muscle group at a time.  I found the instructor easy to follow and the workout was well structured to hit the entire body in this compact workout.  I was able to get a good burn and sweat while doing this workout and would recommend it to anyone looking to get a good strength workout with only 40 minutes available.  This will definitely be in my rotation for quite some time.,1202169600,11,876,4.337423312883436
