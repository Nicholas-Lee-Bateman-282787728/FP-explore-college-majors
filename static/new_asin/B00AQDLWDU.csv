8556345,2,B00AQDLWDU,"Well, this should be considered a 2 1/2 stars review really. The videoclips are good if reggae-budget which is to be expected but the picture looks as if someone had converted the footage from bad AVI files; blurre and artifact-ridden. Not even the VHS quality transfer advertised since they are very old videoclips ( which is what draw my attention to it in the first place). Running time is a megre 48' and there's plenty of empty space on the dvd. They really could have added some bonus clips to offer at least 90' worth of material but no let's respect the original VHS release . Newsflash; you start by making the original quality justice with at least a good transfer.

The bands are superb but 3 !!!!!! Jambo clips on a 12 clip collection ?! C' mon, I love Jambo and these are very rare clips but I'd have preferred some other rarieties instead. Plus these are the ones that look the worst on this collection.

The sound is good but not great  AC3 on most clips and downright lousy on some. To think they're asking silly prices for it only because it's been discontinued. Go with any other bargain-bin best of reggae collection and you'll be way better off.",1399334400,,1165,4.511848341232228
