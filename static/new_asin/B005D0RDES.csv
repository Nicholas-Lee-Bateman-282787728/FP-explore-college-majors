4656493,1,B005D0RDES,"We were looking for some nice family Christmas videos and were very disappointed in both of these.  Both movies had good basic stories, but they are definitely not family friendly because of the gay agenda that was evident in both videos.  One ended with showing two men in bed, and the other presented two gay men celebrating with their friends over their upcoming marriage.  We will be throwing away both films.",1355875200,6,413,4.788732394366197
