8557253,1,B00ARWXI3M,"This movie is not what it sounds like at all. It is just a repackaged version of a 1999 film, which you can find here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Teenage-Space-Vampires-DVD/dp/B000UOOUWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Teenage Space Vampires [DVD</a>] I have no objection to a film being reissued, but the packaging in this case seems to me to be deceptive. The title has been changed from ""Teenage Space Vampires"" to ""Darkness"" (and then, in much smaller letters, ""The Teen Space Vampire Saga."") Not only that, but I saw the original movie some years ago, and the actors portrayed on the cover are not any of the main characters, so that even someone, like me, who had seen the movie before would not immediately recognize it as the same product. (If you look at the original DVD art, you will see that it is totally different--and much more representative of what the movie is actually like.) I believe these manipulations to be deliberate and hence must give this product one star.

The movie itself is probably somewhere in the two star range. If you are fans of Robin Dunne or Lindy Booth, you might enjoy their performance as teenagers. Similarly, if you are a diehard ""Adventure, Inc."" fan, you might like the late Jess Nillson's performance. The adult performances? Well, let's just say their performances are more dead than undead. Certainly, there is enough wooden acting on display to make several coffins. Oh, except that these vampires don't use coffins!

The script tries to move in several different directions at once. The ""vampires"" are really aliens. Their ship, though, is a huge monolith that surrounds itself with spy stations that look like gargoyles. Why do they look like gargoyles? Who knows! Perhaps they are trying to blend in with small town America. In any case, there aren't any vampires in the traditional sense, and the story isn't scary--or paranormally romantic--so it doesn't really fit the traditional vampire genres. However, there isn't really much in the way of science, so it isn't a good fit for science fiction either, aside from the aliens. As for the diamond that is supposed to absorb all the earth's sunlight, well, that's clearly more like fantasy than science fiction. Bits and pieces of different genres float around in the film, but there is little real cohesion.

Eye-popping special effects have been used in recent years to camouflage bad scripting or other defects. It's too bad this particular movie was made with a very minimal special effects budget that would perhaps have satisfied an audience in the 1950's.

If you really want to watch this movie--it is good for a laugh at times--take one of the offers for the original. Don't reward Moonbeam Entertainment for its efforts to manipulate consumers.",1369526400,,2802,5.151648351648352
