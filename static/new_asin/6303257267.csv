607555,5,6303257267,"This is what good espionage movies are all about; a strong basis for the story line (elements of reality), a simple objective, and an intriguing plot.  Lately I've been thinking that some of the best espionage movies of all time were made in the 70's; perhaps this has something to do with the turbulent 60's when there was so much going on (i.e. assasinations, controversial issues, conspiracy theories, etc).
While the movie is not as good as ""The Day of the Jackel"" in my opinion, it still ranks very high on my list of films of this type.  Anyone skeptical about the quality of spy films made in the 70's, just rent (or buy) this picture and rent something that was made in the nineties (something like a James Bond flick or Mission Impossible).  Then see if you don't find a big difference in quality.  I think the problem is that most people are too much taken by fancy gadgits and fantastic action sequences to pay too much attention to the story.",990835200,42,954,4.52906976744186
607556,5,6303257267,"This is a very good movie that will get the viewer on the edge of their seat as the tale of a man who is out to get justice against the ODESSA who are former SS soldiers hiding out after World War II.  Jon Voigt portrays a German who infiltrates the highly secretive and guarded ODESSA with help from the Israeli's, who's ultimate goal is to capture a former high ranking SS officer portrayed by Maximillian Schell and get a full list of ODESSA members.
What makes this movie a cut above the average suspense style of movie is the superior acting by the lead characters.  They are believeable and draw the viewer in for more.  An excellent plot adapted from a novel by Frederick Forsythe has twists and turns at every corner, and finally the reason why Voigt is on the mission to either kill or kidnap Schell for the Israeli's is answered at the end.
This is highly recommended to all movie fans who enjoy an excellent suspensful plot and great acting from all the lead characters in this movie.",973209600,16,995,4.456043956043956
607557,5,6303257267,"I first saw ""The Odessa File"" in the late seventies and I recall being very impressed at the time. So when I came across the DVD version at Mediaplay,  I couldn't resist getting it to see if it would stand the test  of time . I am glad I did because Ronald Naeme's film is as compelling and  entertaining now as when I first saw it.
Jon Voight stars as journalist  Peter Miller who learns that an infamous Nazi may still be alive. Miller  decides to try and track down the war criminal (played by Maximillian  Schell) and bring him to justice. The film is helped by solid acting  throughout, outstanding cinematography, and an effective score by Andrew  Lloyd Webber. The  climactic scene between Voight and Schell is absolutely  brilliant. The DVD transfer is excellent and of a quality not usually seen  in a seventies film with both widescreen and fullscreen versions included.  Do yourself a favor and rediscover this classic and underrated gem!",956620800,41,949,4.719512195121951
607558,5,6303257267,"For some reason this is one of the few movies I've always been able to tolerate in its pan & scan version, no doubt because the story is so involving. It's the kind of thriller that grabs your attention from the  start, and is never dull. And after watching this glorious new letterboxed  DVD transfer, there's no going back to the old tape. -This is how it's  supposed to look, and believe me, it's beautiful. The film is full of great  scenes looking even greater now, making me a bigger fan of it than I  already was to begin with. The pace and look of this movie, the way it's  constructed, is the way ALL movies should generally look. Sadly they just  don't make them like this anymore; a fact that will only highten your  appreciation of this immaculate piece of movie-making.",953424000,20,782,4.457746478873239

With a few changes, this film follows the book closely. Jon Voight does an excellent job of portraying idealistic journalist Peter Miller. The film is fast paced and a great character study as you watch German Peter learn about O.D.E.S.S.A. and decides to follow the story to the end. The story begins on the day that Kennedy is assassinated. If he hadn't pulled over to listen to that story on the radio, he wouldn't have stumbled across the most dangerous ""story"" of his life.
Overall, a great action film everyone should watch at least once. The DVD is great quality with balanced audio and video. I highly recommend. We already have this film on VHS and watch it over and over.",1467590400,6,832,4.553333333333334

608184,5,6303257267,"""The Odessa File"" is a very clever suspense film set around the intrigue of a post-World War II SS type organization that is well-funded and ready to make a comeback in the 1960's!  Jon Voight plays an German free-lance journalist who stumbles upon a Riga Latvia, concentration camp victim's diary that opens his eyes to the threat of this rising organization operating not only in Germany but around the world as it prepares to unleash new horrors.  At the same time, the diary reveals a very important personal connection to Voight's character that is hinted at but finally revealed only near the end of the film where a climactic event occurs.  Voight is perfect for the role down to his English spoken german accent (I believe he is of German descent so he certainly also looks the part.  The absolutely gorgeous (in my opinion) Mary Tamm plays his love interest in what I believe was one of her few feature film appearances.  Mary Tamm went on to become known to viewers as the ""first Romana"" for a season of Doctor Who in the late 1970's, a few years after this film was made.  I think what makes this film work for me is that Odessa apparently was an organization that truly existed for a time after WW II that helped former SS soldiers begin new lives under false identiies so this shred of truth was simply built upon further to make for a truly engaging thriller from start to finish.",1456272000,3,1394,4.556

608265,5,6303257267,"There was a time during to postwar period where truly excellent political and spy thrillers were made. The source of a number of these was Frederick Forsyth. Movies such as The Fourth Protocol and the Dogs of War were based on Forsyth novels.  The greatest of the was The Odessa File staring the young Jon Voight. Voigt plays Petter Miller, a young Hamburg reporter, who on November 22, 1963 stumbles upon the news story of a lifetime, the existence of a secret organization of former SS officers-the Odessa. That date will be instantly recognized by the baby boomers reading this review and serves to set the stage for the geopolitical atmosphere of the film.

The reporter begins a search for an SS officer, long believed dead by infiltrating the Odessa. It is a dangerous undertaking and Voight survives by wit and determination. The director Ronald Neame capitalizes on a brilliant leading cast of Voight, Maximilian Schell and his older sister Maria.  The score writing by Andrew Lloyd Webber is cheerfully creepy.",1450569600,,1019,4.947368421052632

608468,4,6303257267,"Smart, well-written and well-acted ""political"" thriller starring the always great Jon Voight. Some of the weighty material -- the Holocaust, hunting ex-Nazis, etc.-- threatens to bog it down, but taut direction and great acting by all concerned keep the fairly complex plot moving. Basic idea here is that a group of nasty ex-Nazis who have somehow escaped imprisonment for their heinous WWI crimes have formed a network called Odessa, and are plotting to 1) destroy Israel; and 2) take over the world. Successfully, this time. Sound like a great work of fiction? it is, and it is not. The story is based on a novel by Frederick Forsyth, but the historical basis for the story is apparently accurate. One of the highlights here is Voight speaking dialogue with a fairly good (I think) German accent, and even speaking German, and seeming to know what he is saying. Odessa is billed as co-starting Maximillien Schell, but if you are coming for the legendary European actor, you will be disappointed. Schell only appears in scant scenes, including the extraordinary B&W histrionic footage. Still and all, a solid, and very scary entry in the ""if we aren't careful the Nazis will come back, and take over the world"" genre of films, which includes Marathon Man, The Boys from Brazil and many others.",1444780800,14,1295,4.917808219178082

608902,5,6303257267,"Based on John Forsythe's world wide best selling novel of the same title, Jon Voight plays Peter Miller a free lance reporter, newspaper journalist who hears of the suicide of an elderly Jewish man who had been a prisoner in the Riga Concentration Camp. As a reporter he starts investigating this man's life and learns there is a connection to a secret underground Neo Nazi organization which exists in modern times. The tentacles of the organization extend into the upper echelons of the police force, political organizations and highly successful businesses in Hamburg, Germany. Peter learns of a successful businessman who is both associated with the Riga Camp and also runs a very prosperous high tech company. Peter trusts no one but his girlfriend with only small bits of his discoveries.

He travels to Austria to meet with Simon Wiesenthal, the Nazi investigator of war crimes against Jews in World War II. Through this connection he receives a new identity and personal training to assume the life of a person who recently died and whose medical records were changed with significant details to appear as if he were alive and recovered. Peter's goal is to infiltrate the Neo-Nazi organization and find out who the ring leader is to expose him. There is breath-taking drama and action as Peter goes to a printer who will create his new passport and official looking papers for this new identity. This printer has in his possession secret documents known as the ""Odessa File"".

The file provides proof of who was running the Riga Concentration Camp and other details about former World War II Nazi leadership.  The plot intensifies as the Neo Nazis close in on Peter and his location, realizing how close he is getting to the truth which involves their plans to secretly supply Egypt with armaments against Israel. Peter narrows in on the name and owner of the high tech business and stealthily breaks into his mansion.  He confronts the man but in an astonishing unexpected twist of the plot, the viewer is given a whole new reason that Peter was tracking and investigating this man. Jon Voight shines in this role. He is the ideal actor who makes the character truly believable. Anyone who loves espionage, action, drama, and the unraveling of secret plots will love this film.

609058,4,6303257267,"The 1970's seemed to be the decade in which we worried about forgetting the Holocaust -- The Eichmann trial was long over (he was hanged in 1962), but Robert Shaw's ""The Man in the Glass Booth,"" staged in 1968, appeared on film in 1975, a year after ""The Odessa File,"" and a couple of years later, we had ""The Boys from Brazil."" The director of ""The Odessa File,"" Ronald Neame, had proved himself much earlier with ""Tunes of Glory,"" but here he's hampered by a script that purports to be a thriller and yet at the same time wants to educate us in Nazi war crimes (Simon Wiesenthal is a character in the movie, and the real Wiesenthal served as an advisor on the project). The result is an odd blend of thriller-type action and talkiness. The thriller elements are well-handled -- especially the scene in the print shop where Derek Jacobi produces fake passports and other documents to hide the identities of Nazis who are represented as still plotting the downfall of the Jews, this time -- and this isn't a spoiler -- by fomenting an attack by Egypt on the state of Israel. The initiating event of the story is the coming into possession of a Holocaust survivor's diary by German journalist Peter Miller (Jon Voigt), and the ""educational"" element of the movie consists in our being shown flashbacks of events in a concentration camp in Riga as a way of understanding what Miller comes to understand as he reads the diary. As a result of his reading and a little detective work, Miller realizes that the commandant of that camp, Eduard Roschmann (played by Maximilian Schell), is still alive, and he determines to hunt him down. Why he cares to the extent that he does becomes clearer late in the movie, but suffice it to say here that his interest in Roschmann comes to the attention of Israeli agents in Germany who are trying to find out exactly how the now-underground Nazis plan to facilitate an Egyptian attack on Israel.

So . . . the thriller element kicks in about half-way through, and it's effectively done. Miller's efforts to find Roschmann come to the attention too of the Nazis themselves -- ex-Nazi's (not really ex-, of course) seem to be all over the place, so Miller is constantly being trailed and the girl he loves is put in danger too. There's plenty of tension in the latter half -- I won't go into plot-details that might spoil things for first-time viewers -- and I should say that the acting is more than adequate to the demands of the genre. There might be a bit of stereotyping of the Nazis, but we're not in a genre where psychological depth is required. The ending perhaps suffers a bit from talkiness too, where the movie reverts back to its educational agenda, but on the whole it works well enough. To sum up, what I've called the educational agenda of the movie makes it seem a bit dated now, forty years on, but it won't bore you and the thrills are fine.",1413676800,2,2890,4.547024952015355

He plays a German free-lance journalist who gets caught up in a story with a compelling lead. Although the dialog is in English (naturally), Voight plays him with the speech patterns and cadence he would have if he were speaking the German language.

A couple of memorable touches: The wonderful English character actor Derek Jacobi (I, Claudius) as a sniveling mama's boy complicit with Nazis, Perry Como's mellifluous voice singing a (thematic to the movie) Christmas carol on the radio broadcast interrupted to announce the Kennedy assassination.

The movie is set in Hamburg, in1963, and starts the day Kennedy was assassinated. A man - a Jew - dies in his apartment when he commits suicide. He leaves behind a memoir of his time in a concentration camp. This memoir is picked up by a German journalist.

Also, a German company is about to sell missile technology to Egypt. Israeli intelligence is trying to scuttle this plan. The company is owned by an ex SS officer. The story is about HOW and WHY the journalist volunteers to help the Israelis in their mission!

The young man supposedly lost his father, a highly decorated Wehrmacht junior officer, in an incident during the war. As the story opens, a former inmate at a Nazi concentration camp commits suicide by gassing himself in his apartment. The old Jewish man had kept a journal of his experiences under a particularly brutal camp commander, whom he discovers to be still alive and prospering under a new identity, protected by a mysterious organization. While en route to cover another story, the young photo-journalist is delayed by traffic and, when he attempts to take a detour, simply happens upon police and rescue vehicles responding to the suicide . The police investigator brings the journal to the reporters attention and he is so intrigued by the implication that numerous former Nazi SS officers have escaped detection that he is compelled to finish reading the contents of the journal in one sitting, shirking his other responsibilities. His obsession with the journal and the story of the camp commander is unrelated to the death camps or the Jews. Something written in the journal, however, gives him a very personal motivation to meet the mysterious camp commander.

609406,5,6303257267,"The Odessa File opens on 22 November 1963, as news of JFK's assassination is heard over a car radio. Peter Miller (Jon Voight),  a young inquisitive German reporter  is driving in Berlin. when an ambulance speeds by his car. The young reporter pursues, sensing a story. At the house where the ambulance arrives, Miller pokes around the body an elderly Jewish Holocaust survivor has committed suicide, leaving a diary. The diary is a memoir of his life War II Riga Ghetto and the crimes of the SS officer who ran the camp, Eduard Roschmann (Maximilian Schell). Miller steals the diary and begins to doggedly investigate, stumbling upon a secret ex-Nazi organization, the ODESSA,. After several attempts on his life, Miller infiltrates the ODESSA to find Roschmann  whose front-tech company plans is involved in committing another crime against the Israeli people. The secret society, ODESSA is an acronym for the German phrase ""Organisation der Ehemaligen SS-Angeh&ouml;rigen"", which translates as Organization of Former Members of the SS.

The Odessa File is a superior thriller directed by British director, Ronald Neame and is based on the novel The Odessa File by Frederick Forsyth. Interestingly, Andrew Lloyd Webber scored the film and the title song, ""Christmas Dream"", sung by Perry Como and the London Boy Singers became a big holidat hit song.",1390176000,,1352,5.1880733944954125

In the diary, Peter (the journalist) discovers the tyranny caused by a singular man in Hitlers regime; and Peter makes it his determination to find this man (who has since gone into hiding) and bring him to some kind of justice.

It is definitely a Forsyth story with a good mixture of fact, myth, and plausibility. Well it could happen. The film is permeated with rising action; in several places you have no time to catch your breath. You will find your self kibitzing as ""Don't make that phone call!""
The story was best told with black and white flashbacks to explain what happened in history to support today's (1974) action.
Reporter, Peter Miller comes in possession of a diary of a man that survived Riga concentration camp. Something he reads encourages him to seek SS Captain Eduard Roschmann, the commandant of the camp, who was presumed dead. In his endeavor he is thwarted at every turn by the authorities. Finally one posing as a doctor confirms Roshmann's existence by his very insistent that Roschmann is dead.
In the beginning we hear of President Kennedy's death which triggers the end of innocents. This combined with the overlapping plot of the Egyptians to build missiles, overlays Peter's personal pursuit with that of a Jewish organization attempting to infiltrate the ODESSA (Organisation der ehemaligen SS-Angehrigen),an organization to reorganize and protect prominent people that where in the ""National Socialist German Workers' Party"".
Will Peter succeed with his mission (what ever it is) or will he be hindered by the Jewish organization? Will the organization succeed in thwarting the Egyptian missile plot or be hindered by Peter? Is SS Captain Roschmann still alive and if so what is he up to.",1386028800,,1733,4.858108108108108

He barely stays one step ahead of the murkly Odessa organization, searching for the commandant of a concentration camp listed in the dead Jewish man's papers.  The old man's wife died in the camp.  Maximillian Schell plays the evil and unrepentant Major Roschman, the aforementioned camp commandant.

The film started out OK, but somewhere near the middle, many of the actors started delivering their lines in an absurdly hammy way. Meanwhile, characters' actions were hard to believe, such as Voight's character taking a flash photo in the middle of a bad-guy gathering, or not doing anything to safeguard his girlfriend when the bad guys started pursuing him, or not looking at the car parked next to his (which was loaded with guys he should have watched out for) when returning to a parking lot, or the girlfriend blurting out ""What are you doing in Munich station?"" with someone eavesdropping (in reality, she would have just said ""What are you doing there?"").

Also, I am familiar with real German accents, and the ones used by Voight and some other actors were almost humorously bad.

Furthermore, the film starts out with a discussion about missile navigation systems, a plot strand that then gets almost entirely ignored until an unsatisfying reference at the end.

Maximilian Schell plays Eduard Roschmann, an SS officer who was responsible for thousands of deaths, and who had jumped from a train to escape capture by the British. The diary of an old man who had committed suicide came to Miller through a friend on the police force, and much of it was memories, with gory details, of Roschmann. He did not simply kill a lot of people, he took pleasure in it, and in terrorizing them first.

Roschmann and many other war criminals were protected by the Odessa organization, which was a cooperative group of former SS men and their admirers who helped them create new identities, flee the country, and set up new lives for themselves. How Miller gained possession of the file, with the old names and the new ones, with addresses and occupations -- all the information needed to track them down -- is as interesting as what was done with the file after it was discovered.

This is made from a book I read quite a long time ago, probably when it was relatively new. Yes, I'm sure it is quite different, but I don't remember enough details to be sure in what ways. I guess I'll have to read the book again.

It shows you how fanatical and dangerous the times were for a Jew to be in a concentration camp where they killed Jews and survival was very slim. The treachery of the German soldiers was very bad as exhibited by how they lined up victims to be shot in the back of the head at the very same ditch they were to be burned in.

Jews were treated like animals and worse.

This story is about a German journalist who's Father was a high ranking Officer who was doing his job and came across a very bad German Nazi who killed him in cold blood.

This journalist went after the suspect officer and even went undercover with the Israeli Mossad to go after the very same German killer who killed his German Father.

609824,1,6303257267,"The dumbed-down storyline of this film is typical of Hollywood failures of the 1970s.  It presents the idiotic idea that a young journalist, who has already been identified and targeted by the villains would be used by the Mossad as an infiltrator into the very organization which is aware of the young ninny and his dimwitted attempt to uncover them.

  There are no convincing characters in the film, except for the one character who is playing himself, Simon Weisenthal.  Voight delivers his usual lame performance as a mildly retarded person who, improbably, manages to overcome his opponents simply because they are even dumber than he is.

  This film is about as convincing as the TV serials inflicted upon us during the same time period in which ""The Odessa File"" was made.",1314230400,,781,4.908396946564886
609825,4,6303257267,"Reviewing `Quiller' prompted me to remember `The Odessa File; a 1970s classic, highlighting the same competing forces at that time in Germany; the Old and the New. John Voight is the young journalist, given the diary of a Riga, German Jew, concentration camp victim. Maximillian Schell (another fine Austrian born actor - see my Quiller... and Life and Death... reviews) is his antithesis; the ex-SS Riga camp commander he is hunting, through the Ode'SS'a (to emphasise the point)! The unspeakable cruelty of the Riga camp is illustrated (which brings to mind the book, The Kindly Ones, also reviewed by me). Two hundred thousand German Jews entered the camp; 400 survived, according to the script.""People don't want to know"" is his girlfriend's plea as their life is increasingly disrupted. The young journalist hits a wall of silence, as the Odessa closes ranks to protect one of their own. The young journalist is captured but not by whom you might think. He emerges to continue his hunt. The danger mounts. The climax is fitting and personal to the young man. The film is about tenacity in the face of adversity; in simple terms, the good of the few against the evil of many. For some, the intrinsic idea may still upset. It should yet genocide continues. Love features little in this story.",1309737600,3,1295,4.890909090909091

609827,5,6303257267,"This is a very well-made movie which follows the book as written by Frederick Forsyth in most ways.  The book is much more moving and emotional, since Forsyth can use many words to describe a scene which, on film, has to be portrayed only with a facial expression.  Even so, Jon Voight does an excellent job with his role and gives a performance that exactly captures Peter Miller's obsessive, doggedly-determined, even when facing death, quest for answers.

Whether or not you've read the book, you really need to watch this movie and see for yourself what a great espionage story is like when done without tons of gadgets, super-human (ie: impossible in real life) stunts and computer effects.  This movie was done when all that actors and directors had to work with was their own ability at delivering a good movie.  The whole cast, but especially Voight, do a superb job.

Needless to say he meets various obstacles in the way including stumbling into a modern day nest of third Reich survivors.

609903,4,6303257267,"""The Odessa File"" (1974) is a British-made thriller, based on a book of the same name by Sir Frederick Forsyth (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Odessa-File/dp/0553271989/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Odessa File</a>), that gives us a good picture of life in that macho muscular port city of Hamburg, Germany, a decade earlier.  It opens on November 22, 1963, as the assassination and death of American President John F. Kennedy come in over the radio, in between the playing of a catchy Christmas song: ""Christmas Dream,"" sung by Perry Como, written by Andrew Lloyd Webber, who did the film's score.  The film  stars Jon Voigt, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midnight-Cowboy/dp/0792833287/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midnight Cowboy</a>) playing journalist Peter Miller, who, after finding the diary of a Holocaust survivor who had recently committed suicide, begins following the trail of an SS officer who commanded a concentration camp during World War II. Miller soon finds himself involved with an organization of former SS members called Odessa, as well as with the Israeli secret service, as the Odessa is apparently helping Egypt to build weapons that they hope will destroy Israel.  Further probing reveals a link between the officer, Odessa and Miller's own family.

The movie was directed by Ronald Neame, who has just passed.  He was made a Commander of the British Empire on the 1996 Queen's List.  Neame had photographed ""Blithe Spirit"" (1945), ""This Happy Breed,"" (1944), and ""In Which We Serve."" He directed ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" ""Scrooge,"" ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brody,"" ""Tunes of Glory,"" and ""The Horse's Mouth.""  He had three Oscar nominations, and another three wins in his career.  In this film, he is good at capturing the cold war feeling of the divided Germany, the sense of wheels within wheels.  Kenneth Ross has adapted a polished screen play from Forsyth's best selling novel.  The film costars the forgettable Mary Tamm as Sigi, Miller's girlfriend; and Maximilian Schell (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Phantom-of-the-Opera-Full-Screen-Edition/dp/B0007TKNIS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Phantom of the Opera (Full Screen Edition)</a>), playing  Eduard Roschmann, an unrepentant Nazi.  Maria Schell (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/99-Women-Director-s-Cut/dp/B000795JN2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">99 Women (Director's Cut)</a>), plays Miller's mother, Frau Miller.  Sir Derek Jacobi, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Claudius-VHS/dp/6303980813/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I, Claudius [VHS</a>];<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cadfael-Collection/dp/B00068RYZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cadfael Collection</a>), who has, I think, only two scenes, contributes an unforgettable portrait of Klaus Wenzer, the Odessa's favorite forger, and gets a pretty high billing for it, too.  Someone surely knew that only he could play the part.

There were, of course, many fine cold war spy books written during this period, and many fine movies made of them.  This is neither the best nor the worst, but the acting is good, photography and direction are fine, and it holds its own, with Voigt ably carrying it.  The plot's a bit over the top, but it reflects Forsyth's approach of taking an actual situation, and then adding a ""what if,"" to it, which you can also see in the 1973 film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Day-of-the-Jackal/dp/0783226853/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Day of the Jackal</a>, that was itself based on a Forsyth book, adapted for the screen by Kenneth Ross.

So unlike a 1974 film set in...1974 with...1974 automobiles and hairstyles, this is a 1963 period piece that seemed as fresh and mesmerizing of a tale from 1963...last night, as it must have in 1974!

The Odessa File (1974) takes the popular Frederick Forsyth novel of the same name, which is supposedly based on actual facts and events, and presents it as a truly wonderful, tense thriller that I really enjoyed.  Directed by accomplished cinematographer and director Ronald Neame, the film stars Jon Voight as freelance German journalist Peter Miller and Maximilian Schell as an ex-German officer named Eduard Roschmann, a man responsible for horrible atrocities, earning him the nickname `The Butcher', during his tenure as head of a concentration camp which housed Jewish prisoners.  After the passing of an elderly Jewish survivor of a WWII concentration camp, Miller comes into possession of a diary kept by the man, one which detailed, in particular, the various crimes against humanity by Roschmann, and also seemed to indicate that the war criminal may still be alive.  As Miller begins delving into the story, uncovering tidbits of information, he meets resistance in the form of various individuals, many of which turn out to be members of the secret Odessa organization, and are now actively working against Miller for fears that he may uncover their secrets.
As Miller gets closer to uncovering the truths, the resistance against him grows, and takes the form of actual attempts on his life.  Around this time he comes into contact with a Jewish group, working to locate the site within Germany that's developing the guidance system for the Egyptian rockets, and Miller agrees to work with them, changing his identity in order to become an ex-German officer and enable him access to the Odessa organization.  In exchange for this, Miller will supply the group with information, while he himself tries to get closer to Roschmann.  As Miller infiltrates the group, his cover is eventually blown, but not before he learns of the existence of the Odessa file, documents that detail many of the members within the group, including Roschmann.  The goal now is survival, and given the circumstances, his chances seem pretty slim.
I have not actually read the book, but I really liked this film.  Jon Voight is wonderful and believable, German accent and all, as a reporter, seemingly driven by a determination to expose a subversive hideousness, once prominent in his country, that has now gone underground, and threatens yet again a great many peoples of the world.  Listed as a thriller/drama, The Odessa File certainly doesn't disappoint.  The plot, while having many twists and turns, keeps focused, and rarely falters in its' progression.  The development of the characters is carefully planned, but not so to bring attention to the fact, allowing for the viewer to become drawn into the film.  The exposition at the beginning was a little awkward to me, but I didn't see any other way around it, so I accepted it.  Schell provides an excellent performance as an ex-German officer hiding in broad daylight, one who will resort to any means necessary to protect his secrets, along with those of the Odessa group.  One point I enjoyed was near the end, as a particular revelation was made.  Prior to that point, I had started to question one of the main character's motivations, and, as if the film knew what I was thinking, it answered my question in a completely satisfying manner.  The film runs just over two hours, and the first half may seem slow, but I felt as if this was deliberate, allowing time for the story to develop.  During the second half the film picks up speed as the tension mounts, drawing on the momentum carefully constructed in the beginning, resulting in a wholly enjoyable conclusion.  Given the nature of realizing novels to film, I suspect a number of plot elements were left out, but what was left seemed to be missing very little, at least anything that left a glaring hole which would pull the viewer out of the movie with its' obviousness, which indicates a skillful adaptation of original source material, done with care to preserve the elements which made the book so very popular and well received.  All in all, this is a really thrilling outing, one that requires a little patience, but provides a rewarding experience overall.
Presented on this release are really good looking prints, both in wide screen and full screen formats (it's double-sided).  The audio seems a bit soft, but there are English subtitles, so I missed nothing.  As far as special features, there are some well put together production notes in a four page booklet within the DVD case, an original theatrical trailer, talent biographies for actors Voight, Schell, and director Neame, and trailers for Anaconda (1997) and Oliver Stone's U-Turn (1997), neither film as good as this one, but both certainly benefiting from Voight's appearance...and that's another thing...remember when Jon Voight appeared in good films?  Along with this film, I also count Midnight Cowboy (1969), Catch-22 (1970), Deliverance (1972), and Runaway Train (1985) to be some real highlights of his career...and let's look at some of his more recent films...Most Wanted (1997), The Karate Dog (2004), and Baby Geniuses 2 (2004)...not exactly the caliber of films early in his career, but who knows what the future holds?

610071,3,6303257267,"This was the second of the two Frederick Forsyth classic thrillers set in recent history. Forsyth had a wonderful talent for setting taut detective stories in what-if scenarios. Here he connects the secretive Odessa unit, dedicated to protecting former SS soldiers, with a plot to drop onto Israel WMDs loaded with bubonic plague, around 1963/64. Sadly little is made of this second element -- a pro-Israeli secret service unit features strongly in the film, but it seems to have no awareness of the threat that Kiefel Industries and Egpyt's Nasser pose to Israel.
This is a great detective story, but there is little action, no sex and almost no humour. Many would argue that one should not expect these elements in a plot set against the historical background of the Holocaust. Nearly all the Germans are heavy stereotypes -- humourless, cold, threatening, and occasionally explosive.
This DVD is definitely worth watching every 10 years or so, but I cannot say that it rewards more frequently repeated viewing.
The score, such as it is, reveals Andrew Lloyd Webber in his jazz-rock phase between 'Jesus Christ Superstar' and 'Variations'. Jon Voight does a great job as the sincere protagonist freelance journalist. Perhaps the big winner from this movie was Derek Jacobi, playing the troubled printer of false papers for the Odessa. He demonstrated that, with a couple of orange eyebrows stuck on, he could become a totally different personality -- ideal preparation for his masterful role in BBC's I CLAUDIUS a couple of years later.",1078617600,7,1538,5.08300395256917
610072,1,6303257267,"'The Odessa File' is one of those speculative fantasies for which Frederick Forsyth is famous, alternative scenarios inserted into history and tricked out with so much 'factual' detail as to seem convincing.  Well, that's the idea anyway.  This film makes much of its basis in fact and plausible hypothesis - it opens with a Forsyth-signed prologue averring the 'documentary research' behind the work; celebrated Nazi- hunter Simon Wiesenthal has a credit as consultant, and even has a cameo as himself (and, significantly, considering the talent on display, turns in the one natural performance of the film).  Documents themselves play a vital role - the titular file is the Maguffin that records a major conspiracy; a diary found with the remains of a Jewish suicide prompts the film's action.  The film's setting is precise and meaningful - the day and aftermath of JFK's assassination; the Israeli-Egyptian war.  Experts are wheeled in within the film to explain to the hero (and us) the minutae of various crises.
All this counts for nothing.  Jon Voight is a German journalist whose family has a Nazi past and who, after reading the diary of a Riga concentration camp survivor, decides to uncover the commandant long missing, presumed dead.  His investigative progress is hampered by a supposedly democratic system (police, judiciary, big business etc.), that seems crammed with senior ex-Nazis.
Reasons for the film's failure are legion, but the fatal one is the sacrificing of the 'documentary' angle in favour of a bogus, typically Hollywood personal quest.  For all its flaws, Fred Zinneman's 'The Day Of the Jackal' worked because of its distanced style and its refusal to 'psychologise' (sic?) its anti-hero; the various Hollywood cliches used to 'humanise' the hero (secret in family past that must be exorcised; relationship difficulties; sense of personal failure blahblah) remind us we're watching a contrived fiction, and not even a passable simulacra of a documentary.  But we didn't really need reminding - the intrusive music (by Andrew Lloyd Webber!), the aforementioned poor thesping (complete with annoying 'international cast' dubbing), perfunctory direction and dreary script has already done this for us.
Worse, for a film made in the mid-70s, when even major Hollywood studios were experimenting in realism, the look of 'File' is laughably dated (over-lit, over-composed, stagy), with even real locations looking like flat studio sets.  Its pseudo-Melvillean pretensions recall ersatz big-budget follies like 'Night Of The Generals' and 'Funeral In Berlin'  rather than the real thing.  When you think Fassbinder was writing his sour postcards from the post-Nazi FDR at the same time, this film's dinosaur status becomes lumberingly apparent.",1020816000,10,2769,5.3842592592592595

It offers a good mixture of suspense, historical accuracy, and political intrique. ""Substance"" is the word that comes to mind when watching this classic movie.

While this movie is a thrilling espionage classic, I haven't seen worse acting in any other movie. I never was impressed by Jon Voight and this movie only reinforced my feelings.

7841872,5,6303257267,"One of the best all-time espionage thrillers. Peter Miller is a hard-working investigative journalist looking for the next scoop. On the night of Kennedy's assassination the story of a lifetime literally lands in his lap. He starts investigating the suicide of an elderly Jewish Concentration Camp survivor and is soon lured into the murky world of the SS in their new incarnation as the Odessa. Gripping, suspenseful, and with very high stakes, Frederick Forsyth's novel stands the test of time. Jon Voight is phenomenal in the role of Peter Miller; his performance is dazzling. Mary Tamm is breathtaking and believable in the role of Sigi and Maximilian Schell turns in a stunning performance as Eduard Roschmann. This is a must see. The filmmakers are true to the novel and the movie is all the more better for it.",1513555200,2,817,4.927536231884058
