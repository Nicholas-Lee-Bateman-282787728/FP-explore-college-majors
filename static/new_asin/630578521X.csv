1076618,3,630578521X,"A decent noir film to watch on a lonely night - it is quiet, yet grisly, a suspenseful slow climax building as a serial killer with a terrible grudge against God and humanity lashes out in a deadly, carefully-organized, psychopathic way, killing first a good priest, then a hooker trying to help her sister through college, then a philanthropic sports star, then a good cop about to retire... Detective Smith must race to stop the killer from destroying perhaps the most virtuous person of them all, while Smith's gravely ill daughter is undergoing surgery to save her life - if she survives it. Is a powerful newspaper editor the next victim, or the killer? Suspects include the new priest and even Smith's own brother! What happens next could be an affirmation of faith - or something utterly ungodly. The last ten minutes reveal it all.",1415491200,2,839,4.793103448275862

1076682,3,630578521X,"Loved a couple of the cast members, which is the only reason I gave this movie 3 stars. The writing was sophomoric most of the time, and I felt sorry for the actors. The plot line was tough to take, almost silly. So it left me feeling embarrassed for the cast. They did their best with what they had.",1401148800,2,300,4.101694915254237

1076684,4,630578521X,"BEYOND REDEMPTION opens w/ the police investigating a religiously-themed murder. A priest has been crucified on the cross over his church's altar. The next victim is a prostitute, found in her bed w/ a large sum of money. Andrew McCarthy plays the lead cop, Henry Smith. He has problems of his own, including a gravely ill daughter. He's also haunted by memories of a death he feels responsible for. While Henry struggles w/ his own demons, the murders continue. Enter Michael Ironside (SCANNERS, VISITING HOURS, TOTAL RECALL, STARSHIP TROOPERS) as business executive / philanthropist, Alexander Hunt. Smith is suspicious of Hunt for reasons that seem to defy facts or reason. Could he be right, even though Hunt appears to be beyond reproach? BEYOND REDEMPTION is a semi-supernatural thriller w/ a decent plot. I especially enjoyed the finale...",1382400000,5,846,5.182481751824818

1076686,2,630578521X,"An atheist cop (Andrew McCarthy), who lost his faith in God after a bust gone wrong, finds himself pitted against a serial killer who is effectively challenging God to try to stop him.

I bought this film for $2.99 at a discount store and now I know why the DVD was so cheap. This films starts off well and had me interested for most of its duration, but it was let down by a barely coherent ending that, after 36 hours of thinking about it, I still don't get. Based on the plot summary, you might think that this is a Christian propaganda film, but it's not. It's just a normal film with some religious themes, except the religious ideas put forward in this film are so confused, that I'm not even sure what the writer's beliefs actually are. Unless you too can manage to find a ridiculously cheap copy of this film, I wouldn't bother.",1214870400,6,836,4.358974358974359
1076687,3,630578521X,"BEYOND REDEMPTION is a stylish, noir-like thriller featuring former bratpacker Andrew McCarthy.
A serial killer is knocking off what appears to be philanthropists, not withstanding a hooker whose john pays her 15,000 before offing her.  Atheist detective McCarthy is placed in charge of the case, an interesting paradox--an atheist investigating religiously themed murders.  Along with his Jewish partner (Matthew Laurance), McCarthy at first suspects another priest and then is even more horrified to find his younger brother may be a suspect.  Meanwhile, his young daughter is facing life-threatening bone marrow surgery, and is questioning him about death and heaven.  Michael Ironside appears as Alexander Hunt, a billionaire whose philanthropic niceties makes him a possible future victim.
BEYOND REDEMPTION has good intentions, but its ending is contrived and a faux climax doesn't help things out.  Still, the cast does well and it is moody and threatening.  Not a classic but you could do worse.",1088899200,17,1003,5.522875816993464
1076688,5,630578521X,"Beyond Redemption is a police procedural with a religious background.  An Atheist and a Jew are the detectives.  It continues to be ironic and quirky all through the plot.  The characters are real people with real problems, but there's enough action to suit any viewer who expects police flicks to be exciting.  The acting, directing, and editing are crisp and straight up.  Don't miss this film.",970444800,20,396,4.9393939393939394

7895125,2,630578521X,"Some of the blunders ruin it. Two actors in particular were horribly inappropriate. McCarthy was superb, somehow impervious to the weak script and the ineptitude around him. But the brother and the religious woman were infernal, and I mean that literally: they were creepy beyond irritating, coming across as demonically possessed or something. Especially the brother. His niece is dying in the hospital and all he can do is lecture her grieving father with a psychotic-looking permanent smile??? That's supposed to be Christian? That guy seemed evil from his first appearance, a condescending free-loader smiling like he knows exactly how much he's upsetting his family, and is loving every minute of it.

Oh, and it's not really a Christian movie, despite the borderline preaching: the prostitute spends 2-3 full minutes in her ""professional"" underwear, bending, twisting, and putting on a ""show."" Nudity, for all intents and purposes. The gore is minimal, though, and so is the cussing if you mind that kind of thing.",1495065600,2,1020,5.219512195121951

That lead never picked up and followed? Murderer would of been arrested within the hour. And predictable ending for the Atheist. Unless you like drivel pass this one up.",1482278400,,340,4.412698412698413
7895131,2,630578521X,"Enjoyed the movie. Good storyline, ok special effects.  No nudity and very little profanity.
I am pretty sure these talented actors did this one solely for the money. Not the best I've seen these actors- like they weren't really into it.
