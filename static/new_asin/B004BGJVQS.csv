8421955,5,B004BGJVQS,"As one reviewer noted, this Blu-ray will not play in all machines, including my old Sony Blu-ray, which provided sound but no picture.  I purchased an Oppo Blu-ray player a year ago, and now I am fortunate to have the opportunity to both see and hear this fantastic concert.  If you were a fan of Uriah Heep, as I am, and if you have followed Ken Hensley's career after his departure from Heep many years ago, then you will know that he is an extraordinarily talented songwriter and you will have no regrets about owning this concert disc.  Many years after the peak of his popularity with Heep, Ken Hensley continues to write and perform.  The first part of this show, which was recorded in Hamburg with Ken's current band, Live Fire, is the performance of the entire Blood on the Highway album.  It is a superb record filled with interesting mostly new songs at the time of its release.  The band is excellent throughout this performance, which includes an appearance by the gifted former Heep lead singer, John Lawton and also Jorn Lande.  The rest of the performance is a trip back into the Uriah Heep catalogue with additional guest musicians, including fine renditions of classics like ""The Wizard,"" ""Circle of Hands,"" ""July Morning,"" Lady in Black,"" and others you will recognize.  The disc includes an interview that was conducted at the time of this concert that delves interestingly into the story of his years with Heep, his decline into relative obscurity and substance abuse, his conversion to Christianity, and the rebirth of his career and a second chance at life.  All in all, this is a wonderful package!",1436832000,,1621,4.760714285714286
