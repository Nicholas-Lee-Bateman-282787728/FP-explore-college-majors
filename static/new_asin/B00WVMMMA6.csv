8714484,4,B00WVMMMA6,"Karl Ritter was one of the most successful, popular and prolific directors in Nazi Germany, and BASATZUNG DORA (""The Crew of the 'Dora'"") was in some ways his masterpiece. In other ways, it was his downfall. Filmed on location in France, Russia, and Italy during WW2, it is a sprawling story about the effect war has on romance, and romance on friendship. Viewed in historical context, it also has a lot to say about the difficulty of moviemaking in a country like Nazi Germany -- especially when she was at war.

THE CREW OF THE DORA is the story of a tight-knit German bomber crew (the bomber is nicknamed ""Dora"") which has just completed their 500th combat mission and is granted extended leave. While enjoying downtime in places like Paris and Berlin, the crewmembers have a falling-out over a woman (actually several women), and when they resume battle operations, first in Russia and later in North Africa, they spend more time fighting each other than the enemy. A desert crash in North Africa brings them all to the verge of death, and the crew is forced to begin the process of settling their differences so they can continue the fight.

Karl Ritter is famous -- and infamous -- for his creation of the so-called ""Zeitfilm,"" i.e. the movie shot so contemporarily that it reflected the goings-on of the actual moment, so that audiences could relate to it. ""Dora"" is a true Zeitfilm in that when he made the movie, Germany was rolling invincibly forward in North Africa and Russia and had much of Europe firmly under its heel. The production was literally shot on location in live-fire war zones such as northern Russia, and the cast and crew sometimes had to arm themselves whilst traveling by train to their locations (!), to protect themselves against partisan attack. Ritter was a devoted if not humorless Nazi, and also an air force officer, so he always managed to inject both propaganda and realism into his war movies, whatever era they were set in. Unfortunately for Ritter, by the time production wrapped and postproduction was completed, the German position in both Africa and Russia had become perilous and the war situation had taken a sharp turn for the worse. Because of this, and because one of the romantic storylines of the film revolved around the desire of a crew member settling down on conquered land in Russia after the war with his girlfriend, Joseph Goebbels reluctantly decided to prevent the movie's release. Ritter was dismayed in the extreme, but every string he pulled to see the movie put in theaters broke, and indeed, it was shown only once, to a select group of Luftwaffe officers, in February of 1945. (Ritter's experiences with DORA were recorded in a very interesting book called ""The Making of the Crew of the Dora"" by William Gillespie.) Because Nazi Germany's fortunes were waning,  Ritter's ""Zeitfilm"" method was no longer welcomed by the regime after 1942 and in fact, despite his utter loyalty to Nazism, he only directed one more picture before the war came to an end. Thus, ""Air Crew Dora"" is really Ritter's legacy to the medium to which he devoted his life.

As a movie, DORA is interesting without being great. Like most of Ritter's films it has a fractured narrative, meaning there is no real star but  focuses instead on its ensemble cast. This sort of prevents any one actor from standing out even though there is plenty of talent in the film, most notably Wolfgang Preiss, who went on to have a great postwar movie career (playing Nazis!). The romantic sub-plots are not that interesting, and the behavior of the crew is kind of childish, but the footage shot in the air, and especially in Berlin and Paris -- then untouched by the war -- is fascinating. We don't just see Nazi Europe, we see it at a time when the Germans were winning the war and thinking hard about the sort of life they wanted after it. I also enjoyed the North African desert sequences, though I believe they were shot in sounstages in or near Rome due to the fluidity of the military situation in Libya.

If you are interested in the films of Karl Ritter, in Nazi-era or German cinema, or just war movies generally (especially those told ""from the other side of the hill,"" I'd recommend this romantic war picture. I'd also recommend Gillespie's book on the subject. They compliment each other nicely.",1527379200,,4331,4.745019920318725
8714485,5,B00WVMMMA6,"The DVD is enjoyable and extremely well produced.  It depicts Luftwaffe airmen in much the same light as the Memphis Belle might show the airman of the U.S.  They are comrades, they chase girls, the become angry with each other, but in the end--they remain together.  I found it very interesting that the locales shown in the film had been lost to Germany by the time the film was to be released, and thus prevented its release at all publicly.  This was after a whirlwind of publicity on the upcoming film and its widespread anticipation by the public.",1484438400,5,553,4.612244897959184
8714486,4,B00WVMMMA6,"I have been watching a handful of Third Reich movies recently thanks to IHF's excellent DVD releases. It's interesting to see movies made in such a controlled society regarding how much propaganda and the worldview of the regime is injected into the product. While all was interesting to watch for these historical reasons the pure entertainment value have varied somewhat.

Besatzung Dora however is a very watchable movie in a more modern sense. While the story exists in a world where the men are at war and the women work at home, this is just shown as the reality of the time and not dwelled on unnecessarily. The story moves on at a fairly quick pace and is a nice mix of drama, romance, action and comedy. The locations are also interesting: The love stories takes place in Berlin while the crew gets around to France, Russia and North Africa. This was obviously made to provide 90 minutes of entertainment rather than to hammer home a heavy dose of propaganda.

For the WWII buff the movie contains some good footage of the Ju 88 plane. I found the picture quality pretty good for a film of the era. My only minor gripe about the DVD is that the English subtitles are not removeable. While my German is limited, it would have been nice to be able to see the movie without them distracting.",1461369600,4,1297,4.562231759656652
