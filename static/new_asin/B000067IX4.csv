1715402,3,B000067IX4,"I'm a Lauryn Hill fan and I purchased this DVD cus of the positive reviews posted this site. She's really good, no doubt about that. Her voice was cracking a lot of times though. You could really feel what she's saying. Not bad with the guitar also. When the track starts, you'll get into it, after a while you'll loose focus cus there's too much adlib. I'm sure the audience felt the same way. Some were already out of it. She's really good but there's too much adlib. She also talks too much in between tracks. An hour and 45 minutes with only 13 songs..... go figure",1087171200,8,569,4.327102803738318
1715403,5,B000067IX4,"I have not yet viewed the live performance, but just from the cd alone I have never experienced an artist so real. I have never met people in life as real as she is.  She reveals who she is in the most intimate way. She tears away the layers of herself right in front of you.  Her lyrics are sublime and the song arrangements are profound!!!!  After you have listed to this album it is like you were given a ticket of admission into Lauryn's heart & soul!  This is a must. High praise & respect to Ms. Hill is deserved.",1083369600,7,519,4.108910891089109
1715404,5,B000067IX4,"All I can say is, your eyes will be glued to the screen, and your ears will want to hear more. If there truly was an example of what the nature of UNPLUGGED is all about, this video would be the one. Lauryn Hill bares all in this heart wrenching delivery of raw feeling,thoughts and talent. Every song had a powerful burst of spirituality and thought provoking lyrics that were so deep I could hardly believe what I was hearing. In this video Lauryn had an open realness to her beauty, not the dressed up superstar look she had before, but more of a natural, this is me  take it or leave it appeal; every facial expression showed her heartfelt emotional connection to each song, and she sucked me into her reality everytime she spoke. Each note that she hit or missed showed the truth about her humanity, yet it never took away from the respect or adoration she commanded from her stage presence. I give this Unplugged video 5 stars just because it is the most honest, beautiful performance I've ever seen.",1069027200,29,1006,4.497267759562842
1715405,5,B000067IX4,"Words cannot express the stature of the poetry contained in this concert.  I have it on CD and didn't know it was on DVD until about 2 weeks ago.  Only buy this if you enjoy poetry of life, love, and self.  Definately not ordinary.  ""I Gotta Fine Peace of Mind"", ""Adam Lives in Theory"", ""Jerusalem"", ""Get Out""... All Classics.",1041984000,5,326,4.47457627118644
1715406,5,B000067IX4,"There aren't words to describe the awe inspiring, intimate look into what she admits is a new and evolving singer/songwriter/performer.  The high points coming in between songs as she describes thoughts, feelings and meanings to her compositions.  I will forever be a follower of this musical and lyrical master.  The Truths spoken by her resound so clearly to anyone whos been in Love, had to overcome adversities, and eventually triumphed.  Her voice is simply amazing.
I haven't seen a better musical performance.  It leaves you feeling quite good having seen it.  Buy it NOW, for the Love of all that is good and True.",1022198400,12,622,4.9326923076923075

Her voice is filled with passion while her words are unbelievably thought provoking. Yeah, I wish she was putting out more material too but I am more thankful for the efforts she has made thus far.",1427760000,,316,4.981132075471698

1715454,5,B000067IX4,'I love Lauryn Hill. I bought this as a gift to my mom who also loves LH. She owned it on VHS back in the day but loaned it to a family memeber and he never returned it. So I surprised her with this and boy was she excited. I was also super pumped. The DVD quality was nice and I'm glad I found it. Definitely a buy all true LH fans should have.,1423008000,,345,3.675675675675676

1715469,5,B000067IX4,Lauryn Hill unplugged is a classic.  The dvd is excellent and well worth the money if you are a fan of Lauryn Hill.  There is nothing like watching her sing her heart out on this dvd.,1384646400,2,183,4.055555555555555
1715470,2,B000067IX4,Dont waste your money she talks for the first 10 mins I thought maybe she'd start singing after that long talk about nothing...but I never got my wish!!!...then when she did sing I didn't know the songs!!!,1375660800,,205,4.5675675675675675
1715471,2,B000067IX4,"Hi,

The quality of the DVD is very bad, till today i haven't managed to play the whole DVD because it seems that there's lot of scratches.

Im quite unhappy with the purchase.

Silvio",1373932800,,193,4.457142857142857
1715472,5,B000067IX4,Im so glad I bought this DVD it is good. I enjyoed every bit of it . Ms. Lauryn Hill did a Fantastic Job on the Dvd,1357516800,,115,3.2962962962962963
1715473,5,B000067IX4,"This was the greatest lyrical content, that I have heard in a long time.  I wish Lauryn would record again, I cant wait to see her in tour with NAS.  Peace of Mind was a classic song.  It has meaning that is beyond perfection.  It speaks a meaning to my soul that I have been longing for a really long time. I love the video as well as the CD.  Lauryn is the best,  she stands in a class of her own.  She was a bit raspy, however it really made the meaning that much deeper because she was singing with a sore throat.  You felt the pain, happiness and rebirth of her as well as found one for yourself from this.",1350345600,,611,3.9508196721311477
1715474,5,B000067IX4,The dvd came earlier then expected. This was very enjoyable to watch. This unplugged session gives u incite on what's on the true Lauryn Hill's mind. Very moving.,1341100800,,162,4.821428571428571
1715475,2,B000067IX4,"Many of Lauryn Hill's fans were disappointed with her unplugged double CD set. I can understand their dissatisfaction. Many of the songs sounded the same, making the disk set sound like one long song at times. But there were 2 real gems on Hill's unplugged project, Mystery of Iniquity and Freedom Time. These rap songs are rich and powerful. The two tracks are songs that grow as you grow. I go back to listen to these songs and hear something new or am reminded of an important concept each time.  Freedom Time and Mystery of Iniquity could be used as road maps for current rappers to find there way back to artistry and move away from clever punch lines that do not mean anything, which overcrowds rap songs these days. I keep saying that Hill should set the singing aside and create more raps songs to save the genre or else we will have to turn to Eminem, Yelawolf, and Machine Gun Kelly for popular rap that is conscious. Listen to Freedom Time and Mystery of Iniquity by Lauryn Hill to see what I mean.",1317427200,,1009,4.454054054054054
1715476,5,B000067IX4,This was a breath of fresh air. I was glad to see that Lauren is Saved now and is singing about the love of Jesus and coming from among them. She has been inspired to reach out to others about satan and his world. thank God for such a talented woman who has seen the Light. I was EXTREMELY IMPRESSED and have been listening to both CD's and DVD everyday. It is unique and different from any gospel I have heard. I thank Lauren for her creativity:),1306800000,,447,4.149425287356322
1715477,5,B000067IX4,"This is actually the second copy of this DVD I've ordered. Lauryn Hill is so vulnerable and honest. For me, it's my favorite of all I've heard her release. I would actually liked to have gotten my hands on a copy of her book, The Middle Man. As far as I'm concerned, she's a lyrical genius.",1299110400,,290,4.196428571428571
1715482,5,B000067IX4,"I bought this dvd when I bought the Cd and I am so glad I did. Lauryn Hill is my favorite artist, and I have always seen the spiritual side of Lauryn (in every song she has ever sung/rapped), but this dvd is a treat. With the Cd I tend to skip through to my favorites and bypass most of her converstions, but the Dvd helps you to see the fullness of who she is humanly and spiritually. You see and experience her beauty unpolished, real, and thankful. This is another staple in my home and is played just as often as ""the hang over"" and ""Toy story"". I would highly recomend to anyone buying the Cd to get the Dvd too, it's more helpful to experience gift and feeling a part of her message. ""It's freedom time yall!""",1295136000,,715,4.151079136690647

1715484,5,B000067IX4,"ive always loved lauryn. From the day i first her on sister act II. but this album tells who she really is and gives sound advice in the process. i remember listening to the album and picturing her smiling at some points...but when i saw the DVD it was the exact opposite. It captures her essence, more than what you hear, but also her presence. I saw her in her element. and she is serious about what she does but she enjoys it, it's so real and natural...",1265414400,,457,4.204545454545454
1715485,5,B000067IX4,"After hearing the CD. I had to purchase this DVD. Lauren Hill is sharing her testimony, and it brought me to tears. I love it, and hope she comes back soon and shares her gift with the world.",1261180800,,191,4.052631578947368
1715486,5,B000067IX4,"This is the most honest and frank piece of musical demonstration I have ever come in touch with.

This unplugged has nothing to do with music or showbiz. It's a manifest, it's a letter to mankind, it's a sharing from the deepest realms of the human soul.

Lauryn is absolutely sincere, absolutely transparent, absolutely clear, despite of all her pains and regrets. She is real. In this concert I found the most real songs I could ever imagine, even if her voice was cracking at times or she was playing the wrong notes on the guitar. Truer than this cannot be found in human expression.

If you consider yourself more than mere flesh and bones, listen to this dvd. We might all learn something from ideas shared here.",1258156800,,718,4.59375

1715488,5,B000067IX4,"This DVD is great, if you like Lauryn you will really enjoy it. It is only her unplugged playing her guitar. She is amazing, beautiful songs at the purest essence, a full immersion in her wonderful voice. I would highly recommend this DVD.",1209945600,,239,4.5813953488372094
1715489,5,B000067IX4,I saw this on MTV and I cried. That cry cleansed my soul in a way that I can't even explain. I had to purchase the CD. There was no way I could go through life without this CD. GREAT!!!!!!!!,1205712000,,190,3.775
1715490,5,B000067IX4,"It's such a terrible thing--to be loved; especially by folks that don't understand you, or that love you for the wrong reasons.  It's like being loved for a body that is bound to change, to grow.  Many fans (short for Fanatics) want someone to worship; some kind of idol to be their God of music or writing or whatever.. Lauryn came out and showed us who she really was; and it was beautiful and inspiring; it moved me to action in my own Art.  In my opinion, she didn't change at all, this is what she has always been; and what I have always heard in her music.  Fact is: many of you just never knew her.  Many of you were in love with the beat or the hook or the production--you never even heard the words or the emotive content behind the words.  You didn't know that she had a Soul and you weren't prepared to hear her bare it.  This CD/DVD is absolutely beautiful and I'm grateful that she recorded it and released it as is.  It is a peek behind the smoke and mirrors of Hollywood entertainment and million-dollar production;  And it reveals the real artistry of a young American woman of African descent.",1184803200,,1110,4.323671497584541
1715491,5,B000067IX4,"Music is an Art Form, Singing is an Art Form and Poetry is an Art Form but Truth is an Art Form not commonly practiced whether in the secular or sadly in the Religious world...This poetic, political, artistic and spiritual purging cannot be for those looking for the Lauryn who was slickly produced (in MisEducation) because this Lauryn UnPlugged is Truth! After listening to the CD and Spiritually connecting to the words, when I saw the DVD it fully supported the view of someone fighting to express a growing person thru art.
