Answer true or false to the following statements:

(1) 99.9% of the worlds scientists tell us that carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) emissions from human things (such as cars, trains, etc.) that burn fossil-fuels for power are causing the Earth to get hotter.

(2) Florida is more vulnerable to climate change-related disaster that any other place in the United States.

(3) The ocean is rising because its expanding.

(4) Ten of the Earths top fifteen hottest years on record have occurred since the year 2000.

(5) Canadas Alberta Tar Sands (also called Oil Sands) production emits the same level of carbon dioxide than oil refined in the United States.

(6) Engineers are converting methane gas (which is a potent greenhouse gas) from our rotting garbage into fuel.

(7) As of 2015, our global carbon dioxide emission were 26.5 billion tons per year.

(8) I cant imagine that there will be a human being on the planet in 2030 is a credible statement.

(9) No one has been affected by climate change as of 2015.

(10)  Most of the worlds climate scientists don't think its too late for humans to save themselves from climate change.

If you answered false to any one of the statements (1,2,3,6,8,10) or true to any one of (4, 5, 7, 9), then you may need to see this incredible documentary.

This film is narrated by Bill Nye the science guy.  He is an engineer, author, and science educator.

After talking with his psychiatrist/therapist, Dr. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Nye realizes he is suffering from grief--climate change grief.

From this revelation, Nye examines Earths climate change by using the classic five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and finally acceptance.

He ultimately seeks solutions in science, exploring how experts are attempting to forge out a clean energy future that would allow humans to remain on this planet.

Throughout, are brief comments given by scientists, activists, politicians, engineers, university professors, etc.

Finally, with Nyes unique brand of humour, I found this documentary to be not only very informative, but entertaining as well.  Thus, it is never boring.

In conclusion, this is one of the best documentaries on climate change that I have ever seen!!

This, most likely will be a catastrophe for human kind. Can we stop, let's say, at total extra of 3.0 C ?

The movie is extremely well done - simple and short  'CO2-Climate Change 101'.  Numbers, facts, confusing terms ('cap and trade' for example), do not overwhelm, are easy to grasp and remember. Burning fossil fuels, we dump into atmosphere 32 billion tons of CO2/year. Looking horribly ugly tar sand development land in Alberta, contributes 62 million tons/year. They use 2 barrels of clean crude oil to power extraction of 3 barrels of bitumen - total madness. 300 square miles of forest so far has been destroyed, 54 000 more to come if it is not curbed by some common sense.
Good dose of humour is present, provided by both characters: the 'doctor' (Arnold) and the 'patient' (Nye). Arnold's grimaces and faces that he makes during the sessions with the 'patient' are so funny !
Sections of the movie contain: Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, Acceptance and Hope (all together are called by Arnold 'the shrink' as: 'A Climate Change Grief').
In the end the 'patient' is full of hope and thinks it is possible to stop the trend if we use so called WWS (Wind, Water, Solar) technologies. I do not bear such hope considering variety of reasons, sort of like Jared Diamond in his famous book ""Collapse"". I am sceptical about 'science will save us'. But be your own judge..just better do not talk about 2050 with your kids.",1475884800,,1636,4.538983050847458
