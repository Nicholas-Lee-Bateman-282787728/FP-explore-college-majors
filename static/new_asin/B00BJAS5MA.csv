8569443,3,B00BJAS5MA,"Five Great westerns...nice quality. I would have given five stars except only three of the five movies played in my DVD player. Horizons West, Pillars of the Sky and Dawn at Socorro played perfectly. Backlash and Saskatchewan had great picture quality but both continually froze up and skipped. Too bad because they are all great westerns.",1509926400,2,339,5.071428571428571
8569444,2,B00BJAS5MA,"I bought this brand new off eBay.  These are quality westerns, but the discs are not quality.  The fourth disc, Backlash, looks like it has shiny paint specks embedded in it and it will not play.  For $47 (I paid $37) all the discs ought to work.  Irritated and ripped off.  BTW- the case is of a stupid design too.  Very hard to get the discs in and out of.",1483056000,,358,4.042857142857143

8569451,4,B00BJAS5MA,"I've bought 3 of these sets and returned 2. With all 3 sets, the movie ""Horizons West"" has a defect at about the 1hr 5min mark. It will freeze up and then skip ahead 5-7 minutes. With that being said,I did enjoy all 5 movies. The casting is superb. The transfers are a strong 4 up to 5 out of 5, depending on the movie. All 5 dvds were good strong westerns. I paid 40.00 for my set,so shop around...but do remember that disc 1 might be defective...support your favorite artists.",1368748800,2,478,4.263736263736264
8569452,5,B00BJAS5MA,"Let me add my agreement to the other reviewers of this handsome box of classic Universal Westerns. The five discs in this set (not three, as some listings have it) offer an excellent sampling of the handsomely-mounted oaters that Universal-International released in the 1950s.

By the early 1950s the old ""B"" series Westerns were becoming a thing of the past. The enjoyable series with Gene Autry, Roy Rogers, Johnny Mack Brown, Tim Holt, and Charles Starrett were all winding down. Attention was beginning to focus on the new medium of television. Universal had never been a really major B Western producer (although he did do some fine work with Brown in the early '40s). But beginning in the late 1940s and throughout the 1950s, it was Universal and Columbia, largely (with Allied Artists attempting to compete), that offered a superior, usually in Technicolor answer to those Western fans who continued to hunger for  Western adventure.

Early on Universal featured several excellent fine with Joel McCrea; and there were the bigger releases with Jimmy Stewart (directed by Anthony Mann). But it was the wonderful ""bread and butter"" Westerns with Audie Murphy that really established Universal as a studio beloved by fans of the genre. In addition to Murphy, Universal also featured a number of other stars in its stable---Jeff Chandler, Rock Hudson, Jock Mahoney, Rory Calhoun, and others.  Each of these actors starred in various Universal products to the delight of fans.

In this present 5-disc box you have five richly colorful films, each well made and enjoyable, with superb supporting casts and high production standards (something Universal was always willing to do). The films span the period from 1952 until 1956, arguably the hey day of this kind of ""little A""/""super B"" Western entertainment..

One of the best is ""Horizons West,"" an early Budd Boetticher directed entry, with a stellar cast including Robert Ryan, Rock Hudson, youngish Dennis Weaver and James Arness, a rascally Raymond Burr (who was an excellent ""baddie""), and, not the least, John McIntire, the paterfamiliias of Hudson and Ryan. Julia Adams is the major female interest.  ""Horizons"" is beautifully shot, with an intriguing brother-against-brother plot, with hints of the work that Boetticher would do later in the 1950s with Randolph Scott.

""Saskatchewan"" is an Alan Ladd vehicle, and, as the title implies, set in the Canadian northwest. Although the plot might be considered a bit corny these days, on its own merits it's an entertaining, well-made film, once again delving into White-Indian relations. Ladd, of course, looks spectacular in his RMCP red uniform,

""Dawn At Socorro"" lets us see some of the better work of Rory Calhoun  (his ""Four Guns to the Border"" from the same period is perhaps his best Western outing). Once again Universal's photograph, the slightly darkened color palette, offer just the right felling of foreboding as Calhoun is forced to take up the gun one more time.  This is an underrated film, and I'm really happy to see it released.

""Pillars of the Sky"" stars the redoubtable Jeff Chandler, with a fine portrayal by Ward Bond of a popular missionary among the Indians. Again, if the ending seems a bit hokey to today's ""sophisticated"" audiences, consider the message and look beneath to see what is actually going on. This, by the way, is one of the most beautiful of Universal's Westerns, the photography being some of the best of the 1950s .Like ""Horizons,"" ""Backlash"", and ""Saskatchewan,' ""Pillars of the Sky"" has already  been released overseas in the PAL format, so it good to have this one out in the NTSC format.

""Backlash"" has always been one of my favorites, again with John McIntyre serving as a kind of axis for much of the action (did he ever do anything that wasn't spectacular? ....even as the final wagon boss for ""Wagon Train""?). Richard Widmark stars, with the usual superb supporting cast that Universal was able to provide. The increasingly interplay between Widmark and McIntyre reaches a frenzy during the last ten minutes of this superb little film.  I won't reveal the plot twists here, but only recommend that you watch it (even those folks who aren't fans of Westerns should find it intriguing).

And talking of John McIntyre, Universal featured him in other well-directed Westerns: one of the best is ""Saddle Tramp"" (starring a delightlfully taciturn Joel McCrea). Yes, I know, TCM/Universal have already released several McCrea Universals in another one of the great boexes, but ""Saddle Tramp"" wasn't among them---it should have been! Let's hope that it gets a good release (maybe with ""Black Hourse Canyon"" and ""Frenchie"").

As the other reviewers have pointed out, this set is selling for around $45.00 elsewhere. The Marketplace price (around $70) is way too high. As this set becomes more widely available, the price should come down.

Nevertheless, this is an important release that not only provides visual documentation of some of the best entries in a uniquely American film genre, but gives inveterate Western and adventure film fans (like me) an opportunity to see some excellent and enjoyable classics.

Bonus features include movie stills, poster art, and an in-depth discussion of the history, production, and bits of trivia about each of these films.

My advice it---pet this (even if you want to wait until Marketplace prices come down, or if you go elsewhere). These little gems are worth it.",1362441600,11,5459,5.078212290502793
