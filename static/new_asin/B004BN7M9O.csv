8422055,5,B004BN7M9O,"When this movie came out it won multiple international awards and rightly so. The acting is very fine and though it is something of a low budget movie when compared to Hollywood productions such as ""The Vikings"" starring Kirk Douglas and Tony Curtis, it far surpasses them in historical accuracy and authenticity. Filmed in Iceland you are treated to breathtaking and iconic Icelandic scenery. Water falls, glaciers, hot springs, the black beaches of Iceland and the molten lava of Parliament Plains (Thingvellir) are all here to be seen. If you know your Icelandic Sagas you will not be disappointed in that this fictional account of the love affair between Trausti and Isold runs true to typical accounts of feuding families that are such a part of the most famous of the Icelandic Sagas, e.g., The Laxdaela Saga or Brennu Njals Saga.

Trausti returns home in the year 1077 after having studied for the priesthood abroad. He brings home with him an Italian painter in the hopes of beautifying his mother's church. No sooner does he arrive then he is embroiled in a blood feud between his family and a rival clan. The dispute began over the rights to the meat of a stranded whale, but results in the death of Trausti's mother. Trausti, however, having been prepared for the priesthood seeks to be a man of peace, not war, and has forsaken the pagan gods of his forefathers that figure so prominently in the film's prequel, ""The Raven Flies"" (Hrafninn flygur). It is not until things have gotten compeltely out of control that Trausti in a moment of blood lust returns to the forgotten abode of the pagan gods where human sacrifices had once been made beseeching them for power to avenge him and his family's honor, ""You have given power to my fathers. Now YOU shall give power, Jesus Christ!"" And here we see Hrafn Gunnlaugsson continuing to explore the Pagan's dilemma in the second film of this trilogy: Does one turn to Odin and Thor in times of crisis or the new God of the Christians? Without giving the story away the film affords a wonderful view of medieval Iceland and the transitional period after the initial christianization of Iceland that took place in the year 1,000 C.E. (Hrafn Gunnlaugsson returns to the subject of the clash between pagan and Christian cultures in the third installment of the trilogy, ""The White Viking."")  This is a story of forbidden love, passion, intrigue, treachery, deception, and above all else, redemption. Kurosawa fans will also note Gunnlaugsson's affinity for the Master as this and the previous film take on aspects of a Cowboy western set in Viking times. Still the best serious Viking movie out there.",1296345600,5,2653,4.828571428571428
