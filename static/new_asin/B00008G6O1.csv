So I hypothesized the same and it was true for the most part.  This work focuses on strokes and Alzheimer's.  However, it was more upbeat.  It spoke about how physical exercise might help the aging brain.  It said researchers are trying to find ways to prevent senility.  This work had great computer graphics to explain what happens in Alzheimer's.
Don't believe the cover.  If you watch closely, this work does not focus on women or give each gender equal coverage.  Most of the elderly people covered here were male.  I can cut the work some slack, even while considering myself an avid pro-feminist.  On average, US men die earlier than their female counterparts.  There is a PBS documentary about the health problems of the very elderly and that program mostly focused on women as they are mostly the ones who live to be way, way old.  They show physical therapists working with elderly men and students interested in that profession may really enjoy seeing it.",1407024000,,1092,4.775401069518717
