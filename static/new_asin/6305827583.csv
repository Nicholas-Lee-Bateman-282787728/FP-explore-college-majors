magic but we do remember how it felt.  After finding this great little movie from
my youth again..the magic was reborn and the songs came to life again.  No wonder
with actors like Van Johnson and Jim Backup...it was a great feeling and the movie
has a good ending also... A must see for the ones who like this kind of entertainment.

7896901,5,6305827583,"As this musical opens, Hamelin's city council is making all the people, even the children, work day and night to build a tower to impress the King.  Suddenly, a plague of rats invades the town, and a mysterious Piper appears who says he can get rid of the pests by playing music only rats can hear.  The councilmen agree to his price, but when the job is done, they refuse to pay him.  The Piper retaliates by taking away what is dearest to them.

This film was made for TV in 1957.  The dialogue is all in rhyme and the songs are set to the melodies of Edvard Grieg's Peer Gynt.  Van Johnson is excellent as both the hero Truson and the enigmatic Piper.  Claude Rains is delightfully silly as the pompous Mayor, and the very funny Jim Backus steals the show as the King's Emissary.  Parents and children alike can enjoy this musical tale.
