The movie as we know is about Santiago Munez who is played by Kuno Becker, Santiago is an immigrant in America with his family, as his father wanted a better life for his family. Throughout the movie we see Munez incredible talent and the passion he has for soccer, something his father discourages and says 'is a waste of time' etc.

So one day at a local club game where Santiago plays Glenn from England happens to be watching his sons game next to Santiago's club game. Glenn sees Santiago playing and realises what a talent he is,and so Glenn does all he can to get Santiago to play pro in England.

I won't go to much into the movie but let you decide for yourself if you want to watch the rest of this great movie! Starring the great Kuno Becker who has always been a great actor, he portrays and brings his characters to life! And in Goal! he does just that with Santiago, a great story and a great actor destined for big things! If you watch this and want to see more of Kuno Becker i really recommend 'IMAGINING ARGENTINA' starring Emma Thopson and Antonio Banderas, a great movie revoloved around Argentina's history and government. Becker has a supporting role but once again you see the diverse talent and great actor that Becker is!",1151193600,,1340,4.356

Now, I have a pretty good idea of how exciting this game can be. It contains good lessons on the power of teamwork, loyalty and family.",1142985600,3,262,4.717391304347826

Any how, i was suprised when i saw this movie. The story is good, consisten and touching. Very well played out and i do have to say that Kuno Becker's acting is one of his best yet.",1142121600,2,340,3.788732394366197
