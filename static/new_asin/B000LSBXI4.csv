8164025,4,B000LSBXI4,"I did liked this video. The concepts behind the golf-swing motion are well explained.
Simplicity is the key in this video which avoids complicated details and focuses on the ""big picture"".
The camera focused on the instructor is good as the idea is to learn the swing rather than seeing a pretty shot.
The layout of the DVD is quite old, with a lot of dead time between scenes and silly animations that might have been made in 1968.",1203897600,2,432,4.481012658227848
8164026,1,B000LSBXI4,"This video's presentation is poorly thought out.  For example, when showing how to chip from the fringe, the camera only showed the instructor and the initial hitting of the ball.  They should have also shown us the trajectory of the ball hitting the green and rolling to the pin so that we can get a better idea of the entire shot and what we are trying to accomplish with that specific technique.
Also, the entire video is divided up into short sequences of less than one minute that require you to continually hit enter to play the next sequence.  There does not seem to be a logical flow from one to the other and many are short meaningless fluff. There is too much dead space between each sequence.",1201046400,,703,4.4765625
8164027,3,B000LSBXI4,"The best part of this DVD was the chipping method. Keeping the heel of the club off the ground and using your putting stroke allows you to really use a sharp stroke, but the ball doesn't go too far.

I would've liked to seen him cover pitching.",1191369600,,244,4.191489361702128
