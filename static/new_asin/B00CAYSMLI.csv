I kept going back and forth thinking it was going to be about behind the sceens. Davod Cross wanted to side track every. And ruin it he did.
I would love to see this played out again without David Cross. I was so dissapointed and you could tell the cast of archer was too.",1461456000,2,406,4.151898734177215
5710461,1,B00CAYSMLI,"Apparently what David Cross was doing was some meta, dada-esque, post-modern, Andy Kaufman-esque, hip, deconstruction/parody of traditional panel interviews that was supposedly great...if you get it.

I didn't get it.

For those of us not into David Cross' subversive comedy it is completely unwatchable.  Cross acts alternately unprepared, hostile, and clueless as he asks the cast about what they felt on 9/11, what happened to restaurants they never heard of, and other topics designed to make people uncomfortable.  Again, apparently Cross was acting being a jerk as was Jon Benjamin when he walked out in a huff, and the fact remains that the audience seemed to enjoy it and David was in the Heart of Archness three-part season three premiere, but for most people it will be unwatchable.",1461196800,3,792,5.1640625

I've watched a handful of these Paley Center Interviews  this one should be destroyed
On what planet is this final product passable to viewers?
It's cool to see most of the v/o cast (Minus Judy Greer, Aisha Tyler,  Jessica Walter,and  Lucky Yates)
but, after they get on stage turn it off asap or your face will either melt or explode
David Cross should've been yanked off the stage after the 10 minute unfunny bits he does
This has nothing to do with FX's Archer it's David Cross being cringe worthy bad and not funny!
I'm a dummy and actually sat down and watched 20 minutes of it
20 minutes of my life i'll never get back
Don't let this worthless interview make you  believe all the Paley Center Interviews are like this they are not

It should be a SMALL hint when one of the people in the cast gets up and leaves.  After the first ten minutes I scanned through with the Forward button just to hear one of the cast speak and in ninety percent of the stops D-Head was still speaking, or one of the cast starts to say something and he interrupts, usually about something OTHER than Archer.

Fans of David Cross would be elated and would be right to mock 'the haters' and I wouldn't have wasted 15 minutes, which is the time it took to realize this would not be about Archer.  I'm new to the show but I love it and wanted to know more about it and could give a sh*t about where to eat in Atlanta, so the 1 star, at least imho, is more than justified.

On a side note, I also just found Adam Reed's pre-Archer series Frisky Dingo (imagine Ray Gillette as Sterling Archer throw in some Storm Troopers called Xticales and you've got FD.) worth the watch if just to see the parallels...including an ocelot.",1437004800,4,881,4.321212121212121

David Cross, as many negative reviewers pointed out, doesn't lead this interview in a typical fashion.  His questions are random, few are actually about the show, and at one point, he claims he hasn't seen the show [Archer] at all.  Having said that, the interview is funny if you don't take this seriously as an interview.  This looks more like the actors were in the area, and this was thrown together last minute to see how it would fly, but definitely is not taken seriously by anyone in the room.  There are some funny moments, and it's good to hear actors speak ""normally"" (except Benjamin, who always sounds as if in character), so that, I give this 3 stars.",1435017600,4,770,4.632352941176471

Unfortunately, I was wrong. The host was so pathetically ill prepared, awkward, and uncomfortable I would rather do taxes than watch this. I couldn't watch more than a few minutes.

If ONLY David Cross would have just stopped interrupting to hear his own inane drivel for long enough to just get out of the way and let the cast of Archer talk, this could have still been a success. After watching a few minutes of this, you'll probably try to skip through it to find the place where he shuts up and lets anyone else talk. Unfortunately, you won't find that point; it never happens.

Please someone give the cast of Archer another shot at an interview, because it would be great to hear from them, rather than a self-absorbed, under-prepared, snide host with no interest in or respect for folks who did something he wasn't a part of.",1428883200,,881,4.46583850931677

And I still find it both hilarious and witty: I mean, take the various montage sequences which manage to connect seemingly unrelated scenes via ingenious screen writing (which btw u pick up on after watching the episodes multiple times).  Plus, even though each episode is 20min long, you can actually discern multiple layers of dialogue-based storyline (my favorite example of this is S1E4 ""Killing Utne""). You can also pick up on how interrelated myriad episodes are from different seasons!
In a binge-watching society, gluttonous for the (excessively)"" Wow factor"" special effects and Roman-era carnage that Hollywood nowadays produces (I'm referring to the ""if there's no explosion or macabre in the first 5min, I'm not going to see that movie""-type of thinking in ppl's minds), it's really refreshing that technical ingenuity is not merely limited to Silicon Valley.  And to top that off,  the entire premise of the show centers around Cold-war era Russo-American clandestine tactics - an oversaturated film/TV genre,  think James Bond and similar TV series.

I thought it was awful, but I had the capability to turn it off. Imagine being one of those poor people actually sitting in the audience. I don't know if it cost money to be in the audience of one of these Paley panel discussions, but even if it doesn't, these people got dressed, drove to the location, parked (probably paid to park) and had to sit through this crap. I'm surprised the audience didn't follow Jon Benjamin's lead and walk out.

I thought Tobias Funke was an annoying character because he was written that way. Nope. Apparently David Cross is just an annoying, insufferable human being. He has such an overwhelming need to always be the center of attention and to show you how clever, funny and great he is. He can't stand to have people laugh at anybody else as evidenced by this video and his attack on Larry The Cable Guy, James Lipton etc. If you're truly a better comedian than Larry, then just be a better comedian. Don't go around bashing the guy and the people who go to his shows. It wreaks of desperation. It comes off as a whiny tirade of ""Why don't you laugh at me? I'm funny. Why can't I make as much money as him?"" He critcizes Larry as a sell out comedian and then goes and does not one, but three crappy Chipmunks movies.

He completely failed to ask anything about the show (again, in the time I allowed my senses  to be maligned by the vicarious embarrassment of having someone ask me nothing related to the craft piece being represented ).

That being said, this is probably the worst panel interview I have ever seen, and that says alot coming from someone who can find charm in almost anything.  I remember seeing David Cross in a few movies, and I figured he would do just as good as anyone else interviewing the panel.  I mean, how hard can it be?  You are prompting others to talk about stuff that their fans are interested in.

I was grossly mistaken.  I don't know if there was some kind of behind-the-scenes politics going on that prompted Cross to totally diverge from Interviewing 101, but whether by design or mistake, he sucks.  He seemed intent on deliberately avoiding talking about the show, instead gravitating to a myriad of bottle-top, did-you-know facts that had little or nothing to do with the show, it's inspiration, references, or anything else that makes Archer freakin' hilarious.  Don't get me wrong...I am all for hearing about what the stars are doing otherwise in their careers, where to see them next, etc.  However, Cross takes this to another level of douche-baggery.  Again, perhaps there was some kind of agenda on his part to somehow ruin this event.  If that was the case, mission accomplished, Mr. Cross.  Point taken.  You're a jerk.  I had to see the reviews myself to verify that I was not being to critical of this interview.  I instantly saw that many others felt the same way.

No matter what, I will continue to be a fan of this series, and of the excellent voice acting all of the cast perform.  Hopefully, we fans can one day enjoy an interview that focuses on and applaudes the cast, and not treat them like what they do is mediocre.

Jon Benjamin (the voice of Archer) actually gets up and leaves ten minutes into the show and does not come back.  The rest of the time Chris Parnell just looks like he wants to punch Cross in the face which is kinda the most entertaining aspect of the show.

David: Amber you live in Atlanta. Are you from Atlanta?
Amber: I am.  I grew up in Gwinnett, it's one of the suburbs of Atlanta.
David: Now I have a question.  There used to be a really good barbecue place called Alek's with a 'K'. If you went past Georgia State University and kept going south, but that's not there anymore, what happened to that barbecue restaurant?
Amber: I'm not sure, I think it's like a sneaker store now.
David: Where do they eat, when they break for lunch?
Amber: The people that live in that area?
Someone off camera: They eat sneakers.
Amber: No, I have no idea what happened to that place.  I didn't even know it existed until you just told me about it.
David: It was, it was really good.  Surprisingly Atlanta doesn't have very good barbecue.

Yup, that's typical of this Q and A.  If that seems like something you want to see more of, then watch away.  If not, save your time and find something actually worth watching.",1420243200,,1054,4.430051813471502

If you seriously went into an Adam Reed/Jon Benjamin interview expecting any different, then you can't possibly be a fan of their work.  if you're just an Archer fan, maybe you should look into their backgrounds, and then you might get it.",1383177600,,429,4.379746835443038
5710578,1,B00CAYSMLI,"I like David Cross as a comedian, but he absolutely ruined this opportunity.

He seemed bored, ill prepared and actively hostile to the process as if he deeply resented having to do it.

You might think you can get through it just to hear the Archer cast - you can't. David is constantly interrupting and preventing any sort of real discussion.",1381017600,69,344,4.622950819672131
5710579,1,B00CAYSMLI,This is unwatchable. It's not funny. It's not interesting. It's the first one in the series I tried to watch. Train wreck.,1380931200,4,122,4.590909090909091
5710580,1,B00CAYSMLI,"David Cross ruins the WHOLE THING....don't pay to rent this. It's not your normal well run Q & A session. The whole cast isn't there and again, most of the time its David Cross talking about everything but Archer.",1379030400,31,213,4.487179487179487
5710581,5,B00CAYSMLI,Funnier than Arrested Development and funnier than Archer itself.  I laughed and laughed out loud at how unexpectedly funny the cast is.,1377734400,,136,5.181818181818182
5710582,2,B00CAYSMLI,"The audience seemed to enjoy the performance but it didn't play well on video.  David Cross didn't have any prepared material so he improvised.  He attempted a spoof on an awkward interview but forced the ""joke"" too far and it fell flat.  The other actors didn't know what to expect and looked like they had been kidnaped and forced to go on stage at gunpoint.
I watched the whole thing and there were a few laughs but for the most part it was very disappointing.
Cut this down to the best 30 minutes and it might work.  As it is I can't recommend watching it.",1375488000,3,560,4.304761904761905
5710583,5,B00CAYSMLI,"All the low reviews are from people lacking the ability to understand and appreciate sarcastic humor. Honestly, I'm not sure what they even get out of Archer, as I assume they would only watch this if they watch the show.
For the one saying Jon Benjamin walked out, you obviously didn't even watch the whole thing. It was a bit! David Cross and JB do this sort of stuff all the time in their comedy - and it's awesome!
Other points of interest: Amber Nash talking about how offended her mother is by the show, Chris Parnell's failed relationship with the woman from FX, the unusual way the Q&A session was moderated, and Adam Reed's reaction to 9/11.
So, if your idea of comedy is little more than Jeff Foxworthy, DO NOT watch this. It is not for you, you won't get it, and you will hate yourself for wasting the tiny bit of brain cells you have left.
For alternative comedy fans out there, enjoy!",1371859200,9,897,4.409638554216867
5710584,4,B00CAYSMLI,"I was at this event and it was hilarious I assure you. I went in thinking it would be a typical paley discussion but it's true David Cross highjacked the entire thing. This was funny in it's own right if you like him, but if you are looking for a long boring moderated talk about Archer, this isn't it. I still had a great time.",1370131200,2,328,4.061538461538461
5710585,2,B00CAYSMLI,"So, Mr. Soapbox (David Cross) clearly found something about the Paley Center or question and answer panels objectionable, because he was so unprofessional and openly hostile, even to audience members who are legitimate fans.  Hey Dave: we're not all incredibly fortunate, contrarian narcissists like you! We couldn't afford to have Yo La Tengo play our wedding.  We live boring, feeble lives and sometimes want to know a little bit more about our favorite shows.  It doesn't make us losers, as your tone would suggest.  Ya know those people who think they're hilarious, but they're just being d*&%s? Yeah, that was him, maybe 15% of it was actually funny or informative about the how the show comes together.",1369958400,14,708,5.0256410256410255
5710586,1,B00CAYSMLI,"David Cross, whose work I like in Arrested Development sort of rambles off on tangents during this panel show with the producer and some of the voice actors from Archer. I don't know if it was nerves, if he was high,or what but he spoiled the program. At one point one of the actors got up and left.

Sorry, I watched it but I can't recommend it, even if it was ""free"" on Prime.",1369785600,5,378,4.108108108108108
5710587,1,B00CAYSMLI,"Host continually tried to make jokes that had no bearing on the conversation, talking about restaurants and other innane topics.  The guy who is the voice of Archer actually walked off the stage.  I too gave up after 10 minutes.  Don't waste your time.  No wonder this ""comedian"" can't get a current gig.",1368576000,35,304,4.679245283018868

Paley is usually much much better

the jokes that fail are just too much",1367020800,19,129,4.818181818181818

a total waste. . .",1530230400,,28,3.8333333333333335
8579481,1,B00CAYSMLI,"Wow....David Cross must not understand what an interview is or who interviews are actually supposed to be about. This complete POS is just cringe worthy bad. David Cross should be required to watch this hijacking over and over again on a loop until he finally understands/appreciates how self serving his behavior is. What a obnoxious and uncomfortable display of self indulgence!  David Cross, dude...grow up!  Not everything is about you.",1505779200,,440,5.271428571428571

8579483,1,B00CAYSMLI,If there was only a zero.....what a mess. These poor actors. Bobs burgers and archer always a favorite in my book.  H. Jon Benjamin has the best voice. Thank you Adam Reed for creating Archer.,1490918400,,192,4.485714285714286

8579485,5,B00CAYSMLI,"How can you be a fan of an irreverent show like Archer and not like a completely irreverent show about Archer? I blame Comicon for setting the expectation that all panel discussions should be insightful and thoughtful, and just a little too revalatory about the true deep hidden meanings contained within your favorite pop culture media darling.

This is not that. This is a peak without any seriousness or insight whatsoever. Just like the show.",1473120000,,446,4.946666666666666

8579489,1,B00CAYSMLI,This is supposed to be a showcase.  Whatever Mr. Cross' (the interviewer) problem was (jealousy?) he did not do his career any favors by acting like a self possessed jerk.
