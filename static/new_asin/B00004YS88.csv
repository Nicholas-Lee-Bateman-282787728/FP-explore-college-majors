The 2 videos can be put inside one VHS Cassete with no trouble.  The information on the 2 Videos is good, in fact is the same you will find in any survival book, for the same price (with even more information), but with the VISUAL Advantage; THAT IS GOOD.  In general terms DO NOT EXPECT TOO MUCH FROM THIS VIDEO, is short, some times concise, and give you the visual process of many out doors survival activities. You will get what you paid for.

1377794,5,B00004YS88,"This video is from a series of instructional videos on wilderness skills & survival.  I own just about everything from everybody produced in english which teaches these skills and I find that Ron and Karen Hood of Hood's Woods (producers of this tape series) make learning these skills both easy and FUN!  They are clearly the best at what they do.
Their instructional style is friendly, funny and compelling.  You will find yourself wanting to get out into the woods more * more as you watch. I find this refreshing in a subject matter which is USUALLY as dry as dirt with dull regurgitation of the same old military cliches.  Instead,  Ron & Karen teach FIRST CLASS wilderness skills which are entirely usable and enjoyable to watch over & over again.  Their video skills are so good infact that this year they won 1st and 2nd prize at the 2001 Telly Awards for their Jungle Skills and primitive forgeing/knife & tool making videos.
Do yourself a favor, if you want to know more about living in the outdoors from people who do it as a lifestyle and are good at teaching YOU - buy this series of tapes.  One warning though:  Ron & Karen's tape ARE addictive, and soon you'll want the entire set from their website.

1377795,5,B00004YS88,"As a Scout Master I've collected quite a few ""survival"" videos over the years and the tapes the Hoods produce are far and a way the best I've seen. The material is presented in a clear and concise manner with a sense of humor that makes them fun to watch. My 11 year old girl walked by while I was watching one and sat down with me. After the video she asked me when we could go camping! I hate to say it but these video helped to bring our family together because she never wanted to go along before when I took her brother camping. Now we are going to order the rest of the set. Incredible buy and much better than a book for learning from.",987292800,3,642,4.0234375
1377796,5,B00004YS88,"Ron Hood and his wife Karen did a stupendous job on these high quality survival videos.  Ron's sense of humor and knowledge of skills is extraordinary!  I bought one set for myself and liked them so much that I ended up purchasing more for my friends and family.  I was trained in the military and I know my stuff, but these videos teach so much useful information that I learned a whole bunch more.  That's saying something.  These videos are just a sampler of a whole set of survival videos that the Hoods produce.  These producers are so good that their work has won awards for outstanding production.  Highly recommended for all ages from boyscouts to military men like myself.  Good work!!",986083200,4,694,4.631147540983607

The folks in this video are fun to watch and everything they do is explained so everyone can understand and repeat. This is a must watch video for anyone interested in camping, survival, rural skills or just plain old how to be comfortable outside. I'd give it 6 stars if I could.",1327968000,,435,4.190476190476191
1377828,5,B00004YS88,I bought this for my daugher and her boyfriend.  This is a older style and very good video. It's nicely presented with subtle humor and the information given is timeless.  I prefer this to the newer style reality show types that are popular these days.,1325721600,,252,4.5777777777777775
1377829,5,B00004YS88,I have purchased most of Ron & Karen Hood's videos on survival techniques and have found each one having valuable information on survival. They are also entertaining. This is a tribute to Ron Hood who died last year. I have come to know Ron and Karen through these videos and Ron's loss will be a great one for all who love the wilderness.,1322006400,,339,4.396825396825397
1377830,3,B00004YS88,"Well, I found the video to be a bite old film copied to disk. the get ups were out there and the packaging was a little misleading. In all the info was good but seem a little like cut short and it was more geared to saying ""Here is a teste of what we can give you but you need to buy the real videos or come out and get the real life vesion of what we do."" But in all its not bad for a newbie. I am not one but for teaching kids in scouts it peaks there intrest a little..",1317427200,,472,3.592233009708738
1377831,5,B00004YS88,"I first found these videos during a rummage sale, and really did not know what to expect. I was immediately drawn to Ron Hood's presentation of the subject of survival and I can honestly say he rekindled my interest in the subject.

Designed as an introductory package, drawn from his numerous educational videos, Survival Basics I and II is an enjoyable and technically rich overview of proven survival skill sets. Unlike many productions, where the content is given in a severe monotone by stilted participants, these videos are not only valuable but fun and entertaining. I have used these to ""break the ice"" at the beginning of our survival courses, and many students then ask for a copy. Ron Hood has decades of experience, is known as a master educator, and his full length videos have won awards...and it is easy to see why.

This DVD set provides the viewer with a grounding in the essential skills. It is not designed to enable you to disappear into the wild and rebuild a village, it does not enable you to talk with the spirits, commune with fabulous furry forest friends, or to become one with the universe. It will, however, enable you to survive if disaster befalls you. Each skill set can be expanded upon through viewing Mr. Hood's dedicated DVDs, called the Woodsmaster series.  You cannot go wrong with this one, and the value increases with every viewing.

Thanks to Ron Hood's Survival Basics, I returned to a subject I had long let lie dormant. I believe in hypnosis too, so...get the video...get the video...get the video...",1289088000,2,1546,4.7790262172284645
1377832,4,B00004YS88,"Ok, first off this video was not geared to be competing with survivorman or man vs wild to compare it to them is ridiculous. Now that being said, let's take all the little nit picky production complaints and put them aside....good, now to the meat of the video. If I was completely ignorant of survival in the outdoors and wanted a good starter this would be a good choice for the money to choose it corrects some misconceptions and priority issues about survival that people sometimes miss. I would also get it for my child who is just starting in scouting or likes to camp in the woods. This is not a high brow production, it is not glamourous, it is a good introductory video that has value and a place. If you are expecting the host to jump into freezing water off a cliff , run around nude to dry off with snow,or have a whole support team of profesionals behind them then this aint for you. Also who knows maybe you can pick up a new trick or two....

hope this helps.",1265328000,4,974,4.293478260869565
1377833,5,B00004YS88,"This is a combination video that is based off of material in his main Woodsmaster series.  I own the bulk of the Woodsmaster series as well.  The material is based off of a college course that was taught by Mr. Hood.  It is designed to teach you a basic level of skills assuming that you have no prior training and/or experience.  He covers the science and the ""why"" of the things that he teaches.

Bottom line:  If you get this and have never camped before you will benefit.  If you have some background in survival topics you may find some useful tips and tricks to improve your skills.  BUT it will not make you into the ultimate skilled survivor able to make a nuclear reactor with a rusty razor blade and some coconuts.

Get this video with realistic expectations and you will be very happy.  If you like his work he has videos focusing on a wide range of topics in greater depth.  His library covers everything from spark based fire starting to trapping and tracking to travel abroad and even bronze casting.

In addition if you have questions about the material covered in this video he even maintains a forum to cover that angle at [...]- support for the videos he created.

Good starter video, but when you are ready for more Hoods Woods has it.

Hope this helps,

1377834,5,B00004YS88,"i really enjoyed this, and would highly recommend it.  SurvivorMan is good for entertainment, but SurvivalBasics has actual real-world situations.  SurvivalBasics was well worth the money.",1252627200,,188,6.1923076923076925
1377835,5,B00004YS88,"The video is a great start for someone thinking about getting into the outdoors. It has a lot of information so one may have to watch it in increments to absorb it all.

The video is a condensed summary of information taken from other video chapters.

If you want to learn some primitive skills combined with modern self reliance techniques then this is the video to start out with. If you want flashy entertainment with bad advice then go to Man vs Wild (or as I call that show- The new ""Faces of Death."" You can have fun counting how may ways you can kill yourself attempting some of his stunts).",1244678400,3,598,4.378378378378378
1377836,5,B00004YS88,"I have done much wilderness backpacking in Africa, and thought I pretty much had all the bases covered. This presentation just showed how much I didn't know.

1377868,1,B00004YS88,"Ok folks, this is ridiculous.  I can not believe anyone would give this video 4 or 5 stars.  Maybe for humor but for being the steal of the century, are you kidding?  No way!  I mean, I could not stop laughing until I realized this was serious.  How could this video even begin to compete with programs like Survivor-Man or Man vs. Wild!!!  Those shows are real productions, with real information and guess what, entertaining.  Ok so, we gave this video 1 star.  Here is how we rated it overall.  1. Host Personality (Who, Woodsmaster & Cave Lady?), 2. Music (no comment).  3. Cinematography (one camera on a tripod, see Survivor Man for how is should be done with one person). 4. Scene transition (extremely dry and dull) 5. Skills reviewed (good skill set).  So overall, the we gave it an ""F""on all accounts with the exception of the actual skills reviewed.  That is like saying a soup is good only because it is Hot!!!  They have a good start with this one but a long long way to go.  But for $12. bucks, that is only 2 lattes.

1377870,4,B00004YS88,"This video does an excellent job of providing useful information using clear, easy-to-follow examples.  As one reviewer pointed out, it is not a primer on primitive survival, but then it's not advertised as such either.  Ron Hood has well over a dozen videos out that cover just about every aspect of survival, including primitive techniques.  This particular volume is designed to provide valuable information to the average hiker/hunter/etc.  in a format that is easily understood by those with little training or experience.  In that, he succeeds admirably.  The tools he demonstrates while ""synthetic"" are real world, easy to find items.  Primitive skills are valuable to have, but the average individual either cannot or will not invest the time necessary to acquire them.  This video provides everyone with techniques that are quickly understood and mastered.  It is well done and while not designed to teach you to survive with nothing, it may give you the knowledge you need to get out of a bad situation while having only a minimum of equipment.  I suspect some of those who find this video useful will explore survival skills a bit farther (maybe eventually learning primitive techniques as well).  Overall, the video is well done and certainly worth your time and money.",1176336000,33,1281,5.110576923076923
1377871,3,B00004YS88,"First things first. There is an old saying that if you purchase a book, video, lesson, etc.. And you get even just one thing that you like and use then it is worth the price. If you are talking survival, then one useful thing may indeed save your life and that you can't put a price on.

With that in mind, I think anyone will come away with at least one useful bit of information from this DVD.

On the flip side, in my opinion, calling this video survival basics is misleading. This video is geared more towards synthetic survival skills rather than pure survival skills.

What I mean by that is most of what is covered involves having some item that comes off your local hardware or tackle shops shelf. Fish hooks, steel wool, flashlight, paracord, etc...Now don't get me wrong, I am not saying that these principals do not work. Knowing them may indeed save a persons life...literally.

However, if you want to learn the 'real' basics of wilderness survival, I recommend researching other material. One for example would be Tom Brown Jr.'s Field Guide to Wilderness Survival as well as some of his other field guides to expand on what you learn in the first one. The meat and potatos of that book is to teach you to survive with nothing. Not a knife, not a piece of string, not a fish hook, not even the very clothes on your back. That is the true basics of survival.

Even better take one his classes, or anyones for that matter, that can teach you the fundamentals of wilderness survival with only what you find out in the wilderness.

If you are interested in learning as many survival methods as you can, and you should, by all means check out this DVD. But if you are just starting on the path to learning wilderness survival make sure you learn to survive with nothing. If Mr. Murphy has any say so...and he usually does...you may end up stranded in the woods without your survival pack. And then you may be in a world of hurt.

When you can survive with nothing...you will have everything. And if you find yourself in a survival situation and you have any of the items demostrated in this DVD, your task at survival will be all the easier.",1125100800,43,2150,4.455470737913486

1377873,5,B00004YS88,I got this set and use it to teach my boyscout troop with it.  They love the humor and information.  We watch different segments from the videos and then go outside and practice what we learned.  Great teaching tool.  I highly recommend these videos. I let another troop leader borrow my first set and he never returned them to me because he liked them so much.  I had to purchase a second set because of it.  I'm glad I found these videos.,1019865600,,440,4.304878048780488
1377874,5,B00004YS88,"I bought the first video at the Discovery store and loved it. The kids were fascinated with the material and even though I have a lot of experience as a hunter and fisherman I learned a lot so I went back and bought the second one ...! When I came to Amazon to see if there were more video by the hoods I discovered I'd paid twice as much as I should have. I'm not really upset because the material was so good and the presentation was so professional that I didn't mind paying the extra few dollars.
After searching the net I found the Hoods ... where they have a huge selection of videos and I guess these are just like a sampler pack of a few of their other videos. Whatever these videos can save your life and they are fun to watch while you learn. I heartly recommend them for individuals and families. Great stuff",1011484800,3,819,4.189873417721519
