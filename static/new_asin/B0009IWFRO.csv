Loaded with history and scenic beauty; however, the background music was annoying during the ""Devils Golf Course"" attraction and, for me, ruined part of this segment.  But, do not let this put a damper on the entire film!  Highly worth getting, if or if not you are going to Death Valley.  Watched this several times.  Excellent!!",1417996800,,497,4.9397590361445785
8061563,5,B0009IWFRO,"See about, and learn about, Death Valley, with this great DVD. And, if you have a VHS player, it's time to upgrade, and get this and some other F-H National Parks DVDs. That was my motivation!

You'll get out and about to a variety of formations in the park, as well as the quirky, manmade Scotty's Castle. This is a great preview DVD if you're planning a trip, or a great souvenir without having to trust to your own camcorder.

Just about any Finley-Holiday video will be worth your money. High-quality shooting, good cinematography, informative voice-overs and very fitting musical scoring all add up to make a great series.

Plus, videos in the Finley-Holiday series normally have bonus features, such as sidebar attractions in the area. And, they film in all seasons of the year, something you and I can't do on a single trip.",1136160000,8,831,4.7172413793103445
