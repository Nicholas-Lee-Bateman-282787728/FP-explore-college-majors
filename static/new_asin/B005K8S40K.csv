Gokaiger aka Power Rangers Super Megaforce. Gokaiger is about 5 space pirates with Ranger Keys looking for the Greatest Treasure in the Universe. In order to get the treasure, they have to get the Great Sentai Powers from the 34 previous Super Sentai, battle an evil space alien army and a traitor from one of the Gokaigers' past, Gokaiger is a bit different than our Super Megaforce counterpart. For example: there is bad language, the previous Super Sentai groups will met the Gokaigers, more episodes, and blood. Gokaiger had everything; the weapons, the Megazord or Gokaioh and the infamous Ranger Keys. Here is the character guide.
