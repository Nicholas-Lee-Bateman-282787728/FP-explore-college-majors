8517436,2,B007I820WI,"This is the first Taiwanese Drama I've watched. There are SO many cultural references  that are not translated, so you have to just guess..
Even though the English translation does not explain the jokes or references the humor, though brilliant in it's execution is incredibly stupid.
It's like they're imitating cartoons a good bit, complete with sound effects.
I found Alice Ko to be incredibly  bland & boring.
The series get's bogged down in the middle as they stretch out problems that  were already seemingly resolved . It's like hitting your thumb with a hammer over & over again, you just feel numb & start to hate the characters for being so stupid. There IS a happy ending but getting there is painful.
Tia Roy Chiu acting is very good & interesting.",1500854400,,760,4.742424242424242
8517437,2,B007I820WI,"I was really disappointed when this arrived. I had watched the series before on tv and it was really really well done. I'd recommend it to anyone, I loved the story and the characters and decided I wanted to own It. I was really happy when it arrived and put it in to see and it turns out it was completely different than the one I've watched. The quality of the picture and audio seemed warped. The subtitles and translation was completely different than the one I watched and it wasn't very well done.  I absolutly Loved the show but I wouldn't watch it this way. Id recommend watching on Netflix.",1489104000,,599,4.396396396396397

8517442,5,B007I820WI,"This week was a tearful and emotional end to 25 episodes of Rated G joy, love, and comedy. I am notorious for Hulu and Netflix ques filled with Asian Romantic comedies and anime. Most of these single season shows draw you in with their the family friendly, quirky comedy and whimsical scenarios, but keep you hooked with their overall awesomeness.

Side Note: The opening theme song is my jam!

Overall, I loved the cast. Roy and Alice are spectacular and have amazing chemistry. The OST was fantastic (going to download the songs NOW). The plot was great.

WATCH IT.

It's going on my list of All Time Favorites. It's definitely been a while since I've been this invested and emotional about a drama. Office Girls was just fantastic all around.",1350259200,7,745,4.707692307692308
8517443,5,B007I820WI,"I didn't have much expectations for this drama. But I really loved it, the movie is clean - unlike a lot of movies today, funny and it shows that with hard work diligence and honesty you can make your dreams come true. what i love too about these dramas, that at a time when so much trash is shown you can still have a love story that's really nice at heart. Shen xi reng is a hard worker, and is trying to save money to buy her mom a house who is a single mother. Despite the hardships she never complains but does what she has to to with her sidekick le le. The boss' son returns from overseas and is like the usual spoilt kid expects everything to be given to him on a platter. It's not happening as far as the father is concerned, he gets the son to sign a contract with stipulations, and under the conditions that he tells no one in the company who he is, he has to work from bottom  with a salary , can't live at home, can't use credit cards  and has to survive on his own for at least a year. Then the fun begins.
A must see movie. The music accompanying the drama is awesome.",1337385600,8,1083,4.0092592592592595
