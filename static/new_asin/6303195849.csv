601556,5,6303195849,"This is a great tape. It is perfect for a beginner, and well worth the low price. After doing the tape for the first time, I was so relaxed and felt so good, I nearly floated to work. :) I highly reccomend it.",956188800,8,209,3.883720930232558
601657,5,6303195849,I miss this tape.  I no longer have a VHS and was hoping to find this on DVD.  Marguerite mixes the perfect blend of relaxation with a physical workout.  She is so peaceful and this tape made me love yoga.  I wish there were more DVDs of her.,1276819200,3,242,3.9791666666666665
601658,5,6303195849,"Not to be put off by the Buns of Steel title, this is a well guided and doable yoga video.  I wish that it was available on a disc.",1257984000,2,131,3.5172413793103448
601659,5,6303195849,"I bought this new in 1994 when it came out and have used it over the years.  I also have tried neumerous others after this one got ""panned"" as Buns of Steel's attempt at yoga.  But Margurite Baca is amazing.  This routine is tough for beginners but is worth all the effort.  And in no time will you find yourself trying variation's 2 and 3.  I love this tape and it burns me that they refuse to turn it to dvd.  It's really good.  I've used it for years and never get bored with it.",1194307200,3,482,4.010526315789473
601660,5,6303195849,"A friend gave me a stack of yoga tapes for beginners. The first few seemed more like yoga-robics they went so fast. I couldn't keep up. I'd be trying to learn the move and they'd be on to another. I had no time to appreciate any pose at all, either, to get the maximum benefit from it.
Then I came to Buns of Steel Mind/Body. Big sigh of relief. Marguerite Baca goes at a gentle pace I can follow AND she tells me how to breathe through each one. I get a full workout, body and mind, when I do yoga to her tape. I feel better, my poise and posture are better. Depression is going away, too.
I tossed out all the inferior yoga-robics tapes and now use only this one. Marguerite Baca is an excellent instructor and I recommend her highly to anyone who wants to learn yoga. In fact, I'm here for another copy because I lent mine to a friend and really miss it!",1131494400,5,857,4.107142857142857
601661,5,6303195849,"I have been using this same video for years now and finally had to buy a new one after giving up on ever seeing it turned into a DVD. Although I have a variety of yoga workout tapes, this is the one I most enjoy and use most consistently and frequently. It is easy for the beginner to pick up yet doesn't become boring for the more experienced user. But what I like best is that feeling of serenity and peace at the end of the workout - the instructor does an excellent job of integrating this benefit of yoga seamlessly and effortlessly throughout the entire workout.",1124064000,4,568,4.317757009345795
601662,5,6303195849,"I don't have much to add that hasn't been said by other reviewers, but wanted to put in my 5 stars' worth. :-) I love this video and hope it comes out in DVD someday. Marguerite is a very talented instructor who is very warm, kind, compassionate (I've taken many classes from her in person); these qualities come out in her video.",1111276800,3,330,4.338709677419355
601663,4,6303195849,"So what if it is called buns of steel yoga - it is a good video - seriously.  The instructor is clear with her intructions and provides modifications when necessary.  She also provides adequate rest in between each pose which you do not often find on yoga videos.  This video is a bit slow-paced, however it is not boring and I found the poses to be both challenging and relaxing.  If you are a beginner or intermediate yoga practicer I would recommend the tape.",1078617600,4,462,4.464285714285714
601664,5,6303195849,"I've been using this tape for about 8 years.  I've considered writing to Marguerite to tell her how important this tape has been for me, so instead I am writing this review.  I love the routine and the way I feel when I have completed the tape. She gives an excellent explanation of the various asanas, etc.  It's been a personal joy I have given to myself each time I practice the routine with the tape.",1040342400,5,404,4.2894736842105265
601665,4,6303195849,"Just wonderful for doing daily. I took this tape on vacation and my whole family was able to join along in the morning. My nieces 7 and 10 even thought it was fun to do. My brother-in-law who is a policeman said it really helped relieve his stress. The class is about 40 minutes long and you pick up the moves rather quickly. Pretty soon you are going along with the class without even realizing it. There are days where it seens easy and other where it will make you sweat. Great for toning and streching.

Please, please, please put on DVD.",1016841600,5,542,4.313725490196078
601666,4,6303195849,"A lot of people had recommended Yoga to me because I have had some stress  in my life and have had trouble sleeping. I also wanted to be  ""active"" again, but found it hard to work out due to a past  injury and well time. I scowered the Amazon yoga videos and bought this  one.
My first experience with yoga was about a year ago and this guy was  like a drill sargeant... and I was told that was how yoga wasn't supposed  to be. So I took a chance on this video and I haven't felt sooo relaxed in  about a year. This video takes you slowly through the poses which was  perfect for me, becauase I am a beginner. Margurite's voice is soothing and  her meditation is key after the challenging session she delievers well. I  have recommended this video to several people and we all are happy with the  results: relaxed, GREAT SLEEP and I have noticed my buns and legs are a bit  tighter!
Magurite is an inspiration and I do Yoga now about 3-4 times a  week.",968112000,8,952,4.164835164835165
7841328,5,6303195849,"Back in 1996, I used this along with Donna Richardson's 4 day rotation workout (both on vhs) to go from about 180 pounds to 114.",1460592000,,128,4.16
7841329,5,6303195849,"I highly recommend this video. Marguerite's voice is very soothing. If I am feeling chaos in my life, I just pop in this tape and listen to her voice and follow along. Ms. Baca really lives and breaths yoga, mediation and positive living. I have had other yoga tapes before and they were not as entertaining or as beneficial as ""Buns Of Steel Mind & Body Series - Yoga."" This video will be the core of my workout tapes to achieve a strong lower body.",1443830400,,450,4.305882352941176
7841330,5,6303195849,"excellent tape; utilizes classic yoga poses. great ""tune-up"" for experienced yogis. wish it were on dvd",1439251200,,103,5.5
7841331,5,6303195849,"Excellent instructor, shows you variations of poses depending on your skill level. Instructor very encouraging.  Has nothing to do with Buns of Steel. I bought the videocassette and had it transferred to DVD.",1434412800,,208,5.303030303030303
7841332,5,6303195849,"Not sure if it's still available, but a great set of asanas that get things flowing relatively quickly and easily.  Great instructor- easy to follow, nice pace, soothing voice.  This was one of the first yoga tapes and is still great today.",1404691200,,240,4.690476190476191
7841333,5,6303195849,"I'm on my 3rd vhs tape because I have worn two out.  Please, please someone put it on dvd for us!  I have bought numerous (maybe 20?) other yoga vhs tapes and dvds over the years.  Most of them have their good points, but I always come back to this one.  There is nothing on this tape that I do not like or find beneficial.  I still remember the day nearly 20 years ago that I bought my first tape at Target.  I had low expectations because I didn't know how ""Buns of Steel"" could be a serious yoga brand, but I bought it anyway because it was on sale.  Every once in a while I check to see if a dvd is available, and it isn't.  I can't recommend it highly enough for all ability levels of yoga.  Maybe not as good as attending a good ""live"" yoga class, but this is much more convenient and economical.",1388448000,,802,4.025316455696203
7841334,5,6303195849,Even though it is an old yoga tape - it is one of the best! I do wish you had it on DVD - she is great!,1354320000,,103,2.8518518518518516
7841335,5,6303195849,This is the 3rd video that I bought of this tape.  I love this workout as it is not too hard for me to do.  The first 2 videos ..my tape player ate.  I got another VCR & it works great.  I wish this would come on DVD.  I purchased this thru Amazon both times after the first one.  The service was great.......quick & reliable.,1342051200,2,326,3.9384615384615387
7841336,5,6303195849,"I am a certified yoga teacher, and this is my favorite yoga video of all time for beginner yogis and yoginis who have no significant structural health issues.  I started out using this video long before I was certified.  There is excellent instruction, and it is gentle, yet challenging for a beginner or someone who has been away from yoga for a while.  I just wish it would come out in dvd form, since my vhs tape is on its last legs!",1334448000,,436,4.2926829268292686
7841337,5,6303195849,"This tape is best for a class of one or more from start to finish.  It includes meditation, Sun Salutation and poses from different categories of Yoga postures and a traditional close. This is my fourth tape of the same and forms the backbone of my flexibility.  I do wish someone would make a DVD so I wouldn't have to maintain a VHS player and two remotes just to watch it, yes, I do know the program by heart, but it's not the same as being in Marguerite's class. It's a GREAT 50 minutes of my life well-spent!",1326326400,2,513,4.224489795918367
