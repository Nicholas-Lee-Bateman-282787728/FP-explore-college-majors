8665244,2,B00LD0VEAG,"There have been many times I have received great deals on cheap movies. This was not one of them. The picture is bad, sound good, but the real problem is this movie has no plot and some of the worst acting I have ever come across. Don't believe the adds. All those different law enforcement agencies they talk abut never show up. This was a cheap move with bad actors, bad film and a very bad picture, hard to look at. It would be nice if those in power would put out some of the truly good movies that have yet to be put out there for those of us who love to collect movies from the 30s, 40s, and 50s. This is not one you will watch more than once if you get that far.",1434931200,2,669,3.926470588235294
