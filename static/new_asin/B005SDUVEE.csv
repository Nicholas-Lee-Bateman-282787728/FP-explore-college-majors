8484757,1,B005SDUVEE,"I don't usually review films, but considering how highly this one is rated on here compared to how bad the movie actually is, I had to speak up!

I can't believe this film has a single 5 star rating, let alone several. It's boring as hell. The reviewers that are giving high ratings must be friends of the movie makers or something. It's a B movie with B actors, none of which I recognized. Unbelievable borefest. Don't waste your time!",1333238400,,436,4.45
8484758,5,B005SDUVEE,"Out of the over 200 films submitted to our October 2011 Festival this year, it was an easy and unanimous decision to honor ""Dispatch"" with Best Overall Film. Its a serious, intelligent look at one highly-eventful night at a limo service. Nicely balanced story, pace, direction, editing, acting, night lighting, etc. It could easily be a pilot for a new cable channel TV series. I was hooked from the beginning and watched it in one sitting, rare for someone who must watch every film submitted to our Festival in a relatively short timeframe. If your looking for mindless car crashes, non-stop action and bathroom humor, this film is not for you. If you respect well-crafted films, regardless of plot, turn off your phone, pull up a chair and have a look. Gary Berger, Chief Juror, Offshoot Film Festival. This is an unsolicited review and I have no connection whatsoever to the filmmakers, other than watching and jurying their film.",1325376000,,934,4.880503144654088
8484759,5,B005SDUVEE,"When Nick, gets out of his car and takes the all too brief walk through the sunlight to his Dispatch office, it is the brightest part of his day. When he enters the claustrophobic caged-in work area, there is little light to be found and as viewers, we get a definite visceral feeling that things may not go well here. Michael Bershad, who plays Nick and cowrote the film with director, Steven Sprung, commands our full attention. We feel trapped with him in this space and with each fateful decision that he makes, there is nothing we can do but follow him inexorably into the darkness. Bershad and Sprung have done a masterful job of creating a film noir like feel that is all too rare in today's fare. The acting is superb, the direction is deft and the writing is pitch-perfect with just the right amount of humor. Check it out.",1321228800,2,832,4.480263157894737
8484760,5,B005SDUVEE,"Dispatch by first time Director Steven Sprung and is a powerful, dark drama about the inner dealing of a Limousine service on one special night. Potent performances from the Michael Bershad and a powerhouse cast featuring Blake Robbins and Bruce Bohne round out this riveting movie. The mood, look and subject matter are all fascinating, and engaging. An awesome ride, thoroughly entertaining.",1321142400,,393,5.354838709677419
8484761,5,B005SDUVEE,"I'm an indie film lover. Saw this film at a film festival this past fall in Los Angeles. Well told story about a man dealing with some serious issues, juggling a job, a broken marriage, with the hopes of a turning it all around with a seemingly amazing business opportunity. Amidst this drama, director Steven Sprung keeps comedy throughout, plenty of laughs. It's an ensemble cast of characters that you would love to hang out with, that's my kind of movie. Heartwarming. I would definitely check it out!",1320969600,,505,4.75
8484762,5,B005SDUVEE,"Saw it at the 2011 Hollywood Film Festival. My favorite Inde film. Great suspense flick, leading up to the big dramatic moment when one realizes that it's the choices we make in life, what we do and what we don't do, that put us where we are today. Makes you think. Well shot, well edited it's a gem.",1320796800,3,300,4.189655172413793
8484763,5,B005SDUVEE,"I was privileged to have seen Steven Sprung and Michael Bershad's ""Dispatch"" at the 2011 Hollywood Film Festival. This is the most serious and riveting film I have seen all year long. It is a haunting tale of lost love and a lost life, another hapless victim of the Hollywood machine. At times it is crazy, light, and amusing, at other times I wanted to jump into the film and yell at Nick and tell him what to do when he had a life-changing critical moment right in front of his face. When the film had ended, I realized that I was hardly breathing, which is to say I really got into it. I am used to having that kind of physical/mental/emotional involvement after a heart-pounding thriller or murder mystery. I never thought that a ""guy flick"" like Dispatch could pull me in with the same rawness and intensity, but it did, and I could feel Nick's pain and self-deception from beginning to end of the film. Steven's camera work and editing were absolutely excellent and very much a part of making this a beautiful work of film art, truly a uniquely Hollywood story from start to finish. I highly recommend this.",1320710400,2,1113,4.514851485148514
8484764,4,B005SDUVEE,"The new indy feature ""Dispatch"" is reminiscent of the 1964 Sidney Lumet classic ""The Pawnbroker"".  There, Rod Steiger's tormented Holocaust survivor pawnbroker toils day to day in his East Harlem shop while the modern world comes to him through the front door.  In ""Dispatch"", the dispatcher is experiencing one of his worst nights ever, and it all happens in the claustrophobic dispatch office, while the world comes to him in the form of phone calls and his limo drivers.",1320364800,,473,4.974683544303797
8484765,5,B005SDUVEE,"Dispatch is the only film I've ever seen in which there was not one cough nor one whisper during its screening before a full theater.  The film is unique in many other ways--if it were a painting, it might be called a still life.  It is a motion picture, however, and the motion depicts time within the space of a limousine dispatch office.
Nick, the central character in the film, is realized by actor Michael Bershad.  Nick deftly makes decisions regarding the disposition of his limousines as problems develop.  Murphy's Law quietly asserts itself upon Nick as we learn that his life's dreams and goals have never materialized.  Yet Nick is admired and even envied by those around him who may lead lives even more desperate.  In the background we glimpse the facades of the beautiful people attempting to be seen as relevant as they engage limousine service.
There is no climax and, similar to our own lives, seemingly no plot.  Yet Dispatch is like the perfect take in a recording session with a great musician.  It can't be done better.  Dispatch is neither one film frame too long nor one frame too short.  Director Steven Sprung's vision and Bershad's poignant portrayal are near perfect.  This is a film to be appreciated with full attention and no distractions.  A unique film with my highest recommendation.",1320105600,4,1317,4.804444444444444
8484766,5,B005SDUVEE,"This is a great movie for those who like independent movies, and independent movie making. The story is one that is very original and its theme is one that a wide variety of audiences can relate. The directing, acting, and cinematography are all very natural and visually pleasing to the eye. If you want to see something new, with good movie techniques, check this one out. I saw Dispatch at the Hollywood Film Festival a few weeks ago, on the big screen, and I was not disappointed. I left the movie with a new perspective, which is always a good sign for any film.",1320105600,2,567,4.461538461538462
