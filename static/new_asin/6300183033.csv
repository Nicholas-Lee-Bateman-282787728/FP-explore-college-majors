216958,5,6300183033,"Westerns greats John Wayne and Randolph Scott made two movies together. The second one was Pittsburgh. But the first was The Spoilers, the best known and most popular version of the classic Rex Beach novel about two strong men on a collision course with each other with Marlene Dietrich smack in the middle of them.

Wayne is a miner in Alaska who runs afoul of town boss Scott. Wayne has struck gold, and Scott is working overtime to cheat Wayne out of the claim or force him out. Both are in love with Dietrich. The two butt heads in one of the most famous fight scenes in movie history.

The movie has its flaws. It makes racist jokes at the expense of Dietrich's black maid, the nadir of which is Wayne in blackface pretending to be a black man. But this movie is a classic, rip-roaring, brawling Northern that set the standards for this subgenre of Westerns. This is a movie that has a secure place in history, regardless of how uncomfortable certain scenes to watch",1162166400,,971,4.511363636363637

216960,5,6300183033,"I have this movie and love seeing it. It is one that you will want to watch time and time again. The script is cleverly written, such as the line that John Wayne says to Marlene Dietrich: ""Baby,you'd look better in a burlap bag"". The music is conducted by Elmer Bernstein and helps to capture the drama in this movie. John Wayne's way of getting his words across to the actresses in the film is his trademark, his high pitched voice, the nod of his head and his smile. The brawl between John Wayne and Randolph Scott is a real classic of movie making. So much could be said, but if you love old western classics you will really enjoy this one. They don't make them like this anymore. This movie should be rated a 10.",1120176000,2,716,4.272058823529412
216961,4,6300183033,"""The Spoilers"" is an unabashed adventure flick brimming with romance, humor and spectacular action. The plot, such as it is, is simple but compelling. When government agents arrive in Alaska and 'steal' a gold miner's claim, the miners decide to retaliate. John Wayne is a miner who's claim has been stolen by the local magestrate, played by Randolph Scott. Both Scott and John Wayne cut dashing figures of masculinity across the stark but beautiful Alaskan backdrops. Marlene Dietrich - as the lusty, husky-voiced madam, is at her most provocative, sensual best. The climactic fistfight, between Wayne and Scott is defiantly brutal to say the least.
TRANSFER: Exemplary. The B&W picture can be nicely balanced. Blacks are sometimes unstable. There's a limited amount of film grain and age related artifacts that enhances the performances. Digital anomalies are generally not an issue, though some edge enhancement is present. The audio is mono but nicely cleaned up.

216962,4,6300183033,"""The Spoilers"" is an excellent western, released in 1942, that just misses being a classic. I suppose with the setting in Nome, Alaska, it should be called a ""northern"" ! The film boasts a potent starring trio of John Wayne, Marlene Dietrich and Randolph Scott, and has remained famous over the years for its climactic, no-holds-barred fistfight between those two icons of western cinema, Wayne and Scott.
Clocking in at just under an hour and a half, ""The Spoilers"" does not have a complcated plot. The gold rush is on, but ruthless government agents, led by a swaggering crook named McNamara ( an atypically villainous Randolph Scott ), are trying to chisel miners out of their property. Cherry Malotte, the local casino operator ( smouldering Marlene Dietrich ) may seem like a tough woman on the outside, but she has supported a number of the miners and is pleased when her old flame, Glennister ( formidable John Wayne ), is back in town. Cherry's relationship with Glennister is about as calm and centred as that of two Siamese fighting fish ! At the same time, McNamara's pursuit of Cherry is only slightly less energetic than his efforts to steal gold mines, so when the showdown comes, the ""Duke"" has a lot at stake.
In addition to the three stars, there are many supporting performances of note, with faces familiar to fans of old ""A"" and ""B"" westerns--Harry Carey, George Cleveland, Russell Simpson, William Farnum, Ray Bennett and Forrest Taylor to name a few. The movie is directed with a lot of energy by Ray Enright. The sets are impressive--check those streets--thick mud--I suspect that Nome around 1900 was like this--plenty of booze, mud, fortunes won and lost, and a busy undertaker !
The DVD exhibits a black and white picture with reasonable quality. When a movie is 62 years old, I tend to be less critical about technical matters than some reviewers. There are no extras whatsoever. Surely there are some noted film critics out there who could have provided some interesting background comments ? Hey--Leonard Maltin--hey Roger Ebert--how about a little help here ?
""The Spoilers"", even with the legendary fisticuffs, is not--for me, at least--in the top echelon of classic westerns. At the same time, Wayne, Dietrich and Scott are so watchable that this disc still deserves a place in the collection of any serious fan.",1090195200,31,2344,4.891959798994975

216965,4,6300183033,"'The Spoilers' may be the most often-filmed western, ever, yet it has been largely forgotten by today's moviegoers, which is a shame! This is a riproaring adventure yarn with claimjumpers, a sexy romantic triangle, loads of humor, and, to cap things off, the most spectacular fistfight in screen history!
The second of three Marlene Dietrich/John Wayne teamings (and Duke is third-billed, behind Dietrich and Randolph Scott!), the plot is simple; evil government 'agents' arrive in Alaska, steal goldminers' claims, until the miners finally take matters into their own hands!
The climactic fistfight, between Wayne and Randolph Scott, is the stuff of legends! You can hold up 'The Quiet Man', or 'Hard Times', or 'Any Which Way But Loose' as having epic brawls, but this one tops them all! We're talking shirts ripped to shreds, broken furniture and windows, rolling under horses and through the mud mayhem, here! If this were pro football, both Scott and Wayne would make the All-Madden Team, for sure!

Part of a scheme to bilk miners out of their gold mine claims, a dishonest stinker shows up in town as the unofficial gold commissioner (Randolph Scott as Alexander McNamara).  No one checks his credentials or those of a dubious judge (Samuel S. Hinds).  They are working in tandem to get as much as they can before they are caught.  Unfortunately, too many townsfolk are getting mighty suspicious.  What they need is the law.  Instead, theyve got claim jumpers and crooks galore, even the local constabulary cant be trusted.

Oft filmed, this version has the novelty of pairing the older Dietrich with a younger Wayne as her occasional boyfriend of convenience.  The dialog is hilarious and so is the outrageous hairdo Dietrich supports like a monument.  My favorite line came from Richard Barthelmess as Bronco.

217019,5,6300183033,"I liked a lot this 1942 black and white western about Alaska gold rush, filled with action, humour, smart one liners and sexual tension. Below, more of my impressions - with some limited SPOILERS about ""Spoilers"")))

The story takes place in Nome, Alaska in 1900, in full gold rush. Following on the trail of first prospectors and miners numerous shady characters (""spoilers"") arrived to Alaska, to steal most interesting claims by force, ruse or legal artifice. One of such claims, in fact a prosperous gold mine, belongs to Roy Glennister (John Wayne) and Al Dextry (Harry Carey) and their silent partner, saloon owner Cherry Malotte (Marlene Dietrich). Cherry and Glennister are also more or less in a relationship  albeit it is a stormy one

Knowing that they will be targeted by the ""spoilers"" the three partners are concerned for their claim, but hope that things will improve with the arrival of a new gold commissioner Alexander McNamara (Randolph Scott) and a new judge. However, the judge also brings with him his niece, Helen Chester (Margaret Lindsay), an educated, classy, sweet young thing. Glennister immediately falls for her - hard! In retaliation Cherry shows some responsiveness to McNamara's advances And that is only the beginning of troubles

Well, you can immediately see that it is an old film, when John Wayne is billed third))) But in fact this was already the FOURTH screen adaptation of the 1906 novel ""The spoilers"" written by Rex Beach. This book, which was one of bestsellers in 1906, was based partly on real events and the character of Alexander McNamara is based on a real man, Alexander McKenzie. This corrupt official indeed tried to steal gold mines from their legal owners in Nome in 1900, albeit in the real life no violence was involved (he ended by going to jail  but served only little time). As for the character of Roy Glennister it is very, very distantly based on Japhet Lindeberg, one of ""Three Lucky Swedes"" who were amongst the most famous (and most fortunate) prospectors during the gold rush.

This is a really good film. It aged surprisingly little in 73 years and is still a darn good watch. All five main actors offer a great show, but this film has also many colourful secondary characters, beginning with Idabelle (Marietta Canty), Cherry's black maid  who in fact is more of a confidante and also occasionally a kind of partner in crime...))) John Wayne is excellent in this film and Randolph Scott offers all his snaky charm  and menace When those two finally clash, their fistfight is nothing short of epic Veteran actor Harry Carey is excellent as a no-nonsense old timer who trusts his faithful rifle more than lawyers  and honestly, it is hard to blame him))) Young Margaret Lindsay plays very well a ""fille fatale""  an ultimately-not-so-nice deceptively sweet seemingly innocent girl

It is however Marlene Dietrich who shines the most in ""Spoilers"". I always liked those old films which were as full of sex as today, but because nothing could be shown, everything had to be suggested  and here we have a masterful display of those techniques. Innuendos, double-entendres, looks full of meaning, tricks of lights and shadows, musical moments, camera moving away in strategically chosen scenes  all is here Those scenes in which Marlene Dietrich navigates between two attractive males, teasing them, toying with them and occasionally verbally biting them, are a real treasure. Incidentally, Marlene Dietrich and John Wayne were in the same time having a real life affair  and that helped in creating screen chemistry between them

Bottom line, this is a good, solid old western, still very watchable, with a lot of excellent dialogs, humour, tension, drama and one of the most famous fistfights in all history in cinema. A recommended viewing. ENJOY!",1421366400,,3812,4.990536277602524

His movies were clean, family show,and wrong was wrong, and right was right.

217060,3,6300183033,"In THE SPOILERS, we can once again enjoy the unusual star combination of Dietrich, Scott and Wayne in a rollicking adventure set against an Alaskan boom-town circa the 1890's.  ""The Spoilers"" by Rex Beach had already been adapted for the screen several times, but this is the version most people are familiar with.

The town of Nome is at the height of the gold-rush, and saloon owner Cherry Malotte (Marlene Dietrich) becomes the object of desire in a  vendetta between cheated miner Roy Glennister (John Wayne) and local kingpin Alexander McNamara (Randolph Scott).

Universal first combined Dietrich, Scott and Wayne in ""Pittsburgh"" (also released in 1942); their unusual screen chemistry plays out to maximum effect in THE SPOILERS, yet both movies are quite similar with their period settings and fiery love-duels for Dietrich's affection.

Marlene Dietrich gets to really cut loose with her character of Cherry Malotte, costumed in some outrageous Vera West creations.  Adding some fun comedy is her wisecracking maid Idabelle (Marietta Canty).  Margaret Lindsay is the stereotypical ""good girl""--but with a twist.

Many reviewers have already talked about the climactic brawl between Wayne and Scott, so I won't step on anybody's toes.  That said, it is a brilliantly-executed sequence, you can't even tell where the actors leave off and the stunt doubles take over.

I sincerely would have liked to sing without limitation the praises of the film like all the precedent reviewers here but I honestly can't. Director Ray Enright was not John Ford nor Anthony Mann and all the Hollywood stars wouldn't have changed the fact that this movie is a good B-movie but not a masterpiece.

Don't misunderstand me, I've liked the film or, rather, I've liked certain aspects of THE SPOILERS. Marlene Dietrich's performance, for instance, is a reason to see the film, she's the real star here, John Wayne and Randolph Scott's parts being interesting, yes, but less important. I've also liked a few comic scenes such as the arrival of Jonathan Struve at the mine and his retreat in front of Al Dextry and his rifle Betsy. In this scene, Ray Enright reminds us of the time he was a gag writer for Mack Sennett. Finally, there is the well-known final fight between John Wayne and Randolph Scott : absolutely unrealistic but so cinematic.

Also starring Harry Carey former cowboy star of hundreds of early westerns and a favourite of director John Ford.

THE SPOILERS was from a 1906 novel by Rex Beach the story is set in the mud splattered mining town of 1900 Nome, Alaska during the gold rush. Roy Glennister (John Wayne) and Al Dextry (Harry Carey) are co-owners of a gold mine financed by saloon owner Cherry Mallotte (Marlene Dierich).

7804132,4,6300183033,"This 1942 black and white western about the gold rush in Alaska in 1900 when lawlessness was rampant stars Marlene Dietrich, who got top billing, Randolph Scott, who came in second, and John Wayne who was billed third. Scott is the villain in the film. Wayne and his partner are cheated out of their gold mine and the wealth they saved. Dietrich uses her charms to aid Wane who she loves, as does another woman, who also loves Wayne, who is portrayed as a virgin-type compared to Dietrich who is a saloon owner. Wayne acts as he usually did in the 40s with a kind of sweet likable look on his face. He does not want to fight. He wants to resolve the problem peaceably, but the film has what many consider the best fist-fight on film between Scott and Wayne.",1496361600,,757,4.375886524822695
