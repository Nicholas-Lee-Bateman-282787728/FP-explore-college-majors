8303843,5,B000TXQHQ4,"This DVD presents a 1965 London performance of Terry on trumpet and flugelhorn with trombonist Bob Brookmeyer in a distinctive quintet with an excellent British pianist named Laurie Holloway (male), as well as a 1974 London set of Terry's regrettably short-lived Big Bad Band that included saxophonists and arrangers Jimmy Heath and Ernie Wilkins, Chris Woods' vibrant flute, and the propulsive rhythm section of pianist Horace Parlan, bassist Eddie Jones, and drummer Grady Tate.  The final few minutes feature Terry and baritone saxophonist Pepper Adams in separate, succcinct ballad interpretations from 1977 in Copenhagen, when Adams was a member of Terry's quintet.  At 85-minutes, this DVD is an excellent value, with good audio and video quality throughout.",1463356800,,764,5.521367521367521
