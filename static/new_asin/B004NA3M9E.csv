8436535,3,B004NA3M9E,"Stagecoach, 1939 film

The film opens on a road in the southwest. Two riders gallop into an Army post. The Apaches are on the warpath, led by Geronimo. [No reason given.] The coach stops to change their six horses. The conversation introduces the characters. Whats good for the banks is good for the country. [Does the banker resemble President Harding?] Dallas is driven out of town by the good women to avoid a calamity. Doc Boone hasn't done well. Cavalry escorts the stagecoach to guard against attack. The banker hops aboard. Johnny Ringo hitches a ride. They proceed through Monument Valley. Shall they continue without a cavalry escort? They take a vote. What difference does it make? Seating at the table shows their status.

The banker spouts political slogans that are still relevant (and wrong) today. They take a detour north for safety and learn bad news. Mrs. Mallory faints and needs medical attention. Its a baby! Ringo must carry on the family feud. We learn more about the people and their concerns. [Too sentimental?] Smoke on the mountain sends a signal. The stress affects the people. The next stop reveals a burned house and ferry. They get across the stream and continue. An arrow announces the Apache attack, the chase begins. [That wasn't much of an ambush! Would the clever Apaches attack in the open?] Will the cavalry arrive in the nick of time? The survivors arrive in town. Johnny Ringo is in town. Lukes hand had aces and eights. The telegraph was repaired and the Sheriff greets banker Gatewood.

Ringo is given his ten minutes. The men in the bar await the news. Three men look for Ringo in the dark. Shots are heard, a woman screams. Ringo returns to the Marshal, and meets Dallas again. There is a surprise for a happy ending. The film reflects the culture of that era and hasn't aged badly. Ringo has knocked around enough to know what Dallas was and wouldnt care anyway. [Too sentimental?]

Ernest Haycox wrote many popular Western novels, some adapted to films. This is a story of clichs about a group of people who are thrown together, face a peril, and live through it. How does it compare to the other western movies from that era? Few have survived to be placed on tape or disc. Was it more censored in some respects and less in others? I think remakes of this film will drop the banker and pregnant wife due to cultural changes. John Wayne played in many westerns before this film which made him a star.",1509062400,,2446,4.6682134570765665
