7841623,1,6303251382,It appears from the cover that Maria leads a sitdown aerobic workout. Instead she adapts to a routine designed for a walking person. It's difficult to follow since everyone but Maria and one other seated person  are literally walking and grapevining all over the stage while Maria rolls  forward and backward in her wheelchair stopping occasionally to do a few  arm movements. I've had better workouts watching Jane Fonda do aerobics.,940377600,15,434,5.084507042253521
