As the project evolved, it became a docu-drama, with fictional characters and some limited dialogue. It was intended to be shot in 16mm and to do a ""blow-up"" to 35mm for screening at select statewide film festivals. When Robert Lindstrom heard about the idea, he suggested that he wanted to write a full length screenplay for a 90 minute movie. It was decided at that time by Steven Hull and Lindstrom that the project go before 35mm cameras. They raised $55,000.00 to shoot the film, knowing additional funds were required to finish post-production, soundtrack and prints. It was shot over five and one half weeks during October and November 1978. All of the sound on location was recorded as a scratchtrack as there was too much noise polution of dialogue lines. Every line in the picture was rerecorded (dubbed). The entire rough post process took nearly a year on no budget. 14 tracks were mixed in late 1979 to facilitate screenings to sell the product. In 1981 Alan Roberts of Select A Tape took the incomplete project for remixing of tracks, music scoring and release printing. costing $50,000.00. In 1982 10 Speed was shown to buyers at the American Film Market in Los Angeles (Westwood), Cannes Festival and MIFED in Milan. Vestron/Lightning Video finally licensed it for U.S. Canadian domestic distribution.",1350086400,,1455,4.91869918699187
