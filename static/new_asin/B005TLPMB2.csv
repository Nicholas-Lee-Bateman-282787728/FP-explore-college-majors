8486355,5,B005TLPMB2,"I don't watch too many films in the ""independent human-interest documentary"" genre, so I was a little surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie.  To begin with, the story of Benedict is a fascinating subject.  It's gritty and real, but also uplifting and full of hope.  The film tells the story in a way that will draw you in and keep you wondering what's going to happen next.  This movie also provides a lot of insight into everyday life in India.  Overall, it's well worth your time to watch ""I Met with an Accident,"" even if you don't normally go for this kind of film.",1325289600,,574,4.377358490566038
8486356,5,B005TLPMB2,"This magnificent, inspiring, powerful movie will put an enormous smile on your face. One cannot help but laugh at the humor so gracefully sprinkled within this film. However, it is safe to say that the splendor of this movie comes from the understanding of human emotions and the miracles that occur not within our physical bodies, but within our spiritual ones. This award-winning film will dazzle your eyes and captivate your soul.",1324598400,,433,5.027777777777778
8486357,5,B005TLPMB2,"A great documentary. There is a message for us all in this film. It puts many things in perspective when you see how other people live particularly the poverty of the Das family. If you are North American and you think you are poor or have no opportunity, this film will put it all in perspective.",1324425600,,297,4.321428571428571
8486358,5,B005TLPMB2,"This well done documentary was interesting from the beginning to the end.  It captivated me with the real images of life in India to one particular man and his special family. I was expecting something well done, and I was not disappointed.  Trevor Ward did a great job of filming details and caught the emotions driven by the heroics of this man's injury and dependency on others. It is a gripping true story and well worth viewing more than once.",1322956800,,448,4.5875
8486359,5,B005TLPMB2,"I Met With An Accident tells the story of Benedict Das, an Indian man who narrowly survives a deadly bus accident on his way home from work, but not without costing him the functional use of his legs.  The film is quickly raw in content, and often tosses viewers into intense sequences of  ""he said-she said"" competing narratives that ring very close to reality.  And while its first ten minutes carry an ""Extreme Home Makeover"" vibe,  the next 120 pull no punches.  As with life, things often have to get worse before they get better and the dirt has to be sifted before any specks of gold emerge.  Benedict's story is not a pretty one (and he'd tell you as much), but in the end it is beautiful, full of depth, and quite miraculous.

The film immerses its viewer in Indian culture without being preachy about its participants' living conditions or the poverty in the background of each shot.  The clear focus is on Benedict, and I enjoyed this very much because in the process of learning his story I was naturally drawn to the stark contrasts between his world and my own, making me thankful for the life I was born into and more actively committed to helping those in need.  But viewers don't HAVE to feel this way.  Benedict is the central character in the story, and while the setting certainly affects the film, it does not dominate its scope.

Even as I write this review, I'm hesitant to analyze Benedict and his family because Ward has done such a fantastic job of making them ""real,"" and therefore responding with any shred of judgment would be as uncomfortable for me as delivering an analysis to Benedict face to face.  Ward gives us a detailed look into this man's life that is usually reserved for the deepest of friendships, and therefore it's difficult to remember that I don't personally know the man.  Judging Benedict's life would be the equivalent of sitting down a good friend and attempting to psychoanalyze him.

One of the reasons I enjoyed this film so much is that Benedict reminded me of my father.  Without going into much detail, it wasn't until my father went through a life-and-death experience that he realized the value of his family and began the long road to becoming a new man.  Viewers quickly find that Benedict is sharp tongued and aggressive, and can easily imagine how frightening he would be with the use of his legs.  And yet there is a brokenness to the man, a likeability that shines through his flaws and offers glimpses of the redemption that is taking place deep within him.  The film offers hope that even the cruelest of men can change and be restored.

Although it's a small portion of the story, the active discussion on karma vs. grace is fascinating to watch.  Did Benedict deserve or, further, cause the ""accident"" that crippled him?  Several family members seem to think so.  Or, as Benedict believes, did the ""accident"" serve a divine purpose?  The film only presents questions, allowing its viewers to objectively judge the circumstances of Benedict's life and wrestle with the difficult cause and effect relationships that dominate all cultures.

Benedict is the breath of life in this story.  He is hilarious and in love with the camera as long as it doesn't try to follow him to the bathroom.  He is also inconsistent and flawed, and it's often hard to tell if he really believes what he is saying or whether he's merely chewing on thoughts to see how they taste!  Benedict is both abusive and loving and boasts to see the two hand in hand.  This is an odd but not uncommon viewpoint, and yet another reason this story could be transplanted to anywhere in the world and find similar characters.  It speaks to humanity in us all.

I must say a word for Benjamin's wife Celine because she is a remarkable woman.  After suffering years of abuse and neglect, she still chose to stay with her husband (despite her family's protests) and patiently takes care of him every day.  The film expertly displays her powerful love and unassuming resilience, even as she listens teary-eyed from the kitchen as her dependent husband spews hurtful words.  I Met with an Accident, on many levels, is a love story.

The film's pacing is episodic with carefully constructed highs and lows, yet skillfully organized and coherent.  It's difficult to keep track of time while watching, but the conclusion is incredible and, as mentioned above, entirely miraculous.  Throughout the film director Trevor Ward parallels the telling of Benedict's story with footage of construction workers completing a large building project, stone by stone, near Benedict's house.  This beautifully symbolizes Benedict's need for others in his healing process and the painstaking reconstruction taking place in his personal life.

I Met With An Accident is thought-provoking and impactful, and well-worth the viewing.  There are so many layers to it, and it speaks to such a basic level of the human condition, that I think it could be discussed and dissected for days, if not longer.

There was a Q&A session with the director at the screening I attended in Orlando that revealed many fascinating details that didn't make the film's final cut.  I would love to see those details available online sometime in the future, as well as updates on Benedict and his family!",1318032000,,5287,4.785005512679162
