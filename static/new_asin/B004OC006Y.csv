4437137,5,B004OC006Y,"While the movie is certainly worthy of praise and is a very excellent sequel to the first one, my review will be focusing on what now has become a monumental case of false advertising about getting a ""Digital Copy"" product. To be fair to the movie, I did give this a 5 star rating. There are other excellent descriptions of the movie already published under reviews so I am focusing on the product.

What you are getting with this and any other ""Ultraviolet"" product is NOT a digital copy. You don't get a copy of anything. All you get is the right to create an account to access the servers of the so called ""Ultraviolet"" system. Hence, if you are at an airport, you get the joy of using your data plan to capacity (and paying actual additional dollars if you have exceeded capacity) only to realize that while on the plane, you have no access to your purported digital copy. This is one of the biggest scams in the digital age. Advertising to let you think that you are getting a ""copy"" of a movie, when all you get is access to a web site, when it is up, using your own internet bandwidth and the dollars that go along with it. If consumers don't fight this severe advertising deception, soon true digital copies will be a thing of the past and you will be stuck with Bluray vs. iTunes. Buyer beware. Stand up to Ultraviolet and don't let them ruin the digital copy experience. We are all paying good money for these. The least we could get in return is a digital copy to take with us, legally on a plane ride or traveling otherwise.

Again, remember, all you get is access to the Ultraviolet website with no guarantee of its continued existence. That is not getting a copy of anything at all. Just a promise that as of today, you will be able to access a web site owned by a greedy conglomerate of movie studios who want to prevent you from having a portable copy of the movie so they don't have to share any profit with companies like Apple.",1332028800,"1,344",1946,4.343406593406593
4437138,5,B004OC006Y,"Well this film is that level of fun. After kicking into gear they quickly take an old and familiar setting and bring it into the modern day (figuratively that is, since this is actually set in the late 19th century). They manage to do this without making it too youth oriented. The true fun in this film will be in rewatching it, the quick banter and fun plot twists that turn out to be thought out well in advance (for the most part), will only be more enjoyable upon multiple viewings. The layers, much like those found in the Pirates script, are multiple and cerebral. They hit the viewer without our full awareness and when we later realize this it brings a smirk if not a smile to the face. Many plot points that seem by chance or appear to be toss away jokes end up returning and playing a larger role in the story, it's nice to see some effort in a big budget blockbuster - especially when its a sequel.

The action and staging of set pieces might not properly belong in the era portrayed (according to some critics) but it makes for a fun and well balanced film in my opinion. This isn't meant to be historically accurate, its meant to be a version of history much like Gladiator or Pirates. The performances are excellent and I found RDJ to be even more comfortable in his role as Holmes, surprising since he has so many other films and franchises now on his plate. Having laid the groundwork in the first film he spends more of the film flexing Holme's emotional levels, mainly regarding his relations to Watson and Irene Adler. Jude Law becomes much more familiar as Watson and thus becomes much more likable because this time he adheres to the objective with much less resistance (possibly because he has a chance to really let out his frustrations with Holmes early on). The two obviously have that strong relationship that goes beyond friendship, something Ritchie quite enjoys playing with but that makes for something different and refreshing while allowing for moments of strong humor.

Also compelling was Noomi Rapace, filling a space left by McAdams departure after a short but meaningful cameo early in the film. Noomi is given somewhat of a small role and largely facilitates plot purposes but her character does have an arc and emotional stakes that make her important to the story, if not always fully utilized. She of course develops an interest in Holmes but again this is well justified given the events that transpire and doesn't feel as forced as one would assume. Another new face is Jared Harris, who is a very cerebral Moriarty. I really enjoyed his performance but was prepped for it, having enjoyed him on the series Mad Men. For those not familiar with his ""proper/formal"" Englishman style I'm not sure if he will come across as menacing as some might hope or expect, even based on the first film. I thought he played the villain in a unique way and did so quite well.

In short, if you enjoyed the first you will enjoy this, at least I don't see how you couldn't. If you didn't enjoy the first because of the occult vs. science storyline, the pacing, or perhaps the uneven still developing characters, I will say I personally found this one to be much improved and much more comfortable with itself all around. I did enjoy the first but never thought I'd need to see it again, but I found myself rewatching it after seeing this sequel, and this film I want to own and rewatch, again and again, just as I do with Pirates Curse of the Black Pearl.",1331942400,127,3481,4.557507987220447

4437240,3,B004OC006Y,"*This is a review of the actual movie only, as I watched it on Amazon and not a DVD or Blu-ray*

I enjoyed this movie, just as I did the first one. Both Downey & Law are very good, and they work well together. They also make the weird friendship between Watson & Holmes believable. The only thing with this one is, along with being more OTT ""Die Hard""-esque action than mystery (as was the first one, IMO) the surrounding plot was a bit convoluted. Or maybe it's just that it wasn't played out as well as it was described in written summary form. The villain, who was more weird than scary (who takes pigeon feeding breaks in the middle of attempting to start a war?), didn't seem to have well conveyed motives.

Quite honestly, the film bored me a bit for the first half, there just being too much that my brain wanted to turn off.  The set-up provides a lot of information which I had trouble filtering through to the important pieces.  But the second half puts it all together with fine visual flare.  What impressed me the most was the attention to detail in the sets and setting.  The set decorators looked like they put their blood, sweat, and tears into all of the little nuances of the landscapes and buildings and rooms and such.  Perhaps a funny thing to notice about a movie but it is seriously impressive and felt real, not CG (I think it was real).  It was a third actor in the film.",1473465600,,830,4.486666666666666

4437320,1,B004OC006Y,"Greetings,

I had the fortune, or misfortune, of watching Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows on cable last night. Actually, I came in about an hour or more into the film. My first impression of Mr. Downey, Jr. as Sherlock Holmes was his scruffy and disheveled look. Surely, I missed a lot so I tuned in the second time it aired a few hours later. I was mostly curious if the shabby, beard stubbled Holmes would look more pristine and better dressed at the start. But, alas, the opening scenes of the second run was exactly like the first - like I had just tuned into the middle of the movie again! Now he was a grungy china man and he was apparently bruised and battered throughout the entire flick. This ""chinaman"", who appears out of nowhere, purloins a package from, of all people, Irene Adler?!  No set up to the adventure at all! Perhaps, one must see the first film to understand the second.

Mr. Downey's Holmes was so unlikable that I barely wanted to spend two minutes with him let alone a full two hours and eight minutes. I eventually bailed on the second airing not waiting to get to the part where I stepped into this mess of a film the first time round. Frankly, I kept thinking of Johnny Depp and Captain Sparrow in Downey's take on Sherlock Holmes. Downey's inane, clownish comedic tone had him dressed as a chinaman, a wild-eyed tramp, a transvestite, an old man, a curly haired student with buck-teeth, and a chair?

The other problem I had with this film were the over-the-top sets. Just drab and kind of ugly to look at with a dash of steampunk for good measure.

I also got a strong feeling of bromance between Downey and Law. You could view this ""new"" Sherlock Holmes as a gay love story. Holmes has a nice chemistry with Watson, nice chemistry with Moriarty, but zero chemistry with either of the women in the film. In fact, the women were much under used or developed in the plot. A pity that. The homoerotic subtext between Holmes and Watson really shifted into high gear as Holmes spends Watson's so-called wedding night with him in drag. ""Game of Shadows,"" underneath it all, was a love story between two guys. Downey's Holmes also struck me as rather ticked and put off with Watson's coming nuptials.

But the chemistry between Watson and Holmes was spotty with Holmes at times even really nasty toward Watson. Their attempt at droll and ""witty"" banter grew tedious. Sometimes the dialogue was so contemporary that it jarred me out of the Victorian England setting.

When not busy changing costumes, our Holmes tries to get to the bottom of a mystery that has something to do with arms sales and with setting various European countries at one anothers throats. But there was nothing much at stake here aside from getting to the next action set piece. It played like a bunch of barely entertaining vignettes. Forget the Sherlock Holmes once known as a detective with a keen and unforgiving intelligence. That Holmes  a creation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle  vanished inside this contemporary creation - a Sherlock Holmes on steroids!

The plot in general did not really matter much as the director seemed more interested in having their characters stage acrobatic fights with assassins, or setting up excuses for them to perform slow-motion ballets while dodging gunfire or fisticuffs.  It was just one action set piece after another with nothing to keep me interested in the story-line such as it was.

Director Guy Richie just does not know how to direct action. Everything is hyper-stylized. A sequence near the end, for instance, where our heroes are being chased by the army, Richie uses every high schoolish videographer gimmick (slow motion, freeze frames, CGI, extreme close-ups) you can think of. Just park the d@mn camera and let us see whats going on. Stop with all the multiple cuts and scene shifts. Every fight scene in Games of Shadows included a pre-slow motion visualization of the fight before it happens. Yes, I realize Ritchie was lamely attempting to show us Holmes thought process in action, but by the 3rd time it just got irritating. Especially since they were so obnoxiously staged. Mr. Ritchie apparently missed the classes devoted to the masterful contributions of film direction by Alfred Hitchcock, Howard Hawks, Ridley Scott, Steven Spielberg, or George Lucas, et al at film school.

It would be incredibly tiresome to list all the things I did not like about Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows  the chess metaphors, the sheer monotony of the action sequences, Robert Downey Jr.s couldnt-give-a-f#ck performance, &etc. There wasn't much deductive reasoning or reliance on Holmes' wealth of, or arcane knowledge either.  Mr. Ritchie seems to have the character of Sherlock Holmes confused with the worlds greatest detective  Batman.

Indeed, the action tended to drag on and on, the plot became pointless and the production overlong.  It would have been better to see some of that eye candy stripped away in favor of focusing on a simpler, well-told, one hour and forty-five minute adventure instead.

Nobody would be so bold as to assert that anything here had the slightest thing to do with the literary detective known to the world as Sherlock Holmes! I will stick with Mr. Doyle and Jeremy Brett's stellar interpretation of Sherlock Holmes thank you very much.

4437546,4,B004OC006Y,"""Oh, how I've missed you, Holmes.""

Any fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's fictional detective Sherlock Holmes who somehow missed the first of director Guy Ritchie's movies about the man will probably get a shock seeing this 2011 continuation, ""Sherlock Holmes:  A Game of Shadows.""  That's because this isn't your typical Sherlock Holmes.  It isn't the Holmes that Doyle necessarily envisioned, and it isn't the Holmes that so many film directors over the years recreated.  This is an exaggerated Sherlock Holmes, one true to the facts of the character as written down by Doyle but not quite true to the spirit.  If you forget everything you've ever read or seen about Holmes, you might have a good time with it.

Look!  Up in the sky.  It's a bird.  It's a plane.  It's Sherlock Holmes, Action Hero!

Well, Holmes did often wear a cape.  Ritchie's reimagining of the character is neither good nor bad in and of itself.  If viewers know going into the movie that they are about to get an updated action figure in the main character, the movie will not terribly disappoint them.  Ritchie makes a good action comedy of it.  If viewers go in expecting another Basil Rathbone or Jeremy Brett as a cerebral Holmes, star Robert Downey, Jr.'s vigorous portrayal of the character will surely be unsettling.  Forewarned is forearmed.

Here's the thing:  There is really nothing in Richie's films beyond the embroidered plots that Doyle himself didn't at least mention in his many short stories and novels.  It's just that this new Holmes incarnation behaves in a more action-oriented mode than in the almost purely methodical, deductive manner we've come to know.

Is the new characterization too far out?  That will depend on your attitude toward the subject.  The film may offend true and dedicated Holmes aficionados.  However, as I say, there are precedents for Holmes's latest behavior:  Doyle himself alludes to Holmes being an expert fencer and a skillful boxer; in fact, Holmes's friend Dr. John Watson (who in the fictions writes up his friend's exploits) mentions Holmes possibly becoming a professional boxer had he not gone into private investigations. Furthermore, this new Holmes is anything but the meticulously neat, compulsively tidy Holmes we generally see, but, again, Doyle actually describes his character as being rather careless about his housekeeping chores, often using his lodgings at 221B Baker Street as a personal laboratory and workshop.  In addition, Doyle tells us that Holmes frequently used drugs in his early career (a 7% solution of cocaine), and that while Holmes never married, he did admire and perhaps even fall in love with at least one worthy adversary, the beautiful Irene Adler (here played for the second time by Rachel McAdams).

What director Ritchie and star Downey do is embroider and magnify the traits Conan Doyle already gave his main character.  It's just that in most of Doyle's yarns, Holmes never has to resort to much physical activity.  In the new movies, Ritchie exploits Holmes's temperamental nature, his natural athletic abilities, and his acquired talents to produce an amusing, action-oriented hero.  If this Holmes smacks more of Tony Stark than of Conan Doyle, it's no accident.

As for Holmes's best friend, confident, and biographer, Dr. John Watson, Jude Law plays him more in keeping with Doyle's vision of the man:  strong, intelligent, cultured, dapper, and dependable.  Gone is the unfortunate (though highly entertaining) 1930's-40's characterization of actor Nigel Bruce playing Watson as a bumbling old fool.  The fact is, in the Doyle stories Holmes and Watson are approximately the same age, their late twenties when they first meet and take up rooms together in 1881 (in the present movie, set in 1891, they're in their late thirties); and Doyle describes the doctor as anything but the blundering, blathering blockhead Bruce made him out to be.  Indeed, Doyle tells us that before Watson and Holmes met, Watson was a military surgeon in the Second Afghan War, where he received a severe wound.  The author goes on to explain that Watson was a strongly built fellow and apparently quite the ladies' man, mentioning that Watson married at least twice during the long course of the stories, and in this movie we see one of those marriages.

And what do we see of the famous deerstalker cap, Inverness cape, and curved Meerschaum pipe so long associated with the detective?  You won't find them in these movies; they were the products of people other than Conan Doyle, like the artist Sydney Paget and the stage actor William Gillette, who added these touches of their own to the legend.

What we get in Ritchie and Downey's reinvention of the Sherlock Holmes saga is again a vigorous, resourceful, almost devil-may-care detective, still brilliant, witty, and arrogant but more prone to take chances than we've seen from the likes of previous actors in the part.  Downey will not remind you of Clive Brook, Arthur Wontner, Reginald Owen, Basil Rathbone, Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Roger Moore, Nicol Williamson, Christopher Plummer, Ian Richardson, Jeremy Brett, Ben Syder, Benedict Cumberbatch, or any of the countless other folks who have undertaken the role.  Downey is unmistakably his own man, making this Sherlock Holmes a logical-minded tough guy, and an eccentric in the extreme.

OK, so much for letting you know what you're getting in for.  Now, is this second entry in the Ritchie-Downey series, ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,"" better than the first movie?  I wouldn't say so.  If anything, it's even more exaggerated and more action-packed.  In other words, it's more of the same, with the emphasis on the ""more.""  If you liked the first movie, you may like this one even more.  If you didn't like the first one, you may like this one even less.  I rather liked the first one and found this one equally entertaining.

In this one, which takes up just after the first movie ended in the early 1890's, Holmes discovers after a series of bombings in London that his old nemesis, Dr. James Moriarty, is up to his usual no good.  Holmes's friend Watson is just about to wed Mary Morstan (Kelly Reilly) and wants to settle into a more normal and comfortable lifestyle; but Holmes pulls him into one ""last adventure.""  From there it's a battle of wits (and brawn) between the factions of good and evil, with a mysterious Gypsy woman (Naomi Rapace), Holmes's brother Mycroft (Stephen Fry), and Moriarty's chief agent, Col. Sebastian Moran (Paul Anderson), along for the fun.

On the plus side, Holmes has another worthy opponent with whom to contend in his most-famous of all antagonists, the redoubtable Professor James Moriarty, played with menacing glee by Jared Harris.  Moriarity was Holmes's archenemy in several of Doyle's stories, a felonious mastermind behind most of the crime in London (and all of England and Europe for that matter), a man clearly the intellectual equal of Holmes.  And you want action between them?  In Doyle's own account of events (""The Final Problem""), Dr. Watson sees Holmes and Moriarty engaged in a death struggle with one another at the top of Switzerland's Reichenbach Falls, both men apparently falling to their deaths in the waters below.  Yes, Doyle wanted to end the character once and for all and get on with his other writing.  The public, however, wouldn't stand for it and pressured the author into bringing Holmes back and continuing the stories for many more years.  Much to our continued pleasure.

Downey and Law are as good as ever in their characterizations, their banter, their interactions, with more emphasis this time on their constant humorous bickering.  Again, we see this contentiousness in the original Doyle stories, although in the present movie director Ritchie rather enjoys expanding it for comic effect.

The sets and costumes also add to one's enjoyment of the film.  The CGI used in recreating late nineteenth-century London is splendid, and the careful attention to period detail in clothing, hats, furniture, hair styles, and such pays off.  For those critics who complain that Ritchie's depiction of Holmes is not accurate to Doyle's accounts, I can only remind them that after Twentieth Century Fox made the second of their popular Basil Rathbone Holmes movies, ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,"" in 1939, the studio changed the time setting thereafter to World War II and beyond, a far bigger revision of Doyle's original concept than anything in Ritchie's world.  Few people seemed to complain about it back then.

On the minus, side, though, viewers have to contend with several annoyances in this new film, ones so troublesome viewers may not be able to overcome them.  First, it seems as though Ritchie intentionally wanted more clever one-liners than he wanted actual dialogue.  The characters don't so much converse with one another as quibble, jest, and parry.  It is a comedy, after all, yet it would have been nice to hear a little more civilized conversation once in a while.  Second, and probably more vexing, is the fact that Holmes doesn't so much investigate the mystery through logical deduction as he does stumble (or blunder) upon the truth.  True, Holmes is still a shrewd guy and still ""sees everything"" in advance; it's just that Ritchie would rather have him dodging bullets than pursuing clues.  Third, Ritchie continues to use his trademark stop-action/slow-motion technique for having Holmes visualize an event before it takes place, fine once but not three or four times in a movie.  Fourth, Hans Zimmer's background score can be unrelenting.  His main theme music for Holmes is pleasant enough, but the loud, glaring accompaniment to every action scene is like the laugh track in a TV sitcom, in this case continuously telling us that this must be exciting because the music is so blaring.  Fortunately, watching at home one can turn the volume down to a more comfortable level than in a theater.

Finally, ""Sherlock Holmes:  A Game of Shadows"" may contain too much action and too many explosions for its own good.  One can enjoy an action movie best when it slows down a bit and lets us savor the activity and exploits.  This film moves along at so fast a pace, we hardly have a chance to catch our breath before something else blows up.  Frankly, I most cherished its quiet interludes, as few as they were.  Nevertheless, with concessions made, the movie makes for an enjoyable romp.

Video:
I liked what I saw.  The folks at Warner Bros. used a dual-layer BD50 and an MPEG-4/AVC codec to transfer the film as well as possible to Blu-ray, retaining its original 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  There's good detail and delineation in most scenes, and some minor softness in others.  Colors look natural, often deep and vibrant, and skin tones are realistic.  A very fine, very light film grain provides a lifelike texture to most of the shots.

Audio:
Once you adjust the volume to a level where the background music doesn't overwhelm you, the lossless 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio renders the soundtrack quite well.  The dynamic range is wide; impact is strong and taut; and bass is deep and solid.  The surrounds reproduce a variety of noises, from gunfire and explosions to a pleasantly ambient musical bloom.  True, the soundtrack can be raucous, but it goes with the territory; and in any case it can be tamed.

Extras:
The Blu-ray disc's primary bonus item is a Maximum Movie Mode:  ""Inside the Mind of Sherlock Holmes,"" wherein star Robert Downey, Jr. takes us behind the scenes during the film via personal inserts, picture-in-picture, storyboards, ""Focus Point"" segments, and the like.  Then, the disc makes the ""Focus Points"" available separately as little, three-to-seven minute featurettes.  After that, the disc offers access to a free ""Sherlock Holmes:  A Game of Shadows"" movie app for your tablet or mobile device, and supposedly you can go even further into the film, ""uncover, immerse and interact,"" with more behind-the-scenes material (although being as I am a Neanderthal without a tablet or mobile device, I didn't try it).

In addition, the disc provides thirteen scene selections; BD Live (guaranteed to slow down the disc's boot time); English, French, and Spanish spoken languages; French, Spanish, and other subtitles; and English captions for the hearing impaired.

Finally, because this is a Combo Pack, you get not only the Blu-ray disc but a standard-definition DVD, and an UltraViolet copy, the latter offer available until June 12, 2014.  The two discs come packaged in a flimsy double Eco-case, further enclosed in a handsomely embossed, light-cardboard slipcover.

Parting Thoughts:
Let me again put it this way:  If you liked the first Guy Ritchie ""Sherlock Holmes"" movie, you'll probably like this second one as well.  If you didn't like the first one, you'll no doubt hate this one.  It's just too different an interpretation of the iconic Holmes character to appeal to everyone.

With modern technologies special effects in this movie it is a pleasure to watch whether in Blu-ray or ordinary DVD.

If you doubt this read ""The Speckled Band."" When Holywood tried to update Sherlock Holmes in film they had the perfect Sherlock Holmes in Basil Rathbone and blew it by writing inane scripts and characterizing Dr. Watson as a bumbling idiot which does not represent the character Conan Doyle created. The Dr. Watson that the Jeremy Brit TV series  created was on the mark. I would recommend it to those who like the original Sherlock Holmes series written for the Strand Magazine from 1889 to 1898.

4437581,4,B004OC006Y,"The new take on the classic character of Sherlock Holmes from two years ago proved to be quite divisive.  Some fans of the original stories hated how much the character had changed.  Personally, I knew he was very different, but I loved the movie anyway.  So I was looking forward to Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows.

As Dr. Watson (Jude Law) prepares for his wedding, Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey, Jr.) has become obsessed with figuring out what Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris) is up to so he can stop him.  This obsession leads him to almost botch Watson's stage night.

But when Moriarty turns things person for both men, they must reteam to figure out his end game and find a way to stop him.  As they follow the trail all overEurope, can they do it?

So those who complained about the first movie will pretty much find the same things here.  The movie is as much about the action scenes as it is the mystery, and it takes the same liberties with the characters.  Since I'm not attached to the cannon versions, I don't mind these changes in the slightest.

They seem to have upped the comedy factor this time around.  The friends I saw it with and I were laughing so hard at various parts of the film.  Yes, there were the more serious moments, and the movie certainly earns it's PG-13 rating from the violence, but it's a lot of fun along the way.

As a mystery, the plot is weaker than it could have been.  As one friend pointed out, the story feels unfocused for much of the first half.  The movie is still entertaining, but it's not really until the second half that it appears we're actually going somewhere with all the action.  Again, the climax does explain some bits of the story, and it logically falls into place, but it's not as tight as it could have been.

Most of the action scenes are great and lots of fun.  Occasionally, they go overboard with the slow motion.  There's one scene in particular that turns into a mess instead of being interesting to watch.  The special effects, on the other hand, are seamless and compliment the story.

The acting is uniformly great.  Once again, Kelly Reilly is grossly underused as Mary Watson.  Jude Law and Robert Downey, Jr. have the perfectly chemistry to pull off the relationship between their characters.  I truly buy their deep friendship.  I'm not a big Downey fan, but he is great as Holmes with the right amount of swagger and the occasional bits of vulnerability.  While I've focused on the stars and one supporting character, the rest of the cast is great as well.

The climatic scene between Holmes and Moriarty is a wonderful piece of storytelling and filmmaking.  Don't worry, I'm not going to spoil anything.  But all I could do is sit back in awe at how they'd pulled off the perfect scene.  The acting between Downey and Jared Harris was perfect.

Even though this movie has some flaws, I think I enjoyed it more than the first one.  Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows once again takes liberties with the source materials, but it is lots of fun.",1432512000,,3029,4.539741219963031

If you like period pieces set in late 1800's Victorian England then it would be right of you to ponder your curiosity upon the exquisite story of this Sherlock Holmes. It has all the humor and wit and complimentary action to a very well scripted and acted movie.

Guy Ritchie outdone himself with directing this sequel. It is visually immersive and the characters are adorable if I may say so. This second film concentrated on the relationship between two friends and what bonds them together while on a mission to stop one of the western worlds most diabolical villains of it's time.

Noisy and too much emphasis on special effects and gratuitous violence for me to appreciate as much as I might have.

Even so it was not that awful for a couple hours of entertainment. I guess I just prefer a more traditional Holmes.

A sequel to an equally mediocre movie",1423612800,,429,4.4743589743589745

There's a pretty cool gypsy lady in this one, too. Mary Watson, nee Morstan, is simply perfect in an understated way, as she should be, in an expanded role. Mycroft, a bit more eccentric than Conan Doyle's version; kindly have Mrs. Watson knit you a dressing gown. There were a few violent scenes in here and a shot of non-Sherlock backside that was the perfect point to get up and go for cold beverages, but it didn't really disturb any of the adults and we're pretty conservative. We laughed pretty hard, and I'd watch it again. Robert Downey Jr. as Sherlock Holmes? I thought not, and I was wrong.

This is the sequel to ""Sherlock Holmes"". Robert Downey Jr. plays an intelligent and witty Sherlock. Jude law is ever the gentlemanly Dr. Watson. They make a great duo!
I don't like bad language and sex scenes in movies. This is free from all that but has some intense fighting scenes and violence which were very well executed. The plot is quite dark but again, well done.

4437973,4,B004OC006Y,"A Game of Shadows is clever, camp and sometimes downright silly - but in a madcap, always entertaining way. If you delight in a tongue-in-cheek sense of humour and madcap adventure, this is the ideal treat for you. It's a perfect film for the weekend or simply just to cheer yourself up after a hard day's work. The director Ritchie once again proves that, without the clutches of the curse that is known as Madonna, he can create fun, tremendously engaging films.

Problems with it? Sure: there's a couple of absurd scenes between Professor Moriarty, Holmes' evil nemesis, as he and Holmes, both with monstrous egos, do battle to praise the other, as if to say, I'm so brilliantly clever, I therefore can understand how brilliantly clever you are. No, YOU are clever. No, nay, YOU are more clever. And so it goes on. It's silly to the point of tosh, and absurdly camp. Still, it does succeed in driving home the extent that these two genuises are also strutting peacocks, albeit of the intellectual kind.

Also, while the action sequences are nothing less than impressive, sometimes they're so frantically paced and edited that they can be difficult to catch everything happening. You may find yourself pressing the rewind and pause button quite a few times to appreciate all that goes into the action.

As for acting? Downey is Downey and what he does best (but the same as in every other film); Law plays foil to Holmes superbly; Rachel McAdams is convincing and Watson's dog has more magic than Lazarus himself. And Professor Moriaty, as played by Lane Pryce is excellent - probably most familiar to us in his stiff upper lip English gentleman role as Lane Pryce in the Mad Men series - albeit he appears to be playing the Lane Pryce character again, but this time with a beard.

It's huge fun, visually gripping and has a rich plot. It's also faster than a crack-of-the-whip and Ritchie, known for his montage sequences and tremendous, sophisticated, clever fight scenes, doesn't disappoint here.

Highly recommended.",1409788800,,2022,4.832369942196531

This movie, to its even greater credit, took a more serious turn in the contents of its plot, giving a full course of historical ""meat"", if you will, along with the ""side"" of romance and oh-so decadent, sharp humor as the ever-prevailing ""desert"".
Delightful, I say!",1403481600,,519,4.6521739130434785

4438064,1,B004OC006Y,This was one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. The slow motion scenes were annoying and to many. I don't like how Sherlock Holmes is portrayed in this movie. I like RDJ but I'm not sure if he fit the part. I stuck through an hour and a half of this movie but it never got better. I had to turn it off. The sound is horrible. I had a hard time understanding RDJ.I don't know if it was the English accent or what but I eventually had to put the subtitles on. Bad story line and bad acting. The movie was also hard to follow at times. You really didn't care for any of the characters.(that includes Jude Law)To many special effects witch made it unbelievable. Not much humor. There was nothing that drew me in and wasn't entertaining. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it had good customes and a nice backdrop. On a scale 1-10. I give it a 3 or 3 and a half.,1402704000,,884,4.028409090909091

Also, it may be an issue with Amazon rather than the movie, but I couldn't always understand what the characters were saying. It would be nice if Amazon offered closed captioning like other streaming services do so I can read what the characters are saying when I can't hear or understand them.

As far as the story goes, I felt like the writers, directors, and actors just assumed this movie would be awesome and didn't really put as much effort into it as the last one.",1401753600,,623,4.464912280701754

4438074,2,B004OC006Y,"I like action films.  I like sci-fi and fantasy films.  I like ""whodunnits"".

This one I did not like at all.  It was just too-much, too over-the-top, and too-unbelievable.

The special effects were used too often and the dialogue degenerated down to the point of short statements to setup the next sight gag.  Blech.

We enjoyed the first Sherlock Holmes movie (with Downey).  This was a challenge, with the adults in the room hoping it would just end...

4438075,5,B004OC006Y,I've always been a fan of Robert Downey Jr. He is such a great actor. He plays his part of sherlock holmes really well. It is a awesome movie.,1399507200,,142,3.9310344827586206
4438076,5,B004OC006Y,"What is the actual difference between HD (high definition) and SD (standard definition)? HD has many more lines of pixels, top to bottom and as a result delivers finer images. HD's pixels range from 720p/1080p  lines. SD delivers 480 lines. Your PC must allow HD images if you select that feature.

I haven't enjoyed a movie so much in years. It is beautifully photographed, exciting, suspenseful and frequently hysterically funny. Robert Downey,  jr. as Sherlock Holmes delivers a performance you won't forget. He's sexy, funny, never wears a deer stalker but he steeples his hands and smokes a pipe in good old Conan Doyle style. Jude Law is a perfect Watson, although not as thick-headed as the original doctor, and he's brave and just as quick with his fists as Sherlock.  Jared Harris's not quite ugly face as Moriarty is sinister because he is not sinister but his eyes are cold as frozen fish and his gap-toothed smile contains no warmth. Stephen Fry as Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock's brother, is very much like Conan Doyle created him, being huge and corpulent  and so unconventional that at one point he enters a room stark naked.

A new character, not in the Canon is the gypsy fortune teller, Simza, played by Noomi Rapace. Dark-haired Noomi is actually Swedish, but she fits the role of the swarthy gypsy fortune teller, not a damsel in distress, exactly, she comes out swinging, but her brother is part of Professor Moriarty's crime syndicate and she is in danger of being liquidated by the Professor. Holmes and Watson are her knights in shining armor.

""A Game of Shadows"" is a great brew in all respects, and is right at home Victorian England,. It is a romp so full of action your eyeballs may get tired as they try to keep up. It's moving, too, you may even need a hanky close by. Don't miss this one! It's just plain fun!",1399507200,,1836,4.683229813664596

Got curious enough about Downey's eccentric growling-mumbling portrayal of Holmes to watch it again...and again to catch what I'd missed the other times (so maybe I'm a little slow but hey...) Brilliant, subtle Brit-style wit, the writing/dialogue had me laughing as I caught puns and asides missed in previous viewings. And maybe I'm simple, but the plot of this movie was complex and very smartly done. Loved Mary and Watson's subplot and the development of characters such as Holmes fairy-nudist bro, the gypsy woman so well done by Noomi Rapace, the Evil Moriarty (even nastier than first thought)

It took a bit, but now...this is my favorite movie in this genre. Wait...it's the ONLY movie of its kind that I actually kind of, well, love.",1397001600,,863,4.71523178807947

I'm amazed with the consistency between this movie and the first; both have the same elements woven into two entirely different types of plots, yet they manage to be remarkably similar in style and feel. Always dark, but with subtle and sometimes dry humor thrown in, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is a film that tugs at our senses and doesn't let go. One thing that really stands out in these movies is its speed; quick shots abound, as there seems to be a conscious attempt to appeal to a younger audience. This Sherlock series doesn't possess the passivity that one would expect, yet this faster pace seems to work. Robert Downey Jr. does a stellar job once again, as he's perfect for the role of Sherlock. The blu-ray version is superb, though not needed to capture this movie's essence.

4438108,3,B004OC006Y,"Striking a near-perfect balance between grit and sensationalism, it takes viewers through a world marked by violence, double-dealing, and racial division, with an emphasis on the ambiguous morality and personal and familial baggage that come with a life lived between the straight world and the criminal one. The machinations of the characters and the twists of the plot are almost operatic, but the show remains rooted in the harsh realities of gangland.

The villain, Moriarty, was an old geezer who lacked the subtle terror manifested by the main villain in the first ""Sherlock Holmes"". The action scenes showing the Germans trying to kill Holmes, Watson, and the gypsy didn't make sense (why were they trying to kill them?), but perhaps they were paid by Moriarty to kill the heroes in this movie, I'm guessing? Some other adjectives to describe ""Sherlock Holmes: A game of shadows"" are: Pathetic, boring, vapid, unimaginative, wasteful, etc. As Watson would say, ""No s*** Sherlock."" Hahaha... And as Sherlock would retort ""Keep digging or searching for a movie worth watching instead of this piece of garbage.""

Bottom line: Trust me when I say that this sequel was a total waste of time with not character development and a story that just failed to entertain (I do not understand the 4 and 5 stars that several reviewers gave this pathetic sequel).",1393632000,,1026,4.965116279069767

In other words the movie is fine on its own and only is you compare to the first can nitpicks be found.

When you have Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law as Holmes and Watson there is a good base right off the bat and they carry on in the relationship and bring the charactors to life.  The rest of the cast was also very solid.

4438258,4,B004OC006Y,"I really enjoyed the 2009 Sherlock Holmes movie a lot more than I expected. It managed to combine style and substance to produce a very enjoyable two hours of entertainment.  Robert Downey Jr. is certainly not a traditional Holmes with pipe and deerstalker hat and his accent is a bit forced but he has such a wonderful screen presence that I didn't really care that it departed so much from the literary character. Jude Law, likewise, is a new take on Watson but he pairs up very well with Downey. Unfortunately the follow up film does not reach that heights of the first film and feels like a retread with less heart.

One of the parts of the first film I enjoyed was how Holmes could use his powers of deduction even in fights and was shown carefully analyzing his situation in a split second. That was cool. In the sequel however he has practically become a super hero able to fight four armed men single handedly or take on a skilled assassin with stunning acrobatics. I overlooked the physicality of Holmes in the first movie but for me the second film crossed a threshold that it should not have crossed. There were several awesome action set pieces in the first film most notably the one with the 7 foot Dredger at the boat factory and the fight on the Tower Bridge. A Game of Shadows certainly has action but it feels less inspired and more cartoonish. Holmes ability to anticipate future events has gone well beyond the point of believable and his and Watson's luck at avoiding physical damage seems like something from the latest Indiana Jones movie. At least the movie improves as it goes with the last quarter of the movie having the most memorable action in the film and one thing I can't say is that it doesn't look pretty and stylish. This is a good looking film.

I was looking forward to the inclusion of Professor Moriarty in this film but was initially disappointed. Jared Harris does not have much of a look to him and the introduction of the Professor felt uninspired compared to his very cool brief appearance in the first film. As the film progressed I found myself increasingly appreciating Harris's Moriarty and by the end was completely sold. Introducing Moriarty with no fanfare was actually quite clever. What better place for the ""Napoleon of Crime"" to hide than in plain sight. The final confrontation between Holmes and Moriarty was the highlight of the film for me as it should be. There are several interactions between Holmes and Moriarty and Harris manages to convey such a quiet indifference that it makes Moriarty all the more menacing.

Guy Ritchie has produced a pair of visually amazing films and the reproduction of Victorian Europe is just amazing. This is in no way a bad film but it just doesn't measure up to the first film. The balance of style and substance seems to have gone a bit off kilter leaning towards style. I look forward to the third movie but my expectations will be tempered.",1389744000,,2936,4.629558541266794

(Even my 12-yo points out that the heavy weaponry featured in this movie is wrong for this period; still, he looooves this movie and is ready to overlook this fact.)

For the classic pipe smoking deerhunter wearing Sherlock I still prefer Basil Rathbone.

4438315,5,B004OC006Y,"Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows picks up where the first film left off with Dr. Watson getting married and Professor Moriarty becoming a bigger threat. The film has just as much action and humor as Guy Ritchie's 2009 film. Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law fill the roles of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson brilliantly. They play off each other marvelously.

(spoilers below)

A Game of Shadows provides Professor Moriarty with a face - Jared Harris, who has a cool ruthlessness about him. He displays his cruelty early in the film when he poisons Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams). Joining the cast is Stephen Fry, playing Sherlock's brother Mycroft superbly. Mr. Fry adds his own dry humor to the story and has a remarkable scene with the newly rescued Mrs. Watson (Kelly Reilly) where he appears in the nude. Noomi Rapace (well known from the Swedish ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" films) plays a gypsy whose brother has been recruited by Moriarty for an unknown purpose.

(end spoilers)

The production wonderfully brings to life 1890's London and Paris with superb costume designs. Readers of the Sherlock Holms stories and novels will probably have some concerns about the authenticity of the films. Of course, this is not the first time that films have stretched the characters into stories that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle never had in mind, such as some of the Basil Rathbone/ Nigel Bruce films (""Sherlock Holmes in Washington"" comes to mind). As a film, A Game of Shadows is highly entertaining while preserving the essential elements of the characters.

4438343,5,B004OC006Y,"While only loosely based on the Holmes canon this film is quite faithful to its spirit. Holmes and Moriarty are doppelgangers and throughout the film one feels that one cannot exist without the other and the climax will be devastating to both. It seems to play out that way but I won't spoil it.

There is another subtext throughout the film that was not, and indeed could not be, present in Doyle's stories. There is a definite undercurrent that the 19th century and the Victorian era is coming to an end and that we are seeing a glimpse of the century to come. While watching Holmes and Watson thwart Moriarty the viewer is left with the impression that the final victory might have been Moriarty's. While usually not a fan of projecting modern perspectives back into an historical setting here it seems to have been handled just right.

The film is highly recommended. I think director Ritchie's Holmes movies are a perfect blend of respectful reverence for Doyle's stories and modern storytelling trends with their emphasis on fast paced, over the top action and special effects.",1383004800,,1083,4.817204301075269

4438347,5,B004OC006Y,"I've recently been on a Robert Downey Jr. Kick and realized that I had the first film in the series, but not the second one.  This one was a bit difficult to find for me.  But that doesn't matter, I have it now, after getting an acceptable copy from a reputable seller here on Amazon.  Guy Richie directs and in typical style he makes a lot of use of slow motion action sequences, upside-down cameras, etc.  So what you end up with is an entertaining, action packed, art film, with a bit of humor thrown in.  It is also rather fast-paced.  But in my opinion it was very well done.  I also think the second one was a bit better than the first, but that is only my opinion.

In this film we are introduced to Sherlock Holmes' brother and see some interesting,and occasionally hilarious disguises.  Spoiler alert: Robert Downey Jr.is  in drag in one scene.  Nuff said.

This has nothing really to do with the movie but I enjoy seeing films that were either filmed in, or partially filmed in London...seeing how they depict London in 1891, compared to now (I have been there and like seeing places I have been in films) so it helps to bring the film to life for me, because, being familiar with the landscape helps me to immerse me into the story,  It at least added to my enjoyment of the film anyway.  So I thought I would throw that in there as a little side note.

All in all, it's full of action and humor.  This is a must have for the RDJ or Jude Law fans out there.",1382054400,2,1468,4.245487364620939

4438350,5,B004OC006Y,"I wasn't expecting much from the movie because the books hadn't excited me that much. But i was surprised. This movie has a great story line, great actors who did their job and know how to play their characters, hilarious lines, and great action sequences.
  Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law have amazing chemistry that puts the audience on their seats waiting to see what they do next. Jude Law, who plays Dr. Watson,looks out for Sherlock Holmes, played by Robert Downey Jr. Yet at the same time, Robert Downey Jr. is the leader of the two. Sherlock Holmes is eccentric, quirky, weird, yet brilliant. Dr. Watson is almost the opposite of that, down to earth, realistic, and sensible. It is fascinating to see the relationship of these two paradoxical people who form the greatest detective pair of all time.
  This movie is absolutely one of the most funny movies I have ever seen. We've all seen Robert Downey Jr. do his thing in Avengers and Iron man and he brings the same type of hilarity into this movie. His sarcasm, irony and what ever else he adds to it is absolutely priceless. And contrast that with Dr. Watsons stoicism and you get unendless humor.
  This movie is also pure action. They have bombs exploding everywhere. Trees blowing up, canon firing, and gunfire through the whole thing. Not only do you have strong action, but you also have more subtly action such as poison, disguises, and brilliance. And most of the action is clean, which means no gore. The action in this movie is not tension filled action, the comedy plays into the action in an intriguing way which makes the movie light hearted, yet serious.
  Some people claim that Robert Downey Jr. plays Sherlock Holmes in a way that he shouldn't be played. But I disagree. True, he may not play the Sherlock Holmes that we all read about but should he? If Robert Downey Jr. played that Sherlock Holmes I think that the movie would be very boring. Robert Downey Jr. adds a twist to Sherlock Holmes that cannot be paralled in the movie industry.
  Buy the movie or rent it from the library to see if this movie is really as good as I claim it to be. Enjoy!",1381190400,,2130,4.552356020942408

4438358,5,B004OC006Y,"With some fine writing and directing for the occasion, Downey and Company give us  a second feast of a Holmes for the contemporary viewer. It should be added that this in no way overshadows the notable Basil Rathbone series of my generation ( I was already a regular movie-goer when Rathbone and Bruce took over the franchise assisted in the first production by Ida Lupino, among others.  The big difference to date in comparing them is that after the second or third production, the older series was shifted to ""B"" film status and no longer had first rate directors, writers or actors, aside from R&B. At any rate, this is a very different Holmes and has earned the right to be judged on its own merits, in terms of which, I think, it gets credit for a changed Holmesian character without, in any way, undermining the Holmes of the century and some odd decades preceding it. The most recent major Holmes presence, the late Jeremy Brett in an outstanding BBC series ended with his death, shows that the traditional characterizations can co-exist with serious contemporary efforts. ( One might enjoy the comic or psychiatric utilization of the Holmes ethos, but those have no impact on the main traditions.)
Robert Downey, Jr.  remains the acting spark which vitalizes the entire quite well-chosen cast. It is quite a  pleasure to see him in action. The supporting cast, as I have pointed out, deserves much credit as well.
All in all, this should be satisfactory viewing for most general viewers as well as action fans. As I have pointed out, I think that even traditionalist Holmesians may find this an admirable change of pace.",1380326400,,1629,4.786476868327402

Downey and Law are both wonderful in their roles and bring a chemistry of realistic friendship rarely seen in movies. They are at once stoically caring of each other and antagonistic. The writing, the acting, the cast, the settings are all fantastic.

4438362,4,B004OC006Y,"Clever throughout and charming in places, but overly frantic.  Jude Law as a bemused Watson to Robert Downey Jr.'s frantic Holmes continues to provide an effective balance. Stephen Fry as Mycroft and the underrated Kelly Reilly as Mary added a welcome touch.

That said, it is NOT as tightly scripted as the original, and the action sequences are more ""cartooney"" and frantic.  I WAS glad to see Holmes confront his nemesis, though - that's a welcome change from so many series that never get to that point.

If you haven't seen either of these, see the first one first.  For one thing it's a better movie and a better introduction to the core characters.

The plot contains steady, non-stop action and yet, the watcher is really impressed with the complexity of the plan and Sherlock's ability to see into Moriarty's head. But our hero is not perfect ( that makes him more believable as a character) and Sherlock makes a mistake which allows for a bombing to kill some very important people of the time.  We see Sherlock's more human side as he tries to help Mary, Dr. Holmes new wife, trust him...by throwing her off a train!  Hmmmm....  The characters are developed enough to enjoy this fast paced and intellectually stimulating movie and I can't wait for them to make this a trilogy!

Yes, these moments are actually kind of funny, but activism-infused media is actually really not.

British culture has far more depth than the Gay/Straight dichotomy that we love to parade around [literally] here in the US, and I found it offensive that Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes are being made into LGBT champions: If you want equality, then don't draw so much attention to the controversy [which actually never appears in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's writing of this character, BTW] and just make Holmes an interesting character for his attributes OTHER than sexual orientation. He SHOULD be a character who can be admired by anyone, of any orientation. THAT is equality.

4438411,5,B004OC006Y,Great retelling of Sherlock Holmes.  Downey captures his addictive and manic side better then all who came before him in this character.  Channeling?  Mayhaps  but what a way to direct abhorrent energy!  I thought he was skirting the rough edge of reality when he did Chaplin.  So glad he has found characters like Holms and Stark to showcase his dark creative passenger and did not let it destroy him.  The man is naked when he is acting. How he has the courage to do this ...... I cannot imagine but what a thrill to watch! This is the keyed up energy I found in Sherlock when I first read him & now it is on the screen.

4438413,5,B004OC006Y,This is a great movie.  I have the first Sherlock Holmes staring Robert Downey Jr. and needed to get the second.  It arrived relatively soon after ordering and the price was reasonable.  Truly a god purchase for me.,1373587200,,215,4.605263157894737
4438414,4,B004OC006Y,"First, let me just say, I love the subtitle. I tend to be fond of subtitles, but A Game of Shadows is a great title or subtitle. I wish I'd thought of it.

Second, I'm a big fan of Sherlock Holmes. I've read (and own) all of the Holmes stories, so, when I say I like Holmes, it's not just some vague notion of Holmes formed when I was a kid from watching movies and television shows about Sherlock.

Having said that, Guy Ritchie has done an excellent job of adapting the stories into movie format. There have, of course, been some changes (like with Sherlock's fastidiousness), but, overall, he kept all the fundamentals of Holmes and has made a faithful adaptation rather than just making some detective story and calling the character Sherlock as in many of the previous incarnations of Holmes.

Of course, the acting by Robert Downey, Jr. is superb. Looking at these movies through a James Bond lens, I would say that Downey is the Sean Connery of Sherlock Holmes. He's more rugged and less refined. More of a brawler than a fencer, which, actually, also holds true to the character; although, I'd be interested in seeing someone do a Roger Moore version who is more of the gentleman and fencer. This also falls within the realm of Holmes. Okay, so, maybe Pierce Brosnan for those of you out there hating on Roger (but I grew up with Moore Bond films, and I love them most). However, I can't actually think of anyone that would be better at Holmes than Downey has been.

Add Jude Law to that, and you have a pretty perfect team. I'm not a huge Jude Law fan. Not that I dislike him, but I think he often comes off the same from movie to movie. However, I think he's been the perfect pairing for Downey in these movies. Their combination is... well, they make an excellent team.

I've heard a lot of mutterings about how this one wasn't as good as the first, but I don't know that I can agree with that. Sure, they've removed the romantic element (and I was sorry to see Rachel McAdams go), but, really, the romantic element is not exactly appropriate as an ongoing thing in Sherlock Holmes. In almost all ways, Holmes is above romance. Adler was the only woman Holmes was ever interested in even remotely and that was because she bested him. They do add the tension of Watson's wife to the mix, and I think that serves adequately as a substitute for any romance for Holmes. His romance is with ""the game.""

Jared Harris was an excellent choice for Moriarty. He's not someone I would have thought of, but he was great. Quiet and under spoken, rather like a spider. He was quite chilling.

If you saw the first Holmes with Downey and liked it, this one is definitely worth seeing. For those of you that haven't read Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, be aware that many of the smaller details are actually from the stories and not just inventions for the movies. Those kinds of things being included made these movies a very enjoyable experience for me. If you haven't read Doyle, you should.

But don't spend a lot of time looking for Moriarty. He's really only in two of the stories and was an invention by Doyle to provide an adequate nemesis for Holmes in order to kill him off. Which he did. And, then, brought him back later because of public demand. See that thing with bowing to public pressure in writing goes back a long way.",1373500800,2,3325,4.457236842105263

4438450,5,B004OC006Y,"""Sherlock Holmes: A Game Of Shadows"" is great! This is how the story goes: Sherlock Holmes has always been the smartest man in the room... until now. There is a new criminal mastermind at large - Professor Moriarty - and not only is he Holmes' intellectual equal, but his capacity for evil, coupled with a complete lack of conscience, may actually give him an advantage over the renowned detective. Holmes' investigation into Moriarty's plot becomes ever more dangerous as it leads him and Watson out of London and across Europe, to France, Germany and finally to Switzerland. But the cunning Moriarty is always one step ahead as he spins a web of death and destruction - all part of a greater plan that, if he succeeds, will change the course of history.

The cast led by Robert Downey, Jr. (as Sherlock Holmes) & Jude Law (as Watson) is great. The directing by Guy Ritchie is great. The screenplay (based on stories by Arthur Conan Doyle) by Michele & Kieran Mulroney is great.

The music by Hans Zimmer is great. The cinematography by Philippe Rousselot is great. The film editing by James Herbert is great. The casting by Reg Poerscout-Edgerton is great. The production design by Sarah Greenwood is great. The art direction by Netty Chapman, James Foster, Nick Gottschalk, Matthew Gray & Niall Moroney is great. The set decoration by Alison Harvey & Katie Spencer is great. The costume design by Jenny Beavan is great. The visual effects & make-up effects are great.

This is a great sequel to ""Sherlock Holmes"" that is entertaining and fast-paced. It is also a well-made, action-packed movie, that keeps your mind thinking and your heart racing at the same time. Robert Downey, Jr. & Jude Law are terrific together, as usual. This is one of the best movies of the holiday season, so far.",1369526400,,1792,4.774193548387097
4438451,2,B004OC006Y,"I enjoyed the first Sherlock Holmes. It felt fresh and Robert Downey Jr. was masterful as the clever, over-the-top detective. But Game of Shadows feels hollow and dull. Where is the mystery? Suspense? The banter between Holmes and Watson? It just feels void of anything new and refreshing.

It has its moments, and of course they are when both Jude Law and Downey Jr. are on screen together. They make a great pair but I thought their relationship would be more fleshed out here. We got a nice glimpse of it in the first movie and I was left wanting more. Here, not much happens in terms of evolving their characters. It feels emotionless, even during a moment that should be full of it. Very disappointing.

Moriarty has to be one of the most boring villains ever. He's trying to make the most of his role, but the script and plot is so lacking, there's almost no point. Sherlock doesn't even have much of a chance to show off his powers of deduction, or any of his skills actually. No violin plucking, no wit, just a couple of fight scenes.

I don't know what happened to this movie but if they ever intend to make a third I hope they stick to the source material or at least try to actually invent a plot.

The essence of Sherlock Holmes is there with the scientific investigation, the attention to the details around him, and the use of disguises to sneak around looking for clues or getting surveillance. What I think is remarkable is that these techniques were considered new and innovative in the time the books were originally written and a lot of police departments in those days relied heavily on witnesses instead of any other evidence. I am disappointed that the movie had such a sense of finality to it.

We happened to be in her home town visiting family at the time so she was showing me around and telling me about stuff, so we were having fun. Then when we watched the movie we were riveted the whole time.

4438504,3,B004OC006Y,"The movie was packed with action and interesting effects that magnify Holmes' abilities.  It had several fun moments.  It was irreverent, though, to the memory of the original works, in my opinion.  One instance was Holmes' rancorous relationship with the motherly Mrs. Hudson, who Doyle was very respectful to.  Also, in the stories, Irene Adler was admired by Holmes, but in the movie she is something of a call-girl love interest - quite a contrast to the finely adjusted temperament of the Holmes in literature.  Both Holmes and Watson are messy and careless in dress and conduct, quite a departure from the literary works.

Despite my criticism, I do understand that this was an effort to bring Holmes to the attention of a new, younger audience, and employing all the drama and humor possible to make it attractive.  It was no doubt a purposeful departure from tradition for that reason.  Perhaps I cannot be pleased by a modern Holmes.",1365206400,,942,4.880503144654088

The movie itself was about on the same level as the first. My ex-husband is a Holmes fanatic and he hated it because it (as well as the first movie) strayed very far from the original stories in both content and the appearances of the settings and actors, but I enjoyed them both.

However, the second in the series, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, was devoid of the qualities of the original.  Most of the qualities of the first film were missing.  It was just a noisy, fast, shoot-em-up adventure geared toward adolescent boys.  The actors did a fairly good job with a pretty bad script.

Both Robert Downey Jr. and his co-star, bring their A-game actor personnas here.
The script writer and Direction and the frequent slow-motion pre-show of a scene or group of scenes are all BRILLIANT and really increased the entertainment value that makes this a REALLY GOOD SHOW in my humble opinion.
What is it about a Smart-Ass, like the Holmes charactor that we both love and hate?  Admire and Loathe, perhaps are better descriptive word choices.
If I had a friend like Holmes, as played by Robert Downey, Jr.  I would frequently find myself wanting to run out of the room with him and slam the door while exitting;  or just SLAP him on the back of his head!  Hahahaha!!!

I in particular thought Jeremy Brett was the best with Benedict Cumberbach following in a very close 2nd place. Johnny Miller is good but I think the story lost a litle of it's storyline when they moved him to NYC. Sherlock takes an actor with quite a lot of finesse, who can play the several sides of sherlock.

4438563,5,B004OC006Y,"Like its predecessor, ""Sherlock Holmes,"" with many of the same actors, this film brings another era to life as if it were the present day. Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law's Holmes and Watson are a wonderful pair, bickering their way through dangerous adventures, and the addition of Stephen Fry as Holmes' ""smarter brother"" is delicious as well.

Who knew that Sherlock Holmes was an action hero, not just an armchair philosopher? The folks who read the original stories, and didn't just watch the older films, that's who.",1361836800,,522,4.931818181818182
4438564,4,B004OC006Y,"A well-done follow up to the first movie.  This was a Christmas gift for my father who really enjoyed this series.

4438573,5,B004OC006Y,I love the movie. Sequels to original movies are usually bad but it is not the case with this one. Robert Downey Jr. was once again great as Sherlock Holmes and Jule Law was wonderful in the role of Watson. The plot was believable and it was filled with great action scenes.,1361318400,,274,4.288461538461538
4438574,5,B004OC006Y,"I loved the first Sherlock Holmes, and this worthy sequel is no different. The absolutely lovable and brilliant portrayals of the dynamic crime fighting duo of Holmes and Watson, played by Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law, completely draw you in to the world of the story. The comedy is hysterical, well written, and well timed, the action is top notch, and the story surprisingly true to the beloved spirit of Sherlock Holmes. I loved it.

4438575,3,B004OC006Y,"It's always hard to review a movie, since everyone's taste is different.

I got this streaming version when I bought the physical blu-ray and decided to give it a go.

The streaming experience was very good. High-quality picture and sound, easily accessible and fast ""download""-time (no buffering, but again, this might change depending on your internet speeds).

So the product itself is good, I can't complain about that.

The movie on the other hand was quite meh. You might be wondering what ""meh"" means, but it's just that. It's not no, it's not yes, it's like in between, it's alright.

I really enjoyed the first movie in this series and did have some expectations to this, however they weren't met. I feel it's the same movie in a lot of aspects, and therefore I got the feeling that I'd seen it before. Robert Downey Jr is a good actor, but I'm getting a bit tired of him to be honest. He's the same character in all his movies; the cocky, knowitall, charming, ""sarcasticly"" witty guy.

I wouldn't really recommend it, but I'm not gonna say ""don't watch it"" either. It's all up to you obviously. It's entertainment, but not a good movie.",1361232000,,1146,4.648514851485149

4438580,5,B004OC006Y,Downy and Jude Law are a wonderful pairing as Holmes and Watson.  Killed off Irene Addler (Rachel Adams) too soon she was a very good foil for Holmes.  The casting of these is really masterful I hope that the studio can coax these folks together again.  Probably killed off Moriarty too soon,1361059200,,291,4.5576923076923075

I think the best modern version of the Watson and Holmes adventures is ""A Seven Percent Solution"". I also recommed ""Young Sherlock Holmes"". Although not for the very young amoung us.

The video qualilty in ""A game of Shadows"" was very good.

The gritty look at the genius and neurosis of Holmes makes him more human than other versions of this complex character.  If you have the peculiar luck or misfortune to have a genius friend, particularly one you can stand to hang out with or with luck, relate to, you will recognize how spot on he is done.  With the addition of Professor Moriarty it is brilliant to see them fight back in forth without throwing a punch, the chess analogy is used very well to show them in a high stakes contest and treat it like a game.",1360022400,,675,4.217054263565892

4438658,5,B004OC006Y,Being an old Sherlock watcher from way back to early TV and black and white I love the new spin put on an old story.  Of course my favorite Sherlock was Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as Watson but this pair of charachters match my vision of the pair.  Good exciting fantasy drama to watch sitting at the edge of your seat.  Pop the popcorn pour your drink before sliding the disc into the player becasue you do not want to miss any of the details.  Enjoyed it thourghly!!!!,1358726400,,474,4.292134831460674
4438659,1,B004OC006Y,"Having watched the first one of these two versions of SH, and finding the first one absolutely terrible, slow, and mind numbing...all the reviews pointed to this one being far better.  Nope....not so.  As a matter of fact, this one is worse.  The story is all over the place and simply makes no sense.  The pace is plodding and just so bad I could not sit through the entire film...made it about 1 hour 15 minutes before I gave up.  Even if it got better, I really don't care.  The first half was that much of a disaster....why bother?  Save your money and go to the library to get this if you must...which is what I did so I don't feel bad about wasting real cash here.  The quality was great, sound quality was great and colors just fine....ruined by a terrible script, bad directing and boring story.",1358640000,,803,4.378378378378378

4438664,5,B004OC006Y,It is a very good movie and showed up right on time for xmas. My husband has the first one and I almost get him this because everywhere else that I looked it was to expensive. But I knew I could count on amazon.com not to let me down so thanks,1358553600,,243,3.784313725490196
4438665,1,B004OC006Y,The movie is awesome! BUT do not buy this if you really want a digital copy to download. You won't get one. You have to register with Flixster (which I did not want to do) only to find out all I can do is stream it. That is not what I ordered. So I will watch it on the disc but will not buy Warner Brothers again. Very sad.,1358553600,,324,3.710144927536232

4438672,4,B004OC006Y,"Churned-out cash in sequel, right? Nah, it's pretty good. Overlong maybe, and somewhat disjointed. But it's smarter than you'd think. And trying to figure out just how RDJ manages to convince us he is anyway near appropriate casting for this part continues to be half the fun.

Rachel McAdams is in it just long enough to make you wonder why she wasn't in the whole darn thing. Jude Law is...well, he's in this movie. Maybe they'll make better use of both of them in the next one.

That I just typed that last sentence is this movie's biggest success. Fun. Enough.",1358380800,,564,4.574257425742574
4438673,3,B004OC006Y,"I am on vacation and I have the downloaded Ultraviolet copy for this movie on Flixster. (Since I am on vacation, I am typing this on my iPhone).
I cannot watch the Ultraviolet copy of ""A Game of Shadows"" on my wi-fi iPad offline.
On vacation with no Internet I cannot see my movies on Flixster. So, I can't play them. Very frustrating.

The film itself is enjoyable. That's why I wanted to watch it.

Edit 1/18/13: I updated the Flixster App (when I was briefly at a place that had wi-fi) and my two movies are now visible in the program. But ""A Game of Shadows"" can't be played because it is ""processing"", meaning it needs a wi-fi connection. So, I won't be seeing the film on this vacation.
- And I sent a message to Flixster support about the problem. There has been no helpful response for several hours.
* Poor customer service along with poorly designed software.
There should have been an iTunes Digital Copy option with this movie.",1358294400,,939,4.453488372093023

4438675,4,B004OC006Y,Downing Jr. and Law work amazingly well as Sherlock and Watson. These two actors make the movie worth watching. A much better movie than the first.,1358294400,,147,4.6923076923076925

If you've seen the first Sherlock Holmes of this particular series, then you may have been a little disappointed by the first one. I was; I thought it moved too slow and the character development, aside from Sherlock, was lacking.

No complaints for any of the above in this new movie. The plot moves quickly and maintains interest throughout the entire film. If you like watching movies where you think you can predict the ending and then end up being completely wrong, this is the movie for you.",1358035200,,518,4.7444444444444445
4438681,4,B004OC006Y,"Watching this you wonder where it's going, and it does drag in bits, but the payoff is pretty satisfying. All in all a good sequel and the introduction of Jared Harris (the English guy in ""Mad Men"") as Moriarity is brilliant casting.

The extras are worth getting the DVD for. They're all short and sweet but offer great insight into the Holmes-Watson relationship, the use of chess onscreen and off-, and a breakdown of the Holmes-a-vision special effects.",1358035200,2,457,4.858974358974359
4438682,5,B004OC006Y,A good watch. Would recommend to one and all. Especially good for longtime Sherlock Holmes fans who always wished someone would make a film deserving of the World's Greatest Detective.,1358035200,,184,5.166666666666667
4438683,4,B004OC006Y,Robert Downey Jr. does an amazing job of capturing the nuances of the quirky Sherlock Holmes character and he plays it to perfection. I truly enjoyed the fun story line and recommend this movie.,1358035200,,194,4.735294117647059

4438696,4,B004OC006Y,"""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" is an excellent and fun sequel to 2009 film, and well worth it. Though, I do not recommend watching it without watching the first one as I've found the first film to be quite a ""warming up"" to Robert Downey, Jr. as Sherlock Holmes. It was ""entertaining"" to watch him in this role and I have great respect for him as an actor.

This film is a story of Holmes and Watson joining forces once again to outwit their most cunning and dangerous adversary, Professor James Moriarty. There were scenes that are surprisingly interesting and others can be quite dull. But, it's the story itself that implored my curiosity to read Conan Doyle's short story ""The Final Problem"", where the film was influenced by.

Anyway, it's an enjoyable film.",1357776000,2,769,4.688888888888889

Holmes is an erudite British detective, not a comic-book super-hero who always has a 3-day growth of beard.  A terrible waste of some otherwise decent costumes and sets. They basically took a cheezy Kung Fu action movie, changed the name of the character to Holmes and set it in turn-of-the-century England.  Take away the scenery and make Sylvester Stallone the lead and you have a low-budget shoot-em-up action movie.  Zero stars.  And, subtract a few more stars for the total disrespect of a classic character.",1357344000,10,658,4.882882882882883

Professor Moriarty, Holmes' greatest foe, is behind it all, and while there are some pretty awesome moments in this film, overall it just feels like it's missing the humanity the first one achieved so well.  This one is more about elaborate fight scenes and action sequences and explosions, and at times Holmes here comes off almost more annoying/grating than ever in the first.  Not a bad film certainly, but just lackluster compared to its predecessor.",1356912000,,649,5.10377358490566

As for the movie itself, I thought the first movie ended on a mostly serious, and somewhat grim note with a lead up to what was supposed to be an epic showdown in the second film. But upon starting the 2nd movie the antagonist is no longer in the shadows so to speak, and the movie takes a turn for the comedic. It feels as though things are a little too light hearted at times, even though some very serious things are going on, and just comes off a bit disjointed for that reason. There are a few breathtaking action moments but a lot of the appeal and witty charm of the first movie seems to be lost here for some reason that I can't put my finger on. I would still recommend it, just be aware that it drags in the middle, but the showdown ultimately is worth it and has a very satisfying and smart conclusion

Worth a watch, and at this price worth a buy as well. Doesn't live up to the first movie, but I do hope there is a third",1356652800,,1171,4.109170305676856

This relatively straightforward plot-line provides the pretext for a series of rip-roaring adventures on trains, in deserted factories, at an ambassadors' ball and culminating in a cliff-hanging ending over the Reichenbach Falls.  The script is engagingly tongue-in-cheek, with Robert Downey jr's Holmes and Jude Law's Watson forming an ideal partnership: Watson always wants to branch out on his own but finds himself unable to,  Jared Harris makes a plausible villain, his smooth vowels contrasting with Holmes' precise, clipped method of delivery.

My only complaint, and it has nothing to do with the content or the producers, is that the HD version buffered A LOT while streaming - which is Amazon's fault. (We have 7+ Mbps wifi, which works fine with all other HD streaming services).

Sherlock Holmes 2 is a must see film, even with the Amazon HD buffering issues(though you might try the non-HD version instead)

4438834,2,B004OC006Y,"I loved the first Guy Ritchie Sherlock, and I had high hopes for this.

Alas, no luck.

I knew something was wrong when the best character--Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams)--was killed right off the bat.

And it just got worse from there.

The villain, Moriarty, is simply dull.  He may do bad things, but he is so remote from them and so professorially boring, that it's hard to work up any hatred.  He is like everyone's blandest, chalky teacher: eminently forgettable.

Watson (Jude Law) has a stronger part, but it's all wasted on weak jokes about Sherlock's competition with Watson's new wife.  The bromance is telegraphed in every scene and overdone.

Some of the better characters--Watson's wife (Kelly Reilly), Lestrade (Eddie Marsan), the gypsy Sim (Noomi Rapace)--either scarcely appear or have nothing useful to do with the plot.  Even Sherlock's brother (Stephen Frye) can't make anything of his pointless role.

The problem is the writing.  The plot is opaque and dull.  The dialogue wavers from pedestrian and unmemorable to stilted and unfunny.

Even Robert Downey, Jr.--one of the best actors in the world--can't make anything of his part, and doesn't really act.  He is reduced to merely striking poses.

An utter waste of wonderful people on a bland, frantic, unexciting mess.

4438840,5,B004OC006Y,This sequel is even better than the first one.  Very intense and the directors style is most unique. Watch it over and over.,1356307200,,124,4.391304347826087
4438841,1,B004OC006Y,"terrible movie.  I do not recommend.  I like some awful stuff, but this is just ridiculous. I like ""entertaining"" movies... I consider them different from ""Good"" movies...this was neither... just bad bad bad.",1356220800,2,208,5.2727272727272725
4438842,5,B004OC006Y,"We didn't think that a sequel to the first Sherlock Holmes videoi would be as good, but A Game of Shadows was great, maybe even better than the first one! A great addition to our home collection. It was surprisingly clean and suitable for nearly all ages, although the little ones might be disturbed at some of Moriarity's cruelty.",1356220800,,331,4.627118644067797
4438843,5,B004OC006Y,Christmas gift and exactly what I thought the person on my list would like.  Came in a timely manner and pretty sure the gift was well received.,1356220800,,144,4.333333333333333

4438845,5,B004OC006Y,It's a good movie. Well worth the money spent. If you enjoy mysteries then either rent or buy this movie.,1356220800,,105,4.3
4438846,5,B004OC006Y,The story line is good. The acting is great. Guy Richie has a good sense when he made the first Sherlock Holmes and it follows in this one too,1356220800,,142,3.9310344827586206
4438847,5,B004OC006Y,"Great entertainment , I'm big fan of Sherlock Holmes and this is definitely different take on Sherlock, keeps you entertained through the whole movie",1356220800,,149,5.25

4438854,4,B004OC006Y,"Sequels are rarely better than the original, but this is satisfactory. Who would of thought the same actor who plays a sleazy tabloid journalist in Mr. Deeds could do so well as the calculating Professor Moriarty? Indeed. Still not sure why Noomi Rapace is in movies, so many other qualified actresses out there. Then again the only other movie I've seen her in is Prometheus...

Nevertheless. Plenty of entertainment, looking forward to the next Sherlock installment.",1356134400,2,468,5.157894736842105
4438855,4,B004OC006Y,"A great film; to be sure. I still feel it went too quickly.
Too powerful a villain to be killed off in one movie.
The story line seemed to jump from challenge to challenge, without any true development, and then you're at the final showdown when it feels like you're just getting started.

I did not get into the special features yet, so they aren't included in this rating.",1356134400,,374,4.420289855072464
4438856,5,B004OC006Y,I love both movies so I think I have to label each one on its own merits with five stars.  I like it enough to see again.,1356048000,,121,3.4814814814814814

4438858,5,B004OC006Y,"Saw Game of Shadows before the first Sherlock Holmes and loved it. I went back and watched the first one and while it was pretty good, Game of Shadows was much better I thought. I definitely recommend it.",1356048000,,204,4.394736842105263
4438859,3,B004OC006Y,"I liked it ,and I bought it because I have the first one,I really didn't like this one as much as I did the first one. I do find it hard that Robert Downey Jr would agree to act in either of these two movies. But again this is just my thoughts.",1355961600,,244,3.7115384615384617
4438870,5,B004OC006Y,"Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend (who's a big SH fan of the movies and the books and old tv series). We both loved these new movies with Robert Downey Jr. as Holmes and Jude Law as Watson (great chemistry) and the action, adventure, mystery & suspense are all done really well and remind me of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies with great stories, actors, special effects and set pieces.  This sequel was done well and leaves the possibility of another, 2nd sequel open if Hollywood so desires. I'd see more!",1355961600,,517,4.5
4438871,4,B004OC006Y,"So, for a second I thought they might like really try to make a Holmes story based on one of the canonical tales and just spruce it up for the new tech and the 'buddy film' style of the last Downey movie. This isn't it. It's no Hound of the Baskervilles, but it basically takes a short story that was meant as a swan song for Holmes and adds a huge amount of story in front of it and then thumbs its nose at reality a bit at the end.  The performances are all stellar, the special effects are bit overdone. Still a decent movie and leaves me wanting the next one.",1355961600,,563,4.026785714285714

4438873,5,B004OC006Y,"Great visuals, great action, great story. Really an exciting movie to watch. I love the way the director films this flick and how the actors act in it. You can tell they had a fun time making it.",1355961600,,195,4.157894736842105

4438876,4,B004OC006Y,This was a more coherent movie than the first with a well played and appropriate villan and better written story,1355961600,,112,4.65

This is Sherlock for the ""Monster"" imbibing and AR-15 carrying American who desires to think not and reason less, the central process in the original stories from Doyle.

I watched the original Sherlock Holmes - Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon with actors - Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce (1943) and truly enjoyed the movie.

Then I re-read the description of what I thought was for the DVD, and could not find that I would actually be getting the DVD with the so called ""free download"", so I cancelled the purchase.

4438965,4,B004OC006Y,I love how this movie same as the previous got to the true Sherlock Holmes while keeping it safe for family's. This one was more violent as it was about WWI and the death of Holmes and Moriarty.  So I wouldn't recommend it for smaller children but for teenagers it would be perfect.,1355097600,,282,4.320754716981132
4438966,5,B004OC006Y,close to a non-stop action movie as well as being a thinking man's movie. Excellently done. Downey's reprise of the original Sherlock Holmes is superb a quick thinking master of deduction and action.be sure to press pause if you leave the room.,1355097600,,244,4.833333333333333

4438970,4,B004OC006Y,Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law are awesome together in this movie.  They both play their characters really well and they are so funny in this movie.

If you're happy with the seller, then don't get upset.  MY SELLER:  AMAZON.COM, LLC - inserted invalid ultraviolet codes.  When I received the blu ray discs (I bought 2.  1 as a christmas present), they were partially opened.  There were ultraviolet codes in them, but they don't work.  Instead there is an error when you enter them.  5001 code that says there is no title associated with the url and code to redeem.  I have since contacted their customer support.  I am a nerd and have never had this kind of problem with ultraviolet before.  Recently I have bought over 3 dozen movies and shows from amazon and their packaging and legality is questionable.  I think that they are partaking in illegal copies of movies and shows.  The things I have received have seemed very cheap and not run of the mill just out of the box discs and advertisements.

There are many close calls, as you would expect.  It is cleverly done, lots of action, and several scenes/moments made me laugh out loud.  I was sitting in a repair shop lounge waiting for me car, I was able to completely lock out all the noise around.  it kept me occupied, entertained and helped the time go by.

4439020,4,B004OC006Y,"Even though I enjoyed watching some of the old Sherlock Holmes movies, I was not really a great fan of this character until I saw Robert Downey Jr. in the first movie he played the great British Detective.  I enjoyed this one, Sherlock Holmes: A game of Shadows, even more than the last one.  This time his detective skills and his other physical fighting skills are tested to the limit as he matches wits with his old nemesis.  I imagine some old fans of Sherlock Holmes may not enjoy this more modern version of the brilliant detective, but I found Robert Downey Jr.s portrayal  to be delightful, refreshing and brilliant.

In conclusion, if you are a Sherlock Holmes fan you should enjoy watching this film.

4439029,5,B004OC006Y,"A Game of Shadows has a great connection with its predecessor. The story of the movie is relatively satisfied, but lacks the deeper connection later on with the movie. It seems as if the script writers had to rush through the story at later part of the movies. This is the only part of the movie I find to be unsatisfied. But the overall movie is still worth the money.

The combo pack for this movies consists of dvd, blu-ray, and an ultraviolet copy. The digital copy of this pack is what I dissatisfied with the most with this movie. I personally would prefer the itunes digital copy that can be transferred to my ipad or other devices. But the ultraviolet copy would require users to go on to their websites to watch it.",1354492800,,724,4.402985074626866

4439035,4,B004OC006Y,Sit back and enjoy this version of Holmes. They could be a little more clever and a little less high tech but the acting is first rate and maybe they can evolve into the head game masters that Holmes and Watson are in other iterations.,1354406400,,235,4.2444444444444445

Later on I decided that was too harsh and purchased the first movie on bluray.  I still regret it to this day.  Not sure why I opted to rent Game of Shadows, but this one turned out to be MUCH BETTER than the first one.  The rapport and chemistry between Downey Jr. and Law is fantastic.  I love the many quips and ""slopes"" in this film.  The actor who plays Moriarty was cool too.  But the scene that got me the most was the two minute slow motion sequence toward the films end.

4439120,4,B004OC006Y,"The producers of ""A Game of Shadows"" must think so, because Holmes has a problem worthy of James Bond -- preventing a world war (circa 1891). Holmes has become an action hero, whose skill at scientific fighting enables him to defeat any attacker. Even two. Hiding in the rafters.

This is one of those rare sequels that's better -- much better (That's a joke. Get it?) -- than the original. The writing is sharper, there's a lot less of Rachael McAdams, and the story goes beyond being a clever mystery to examining (if only superficially) why humans engage in war. I particularly enjoyed Jared Harris as Moriarty, who doesn't drool and slobber like the stereotypical movie villain. The Bond/Grant train fight is reprised (though as such a bloated battle as to approach absurdity), and the auction scene from ""North by Northwest"" (sometimes considered a precursor of the Bond films) is winked at.

Nevertheless, the four-star rating I gave the first film has to remain, simply because Holmes' character has been altered to near-unrecognizability. He's like the anthropomorphic Jiminy Cricket in ""Pinocchio"" -- he's a cricket because the other characters /say/ he is. Had Holmes remained as Conan Doyle created him, this film would have been a significant contribution to the Holmes tales. As it is, it is merely an entertaining confection.

There are at least two anachronisms, one major, which I leave the viewer to discover. (No, it's not contact lenses, the first successful version of which dates to 1887. Nor is it plastic surgery, which is almost 3000 years old.)

Those familiar with the Holmes canon will know how the film ends long before the final scene. There's room for another sequel, but I hope it isn't made, as it will be hard to equal this entry, let alone top it. (I checked, and someone is writing #3. One can only hope he comes up with something genuinely original.)",1353369600,2,1886,4.884375

4439124,5,B004OC006Y,The Game of Shadows is very well plotted and directed.  The actors are picked with the idea of who works well together in such a teaming up of Sherlock and Dr. Watson in the true storytelling of the original writer.  The effects are very different and bring a twist to the movie itself.  It is a keeper and a movie to add to your collection.,1353196800,,341,4.2153846153846155
4439125,5,B004OC006Y,"Robert Downey Jr has been great as of lately in every movie he has been in (Iron Man 1&2, Avengers, Due Date, Sherlock Holmes), and this one is no exception. Robert and Jude play off each other so well, but Robert definitely steals the movie, as usual, and that is never a bad thing, and his comedic style is just always spot on.

  Sherlock Holmes 2 is not quite as good as the first one, but what sequels are, but it is a very long way from being bad! 2 is full of action from beginning to end. Also the Holmes-vision is back, and I think this is one aspect that they improved upon from the first movie, and actually catches you off guard at first, and goes to show they didn't just try to replicate the first movie. There are a few surprises in this movie that will catch you off guard. The villain was written really well also, and proves to be a very good adversary to Mr. Holmes, and what really keeps you engaged in this movie from start to (surprising) ending.

4439143,4,B004OC006Y,"Of course, the first movie was better...brilliant, funny, exciting, a wild ride filled with great action scenes and sarcastic comments and the deep friendship between our (rough around the edges and too smart for his own good) Sherlock and the ever-suffering Dr Watson.

As a second movie goes, this is a good one.  Its always hard to follow brilliance.  That being said, its well worth watching and owning.

The friendship is still there, though Watson is understandably being pulled further away from Sherlock by his impending wedding.  Sherlock seems more vulnerable in this movie, perhaps because he is on the verge of losing so much and is facing a man as brilliant and cunning as he is...if not more so.  I wasn't sure they could cast someone to be as charming and evil as Dr Moriarty always has been in my mind from reading the books, but the one in the movie comes close enough.

Who will win the battle of wits?  What will Sherlock do, what will he give up, for Watson's sake?  It really did feel like the real fight in the movie was between Dr Moriarty and his impending mechanistic impersonal World War mentality and Sherlock with his clumsy appreciation and belief in (much as he might deny it) human companionship and caring.

One thing that these movies have done is made Sherlock more vulnerable, more human...as much as he is made inhuman by his gift/curse.  Watson is also as imperfect as he is loyal and brave.  Law and Downey have done a terrific job with these characters.

Holmes purists probably dislike these movies, but I enjoy them as a modern re-envisioning for our times.  Which, if you're going to make a movie out of any books written in and tied to a previous historical period, you have to find a way to make them connect to and have meaning for a modern audience.

Saw both in the theatre and bought them both on DVD and will go see a third movie if they make one.  Bravo!",1352160000,,1904,4.555882352941176

But if, as I did, you found it an interesting look at what Holmes could have been like if Dr. Watson seriously ""toned down"" his narratives...then you're going to like this second installment even more than the first.
There is plenty of action, start to finish, but the best aspect of ""Game of Shadows"" is the realization that they're giving you all the same clues Holmes is getting, but he's the one who can put them together. I don't want to do any spoilers, but when you see the chain of logic Holmes builds from a book and a plant, you'll appreciate that this movie doesn't treat Holmes merely as an action star, but as a giant of deductive logic who can hold his own when the action starts.

I've always viewed Holmes as something of an action-hero anyway...the fight in total darkness in the basement of the bank in The Redheaded League and the physical control required to wait motionless for hours then pounce in The Speckled Band for instance...so these movies haven't put me off as much as some others have indicated. Many of the physical feats of strength and endurance described in the Adventures required not a frail bookworm, but a confident athlete. Give these movies another chance; look at them as not re-imagining Holmes, but expanding on the things Watson put in his narratives.

4439241,3,B004OC006Y,Entertaining movie but difficult to follow at times. I love Robert Downey Jr. so it was worth the money but not the best plot. Seemed predictable and cliche. I liked the slow motion breakdowns and visual effects. Made it worth watching.,1348185600,,236,4.780487804878049

Although it's technically a sequel, it can be seen and understood without having seen the previous. The plot just draws you in to the point that you're hanging on to every word of every scene, the acting is flawless, and it's one of those movies that keeps you watching and will have you thinking about it even after it's over. All in all, it's an amazing movie, dramatic, slightly funny, and nerve-wracking. I sincerely recommend it to everyone.",1348012800,,573,4.683168316831683

4439247,4,B004OC006Y,"This movie doesn't seem to be nearly as well liked as the first one and I'm not sure why that is. I thought this still contained the Holmes and Watson from the first film, just with a less 'traditional' focus and more character development between the two main characters, and of course the addition of Moriarity. I will agree that this is not the Holmes I imagine from reading the official novels & short stories, but there really isn't that many inconsistances between two; the movies just focus more on the action and grit instead. I wouldn't say this is the best Holmes adaptation, I too liked the first movie better, but that doesn't make the sequel bad in/of itself. It had action, intrigue, mystery, drama, and even a little romance. Enjoy this movie for what it is, a different yet still mostly accurate representation of Sherlock Holmes. I know there are those who will disagree with that assessment but not only was Holmes a respected fighter, in multiple styles and with multiple instruments, but his final 'battle' with the good Professor was in fact a fist-fight.",1347926400,3,1076,4.759358288770054

4439270,3,B004OC006Y,"The casting of Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law might seem a strange choice, but all concerns were allayed in the first outing featuring the pair. Of particular novelty were the fight/boxing scenes, which, with slow motion effects were quite thrilling.

The second film in the franchise left me cold.  As a matter of fact, I had to keep rewinding scenes because I fell asleep.  Finally, a day later, I watched the whole thing again, but still I could find little to recommend it, save the chemistry between the two leads.

If there is a third, I will give it a chance as I like the overall take on Doyle's masterpiece.",1347235200,,616,4.5225225225225225

4439276,3,B004OC006Y,"We loved the first Sherlock Holmes and Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law are very good in both.  However, in the second film, the script is poor, there are too many jumping ""thought"" sequences by the director and it is short on the twists and surprises in most Sherlock Holmes films or books.  It was an ok movie but it was a drop off from the first film.  It also seemed more of an early 20th century version of the new James Bond vice the crime solving prowess of Sherlock Holmes.  It was average but not because of its main stars who were still very good.",1347062400,,554,4.19811320754717

4439288,5,B004OC006Y,"This movie was fantastic- it's Victorian era intrigue, action, and espionage for the common man. It's a fun, humorous romp that manages to stay entertaining and engaging for its two hour run time, something many modern films struggle to pull off.

Although some people will be dismayed by the slick style of film editing, featuring plenty of slow motion and ""edgy"" cuts (a signature of director Guy Ritchie), I thought it worked very well with the rich cinematography (and it looked great on Blu-ray). I'm no expert on the period of the story, but to my eye, the movie portrayed a very convincing setting. The wardrobes, brick buildings, cobblestone streets, and perpetual soot transported me to a different time and place.

The chemistry between all the actors is outstanding- particularly Downey (Holmes) and Law (Watson), who were both brilliantly cast for this iconic duo (just as they were in the previous movie). It's great to see their strange friendship on the screen, as they exchange quips and wry observations, putting their quirky personalities on full display. Also of note is the marvelous performance by Jared Harris as Professor Moriarty. His interactions with Holmes are superbly played by both actors, perfectly conveying the competition between their genius intellects and conflicting world views. The climax of their intellectual battle is one of the most enjoyable finishes I've seen in any movie of recent memory. It's complex, riveting, multi-layered, and extremely satisfying.

I give this movie five stars, with particular appreciation for the efforts of Downey, Law, and Harris. A good way to spend a Friday night, laughing with friends!",1346976000,,1663,5.2209737827715355

My son did not see it theatrically - so I await a nice moment when we can watch together and I can relive the thrills while my son lives it for the first time. Downey and the rest of the cast have an easy chemistry together and Mr. Harris is properly impressive as Dr. Moriarty. this one is a lot of fun.,1346976000,2,404,3.8795180722891565

At first it was ok but after a while I would want to fast forward or take a motion sickness pill. They did a lot of special effects almost like the Matrix. That turned me off from giving this a better rating. It is a good watch but not a great watch. I wish it was better just because of the Moriaty situation. But the most memoral scene in the movie was Holmes killing (and reviving) Dr. Watson's dog. Again. Will the dog make it threw another movie? Who knows.

Thus, there are male-bonding extremes, disguised cross-dressing extremes, hand-to-hand combat extremes, and many 19th-Century-characters-versus-20th-Century-warfare-technology extremes; but with Downey's cynical but sentimental Holmes and Law's baffled but steadfast Watson, they actually pull off a very non-Holmesian plotline.

I like how they modified Sherlocks planning out anticipating fight scenes. Keeping the same cool concept from the first, but changeing it a bit to keep it fresh.  Mild spoiler alert his plans can get interupted, and there are others out there who can do the same thing.
Overall not quite as good as the first, but I highly reccomend this film.",1346889600,2,486,4.705882352941177

There was just something about it that seems to leave you wanting, or should say, expecting more. As I said, the movie does a decent job for a sequel, that in itself is a victory considering how many lousy sequels are out there. But if you're wanting a movie that is challenging or is a blockbuster smash, this isn't it; however, if you're wanting a movie that is a great way to just relax and let your hair down with, then you'd probably enjoy this one. It's easy to follow, simply to understand, and unfortunately, the ending is pretty predictable if you're watching the movie and not having an ADD moment. So, why the 3 stars? It's a pretty okay movie,(would probably work for a date night movie) but I expected more and it just wasn't what you'd call, ""overly impressive.""

4439390,3,B004OC006Y,"Guy Richie continues his Sherlock Holmes play with ""Game of Shadows"" with Robert Downy Jr. and Jude Law reprising their roles.
It's a fast-paced film, and tries to pick up where it left off in the first film, but like many sequels, it plays its strengths too much!

The slo-mo martial arts were interesting as in the first film, but the second one plays these out time and time and time again.  Gets a bit boring after awhile.  The early death of a woman you were hoping would take Holmes' side (rather than Moriarty) was disappointing.  The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (the original Swedish version) Naomi Pace made an interesting gypsy but the acting was tepid.

What I liked about the film was the developing relationship between Holmes and Watson as they each play off each other, not always able to stand each other, but recognizing their friendship is necessary to carry out the ultimate point in their careers:  prevent the collapse of Western civilization - no pressure!

The Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (the original writer of the Holmes' stories) aspect of Moriarity and Holmes playing a chess game of sorts (literally and figuratively) while one counter plays the other is what saved the movie for me.

A bit too much CGI and a tad too much slo-mo martial arts fighting (in the 1880s?  Really?) doesn't make this the best Holmes film to watch.  If you want original, well-written Holmes, watch BBC's Jeremy Brett or even the earlier classic films with Basil Rathbone.

If there is a trilogy, let's hope for something a little more cerebral and less super-hero!

Better:

Too goofy, like a parody.

We were waiting for Jerry Lewis and the 3 Stooges to jump out at anytime.

The casting of Eric Porter in the Brett series was a stroke of inspiration seldom encountered in television or anywhere else. That mountain of crags WAS Moriarty. He has been replaced here by a bearded cherub. But then this is the type of film that cannot be photographed with too much sharpness lest it be taken for a commercial film when heaven knows the director is making an A.R.T. film, the kind they drain of color except for flesh tones.

4439395,5,B004OC006Y,"We've enjoyed a Sherlock Holmes renaissance these past couple of years.
BBC (leave it to those Brits!) gave us a loopy, but oddly endearing
Sherlock for the 21st century - complete with a Watson who ""blogs"" his
irritating room-mate's adventures.  (Think Holmes, sitting naked in Buckingham
Palace and chuckling about it.)
Then there's Robert Downey Jr. - packing the plexes with his (quite accurate)
Iron Man interpretation - as Mr. Holmes.  Downey's Holmes is equally as manic as
Benedict Cumberbatch's SHERLOCK, a bit less cerebral but far more physical.  The first
Downey SHERLOCK HOLMES was classic stuff; but A GAME OF SHADOWS takes Holmes into
the larger world (to save it for a while) while matching him with his worthiest opponent:
Dr. James Moriarty.  There is a fine midnight train confrontation with the baddies
(Holmes badly disguised as a woman); an amazing flight through a foggy forest whilst
artillery shells whiz all around; and...
I won't give the ""gag"" away, but it's true Holmsian and occurs early in the film
(caught by surprise, I laughed out loud), then reoccurs to cap the climax
at the end (I think I fell into the lap of a beautiful brunette several seat rows

International plots and conspiracies and action are simply not as succulent, other reviewers have likened this movie to a Bond film, I agree, and its not what I'm looking for. Did anyone care about the capture of the so-called villain?  No.  Was the villain even remotely fascinating? No.  Were any of the characters?  Again, no.

I would prefer to see Holmes and Watson on holiday somewhere along with nine or ten other people in a far away location, where, coincidentally! a murder occurs which only he can solve--formulaic, sure, but, you see, it works, such a storyline can be diversified and differentiated....

 Ironically, Downey plays a pretty good Holmes, if only the storyline was great he could truly shine.  I can watch the film ""Evil Under the Sun"" time and again, because its compelling, it possesses all of the elements necessary to exalt it, yet the Holmes sequel was dull, contrived, predictable, silly, unmysterious...a failure.

One reviewer compared it to Pirates of the Caribbean and that's probably a rather good comparison. One thing you should not expect is the Sherlock Holmes of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Although there may be a few hints of Doyle's' literary Holmes character the movie creates a very contemporary Holmes in the spirit of the first Holmes played by Robert Downey Jr. In other words you'll enjoy this one if you enjoyed the first one. If, on the other hand, you're a devoted fan of Doyle's Holmes you may be disappointed in this version of the famous fictional detective.

I'd've probably given it four stars but for the savaging ""Hate it"" reviews of people ranting that it's not the old Holmes; it's not the real Doyle, blah blah.  Fine.  Be that as it may---let it be called Holmes inspired---IT'S A BLAST TO WATCH.  I watched it twice in one day.  I love that there's a bunch of things that can be picked up on second or third viewings, yet the initial watchings don't, for me, suffer from this.  It just makes later viewings more fun.  OK, so I'm no Sherlock; it took the second viewing for the bomb thing to really bother me; still I had great fun watching it both times---and will buy a copy soon to go with the earlier movie. (I never buy movies I don't LOVE).

I tend to be very picky about movies.  Still, I can love movies even if there's a blatant flaw--or even several--so long as it's smart, richly produced and takes me away without making me feel the cameras are just out of view--if you know what I mean.

Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law are brilliantly in and out of each others' heads as Holmes and Watson, and the verbal dexterity and subtly different shades of wit between them drew me in and gave the movie a wickedly pleasurable texture. There was such an effortless liveliness, grace and fondness between the two actors--a pleasure to watch, all around.

The year is 1891. France and Germany are at each other's throats. There is a series of bombings. Most people pin it on anarchists. But Holmes has a different theory; we know what that theory is.

As long as you can put aside any preconceptions you may have had of Holmes from the books, you can completely enjoy Downey's portrayal of the great detective. A recent reviewer compared the action to a James Bond film. I'd agree, but then I'd say that this is a cerebral Bond set in the 1890's, within the gritty atmosphere of industrial Europe, a Europe on the verge of nationalism and warfare. For the most part, the action moves along nicely. My only criticism of this movie is that it should have done a bit more to set up the rivalry between Holmes and Moriarty (as genius vs. genius). Instead, it relied primarily on Moriarty's continued threat to his partner Watson as the main reason their personal conflict. In this way, Moriarty comes across as more of a sadistic evil than an intelligent evil. Like the first movie, A Game of Shadows looks fantastic. The atmophere of this film depicts the era wonderfully. Yes. This version of Holmes is a bit wacky, but this is my kind of movie!!",1343952000,,1118,4.567164179104478

Instead of a Holmes adventure, the producers made a James Bond retread set in the Victorian era. The film is a painful shambles: two hours of action-movie clichs and cheap laughs minus the suspense, mystery and inventiveness of its predecessor. Only the chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law survives intact - undercut by a fraudulently misguided script and Guy Ritchie's helter-skelter direction.

Everyone in the movie plays their parts well and especially Robert Downey Jr, Jude Law, Noomi Rapace (The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, Original Swedish Version & better than the recent remake of TGWTDT)and especially Jared Harris(Mad Men & many other fine roles)Harris is an amazing actor. I see where some people complain because it really isn't strict to Holmes original time frame or character or something silly like that but these are fun, well made, intriguing, funny, action packed, well detailed movies with amazing top drawer actors and produced excellent. I for one have no complaints and thoroughly enjoy them to the max. Somewhat like James Bond movies, can't wait for the next one and Downey Jr and Law make perfect Holmes & Watson.

That said, my husband rented Game of Shadows last week and I was watching it before I realized what it was. To my astonishment, I found myself sucked in and thoroughly enjoying the experience. The only thing that bothered me (spoiler) was the incredibly trite ""super villain amassing super weapons in order to start a war for profit"" plotline. That part was boringly predictable and quite a letdown after the way it had been building up to that point. The sudden shift to comic book style villain was jarring and disappointing.

4439556,5,B004OC006Y,"This is a crisp and intellectual movie and the banter between Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr) and the rest of the characters was funny and well written. Sherlock is on the top of his intellectual game and his detective skills are firing on all cylinders. His powers of observation and intuition are made to be amazing. This movie's pace speeds up throughout the film and it becomes an action motion picture with a deep plot and several sub plots.

Sherlock appears throughout the movie in disguise as he believes that his mortal enemy, Professor Moriarity (Jared Harris) is constantly after him and wants to kill him. The world is on the verge of war between Germany and France as mysterious explosions occur in both countries and they are viewed and retaliation against each other for the terrorist's attacks sponsored by the governments. Holmes knows better as he has been tracking the events and he feels that the evil Professor is behind all of the murderous activities, bombings and attacks.

Professor Moriarity is not only after Holmes but his partner investigator, Doctor Watson (Jude Law) and his new wife. Now Sherlock must try to stop a war in Europe, but also prove that the professor is the perpetrator and also protect his lifelong friend and ally....

My wife and I enjoyed this movie. The plot is well written and as I have said the banter in the script is crisp and sharp and makes the movie more enjoyable. This film was made for entertainment purposes and it varies a lot from the original Sherlock Holmes character in that is does make Robert Downey Jr's character seem to almost having supernatural insight and perception. It is still a good movie and we enjoyed it.

One scene detracted from the movie where a fight occurs between Sherlock and a Cossack assassin. The rubber knives the Cossack is using are flapping back and forth. This scene looks so fake and it should have been reshot and that error taken out of the movie. I don't understand how a film editor and the director could have left that scene in the film.",1342828800,,2045,4.719887955182073

4439560,5,B004OC006Y,"This interpretation of Sherlock Holmes is beautifully made.  The characterization of Holmes is not as reserved and witty, perhaps, as that of the original Holmes, but this Holmes is fascinating and engaging; in addition, Downey manages to imbue the character with unexpected suggestions of tragic depth and moral insight.

Above all, the movie is comedic, not tragic, and the writers and actors never lose sight of that fact.  The writing and acting are pitch-perfect throughout the tightly woven plot.

I especially like the fact that the writers and actors retain the moral center of an Arthur Conan Doyle story -- the passionate concern for the victim and the fierce devotion to unmasking the concealed, murderous criminal.

The final scenes with Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Moriarty at the Reichenbach (sp?) Falls are presented beautifully.  The ominous Falls are as terrible as we had imagined them to be.  The actors are impressive and mesmerizing.  Downey, especially, ""steps outside of himself"" to occupy the moment brilliantly as the great detective face-to-face with his sinister, inimitable foe, so aptly described as ""morally insane.""

Jude Law is superb in his faultless interpretation of Watson.  He is a fine, fine actor.

The music is stunning.

Anything not to like? I thought that the ""semi-nude"" scene in Mycroft's study was somewhat disturbing; I can't imagine a Victorian gentleman -- even Mycroft -- appearing in such a way.  The actor who played Mycroft, however, did a good job with the rather strange episode.

Similarly, the dance scene between Holmes and Watson was too implausible to accept, even with the duo's frequently witty antics in prior scenes.

However, those unusual scenes were so well acted that one cannot fault ""the players,"" who entertain us so well in this memorable, exquisite adaptation of the Conan Doyle classic.",1342656000,3,1856,5.202020202020202

4439562,4,B004OC006Y,"I was prepared not to like this but have come to realize that it is intelligent, engaging, cool, steampunk-filled action.  Of course, those who hold to the classic Sherlock Holmes will never agree and I can't fault them.  But for those who've never read the books and just want to see an action movie .....

I enjoyed the plot and the choreographed fight scenes.  I enjoyed Holmes' character and Watson's character, their gypsy allies, and their love/hate relationship.  Prof. Moriarity makes a downright nasty villian, as does his sharpshooting assassin sidekick.  Holmes' nearly supernatural insight & foresight are a stretch, but still very enjoyable.  In a second he looks at a perilous situation (like a fight) and works out the next 10 moves, like a chess Grandmaster.  Watson, his ""Bishop"", is likewise very enjoyable to watch in action.  There's elements of violence/action mixed in with intelligent scripting and even comedy.  (Like when the sharpshooter has Watson pinned down, but Watson finds a cannon to shoot back at him.  The sharpshooter mutters, ""that's not fair"" as he scurries away.)  It has LOTS of Steampunk elements - Cool metallic gadgets and ""neat"" WWI-era armaments, all enhanced by the director's stop-action super detail-oriented techniques and gritty photography.  (I loved the scene: ""let's introduce them to little Hansel,"" ... a giant cannon!)  Makes you really think that you're watching turn-of-the-century Europe!  But action alone can't make a winning movie, and ""A Game of Shadows"" delivers the intelligent plot to go along with the action.  Like Dr. Moriarity trying to start a war by using terrorism (predates WWI).  Like our heroes trying to figure out where the next terrorist act will be, or trying to analyze clues for which disguised man is going to shoot the Arch-duke.  It does engage your mind.

Some reviewers didn't like the casting of Harris as Moriarity, but that's their totally subjective opinion.  Like which is better, Blue or Red?  I thought he was great (ie you hate him) without being the typical cliched Hollywood villian.

Why doesn't it get 5 stars?  Because the director goes over-the-top (arrogance? assumes his fans don't care?) with stupid ""stuff.""  For example Holmes' brother is hosting Watson's fiance at his home and he greets her in the morning stark naked. Very stupid and it would never happen in England in 1900!  Also for example the pseudo-gay stuff like making Holmes dress in drag, lie down half-naked during a firefight and tell Watson, ""Come lie down with me!""  Just this little over-the-top irritating stuff that knocks it down from 5 to 4 stars.  Also, I'm sure that true Sherlock Holmes fans have never gotten over giving the gig to a very non-British-looking American actor (Robert Downey Jr.), despite his talent and ability to flawlessly speak with a British accent.  But if you've accepted Downey Jr. as Holmes by now, and you don't require adherence to the original Sherlock Holmes character & stories, then this movie is better than the first in my opinion.",1342656000,4,3044,5.0582329317269075
4439573,2,B004OC006Y,"Positives:
Good sets and scenes (even if mostly green screen); good period costuming. A gallant try by Downey but ...

Negatives:
Basil is turning over in his grave. What happened to the mystery; the natural believability of real sleuthing.
It seemed as if the plot, script and role were written with Depp in mind. And, maybe he might have pulled it off but I doubt it. Watching Downey I couldn't get Depp out of my mind.
The fight scenes and bullets with the high speed filming reduced to slo-mo was not only been-done-for-decades old, but actually took away from the natural mystery of the story. It and other events seemed overly staged like you could see all the crew along side the sets.
The tone of the movie was too narcissistic and self-indulgent not only in the acting, directing but especially in the script. Let's see how clever we can be just stood out. The twists, problem solving, sleuthing and displays of observational skills besides being not believable were excessive. Like the tricky filming it soon became a distraction.",1342656000,,1040,4.810055865921788
4439574,4,B004OC006Y,"First let me say that no one seems to be happy with the relatively new Ultraviolet digital media format that much of Hollywood has adapted to. And I would say that most of the negative 1 & 2 star reviews here at Amazon for this movie are an outcry against said format. But in fairness, the average number of stars that this movie is getting is dramatically lower based on the outcry to this format that Hollywood has taken to versus the quality of the movie. So if you are considering this movie, that fact should be kept in mind as you decide whether or not to view. Anyway....

Us old guys have all seen Basil Rathbone in the original Sherlock Holmes movies from the 1940s, right? When I was a kid in the early 70s they used to rerun them on Saturday mornings, and I must say that I found them intolerably boring. In 1939 Rathbone actually did the first called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hound-of-the-Baskervilles/dp/B0001DCYBE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hound of the Baskervilles</a>&nbsp;in what became a series of over a dozen sequels with him in the lead role.

To the preservationists who say that one should only re-make bad movies...not good ones...think this: One should re-make old good movies and make them as good or better. That's what Guy Ritchie's 2009 version of Sherlock Holmes accomplished, and it's what Ritchie accomplished here with A Game of Shadows.

While the storyline of Ritchie's 2009 Holmes was a bit...well...remade, Game of Shadows was only slightly influenced by Conan Doyle's short story ""The Final Problem"".  All in all, Ritchie's Holmes movies give the classic franchise a beautiful 21st century treatment with good FX and cool scenery. They're full of action, along with a lot of clever dialogue that made the 2-hour length of the movies go by before I was ready for an end.

I have seen quotes suggesting that Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes is ""a travesty to the character that Doyle created"" and one particularly funny quote suggesting that ""Robert Downey replacing Rathbone in Holmes was akin replacing Clark Gable with Eminem for a remake of Gone With the Wind."" But look, to me as long as the result is good I couldn't care less if a director takes liberties with what was originally created in print or on screen. I thought Downey made an excellent Holmes...but I doubt that I'd feel the same way with Eminem in Gone With the Wind. :-)

I was not only pleased with the first two Sherlock Holmes efforts under Ritchie's direction, I was also thoroughly entertained. Action fans, don't pass on this. Preservationists, you probably won't be happy. And back in January 2012 it was announced on DeadlineHollywood that Ritchie will be back to direct a third sequel in the franchise.",1342656000,4,2769,4.995661605206074

The storyline flows well and is of a decent enough pace to keep the viewers interest throughout. Trouble is, I wasn't sure when the comedy was intentional and when it was due to unbelievable script writing.

For example; a scrap of thick paper with a wine stain on it would lead many to deduce that the note on it was written hastily in a restaurant on whatever material the author had to hand. To Sherlock it means, that there is a printing shop nearby which contains a wine cellar. And yes, so there is. The powers of deduction and heroic deeds could have been written by the Monty Python crew at times.

The characters are quiet shallow, and at no time did I feel like I had any sympathy for their situation nor did I concern myself that there was ever any danger of anyone important being seriously harmed anyway.

Stephen Fry as Mycroft adds to the Monty Python feel to the movie, only trouble is MP did it better some 40 years ago.

As I said, an enjoyable romp with a sufficiently storyline that it holds one's interest for the majority of the film. But if you want new Sherlock Holmes, get the series 'Sherlock' from the BBC. A more original and almost believable take on the SH stories and with characters that have personalities which one can care about.

Downey and Law surely had some fun making this film but the most interesting role here was 'Mad Men's' Jared Harris' take on Moriarty. Too bad the producers did not think that audiences might actually want a real Sherlock Holmes film and not this one aimed at the 6 year olds in all of us.

I am not going to say much about this film, except you should see it if any of the following applies to you:

You like watching films starring either Robert Downey Jr. or Jude Law

You enjoy action movies, because this sequel is probably a bit more action oriented than the first film, though not in a bad way.

You are a fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's mysteries or the Sherlock Holmes character in general

You enjoyed Raiders of the Lost Ark, other films from that series, or that type of action/adventure

This is a very well made motion picture that just keeps rollicking along until its climax.  It proves to be a lot of fun along the way and has a decent storyline.  Jude Law and the other supporting actors and actresses do a fine job, but Robert Downey Jr. makes this film, in much the same way I thought he dominated the screen in the Iron Man films and the recent Avengers film.

I watched this on a home theater with a 60 inch screen and full digital surround, but it still would have been better served in the theater.  I am usually not a fan of sequels, but I hope they continue producing this series and keep it fresh.  The first two films have been well above what passes for the current Hollywood average.

4439641,5,B004OC006Y,"I'm a big Sherlock Holmes fan and have collected most all versions, both feature films and made for TV that have been produced. The Robert Downey franchise is entertaining and enjoyable. Script is tight, though not as humorous as the first film. Moriarty is well depicted and quite well played. The relationship between Holmes and Watson is equally well defined and a treat to watch. Due to the ending of this adventure I'm wondering what the future of the franchise will be? I'd love to see a 3rd and 4th film based around other classic Holmes stories.",1341014400,3,553,4.711340206185567
4439642,4,B004OC006Y,"I will agree with any amount of praise that gets heaped on this film on the subject of:

(a) Robert Downey Junior and Jude Law as a fantastic Holmes & Watson. Their performances in both the first and second film are sometimes jaw-droppingly good, with Sherlock as damaged as he is brilliant and Watson his tough but personally insightful anchor to humanity.

(b) Cinematography and style. Although my son sat next to me looking up inventions and weapons on his iphone through the whole film crying ""anachronistic"" I thought the sets, costumes, and props all combined into a very slightly steampunk Victorian Europe that's just huge fun.

(c) Music - love the music and special effects.

What brought this film down to 4 stars for me is that it has almost no plot at all, and what little there is is painfully silly. We follow H&W around England, France, Germany, & Switzerland with almost NO idea what they're doing or why (though things are explained after the fact in flashback) - and once we do know, I found it very hard to see why H&W were important to...well, anything except the audience...and the nudge nudge are they or aren't they a couple byplay felt a little too over the top.

The extra features on the Blu Ray were clearly value add to the consumer.  Nice juicy behind the scenes stuff with the cast and crew.

What wasn't value add to the consumer was the added cost of the Ultraviolet streaming service.  Ultraviolet is NOT a ""digital copy."" It requires the consumer to have yet one more set of login/password combinations to track, (I had to get separate accounts on both the Ultraviolet site and the Paramount site in order to ""register"" the only Ultraviolet movie I have access to.  Not going to go through that user hostile process again) in order to stream a movie they already have both the Blu Ray & DVD versions of.

While the director was trying to show Holmes thought processes it just ruined the flow of the movie. It would have been much better if done at regular speed and treated more like a flashback.

This whole stop action slow motion thing seems to be taking over a number of movies. Much like autotune being used on almost every pop song it's over use ruins as opposed to enhances the final product.",1340582400,2,499,4.483516483516484
4439678,4,B004OC006Y,"Robert Downey jr, and Jude Law make a wonderful pair as Holmes and Watson and A Game of Shadows takes it up a notch. Holmes has met his intellectual match in Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris) who not only plans to launch a massive war in Europe but make himself incredibly wealthy and rid himself of his arch enemy at the same time.

The first twenty minutes of the film establishes Moriarty as Holmes' equal and he clearly places our heroes in great peril. Rachel McAdams does a cameo and Stephen Fry (of Blackadder and Fry and Laurie fame)also appears as Sherlock Holmes' smarter brother. While Jared Harris' Moriarty is not as imposing as Mark Strong's Lord Blackwood, Moriarty does have numerous henchman to do his dirty work and there is a scene which Harris displays his acting range in a chilling scene where he tortures Holmes with a calm and ruthless demeanor and while Holmes manages to escape, he is left physically weaken for his upcoming duel with the professor.

The movie looks brillant and captures the sense of adventure and danger to satisfy both action and detective fans alike. I would rate this movie 5 stars however the blu ray combo pack lacks a digital copy. I went to numerous stores trying to find one and it is only available with Ultraviolet, which is not mainstream yet and I have no desire or interest in their service. The first Sherlock Holmes came with a digital copy which I enjoyed on a flight to Germany, sadly, if I want one of this film I will have to buy it twice. I have no issues buying a movie by itself, I've done it many times but when it is advertised with a digital copy, I expect a digital copy I can use on my PC or iTunes.

I am unpleased with my recent purchase of the Sherlock Holmes A Game of Shadows Blu-ray + DVD + Ultraviolet pack. The fact that the Ultraviolet version is not compatible with my iTunes library renders the purchase useless. There is only one reason to buy these multi format discs and that is to be able to play the content on my devices any where I choose to enjoy them. Had I realized that this was the case before Pre-ordering the movie on Amazon, I would have purchased the Blu-ray only version. That is Amazons fault for not making it clear what we were getting with our pre-order. I have not had this issue with other WB movies purchased so I had no reason to believe there would be an issue and I assume it is a new practice. I also take issue with the fact that it was not made obvious that the ""Digital Copy"" was a proprietary format that requires me to sign up for Ultraviolet and Flixster accounts and go through the Rube Goldbergian process of linking those accounts which is, to say the least, not user friendly. I understand that iTunes and Apple are a thorn in the side of both the Music and Movie industries and Ultraviolet is your attempt to wrest control from them, but the fact is it's only making the end consumer angry and frustrated that you don't see consumer satisfaction as what should drive you, not over throwing iTunes. Do the math... there are more iDevices than any other platform out there but you made this movie incompatible with the system that controls those iDevices. I don't see this changing in the near future. Its time to make it JUST WORK.

Ultraviolet will only work on a Mac with the download of the Flixster client app and an Ultraviolet account linked to Flixster and will not load into iTunes. So if you hope to use the ""UV Digital Copy"" with Apple TV you are out of luck. Have fun getting the two accounts linked together. That process alone took 45 Minutes due to server errors and pages not loading all the way.

Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is successful largely because of good story line, breathtaking effects and the superior acting of Robert Downey, Jr. as Sherlock and Jude Law as Dr. Watson.
It's so refreshing to see Robert on his game after several years of sorting out his problems with alcohol and drugs.
The story, loosely based on Conan Doyle's short story The Final Problem, puts our heroes in an all out war with a cunning adversary, Professor Moriaty (Jared Harris).  Producers and directors made the decision to make Game of Shadows a stand-alone film, which didn't require viewers to have seen the first one, Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock is his usual quirky self working on interior-camouflage, secretly trying to sabotage Dr. Watson's wedding, thinking through outcomes of fights before they happen and even donning women's clothing, as a means of keeping his identity secret.
""I just put on some make-up. I thought I looked like Arnold Schwarzenegger's dwarf brother, or the lead singer of The Cure, Robert Smith,"" Robert said.
The first movie grossed $209 odd million, the second was commercially successful with a worldwide gross of over $540 million. We all know what that means.
Warner Bros. has announced that the first draft for Sherlock Holmes 3 is being produced with screenwriter Drew Pearce writing the script.",1340150400,6,1387,5.105726872246696

Both movies have the same story, plot, twist, character development, villian, setting and only the comic version of the LOFEG has Sherlock Holmes as the leader of the group.

4439738,5,B004OC006Y,"Students of history will enjoy the newest Sherlock Holmes installment. Not only are you taken back to late 19th century Europe, but it has a plot that involves the national tensions in Europe that lead to WWI. A more down to earth plot versus the secret society of the first in the series, I think that gives the movie a better footing, although Sherlock Holmes did have brushes in his novels with topics that touched on the paranormal or fringe. This movie has more laughs than the first. Downey Jr and Law's chemistry is better than in the first movie. IF there are any weak spots in the film, I think its the casting of Professor Moriarty. I think Gary Oldman would have been a much better choice or Ben Kingsley. Jared Harris comes across as a weak pick, Mark Strong did much better in the first of the series. I went into this movie jaded by the overall rating here and I was pleasantly surprised that I loved the movie.

My true wish was that release week on Blu-ray, that WB would have another BD Live cast event with Robert Downey Jr like the first movie did. Alas, instead it has something that is called ""Maximum Movie Mode"" where RDJr gives some background into the making and writing of the movie, the importance of certain scenes, why some scenes came out like they did and the historical background of things seen in the film. It also has B roll and stills at certain points.

I don't think that the the Maximum Movie Mode has the same impact as a BD Live screening, you really feel like you are a part of of a live, historic event because WB added it to the BD Live content so it can be experienced by those that missed it.  Although, Maximum Movie Mode wraps several types of extras into one mode (commentary, B Roll and stills) while a live screening only has the commentary.

I am not sure that Maximum Movie Mode, a DVD and UV are worth the extra $10 at release. At least not to me. But I think the movie is great and if you look at the negative reviews, most are about a dislike of Ultraviolet vs the movie.",1339977600,8,2027,4.326315789473684
4439739,5,B004OC006Y,"I thought this was superior to the first movie. A lot of fun to watch, a beautiful film (digital backdrops were gorgeous), RDJ is not quite as out-of-control as in the first film. The plot moves along and the action is exciting and not as over-the-top as in the first movie. I personally thought the ""bullet time""/Matrix-like moments were excellent, very artfully done. It's funny, it's exciting, it's got RDJ (and Jude Law) in top form, and a wonderfully evil villain. What's not to like?

But then there's the whiners and complainers ""getting back"" at Amazon with their one-star ratings.  What's got their undies in an uproar? The Ultraviolet copy doesn't work! Heavens! You people need some REAL problems. You've got electricity that's on 24/7, clean drinking water, a safe clean home to live in, you're most likely American (as I am) and spoiled completely rotten. You've got an incredible magic viewing screen that shows you BluRay movies that are stunningly realistic--truly a miracle device. Meanwhile, 800 million people (nearly the US population x 3) have no access to drinkable water. And you are pissed off because something you don't really need isn't working as promised. Give me a break. Try spending the day collecting cow dung for fuel and then tell me about your stupid Ultraviolet copy problem.

Another reason this movie (and the BBC show ""Sherlock"") get panned here is because it's not true to the original books and stories. I call these types fundamentalists, and suggest that you ignore their ratings, too. What you're left with is a 5 star rating, as far as I can see.

I've received absolutely no replies to my service help requests.  I was initially wary of UV because of all the bad reviews I'd seen, but after dealing with them, I would strongly warn everyone to stay away from any Ultraviolet digital copy.  Question: what do you call a company that takes your money and doesn't give you what you bought? Answer: A scam.  Ultraviolet is a scam and should be reported to the better business bureau.

Ok, I finally have my digital copy.  For some reason, signing on to Flixster using my Facebook account allowed me to FINALLY link my ultraviolet and flixster accounts.

Robert Downing Jr was brilliant in the first movie; and he plays Holmes to the best of his ability in this one. However, overall, it is a terrible Holmes story. The story is handed to you in this one. There is no twist, no subversive plot change that Holmes is known for. It follows a straightforward, overused and cliche path of an arms dealer trying to start a World War. That's it. Instead of story substance, the director introduced far to many mindless action scenes.

4439779,2,B004OC006Y,"That quote form a Gilbert and Sullivan lyric defines this movie's appearance. Remember that particular pleasure of reading Arthur Conan Doyle's intelligent and vastly entertaining stories about a man and his sidekick whose braininess unraveled impossible mysteries that no one else could solve? That man was Sherlock Holmes and his sidekick was Dr. Watson, and neither of the ghosts of those two fascinating and intelligent gentlemen can be found in this lengthy, boring mess of a film that seems to be concerned only with action movie clones so popular today and setting in a period that allows beautiful costumes to hide the lack of story. Michele Mulroney and Kieran Mulroney are responsible for hiding behind famous literary characters to create a script that is likely less than 5 pages long.  Guy Ritchie is the star of this noisy piece.

Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey, Jr.) and his longtime trusted associate, Doctor Watson (Jude Law), take on their arch-nemesis, Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris), with the help of Holmes's older brother Mycroft Holmes (Stephen Fry) and a gypsy named Simza (Noomi Rapace).  Now make a movie-long story out of that and you have the second installment (and hopefully the last) of Sherlock Holmes a la Guy Ritchie.  The endless fighting on the screen is also populated by some fine actors such as Rachel McAdams, Eddie Marsan, and Kelly Reilly. If the viewer is entertained by the countless costume changes by Robert Downey, Jr. and by some fairly silly swashbuckling by all concerned then perhaps the two hours will pass quickly. But in the end there is simply no story or resemblance to the creations of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to warrant plagiarism of his books.  Pass.  Grady Harp, June 12",1339804800,4,1732,5.017421602787456

4439781,4,B004OC006Y,"When Guy Ritchie and Robert Downey Jr. gave Sherlock Holmes a makeover as more of a quirky, intellectual action hero, the duo managed to recreate Holmes in a unique 21st century way that allowed for an appealing, fun film that actually had a plot.

""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" improves on the first film the duo made deepening the great rapport between Holmes and Watson (Jude Law who marvelously reinterprets Watson moving him even further away from the Nigel Bruce interpretation where Watson--an intelligent and sharp individual--was played as a bit of a buffon)taking what's been done with each succeeding actor to play the role. Casting Jared Harris (""Mad Men"", ""Fringe"") as Dr. Morarity gives Downey a perfect foil in the film. Morarity has his own Dr. Watson in the form of Sebastian Moran (Paul Anderson who does a marvelous job)as well making Morarity even more of a doppleganger for Holmes than before as portrayed here.

The Plot:

Holmes finds himself in the middle of a series of terrorist bombings trying to unravel the role that Morarity is playing in the role of the murder of some of Europe's leaders. Complicating things Watson is getting married and Holmes fears the loss of his partner in solving crime.

The film adapts elements from a number of Doyle's stories and integrates original elements as well which makes it both familiar and just different enough for those who have read the stories to be a bit surprised.
The Blu-ray looks quite nice with a sharp presentation and the colors are slightly desaturated much like the first film. Detail and grain are quite evident throughout and this is a nice looking presentation of the film.

Interestingly, unlike the first film Holmes makes mistakes or seems a step behind at times as he's finally met a worthy advesary in Professor Morarity a man as brilliant as Holmes who takes pleasure in outwitting him.

The audio sounds terrific with an immersive lossless presentation. Audio is clear and we do get subtitles in English and Spanish.

Now the bad news: If you are an itunes user this uses Ultraviolet which a lot of folks don't care for as it's a streaming service for your computer, etc. It does state it in bold print in the back. According to the fine print (and I'm getting old because I could barely read it), Ultraviolet is not compatable with itunes --unless I misread the fine print--could we print this a bit LARGER next time guys?).

You do get a DVD with the film as well as the Blu-ray.

Special features include a visual commentary track using the Maximum Movie Mode hosted by Downey, storyboards, ""Focus Points"" (which are also accessible via the Max Movie Mode)and stills galleries. There is a movie ap that can be downloaded to a tablet or phone (I didn't use this on my ipad--wasn't interested in watching two screens at once).

The special features that we do get are quite nice and compliment an already fun movie. For those folks that want to watch this on a portable device via itunes, you're out of luck. For those that hate Ultraviolet, you're out of luck. I do wish that Ultraviolet would go away or at least improve at some point but I don't expect that to happen since Hollywood (who, by the way, insists on putting new piracy notices that you have to sit through twice as long--really folks if there are pirates out there do you think 1) they care 2)they didn't use software to skip that and just copy the movie?--end of my rant about fooolish things).

""A Game of Shadows"" is an enjoyable adventure and is actually (IMHO) a better movie than ""Sherlock Holmes"" with sharper writing and plotting.

This isn't your father's Holmes (whether that be Jeremy Brett's portrayal of Holmes or Basil Rathbone) nor is it the same as the almost sociopathic portayal by the marvelous Benedict Cumberbatch on the BBC series ""Sherlock"")with Downey giving us his own unique performance that hints a the darkness of the character but still makes him fun.

4439784,4,B004OC006Y,"When this ""New"" Sherlock Holmes movie series was first announced, I thought old Doyle would be turning over in his grave, but I gave it a viewing and appreciated this new ""style"" of Sherlock Holmes obviously designed to appeal to a new younger generation. This second installment had the usual ""Explosions and chases"" of our modern movie system, where even the year 1891 can be made to look very fast paced with modern morals and Victorian style ""warrior women"", the fictional mythology of modern cinema.
These things being said, the movie is remarkably plotted, taking a new angle on the ""Final Problem"" of the original written account. Downey and Law work very well together and the supporting cast is excellent. This movie follows the first in visual effects of the dirt of London street life, the peculiar Zimmer music hinting at Bohemian melodies, and conveys a sense of class in scenes from Mozart's Don Giovanni drama (imitating Amadeus?) with the exact scene of King Leopold and subsequent dragging down to hell. Another scene seems to be stolen straight from ""A Beautiful Mind"" where Watson's former room has been converted into a ""conspiracy map"", similar to the garage scene in the Russel Crowe movie.
There are several curiousities in this work, one of which is the use of an 1889 Oswald Wirth Tarot Deck by Holmes when he consults a gypsy, and camoflauge techniques by Holmes that in the beginning are a reminder of ""Robin and Marian"" with apologies to Sean Connery. We are given a hint of the Diplomacy era prior to World War 1 (The Fall of Eagles?) The Arms of Krupp? As Holmes races across Europe trying to figure out the plan of the Evil mastermind. The result is a final encounter at a new and fashionable castle overlooking ""Reichenbach Falls"".

I loved the books and found myself searching old Books stores for old copies of these classic works.
The stories of Sherlock always amazed and astounded me with his autistic nature.
But one day I came across the final book or the death of Sherlock Holmes.
I was devastated.
When you see that Irene Adler is killed I almost lost hope in this film.  The movie industry too often takes the best characters or enemies who were in multiple stories and kill them off too quickly.  Irene who was his equal, his secret love, and Sherlock's dance on the dark side dies...

then when the film gets you back in we pan to a large Waterfall and I knew EXACTLY where this was going.  It was the Death of Sherlock Holmes.  I again wanted to destroy this movie.  I was so sick of this film... but I must say that it did redeem itself with the story line that comes after the funeral.

This film did what great film should do; it engaged, it enthralled, and it caused me to feel up and then be dashed, only to bring me back and dash my spirits again and finally leave me with a teasing '?'.

4439841,2,B004OC006Y,"The production values for this movie were excellent, let me start off.  The movie also brings some of the devices from the first movie which is both good and bad.

Holmes' ability to predict the future of confrontations in slow motion is back. His aloof personality is also back.  It's a perfect role for Robert Downey Jr. and also a great character performance by Jude Law.

However, the plot, the pace and the writing are duds.  Executive summary: a replay of the first movie with less excitement, a weaker plot and nothing to add.

The plot centers around a contrived conflict between Dr. Moriarity and Holmes.  The basis of the conflict is, essentially, a battle of super-wits.  Later, the movie introduces an actual plot... something about Moriarity profiting and inciting a world war.  Utterly forgettable and tired.  Their conflict is also as tired as some of the scripted banter that tries to be much wittier than it actually is.  There are only three moderately developed characters (Holmes, Watson, Moriarity) and a host of forgotten supporting characters.  Even Madam Simza Heron, arguably one of the main characters, never becomes someone to care about.

I fell asleep.  Better to watch this when it comes to Starz, while cooking dinner or folding laundry.  Definitely not one for movie night.",1339632000,7,1305,4.976851851851852

Unfortunately this sequel loses the entire point of a Sherlock Holmes story: he's supposed to use his idiosyncratically brilliant deductive powers to solve mind-bending mysteries. In this movie Sherlock is more of an action figure who fights all the time, pursues a sloppy plot of international intrigue blah blah blah, and never solves anything. It's pretty sad: it turns out that a Sherlock without a confounding murder mystery is just an irritating twit with a few mildly colorful sidekicks. In a word: avoid.

Robert Downey Jr. shines as Sherlock Holmes - not the stuffy Englishman your grandmother was in love with, but a swashbuckling action hero with a razor-sharp mind. Jude Law is his perfect companion as the loyal and practical Dr. Watson, and Stephen Fry is absolutely astounding as Holmes' older brother Mycroft.  Last, but certainly not least, Jared Harris is chilling as the evil Professor Moriarty.  He brings every ounce of dastardly deviousness to the role and does not disappoint.

In regards to the ultraviolet digital copy:  No, it's not iTunes. Get over it! It's still a digital copy, and you CAN download it to your computer if you meet the software requirements.  If not, you can still stream it to your iPod Touch/iPhone/iPad.  And because it's stored in the cloud, you don't have to worry about it getting lost if your computer crashes.  Oh, and another thing they won't tell you:  when you activate your Ultraviolet account, they give you another movie for free.  I got He's Just Not That Into You.  It's not necessarily what I would have chosen for myself, but I'm okay with it - and they do give the option to choose another movie if you want.

Long story short (too late), DO NOT LET THE ULTRAVIOLET STOP YOU FROM BUYING THIS!  It's still a wonderful movie and if you don't want the digital copy, you don't have to get it.",1339545600,7,1614,4.714285714285714

4439862,5,B004OC006Y,"SHERLOCK HOLMES:  A GAME OF SHADOWS, is a shining exception to the Sequel Law.  (Sequel Law:  They suck.)  In this highly entertaining second offering, Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law take their reprised roles as Holmes and Watson to a higher level; they're grittier, more developed, deliciously nuanced, and even funnier.  As much as I enjoyed the original 'Sherlock Holmes', I liked the second installment even more.  (And here's hoping there's one more installment to complete the trifecta; such a box set would be a must-own in our DVD collection.)

There is a core group of four actors who make this exciting, high flying adventure such grand fun:  Downey and Law, of course, along with Jared Harris as the brilliant-yet-evil Professor Moriarity (a most formidable and dangerous adversary for Holmes), and Stephen Fry as Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock's eccentric older brother (who is hysterically funny).  There is plenty comedic relief here, from Watson's honeymoon train ride going awry, to quite the ostentatious bachelor party, to Mycroft making a most memorable entrance to Watson's blushing bride (Kelly Reilly).  And it's a good thing there are bountiful humorous moments, because there is a dark side to this film, epitomized by Moriarity's cunning evil, which sets the stage for some unbelievably astonishing action and special effects.  Director Guy Ritchie and his crew cut no corners here, and it shows; this is a white-knuckle thriller that promises to have you squirming in your seat.  It's entertaining indeed to watch Holmes and Watson attempt to thwart a world war, with an open ending that hints at least one more installment in this franchise is coming our way.  And will this reviewer enjoy such a development?  Elementary, my dear Watson!

Consumers do NOT like buying downgraded products. If we started with UV, we probably wouldn't notice. But going from Digital Copy to UV is an obvious downgrade. Flixter has horrible service. Having to download the app to your PC is horrible.

4439878,5,B004OC006Y,"Sherlock Holmes was one of my favorite movies of 2009, so my expectations for this film were high. I was not disappointed in the least. Though the first film was tighter, I enjoyed this one far more. Game of Shadows has a very ambitious plot, that falters somewhat half way through. Holmes and Watson's trip to Germany, while host to the most exciting scene in the movie, is a bit cluttered story wise. Everything makes sense, but it isn't until the end of the movie that you find out why.

Robert Downey Jr. is compared to Benedict Cumberbatch, star of the excellent BBC show ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sherlock-Season-One-Blu-ray/dp/B004132I20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sherlock: Season One [Blu-ray</a>]"", a comparison which I find unfair. While Cumberbatch is indeed brilliant in his portrayal, Downey is equally so in a completely different way. Their performances are apples and oranges, with the only similarities being that you will enjoy both. Jude Law, once again, shines as Watson. Him and Downey have chemistry, the likes of which I have never seen on film. The term bromance is tossed around too frequently these days, but it fits Holmes and Watson to a tee.

The villain of this film, Moriarty, played to perfection by Jared Harris, elevates an already entertaining film to something with some weight behind it. He is a foe of intelligence on par with Holmes and the game they play is fascinating to behold. While there may be one too many action sequences, the fight at the stag party, and the always wonderful Noomi Rapace is given nothing of real importance to do, this is, as stated above, an unfailingly fun, and wonderfully enjoyable movie, well worth your time and hard earned dollar. Highly Recommended.",1339459200,11,1770,5.207017543859649
4439879,5,B004OC006Y,"SHERLOCK HOLMES: GAME OF SHADOWS is the follow up to Robert Downey Jr.'s and Jude Law's very successful action-adventure SHERLOCK HOLMES. The entire cast is reassembled for GAME OF SHADOWS, including Kelly Reilly as Mary Watson and Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler.

GAME OF SHADOWS concerns the first showdown between Holmes and Professor Moriarity (Jared Harris), the brilliant but evil genius who is Holmes' nemesis. The year is 1891, and Europe is on edge due to a number of assassinations and bombings. Each nation is blaming the other, and it seems that World War I will break out 23 years early. Only Holmes realizes that Moriarity is behind it all, for reasons of his own.

Moriarity attempts to destroy Holmes by targeting Irene Adler and the Watsons. Fortunately, Holmes has new allies as well, including his older, smarter, even more eccentric brother Mycroft (Stephen Fry) and Madam Simsa Heron (Noomi Rapace) who leads a gang of revolutionaries once coopted by Moriarity but now fighting against him.

GAME OF SHADOWS outshines the initial film. The pacing is faster, the scriptwriting more crisp, the humor more incisive, the action less pyrotechnic. If the film has a relative weakness, it is in the female leads. Kelly Reilly and Noomi Rapace both give well-acted performances in inconsequential ""pretty girl"" roles. Rachel McAdams is wonderful, but her part in GAME OF SHADOWS is much abbreviated. This is really a men's buddy film nonpareil. Downey and Law, having given us the backstory of their characters in the original film, have incredible chemistry together as Holmes and Watson, and are able to explore in depth the complicated, sometimes ridiculous, often rivalrous relationship between the two men. All in all, it is great fun.

I was then introduced to Basil Rathbone's movie version of the sleuth. Over the years, I've read a few of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's short stories and loved them all. Unlike many Sherlockians, I had no problem with Robert Downey Jr. playing the character. I thoroughly enjoyed his unique, physically fit, and active exploits in Guy Ritchie's first ""Sherlock Holmes"" film.

Upon a second viewing, this is still a great movie. That's not to say it doesn't have its flaws. The only real issue is the beginning of the film, where it feels like Ritchie is trying to frontload it a bit too much. The rest of the movie moves along at a good pace and keeps viewers riveted. Don't try watching this in a noisy room or while doing something else because it's way too complex and you won't be able to keep up.

4439896,1,B004OC006Y,"Loved the movie, couldn't wait for it to be released on Blu-Ray.  Did however make the mistake of purchasing the Blu-Ray combo pack, you think I would have learned after experiencing previous digital copy issues.  This whole digital copy scam has pushed me over the edge regarding spending anymore of my hard earned money on this crap.  What happened to the good old days when you could download a copy of a movie to ITunes or your computer, now you spend more money and have to contend with the studios and their numerous partners?  With this combo pack I was forced into setting up yet another account, this time with Flixster, and had to go through the process TWICE to then wind up with NOTHING.  I can't use the digital copy on my IPad, IPhone, Kindle Fire or laptop so I'm stuck with having to either view on my desktop or use the DVD copy to view on my laptop, not exactly what I would call a Digital Copy.

Maybe I'm missing something but buying a digital copy should mean I can use it on any of my compatible devices.  Ultra-Violet is nothing more than a file cabinet which stores your ""digital copies"" but then you have to sign into another partner account (i.e., Sony, Universal, Warner Bros., Flixster) to view the movie only on your desktop.  So now I have to log into my Ultra-Violet account then get redirected to another site with a different login and then still can't download to my devices.  If that's not a scam I'm not sure what is!!!!  Some of the ""partners"" do allow ITunes copies but each partner is different so you aren't guaranteed you will be able to use the digital copy on any Apple products (IPad, IPhone) or an Android/Kindle Fire device. Flixster supposedly allows download to Apple and Android devices but after numerous attempts I was unable to download this movie to either my IPad or Kindle Fire.

Also of note if you do purchase any of these Digital Copies they all have EXPIRATION DATES on them, some expire within three months of when the disc is released; I already got burnt by not noticing the expiration date on a movie.

While I am against piracy I can certainly understand why people are driven to it; the studios are forcing people to go with illegal copies of current films because they are making it so difficult to download and use these digital copies.  They are penalizing customers who are making legal purchases!

Also what's with Amazon, I purchase all these Blu-Ray combo packs and only one of them was available through my Amazon Instant Video Library, why when I purchase a combo pack from Amazon are those movies not immediately available in my Video Library list or worse why do I have to pay even more to get an Amazon digital copy?

Bottom Line: These Ultra-Violet/Digital Copy movies don't work so I may be old fashioned but unless it's some extraordinary movie I'll go back to buying plain old DVD's, it'll allow me to watch on my TV, computer and laptop, which is all I'm able to do with most of these combo packs AND it'll save me money and a lot of aggravation!!!!!!

NOTED ADDED: Seems that the specials on this Blu-Ray Combo pack on nonexistant and the ones that are included you need to download a free IPad App and you also need to have a Facebook Account to use.  Again I guess we're just old fashion but not everyone in the world uses Facebook or has an IPad so that leaves you with nothing - thanks for that Warner Brothers.",1339459200,48,3398,4.50814332247557
4439897,5,B004OC006Y,"First off, I gotta say as much as I loved the first one, the second is even better! The chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law is the best and Jared Harris was an excellent Moriarty.

Now, for those who've had trouble with the download thing, here's the deal...

Step 1: Go to Flixster. Click ""Redeem Now"" under the 'Redeem Your UltraViolet Digital Copy' title.
Step 2: Scroll down and click on ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows.""
Step 3: Click ""Get Started."" It'll take you through setting up an account and linking it with UltraViolet.
Step 4: After linking the two accounts, make sure you go back to the FLIXSTER homepage (I got stuck on the UltraViolet webpages which is what threw me).
Step 5: Repeat Steps 1 and 2 if need be to get back to where you enter the code.
Step 6: You'll be directed to enter the code and download Flixster. Do so (enter the code that's on the insert), and install the Flixter program. (It can take awhile to install.)
Step 7: With the Flixster program installed and the code entered (through the Flixter webpage), open up the Flixster program on your computer. Your video library should have the movie listed. Click download if you want it saved on your computer.

TA DA! Hope everyone can follow what I wrote okay. If you don't want to use the memory, you can just stream it from the Flixster library, but that requires an internet connection to watch it.

4439900,1,B004OC006Y,"Unfortunately... I have to add my lumps as well as the majority of other reviewers. The Motion picture industry continues to drive a wedge between themselves and the buyer by instituting things like this. Even digital copy rights are rediculous, due to the fact that you can only download one version to one type of device (either WMV for windows based players, or Quicktime for Apple). This Ultraviolet thing takes it one step further.

In my humble opinion... When honest buyers aren't afforded the benefit of having there own personal copy to share between members of the same household, you run the risk of them just going to get it illegally. If you want pirating to stop... stop doing crap like this. The music industry seems to have gotten the point.

Remember when they tried to make CDs ""unripable"" by encripting them. All it did was irritate the person buying it, because they couldn't play it on their MP3 device. Really short sited folks. DUMB!!!!",1339459200,15,959,4.806060606060606
4439901,1,B004OC006Y,"I am afraid that I cannot agree with the people who say this movie was a great film. It was not.  I loved the first Sherlock Holmes movie: I thought the depiction of Holmes and Watson by Downey and Law were the best I had ever seen.  I eagerly waited for this sequel to appear, fully expecting to enjoy it.  But I did not.

Now, I am going to discuss details of the movie here, so I suggest you read no further if you don't want to see such details.

First, what was the purpose of having Irene Adler in the movie, only to kill her off in the first 15 minutes?  She played no major role, and was never metioned again.  So why bother to include the character at all?  Furthermore, what was Irene doing working for Moriarty again?  From the last movie she knew he was murderous, could not be trusted and had thoroughly frightened her.  So why in the world would she work for him again?  She was far too smart to have come anywhere near him again, regardless of what he offered.

And speaking of Moriarty---the depiction of the character in this movie was more like a cartoon version of a villain than the dark, compelling and ingenious master criminal I was expecting.  He consistently murders anybody who works for him.  Not a smart move for any master criminal to make-----it does not take long for everybody to learn that you cannot be trusted, and that you kill your hirelings rather than pay them.  Nobody would work for you, for any reason.  Moriarty tries to get to Holmes by threatening Watson and his wife's lives.  He sends men with a machine gun to kill the newlyweds, on a crowded train, in the middle of the English countryside.  Really smooth move, there!  Moriarty comes across more like a low level mafia thug than a brilliant criminal mastermind.  And his big, secret, master plan?  Is it a plot to steal the crown jewels?  Counterfeit European currency?  Steal priceless works of art?  Kidnap a royal prince?  No.  He is going to make money by starting a world war and then selling guns.  I, for one, am underwhelmed.  Many men in real life made fabulous fortunes selling guns without needing to do anything more.  All Moriarty needed to do was sit back and watch the money roll in----completely legal and without all the extra effort. And he would be free to enjoy all that extra money in a world of luxury, not bothered by the destruction of a world war.

The movie wanders around looking for a plot, with an excess of fist fights,  knife fights, gunfights,  explosions and general mayhem.  They start out shooting small guns, then shoot bigger guns, then shoot really big guns, and then REALLY big guns.  All of this action might have looked good in a ""Lethal Weapon"" or ""Mission Impossible"" movie, but looked out of place in a Sherlock Holmes story.  It was boring and ridiculous.

Yes,  Downy and Law were great as their characters, Holmes and Watson.  And I loved the character of Watson's wife.  Frankly I think the movie would have benefitted from Mrs. Watson accompanying Holmes and Watson in their adventure, rather than a secondary ""gypsy girl"" character.  Mrs. Watson had already proven her nerve and intelligence earlier, and I can only imagine the conversation between the three during the adventure would have been thoroughly entertaining.  But I dearly wish these fine actors had been given a far better story to show off their talents in.

Holmes's brother,  Mycroft Holmes is depicted as an idiot and a buffoon.  This man who is supposed to be far more brilliant than Holmes himself,  is reduced to being a bit character and ""comedy relief"" with no real part in the story.

In fact the entire story staggers back and forth between vicious violence and slap stick foolishness.  Perhaps the makers of this movie thought the ""comedy"" would be a good element of the film, but they grossly overdid it.  Holmes ""disguises"" himself as a woman, complete with makeup,  then  gets his dress torn off by an enraged Watson, and spends the next part of the movie half naked,  while sexual innuendoes fly thickly. In another scene, it turns out that Holmes is afraid of horses, and is reduced to escaping the country riding a tiny Shetland pony.  During the peace summit ball, Holmes and Watson waltz together in each others arms in full view on the ballroom floor. (somthing that, at that time, would have disrupted the summit even more throughly than an murder, not to mention get them both arrested, imprisoned or possibly shot.)  The ""humor"" was such that I was expecting to see people throwing pies and farting in each other's faces.  Comedy needs to be sprinkled on with a spoon, not slathered on with a trowel. Otherwise the result is like something out of  ""National Lampoon"".

Another example,  Mycroft Holmes (an English gentleman of the upper class) is seen wandering blithely and completely naked through his home in front of Mrs. Watson----another man's wife, who is currently a guest in his home and under his protection.  This scene would not be funny if it took place in modern times---but in a story placed during the time of Victorian England?  It was barely acceptable for a woman's own husband to be naked in full daylight in their own bedroom with her!  But wandering around in the rooms of the mansion, in full view of the guests and servants?  This reduces it to the level of slap stick.

At the end of the film, Holmes is off with Moriarty, leaving Watson to stop an assassin from disrupting a peace conference.  Watson stops the assassination, but the conference is very much disrupted, and we never see or hear of any resolution to the scene.  Was war prevented or not?  We are not told.  And the infamous death scene, were we have Holmes and Moriarity going over the falls completely fails to be either dramatic or emotional.  I heartily wish that movie makers would stop jumping on that weak plot device.  Arthur Conan Doyle had Holmes go over the falls in his original story, because he was tired of his character and wanted to be done with him.  It didn't turn out, and so Doyle had to cobble together a story to bring Holmes back to life.  Doyle did not consider either story to be his best work, or his favorite.

At any rate, this movie was a disappointment. I can only hope that, if another one is made, it will be better than this one was.  Why, so often, does it seem that the first movie is great, and then the next one stinks?

If you are eager to see this movie, as I was, I suggest you rent it and not waste money on buying it.",1339459200,14,6487,4.563746747614918

4439904,5,B004OC006Y,"Let me just start with the Ultraviolet copy crap. I personally don't buy movies for the digital copies, I buy the dvds(and sometimes Blu Rays) for the movies, nothing else.
I took my dad to see this sequel on the first screening. We are pretty big fans of the books, t.v. shows and other movies(possibly). We love the first one, but when we saw it, I don't think I've ever seen him laugh as hard(he never really laughs during a movie)as he did during this movie, A Game of Shadows. One of the very few movies that completely surpasses the 1st one in pretty much every way. My brother, who doesn't really care for movies like this, actually liked it quite a bit.
I won't give any spoilers, for anyone who hasn't seen these movies. If you enjoyed the first one, you'll love the 2nd one. As for watching it in theaters, the end had the whole room laughing!! Hard! Even my dad laughed quite a bit. This movie is a must own in my opinion.",1339372800,3,933,4.306818181818182
4439905,4,B004OC006Y,"Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law return as Holmes and Watson, along with Rachel McAdams, Kelly Reilly, and other minor characters from the previous film. Downey and Law have the same fantastic chemistry as before. Though, Downey seems to be acting even more eccentric than ever as he follows the clues and his wild theories on a high speed adventure across Europe. Noomi Rapace as Madam Simza, a gypsy who Downey and Law must team up with along the way. Simza is a mysterious character, though a bit wooden. Jared Harris does an excellent job as the infamous Professor Moriarty. As Holmes' greatest adversary in the original novels, Moriarty is the only person who is on the same intellectual level as Holmes.

A Game of Shadows is a strong sequel to Downey's first Sherlock Holmes film. I enjoyed this story a bit more in fact, as there were no elements of the bizarre mysticism of the first. This was another wild ride of humor, drama, mystery, and action-packed adventure.  The mystery and suspense kept me guessing and on the edge of my seat. And the many comic relief lines had me laughing out loud. The suspense built to a massive climactic ending that was a bit predictable, yet completely enjoyable all the same. I hope this series continues with the same fine actors and keeps the light-hearted humor paired with intense action and intrigue.

Well, since I know nothing about UltraViolet digital copies, I can't say anything about it.  What I will say is that I had blast watching this movie.  I didn't LOVE the first movie but since my husband was a huge fan, he drug me to this one.  And I was glad he did.

You had to know that when Watson announced his intentions to marry, Holmes would not take it well.  As expected he dives deeply into the recesses of his mind to find a way to catch his nemesis, Moriarty, and distract himself from the impending wedding.  But soon Holmes finds out that Watson and his new bride are to be targets of the villain and must save them.

The cast in this movie is amazing.  Robert Downey, Jr. excels at the role of Holmes, Jude Law does a fine job as Mr. Watson, and Jared Harris is impeccable as the evil-genius Moriarty.  The plot in this movie is fun, thrilling, and keeps you guessing.  Will there be another one??  Maybe (and hopefully) so.",1339113600,6,1026,4.37037037037037

4439910,3,B004OC006Y,"SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS isn't a necessary film.  Okay?  The first SHERLOCK HOLMES was more than enough: a fun film that got decidedly less appealing the more you watched it (don't ask me how or why, but I saw it three times in theaters alone, so I know of what I speak).  But of course, the first film made enough money, and had built-in franchise appeal, so you knew a sequel was coming.

And here it is.  Holmes and Watson are taking up their ultimate arch-enemy, the thoroughly evil Professor Moriarty.  He's Holmes's equal in all capacities, both physical and mental.  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Moriarty was a shadowy entity; the one here is, by necessity, more transparent, though actor Jared Harris gives it his all (the script is at fault here, not the actor).  Back in the lead roles, Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law keep their chemistry intact; if nothing else, watch this film for the camaraderie between the two, it remains a highlight.  In supporting roles, Noomie Rapace, Amy Adams, and especially Stephen Fry give it their all, creating likable characters that we can relate to, if not entirely believe.

Overall, the film seems kind of lazy.  It takes a few chances early on (nothing too shocking, but stuff that you wouldn't necessarily expect a blockbuster film to do), and the climactic moment is a nice ode to the stories (and, just breaking it down, a good scene), but we're still left with the feeling: so what?  SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS is a fun time, definitely, but it's not something you'll want to watch as often as the first film.  Maybe because Guy Ritchie and company are merely repeating themselves?  Maybe Downey, Jr. and Law could go off and do another film together.  They are easily the best things here--two great actors enjoying themselves and their time together.",1338940800,4,1820,4.733333333333333

I was so disappointed when I saw UltraViolet copy next to the title, which like so many have already stated, is not really a digital copy at all. I liked the movie so much I pre-ordered it anyways, but just recently I came to my senses because it's not nearly worth the price as long as ultraviolet is attached to the product.

In contrast to Arthur Conan Doyle's stories, where Holmes is mature and seasoned, in the films he is played as brilliant but wild and erratic.  His relationship with Watson is now an egalitarian friendship: the more stable Watson is the anchor that keeps Holmes sane.  The second film, Game of Shadows, is a considerable improvement over the first.  The plot is ingenious and cleverly written.  The direction is outstanding, with fast pacing and good visuals, which bring the late nineteenth century to life.  There is more action than in the original stories - again, this is a reinterpretation for contemporary audiences.  The climactic scene, in which chess is used as a metaphor for the struggle between Holmes and his arch-nemesis Moriarty, is a nice touch.",1338595200,10,910,5.108108108108108

Yes, it's a pain because you can't just do a direct transfer from the disc to your computer/device but you still can get an actual copy of it.

Moriarty is as devious as ever and you really start to wonder if Holmes is in over his head. The final fight was very unexpected and quite fun. Finally, those who think the original films were true to the books should give the books a read (ie: Holmes never ever says ""Elementary my dear Watson"" nor is he some stuffy old man). The books/short stories are classics for a reason and still have relevancy.

Well, that was my loss - I completely LOVED this film! It's a rollicking, slam-bang, intelligent, witty and compelling update of the Sherlock Holmes canon, and surprisingly, in many cases it is closer to Arthur Conan Doyle's original concept of the characters than many earlier movies and TV shows have been. Doyle, remember, was writing popular, mass-market entertainments - and his Sherlock is not a stuffy, sedentary dude who just sits around in his armchair puffing his pipe and working out Great Deductions. The original Sherlock IS a man of action -- he is a boxer (yes, that's canon!) and in ""The Final Problem,"" where he fights Moriarty to the death at Reichenbach Falls, we learn he knows an Asian martial art called ""baritsu"" (there actually IS one called ""bartitsu,"" which may have been what Doyle meant). So RDJ's take on Sherlock is spot-on canonical -- manic, genius-brilliant, a bare-knuckle fighter, a martial-arts expert, a violinist, an imbiber of intoxicating substances (though they don't show his cocaine habit - interestingly, it was OK to mention it in Doyle's age, but in ours, it has to be Sherlock swigging stuff like formaldehyde and gypsy wine, although Mrs. Hudson does mention he survives on a diet of coffee and ""coca leaves""...).

RDJ's Holmes is also dashingly handsome, as is, for once, Dr. Watson (how could he not be, when played by Jude Law?). And this, too, makes absolute sense -- Watson was portrayed by Doyle as a wounded war hero recently returned from Afghanistan (that earlier Afghan conflict that England found itself embroiled in), so it would make sense that Watson would be fairly young and in fighting trim (Law uses a cane and limps a little, due to that war wound, but he's a mean hand with both a stick and a gun) -- not some old, querulous duffer as portrayed by so many earlier actors taking on Watson.

There's a fair amount of covert (and overt, hilariously enough!) slashiness (fan term for, er, ultra-bromance) going on - Holmes and Watson are definitely crushing on each other; they bicker and make up like a married couple, which is the ongoing in-joke of both movies (yup, I've seen the first one, now, too!). All this means the ladies don't get to do a whole lot -- ""The Woman"" of Holmes' life, Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) is in this movie only very briefly (and I'm not buying that she's gone for good...). Watson's new wife, Mary, gets booted early, too, but I can tell there's a lot more going on there - I'm liking Mary, and she gets to do a little a**-kicking of her own in this one. The leading lady of this movie is Noomi Rapace, playing the gypsy Madame Simza -- Noomi is the original Swedish ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"" and she's put on a few curves to take on this, her first big role in an American movie. She does well here, but her character is mostly a plot device to lead us to the middle of the web woven by Holmes' arch-nemesis, the ""Napoleon of crime,"" Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris of ""Mad Men,"" son of the late Richard Harris).

Now here is a villain worthy of Sherlock Holmes. Harris' Moriarty radiates menace, with his foxy face and yellowy teeth; he's here (in 1891)trying to create a sort of proto-World War I by taking over the whole line of products, ""from bullets to bandages"" -- including an armaments factory where some enormously anachronistic weapons are being manufactured, which becomes a setpiece battleground in the movie. Nicely done, too. Director Ritchie may have gone a bit overboard in his extreme slo-mo sequences, showing bullets crashing through and splintering trees as our heroes flee through a German forest, but it's all undeniably beautiful. The effect of his ""Holmes-o-vision"" (where Holmes -- and we -- ""see"" what will happen in a fight just before the fight takes place) is also very cool, especially when things don't quite turn out as Holmes pre-envisions them. It's especially effective in the final confrontation between Holmes and Moriarty at Reichenbach, where the two engage in one of the great cinematic chess matches of all time (and half of it is in their heads, not on the board! And yes, there's a ""chess advisor"" listed in the credits, so I have to assume the moves are all realistic...).

A large part of the joy of this movie is just seeing an ultra-intelligent character who also gets to be an action hero -- so often, intellect is downplayed in movies, or relegated to the bad guy (aren't the bad guys always the brainy ones?); or the intellectual is portrayed as a sedentary ""man of thought"" rather than action, as in most earlier Sherlocks. This Sherlock Holmes dares to break the mold, and for that I say ""Huzzah!"" and here's to many more in this series. Thumbs way up!",1336608000,11,5028,4.722095671981776

4439952,2,B004OC006Y,"Guy Ritchie's take on Sherlock Holmes is fast becoming formulaic.  All the elements are there to make it entertaining - but as in the first installment, this escapade isn't very thrilling.  Sherlock Holmes has been reinvented to become this zen taichi master with an uncanny sixth sense (watch the Chinese film HERO to see where Ritchie got his inspiration).  Which is fine for a moment, but then becomes the entire formula for every action sequence in the film.  Stop.  Rewind.  Flashback.  Explain how Sherlock anticipated / fixed something so that the ""threat"" to him/Watson/everyone else has been cleverly defused.  Assassins; bullets from guns; exploding trains - everything gets the same deconstruction, I-told-you-so treatment.

Beautifully filmed, superbly casted and styled, witty repartee - Sherlock Holmes is just lacking in one critical area: Suspense. It would be nice to have a plot that at least gives more of a homage to the original sleuthing of Holmes.  He's become a parody or mutation of the original idea - which is fine, but Ritchie and team could do better plot-wise.  All smoke and bluster and little to show for it.

Christopher Nolan should be doing Sherlock Holmes...it needs a lot more danger and less posing.",1336176000,7,1237,5.099502487562189
4439953,3,B004OC006Y,"I've got to concur with the review that talks about pawning off an online ""UltraViolet"" license as a digital copy. I've played around with this technology and it is not ready for prime time. I don't want to have to go to multiple places to watch movies that I've purchased.  If I want to watch a movie on my iPad/iPhone, then I should be able to launch it from the Video's App.  I shouldn't be forced to go into some buggy 3rd party app to stream a movie that I theoretically purchased.

But in all honesty, I feel Warner Bros in general has not been playing fair in regards to ""Digital Copies"".  Even prior to UltraViolet, they often distributed digital copies with new releases but only allowed a very short time frame to redeem those copies via iTunes or for use in Windows Media Player.  In my case, I always bought the more expensive Combo packages in part to get the digital copy.  However, I just started redeeming those digital copies recently after getting an iPad. With almost every studio, I didn't have a problem redeeming the digital copies - even if the blu-ray or DVD was several years old.  But I was locked out of almost every Warner Bros digital copy because it was ""expired"".  The expiration date was listed on the disk, but in fine print.  I find it ludicrous that an unused digital copy redemption code should ever expire.

But back to the movie - Sherlock Holmes 2 was a very entertaining movie, though I felt the first movie had a more logical flow. And with Sherlock - logic is EVERYTHING.  This movie seems to move from scene to scene often with very tenuous connections and a thin plot to hold things together.  But with that said, Robert Downey Jr & Jude Law are both great in the movie and it's the quintessential popcorn movie to enjoy on a Friday night.

My new philosophy - if a movie comes with a true Digital Copy, then I'll buy the blu-ray combo pack.  If it comes with a UltraViolet copy, I'll bypass the blu-ray and just buy the 1080p digital copy on iTunes.",1334793600,10,1994,4.4423076923076925

Even the relationship of Sherlock with Mr. Watson seems tedious. The good doctor isn't just a straight man for Sherlock to zing with one liners. Reminded me more of Abbot and Costello.

4439966,1,B004OC006Y,"I loved the first Holmes outing with Downey Jr. and Law.  I missed the sequel in the theaters and would normally purchase this film site unseen by pre-ordering from Amazon.com (this review focuses on the scam of Ultraviolet and not the movie--I'm giving the movie five stars without ever seeing it and just hearing what my brother thought of it). HOWEVER, after the burn I received when pre-ordering ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" from Amazon I will NEVER do so again.  I enjoyed TGWTDT movie. When I went to retrieve the digital copy is when all things went south. I had no exposure to this Ultraviolet scam.  I complained to the movie company (Sony) and they told me they could not issue a code to download a digital copy from iTunes. This put me over the edge because my wife purchased the final Harry Potter film (Deathly Hallows Part 2) as a gift and it also only came with an ultraviolet copy. When I took my case to Warner Bros. they sent me a code for an iTunes download within 24 hours. Sony said that is something they're unable to do when I complained about the Dragon Tattoo movie (Amazon.com never got back to me when I complained about the ultraviolet copy for TGWTDT).

So long story short, I would have already PRE-ORDERED the newest installment in the Holmes saga helmed by Ritchie. However, I'm just going to wait and spend my dollars at Apple's iTunes so I can have a truly digital copy.  I'll keep my eyes open at my local Wal-Mart for a good deal on the Blu-Ray a few weeks after the release.

4439971,4,B004OC006Y,"Ham and eggs, salt and pepper, Holmes and Watson. Some things just naturally go together. Yes, our intrepid tag team is back to a sooty, soiled London, with ever more outrageous plots and counter-plots, wry asides, hairbreadth escapes and goofy disguises. Once again we see Holmes' slow-motion mental preview for the next bout of fisticuffs before we see it unfold in blinding speed, exactly as planned.

This time Professor Moriarty makes his debut in this series, so we're talking world domination here, not just Jolly Old England. Naturally we recognize faces from the 2009 film and the audience laughs when they appear.

Once again Guy Ritchie (""Sherlock Holmes"") directs:
  * Robert Downey Jr (""Iron Man"") returns as our dauntless detective, doing his darnedest to derail that infernal wedding! (...and save the world.)
  * Jude Law (""Hugo"") is, once again, his faithful sidekick, Dr. John Watson, who is Holmes' equal in every way, it's just that he wants to get married.
  * Noomie Rapace (""The Millennium Trilogy"") introduces Sim, an ingenious fortune-telling gypsy, trying to locate her brother.
  * Rachel McAdams (""Midnight in Paris"") returns as Irene Adler, an important woman in Holmes' life.
  * Jared Harris (""The Ward"") is Professor Moriarty, one of fiction's best nemeses. He and Holmes share a mutual admiration for each other that adds to the fun.

Sometimes things just get too, too cute, and the ""bromance"" between Holmes and Watson has them dancing together, almost kissing, and Holmes is clearly jealous when faced with the idea of Watson getting married. How would Sir Arthur Conan Doyle feel about this? I'm just sayin'...

Personally, I appreciate the women in this series: they don't trip while running in the forest or need a strong man to save them, we find them serious, resourceful and focused. Of course with this being a Guy Ritchie film, they also know martial arts!

Remember, we're talking world domination, so you may expect gunshots and some blowie uppie stuff; for the most part, this 129-minute PG-13 comedy keeps us entertained and we never have to cover our eyes. Whew!

Guy Ritchie's big-budget big-screen treatments of their adventures, with the first self-titled film, and now with A GAME OF SHADOWS, handle the character deftly but with a wink in his eye and a manic spring in his step rather than the traditional visage of a frown, a magnifying glass and a hunting cap. This not-entirely-alternate vision of the character has more to do with the casting of Robert Downey Jr. as the world's greatest detective of the Victorian age as much as anything else. Downey's Holmes is constantly exercising his mind with new devices, new disguises and new mysteries as well as constantly abusing his body with various chemicals (in this film, we see him drinking embalming fluid early on). He's also doing everything he can to insinuate himself in the life of his only friend and partner, the erstwhile and begrudgingly faithful Dr. Watson, who is also given new life by Jude Law as more of a masculine and independent man of action rather than his more common interpretation of the portly sycophant hanging on Holmes' every word. Law's Watson would, at times, rather be as far away as possible from Holmes as possible than being his eternally loyal, eunuch-like companion.

With A GAME OF SHADOWS, we are introduced (beyond cryptic references in the first film) to Professor James Moriarty (played perhaps too stone-faced by Jared Harris), nicknamed The Napoleon of Crime and famously Holmes' arch-enemy. At the film's opening, according to Holmes' massive investigation, has already started a plan that looks to throw all of Europe into chaos and war. The endgame, or course, is unseen. Meanwhile, Watson readies to wed his fiancee Mary (Kelly Reilly, reprising her role) and Holmes and his Secret Service brother Mycroft (played with relish by Stephen Fry) intend to take him to his bachelor party. Naturally, the place they end up going to has an entirely different purpose for Holmes than it does for Watson. He investigates a gypsy fortune-teller (Noomi Rapace, the Swedish actress who played Lisbeth Salander in the original MILLENNIUM trilogy, as well as the star of the upcoming sci-fi epic PROMETHEUS) who Moriarty has targeted for murder. She, like Irene Adler (also reprised here in a much smaller role by Rachel McAdams), becomes a reluctant part of the investigation after being saved by Holmes. However the stakes change again for Holmes, who was more self-serving in the investigation rather than personally invested, when Moriarty commits a heinous act that wounds Holmes more deeply than he lets on, but also announces his intention to make Watson and his new bride ""collateral damage"" in their game. This, and the other atrocity that Moriarty committed, force Holmes to take more proactive steps to protect the Watsons. They travel from London to Paris to Geneva, discovering new information, gathering new allies and facing new enemies as the labrynthine plot of Moriarty begins to unravel, until it all culminates at a peace summit at Reichenbach Falls, a place famous in the lore of the mental and physical combat of Holmes and Moriarty.

The super slow-mo techniques used in the first film to display Holmes' combat acumen is utilized here with an exciting unpredictability since there are occasionally other players at work whose assistance can be unexpected, and makes it as enjoyable if not more so than the first film. Also the same can be said for his myriad glances at seemingly insignificant items and showing how they play out later. The set-pieces are terrific, such as the fight at the bachelor party, the train sequence, and the arms factory. The major set piece, much like the warehouse explosion in the first film now takes place in a dark forest with several pursuers and a very VERY big cannon, and it's terrific, but Ritchie's technical expertise was never in question. He knows how to make a film look good.

The problems I do have with the film are mostly in the performance category. Jared Harris has never been one of my favorite actors, and he plays Moriarty mostly as a cold fish, whose placid take on the character is not one of any flamboyance or real menace, with the exception of one scene when he sings along to a Schubert opera as he tortures Holmes. Noomi Rapace is criminally wasted here for such a volatile and vibrant performer. It's not her fault; her part is just terribly underwritten and she does a lot with it, but it's like she's hardly there. Also, Eddie Marsan as the inherently inept Inpector Lestrade is, with the exception of one 30-second scene, is completely absent from this film; a sad outcome for someone who is a vital part of the Holmes mythology and was such a vital part of the previous film.

The other problem that I have is with the climactic confrontation between Holmes and Moriarty at Reichenbach Falls. I understand what they did in the context of the film; it's more of a war between minds than it is a war between bodies. However, there isn't any kind of sense of satisfaction that the whole film would be leading up to a major climactic physical confrontation. After all, they are both physically adept and, at least in common lore, they are both master swordsmen. It would have been nice to get something more out of the ending. Perhaps screenwriters Kieran and Michele Mulroney (having only one independent film to their names) were a little out of their depth on a major studio outing.

Sorry... one last problem: The film seems far too short. There are scenes that either could have been shortened or entirely cut in order to make room for scenes of greater humor, drama, or character. The film ends too abruptly and it seems like it could have been at least fifteen minutes longer.

However, the scenes that shine brightest are the scenes between Downey and Law. They have a great, effortless chemistry that translates to an easily believable friendship on the screen. Fry is terrific fun as well, and McAdams continues to play Irene Adler with a flirty yet deadly side, although her role in this film is greatly diminished.

Downey, as per usual, is terrific as Holmes. He enjoys playing this role, and that's evident. He's extremely clever as a performer and plays Sherlock Holmes with a vitality and bawdiness never seen before. Law as Watson is equally good as his frustration with Holmes' antics builds to blind rage at moments, all the while deeply caring about Holmes as his friend and always feels the need to stand by him.

All in all, this is a very solid 3.5 out of 5 star film, and although it lacks the same punch as the first film, I'd still stand in line to see Downey and Law be Holmes and Watson again.",1333843200,6,7976,5.3548644338118025

4439975,4,B004OC006Y,"As a stuffy Canon purist who despised the first movie for its painfully out of character portrayals and Holmes' utter slovenliness, I can say with honesty that despite my reservations,'A Game of Shadows' not only outshined its predecessor, at its heart was more substance than I ever thought possible for what I'd dismissed as a mindless action flick. Guy Ritchie clearly took pains to correct much of what was broken in his '09 effort, from the little touches to the major issues regarding the disjointed feel to his directing. I was relieved to note that there were improvements made in cleaning up Holmes' intolerable slovenliness - though by no means does he display the ""quiet primness of dress"" Watson wrote him as having, he is slightly more of a conventionally dressed gentleman here. Slightly. And while RDJ's Holmes is far from the ""quiet thinker of Baker Street"", here we see performances that become entirely more recognizable.

The modernity and steampunk elements have been toned down somewhat, and the fact that two completely different (and talented) writers had scripted this one was glaringly obvious. We have a Holmes whose intelligence has been dulled for the sake of comic relief, I am sad to say, but in this film it is done in a more tolerable - even endearing - manner. I also confess to despising Jude Law's Watson in the first film, for what I thought was an uncalled for level of hostility. Best of all was the fact that the razor edge to his character was blunted in the sequel, and we we are given a Watson who is exasperated, yet lurking underneath was a palpable fondness not present in the first installment. I could believe that underneath it all was a friendship, and that honestly made all the difference in convincing me this was the man who would willingly follow Holmes to the ends of the earth. We are shown the camaraderie and affection between Holmes and Watson that existed in Doyle's stories, and understand how it hurt them both when the doctor marries Mary Morstan. Regardless of how you view their relationship, this did pain Holmes in Canon, and I've never seen that heartbreak rendered so beautifully and respectfully as it was here.

I was especially taken with Jared Harris' performance as Professor Moriarity, and the back story surrounding him has quickly become a favourite with me. He was quite convincing as an amoral intellect to rival the foremost mind of his time - when they clash, it is genuinely frightening, and the shivers come not because we think he's some volatile nutter, but because his decided lack of a conscience becomes a true counterweight to Holmes' sense of justice. Holmes of Canon was a flawed man (why we love him, honestly) but he was also a good man. He would have come to the same conclusions about humanity and the coming wars as Moriarity did in this film, but opposed them all the same. He is a worthy opponent, and we feel this throughout.

Of course, I had my issues, mainly with the overdone action sequences that I find boring and the scene in the train where Holmes is decked out in drag. But these quibbles are easy to overlook when the movie was such a fresh take on 'The Final Problem', when we were given such a beautiful representation of the love (whether you see it platonic or otherwise) between Holmes and Watson, and that memorable ending scene where all Holmes' logic is cast to the wayside with one selfless act. It was truly gorgeous, and elevated this from being just another action flick to an actual relevant movie pastiche. While it doesn't approach the loyalty as that of the BBC adaptation, it does do ACD's immortal characters justice this time around.

And whether you are a Sherlockian (who possibly loathed the '09 movie) or just interested in the mystery/action elements, I doubt you'll regret seeing this.",1333670400,3,3819,4.7730711043872915

The problem for me, and my digital movie collection is, that the UltraViolet Digital Copy isn't a digital copy at all, and even after giving this means of digital media viewing a chance, I've found the download to be clunky, slow, and mostly unbearable, and rarely available at times when I might want to watch, like during air travel.  When I complained to Warner Bros. about this very subject (after purchasing ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows II""), Warner Bros. graciously offered me an Itunes version of the film.  The WB offer certainly was a giant step to creating good will and at the same time seemed a bit of a rejection of the format they were trying to shove at me (claiming it was a digital copy).  For me, I think being forced to take something that I don't want, all the while telling me that it's the digital copy that I do want has caused me to loose some of the love for collecting movies.  Oh, I'm sure I'll still purchase and watch movies, but I'll think twice about taking the combo Blu-ray/Ultra Violet movies.",1333065600,6,1558,4.388888888888889
4439979,3,B004OC006Y,"In the first film made in 2009, Robert Downey Jr.'s Sherlock Holmes used his brain and brawn. Now in the sequel ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows"" he is seen using only the latter. What was once a refreshing take on the well-known fictional character now becomes a kind of superhero trying to save the world from the archvillain. The second Holmes movies is a more action-packed, if derivative, sequel, for better or worse.

In ""A Game of Shadows"" Holmes and newly-wed Watson must confront Professor James Moriarty, the mastermind of crime. Unfortunately, the writers team Michele Mulroney Kieran Mulroney, it seems, could not come up with a better idea than throwing references to the source material - several character names like Colonel Sebastian Moran (yes, from ""The Adventure of the Empty House"") and lines from the book (""Come at once if convenient; if inconvenient come all the same"") - into a typical storyline for Hollywood action movies.

Had the story been more interesting, this could be still OK. Or had Professor Moriarty been more charismatic than the one played here by Jared Harris, all these things might be excused. As it is, the thin plot devoid of creativity and imagination hardly deserves the name of Moriarty.

Noomi Rapace plays a fortune teller Simza, who may hold a key to Moriarty's latest grand criminal plan. Even the talented player, whose electrifying performance gave life to the character of Lisbeth Salander in the Swedish version of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"" cannot save the one-dimensional heroine from becoming a stereotype.  Stephen Fry's portrayal as Sherlock's brother Mycroft Holmes serves only as comic relief, which I think is a misguided idea.

After all, this is a movie directed by Guy Ritchie, whose style has not changed much since ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" - lots of stylized visuals in action scenes, often with smoking guns and flying bullets. ""A Game of Shadows"" has a lot of action scenes, together with Holmes as a martial artist predicting the opponents' next moves, frequently shot in slow motion. Now I start to think it is too much this time.",1332720000,24,2126,4.96067415730337
4439980,4,B004OC006Y,"I'm holding out for when Robert Downey, Jr. takes on the role of Louis Pasteur or maybe Lawrence Welk, just to see how he twists them to suit his insouciant temperament. There are folks out there raking Downey, Jr. over the coals because, by gum, dude is not playing the Great Detective in the manner done by Rathbone or Brett or currently being done by Cumberbatch. I love Sherlock Holmes. But I'm also a proponent of slaying sacred cows when appropriate. In my eyes, what Robert Downey, Jr. brings to the table supplants all fuddy-duddies and their disgruntled harrumphs. SHERLOCK HOLMES: A GAME OF SHADOWS is ridiculous, yes. Ridiculously entertaining.

If you're anticipating a cerebral armchair detective, brother, you must not have seen 2009's SHERLOCK HOLMES. This Holmes is cerebral AND scruffier AND decidedly a man of action, this last bit referenced by A. Conan Doyle in SIGN OF FOUR, but an aspect which most folks have glossed over. Holmes, canonically, is a bare knuckles amateur pugilist, as well as a student of the martial arts of baritsu (or bartitsu). It's this physicality which director Guy Ritchie chooses to emphasize. Maybe the coolest gimmick in the first film is Holmes' application of his deductive powers to predict an opponent's next move in a scrap. We see him visualizing his counter-moves and then executing them. Ritchie takes this gimmick and extrapolates to wonderful effect.

In the first film, Holmes' archnemesis was merely a figure in the shadows, puppeteering events. In this sequel, Professor James Moriarty comes to the fore, and Ritchie knew better than to eff with the Holmes-Moriarty dynamics. If ever there was a match for Holmes' dazzling intellect, it's this daytime Oxford don's. Whispered in certain circles as ""the Napoleon of Crime,"" Moriarty has felt Holmes nipping at his heels, here and there putting a dent in his criminal empire. Jared Harris is a stark contrast to Downey, Jr. Whereas Downey, Jr.'s Holmes can be at times jittery and often airily impudent, Harris' Moriarty is composed and self-assured in his power and influence. You don't get a better sense of this than in the scene in which he and Irene Adler are dining in a restaurant, a venue Irene Adler had selected for its very public (and, therefore, safe) atmosphere. But, it turns out, not so safe, as the professor proceeds to chillingly demonstrate his reach. The big bad is so formidable and time and again stumps Holmes so effortlessly that the detective is forced to compliment him: ""My horror at your crimes is matched only by my admiration at the skill it took to achieve them.""

The story indulges in a bit of globe-hopping as the chase leads Holmes and company from a fully-realized Victorian London to Paris to Germany to Switzerland. I will say that the plot is tortuous and torturous. In a nutshell, Moriarty is working towards destabilizing the western civilization, trying to push the nations into war. Moriarty, owner of a gigantic munitions factory, then stands to profit. Sherlock Holmes, in his stand against Moriarty, faces anarchist bombers, acrobatic Cossack assassins, exploding trains, collapsing edifices, and having to ride a horse. To help whittle down Moriarty's minions, Holmes recruits a gypsy fortune teller (Noomi Rapace) and his big brother Mycroft (a delightfully sly Stephen Fry). And, of course, Doctor Watson.

Proving that it wasn't a one-time thing, Downey, Jr. and Jude Law exert that same marvelous chemistry. These guys just play off each other perfectly. Again, it's gratifying to have a Dr. Watson who isn't a lapdog. Watson, in fact, tends to roll his eyes at Holmes' excesses. Jude Law lends Watson resolve and big brassy huevos; I love that the good doctor - who, if one recalls, is a war veteran - is just as handy in a tight spot as Holmes is. And to demonstrate that Holmes holds his Boswell in deep esteem, even in the brains department, he relies on Watson to apply his own observational skills to prevent an assassination. It must be noted that Watson agrees to sidekick duties once again, albeit reluctantly, having just gotten married to Mary Morstan (Kelly Reilly). This says something of Holmes' persuasiveness, especially since ***SPOILERS FOR THE REST OF THIS SENTENCE*** he'd just tossed Watson's wife off the train.

Guy Ritchie, flash director, comes with full artillery, splashing nonstop bombast on the screen. We again note his fondness for the slo-mo and the speed ramping, except that he uses these techniques to very good effect. I love the action set pieces, the best of which may be the amazing battle on the honeymoon train. Only Holmes and Moriarty's brilliant final confrontation over Reichenbach Falls tops that sequence. Robert Downey, Jr. anchors a good cast (except for Rachel McAdams whose performance of an uncharacteristically dim Irene Adler made my teeth grind). No one else can pull off what Downey's doing with Holmes. Any other actor, and chances are, I'd be out there, too, with tar and feather. Yes, it's a smudge on the old Sherlockian establishment but, for me, in the end, star power and charisma and sheer likability win out, even if sometimes the banter seems forced and some of the jokes come on too obvious (Holmes' observation that ""It's so overt, it's covert."" seems like levity trying too hard). I love what Cumberbatch is doing with his BBC show. But I also like what I see on the other end of the spectrum. And I don't think Cumberbatch, wicked brilliant as he is, can play a chair as convincingly.",1332633600,4,5517,4.953563714902808
4439981,3,B004OC006Y,"Once you get past the fact that this is not the Sherlock Holmes you remembered as a kid, this is a pretty good action comedy. Kind of a Victorian ""Lethal Weapon."" I'm not sure, but I doubt that the form of martial arts used by Holmes, Watson and most of the villains had infiltrated Europe or had even been formulated in the 1890's. I could be wrong. In any case Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law reprise their bromance as Holmes and Watson and for this we can be thankful. After a stumbling opening, the repartee between them improves and the actors deliver some clever, witty lines.

Watson, newly married is now the target of a new supreme criminal named Moriarty (Jared Harris), a professor of mathematics. Moriarty is set to get an early start on WW I by assassinating various politicians at a would-be peace conference. He is heavily invested in arms dealing and is backing the German Kaiser. Holmes is getting in his way so he threatens the death of Dr. Watson and his bride as a result. Noomi Rapace (The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo"") is Simza a Gypsy whose brother is believed to be one of the assassins. There really isn't much to her role and just seems to be along for the ride.

There are the interesting special effects we saw in the first ""Holmes"" where ""Sherlie"" (his brother's nickname) anticipates the next moves of an opponent when found in a precarious situation and thinks his way through his resulting action. There is also an exciting scene when Holmes and his small band escape from a building holding Moriarty's arsenal. The professor and his henchmen haul out the big cannons and deliver a volley at the running good guys through a snow ensconced forest. Director Guy Ritchie brings out the super slow motion to show the bullets whizzing by, nicking trees and body parts. Very effective. In the end however, this is a showcase for Downey and Law's well written banter. Not a great movie but very entertaining.",1332374400,4,1930,4.623906705539358
4439982,4,B004OC006Y,"Guy Ritchie's first 'Sherlock Holmes' was a decent, if completely forgettable attempt to reboot/remake the classic Sir Arthur Conan Doyle characters for a modern-movie audience. Now 'Sherlock Holmes:Game of Shadows' is out and while I don't think it comes any closer to successfully rebooting the franchise, as a sequel it makes a remarkable number of improvements and ends up being a very entertaining film.

The main story of 'Game of Shadows' has Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson investigating a series of bombings and assassinations that put them on the trail, and in the cross-hairs of arch-criminal Professor Moriarty and master sniper Sebastian Moran. The plot in this film has some fun twists and turns as Holmes and Watson team up with a mysterious gypsy and Holmes' older brother Mycroft, but it's the battle of wits between Sherlock and the Professor that keeps this film engaging; Moriarty is a dangerous and diabolical adversary which raises the stakes in this film head-and-shoulders above it's predecessor.

The acting in 'Game of Shadows' is much more level-headed than the first 'Sherlock Holmes' and therefore easier to swallow: Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law's Holmes and Watson act less like a bickering couple and more like long-time friends who actually care about each other. Stephen Fry brings dry-wit and welcome comic relief as Mycroft Holmes. Noomi Rapace is great but seems wasted in a smaller part as the gypsy. Rachael McAdams, who I couldn't stand as Irene Adler in the first film makes a surprisingly welcome (if brief) appearance in the film. As good as these actors are however it's Jared Harris as Professor Moriarty who ignites the screen and the scenes between him and Downey Jr. are nail-bitingly tense.

As with everything else in 'Game of Shadows', the camera-work is an improvement over the original 'Sherlock Holmes' though is still a bit overblown. The slow-motion, rewinding-hand-to-hand combat scenes are much more fun as things don't always go the way Holmes plans. The more open environments in this film add to the atmosphere and make the action seem less artificial. Ritchie still favors super-close-ups and a bit too much slow-to-fast motion (I couldn't tell what was going on during one particular chase scene through a forest) but overall the movie stays coherent from beginning to end.

As I've said: Guy Ritchie's 'Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows' is far from a successful reboot of the Holmes/Conan Doyle characters (and still carries a lot of pointless disguises and sight-gags), but as a sequel that gets right what it's predecessor got wrong it stands as a very fun movie experience.",1332201600,18,2640,5.104166666666667
4439983,5,B004OC006Y,"After the very good opening film in the Guy Richie Sherlock Holmes franchise- A Game Of Shadows takes the series to another level. There is a real feeling that the actors have a firmer grasp on their characters. It can also be said that Richie seems to be in more of a flow in this second installment. How many times can we actually say that a second film in a series improves upon the first?

First and foremost, Robert Downey Jr is an extremely gifted actor. Most people know that, but his command of this role is exceptional. You have probably seen the extent of his preparation in regards to the proper English accent he had to master- before ever getting infront of the camera! His acting in this film is up there with Chaplin and his other great performances. He is Sherlock Holmes and I believe any version of Sherlock in the future will be hard pressed to equal Downey's version. And Sherlock definately needs a worthy Watson. Enter Jude Law. The perfect sidekick, who has to shake off Sherlock's barbs at times, but is equal at firing back. Its part of the charm of these movies. When the going is rough they are a perfect team. When they are at each other's throats- they're just as perfect.

Watson's wedding and honeymoon should have been great memories for him- too bad Sherlock is working on ""the single greatest case"" of his career! That means- edge of your seat action, mystery and not the least of all ruining poor Watson's honeymoon! The scenes where Sherlock and Watson are on the train are some of the funnier moments of the film. ""I'm on my honeymoon!"" ""Did you just kill my new wife!"". To top it off, Sherlock's disguise!

The men are in pursuit of Professor James Moriarty. A challenging opponent for Sherlock, which is proven countless times throughout the film. Mr. Moriarty is waiting for an outbreak of war, because he owns a large weopons cache/factory. Sherlock must get to the professor before France and Germany put Europe in turmoil. There are some classic confrontations between Sherlock and the professor. Great dialogue and witty banter back and forth. The two men finish a chess game without even looking at the board, while talking about their own personal moves in the next room. That is a great scene.

Not to be forgotten in all the excitement- are the scenes with the gypsies. Sherlock's interest in the gypsies is for the sister of Renee. Noomi Rapace -from The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo- is excellent in this role. And a natural fit with the other actors. There are several great scenes with Sherlock and Watson trying to mix with the gypsies. Then theres the case of how Sherlock will travel across the countryside- have to see this!

Lets hope there is a 3rd installment. It looks like a sure bet, but things can change. I think Downey and Law have great comedic chemistry. It would be great to see these guys atleast one more time playing these iconic characters. And adding another chapter in Sherlock lore.

It is 1891, there is conflict in the Continent and bombing in England. A woman walks alone, men follow her. Then they attack Sherlock Holmes, who defeats them. The woman delivers a package, it has an infernal machine inside! Holmes neutralizes it, then leaves. He finds a man dead from a poisoned needle! Later Irene Adler dines with a man in a restaurant. Her services are no longer required. There is a view of late 19th century London, then Holmes lodgings. Dr. Watson visits Holmes to tell of his marriage. Holmes talks of James Moriarity. Holmes leaves in disguise. They meet Holmes brother who works for the Foreign Office. Sherlock meets a fortune teller. There is an attack that is defeated. [This adds action.] Next day Watson weds in an outdoor ceremony. Moriarity sends an invitation to meet Holmes. They talk.

Watson and his wife take the train. A man attacks them but it thrown out. There is shooting in the corridor! [There is quick action that is hard to follow. Does this make sense?] Then they travel to Paris. They meet people and dine on hedgehog goulash. A woman shows her drawings. There is a wine cellar where anarchists meet. Mrs. Watson meets Sherlocks brother Mycroft. Holmes and Watson and the fortune teller look for her brother. Claude no longer has need for his pistol. The three escape through a secret passage to the street, then to a theater where they are performing an opera. There is an explosion in another building where businessmen meet. Holmes deduces where a rifle was fired. Holmes tells about the sale of a cannon business. He deduces which train Moriarity will take to Berlin. Holmes party will ride horses across the border. Holmes visits a factory and is captured! Moriarity is behind the conspiracy.

A sniper shoots at Watson while Moriarity and Holmes converse. A cannon hits the building. Watson comes to help Holmes. There is a chase and gunfire! Another cannon knocks down a wall. There is a running gun battle. Another cannon fires at the fugitives, who hop on to a train to escape. Watson revives Holmes! They discuss the events with Mycroft, who asks for proof. There is a conspiracy to assassinate a politician and cause a war. Holmes attends a ball and tries to figure out the plot. Holmes and Watson dance without attracting attention! [Unbelievable even as a joke.] Then Holmes and Moriarity talk and play chess. The attempt fails! Will that man survive? Holmes tells Moriarity about the theft of his notebook and its decipherment in London. They fight and fall over the railing into the cold water! Watson sees this. There is a memorial service. Watson types this story, then opens a parcel. Who brought it?

Was this one of the worst Holmes movies? Compared to the classic movies where Basil Rathbone acted as the greatest consulting detective in fiction? The story seems confusing at times. John Buchans The 39 Steps remains the classic story about a conspiracy. Alfred Hitchcock filmed this story many times: The 39 Steps, The Man Who Knew Too Much, Foreign Correspondent, North by Northwest. Any of these are better.
