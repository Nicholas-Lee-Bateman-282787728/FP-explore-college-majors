2226748,5,B0007P0YKE,"Man!  Thought this would be another fluff workout but was wrong.  Hardcore, but easy to understand.  Very well done and I am still breathing heavy from doing it!  Martial arts aspect of it was cool too.  Buy it, it's worth it.",1108857600,23,226,4.414634146341464
2226779,3,B0007P0YKE,"Alas, another moderate workout.  I have been on the perpetual search for a workout that actually gets my heart racing into the cardio zone and this is just another one of those workouts that is left to the physically challenged.  Sure there is the typical punching sequence, the kicks and complex sequences; unfortunately, if you exercise more than 3 times a week you will not find this DVD challenging.  Why doesn't a hardcore workout exist on DVD?  I don't know.  Perhaps someone has the answer.  Until then, I will be forced to do my own workout at home.  Perhaps I will make a video someday that doesn't have an instructor that acts like they are having a great time when really they should be more focused on giving you a good workout.  So in my search for a good workout, I'm afraid that this is not it.  Hardcore it is not.",1152489600,10,830,4.443708609271523
2226780,4,B0007P0YKE,"This is a great workout!  I have been working out for a while and would consider myself in the intermediate/advanced stage.  I was looking for a cardio workout that didn't involve step and was more than 30 minutes.

Although this has some toning and weights with it, it's divided into sections so that you can do just the cardio part or just the toning part if you'd like.

The sections where Janis Saffel leads are alright.  Her workouts are not very instense and don't tend to raise the heart rate or make you sweat.  However, she is a very good instructor and even when she does more complicated combos, she's very good at explaining and building the movements.

The sections that Guillermo Gomez leads are excellent.  His workouts are challenging and tough and make you sweat and feel like you are really working.  And this is starting from the warm up. In fact, on days when I can't make it to the gym and it's a weights day, I do the warm up on this DVD to get myself ready for the weights.  It's great!

I would reccommend this to anyone.",1150934400,2,1045,4.4188481675392675
2226781,5,B0007P0YKE,"This is my second dvd of hers and it's just as good as Brand New Butt.  She's fun to workout with and she's such a good cuer.  This is well cued and it mixes cardio with solid strength training.  It's high energy so be warned.  Along with Janis is Guillermo Gomez who is a blackbelt martial arts expert.  They use great choreography in the kickboxing section - better than I've seen in some other workouts.

You will need dumbbells for toning segments but other than that, that's practically it.  Clear some space in your bedroom or in the lounge and prepare to work hard.  You'll work up a sweat and get fit fast.  It's fun and she motivates you to work harder.  I love it and really recommend it.",1149811200,,698,4.341085271317829
2226782,1,B0007P0YKE,"Regardless of your level of fitness, this workout is impossibe to follow as it is fast paced with little or no cues.",1149206400,,116,4.318181818181818
2226783,5,B0007P0YKE,"I have just recently discovered Janis Saffell and have been very pleased with her workouts.  I am at an advanced home workout level and have found it somewhat difficult to find quality workouts on DVD.  This is yet another quality workout from Janis Saffell and well worth the $ to add this to your rotation.  Someone commented that the transitions are not that smooth, I didn't really care since I do like the more diverse workout Guillero and Janis provide in this video.  I am somewhat new to kickbox and really appreciate the advanced level workout they give you in this DVD.  This is a very efficient workout which will make you sweat - both cardio and strength, which I appreciate.  Be sure to catch the bonus abs workout - a pretty different approach.",1130716800,5,758,4.619402985074627
2226784,4,B0007P0YKE,"It is a challenge to find workout dvds that really make you sweat, and this is one of them.  The routines are hard and fun, and it is truly an intermediate to advanced level. The first time through the dvd, some of the combinations are hard to perfect, but with additional practice, they can be mastered.  Whether you do them perfectly the first time or not, it is a great workout.  Janis and Guillermo are energetic instructors that make you motivated to work your hardest, and though some of the combinations may move too quickly at first, they do a good job of creating a challenging dvd you can grow with.  The wardrobe and set are somewhat cheesey, but not overly so, and the quality of the workout itself more than makes up for it.  A great buy for someone who enjoys working out hard at home.",1129766400,5,799,4.408163265306122
2226785,4,B0007P0YKE,"Normally, I am a Tae Bo kinda girl and have not been able to find another kickboxing video that holds a flame to Billy. Surprisingly, this workout is really well done! It is challenging so probably not for beginners. However, if you are a seasoned kickboxer this video really gives you the opportunity to perfect your form without worrying about keeping up! The added weight training really makes you sweat! Great workout!",1127779200,2,422,4.875
2226786,5,B0007P0YKE,"I purchased Hardcore Kickbox Circuit with Janis Saffell because I have another workout DVD by her and I love her.  This DVD is no different.  She offers a challenging cardio workout with some strength sections built in.  Guillermo Gomez is a guest instructor in this DVD and he is wonderful too.  The punching/kicking sequences are not too difficult but offer a kick butt workout.  You will be sweating the pounds off for approximately 50 minutes and you will be able to feel a difference after a week.  If you like kickboxing, this is the workout for you.",1125619200,8,556,4.680412371134021
2226787,5,B0007P0YKE,"Janis and Guillermo make an excellent work team. This workout is fun yet challenging. I love the complexity of the segments. If you have a knee or back problem, use some caution. I'm not a seasoned pro at this. I'm still learning but I enjoy this dvd very much. I also recommend Quickfix Total Cardio Kick also with Janis Saffell.",1120176000,2,330,4.516666666666667

8049956,5,B0007P0YKE,"This is an excellent interval workout. My core is screaming. I will definitely try other workouts in her collection.

The workout is challenging without being overbearing.",1388275200,,171,5.576923076923077
8049957,3,B0007P0YKE,Guillermo is good because he actually uses kickboxing moves. Janis spends a lot of time trying to get you to do complicated step routines (very similar to step aerobics from the 90s) which make you focus more on the steps and less on working out/cardio. This workout also barely made me break a sweat. It is very far below p90x and the insanity workouts. Would be good for a light workout day.,1374105600,,393,4.472222222222222
8049958,5,B0007P0YKE,Some tricky combos that I had to do a bunch of times to master. I like to rewind the upper dumbbell sections and do them twice. Janice uses twos in these sections. I use fives. Moves quickly and its fun not boring.,1363737600,,214,4.119047619047619
8049959,5,B0007P0YKE,"Love love love this workout.  It's fun, fast paced, and makes you sweat.  To make it even more hardcore, I do the whole workout holding 2lb weights and then use 5lb weights during the sculpting session.  So if you don't find the workout challenging enough, add the weights and you will get more out of it.  But I really love the drills and combos.",1334966400,,347,4.375
8049960,4,B0007P0YKE,"Janis Saffel and Guillermo Gomez really have it going on in this video. They take you through a warm up, several cardio kick boxing routines, which can at time be complicated, and circuit weight training. The kick boxing routines are challenging but I wish they were longer. They switch off as the instructors and have 3 ladies working out with them in the back. While it is a more advanced work out but it could certainly be more challenging. My one complaint is the jeweled outfits Janis and the other ladies wear. She designs ""couture"" activity wear but these are just silly, they are sparkling and a tad bit distracting, this isn't belly dancing.",1174608000,,650,4.7105263157894735
8049961,5,B0007P0YKE,"I think this is a good workout.  I have been doing Kathy Smith's Kickbox Workout and Kick Butt 2 which are both my favorites, and have had a hard time finding others that I like as well. I think Hardcore Kickbox is at that level that I was looking for.  It is a long workout, which I like.  I really feel like I am getting something out of this one after I do it.  The instructors are both helpful,encouraging, and make it a fun workout.  I also like the fact that I can break it down into segments if I choose to.",1168646400,2,514,4.0
8049962,4,B0007P0YKE,"I've enjoyed Janis Saffell's other kickboxing workouts, so I decided to give this one, which she teaches with partner Guillermo Gomez, a try as well.  As the name suggests, this is a circuit workout which alternates cardio kickboxing sequences with both weighted and unweighted toning work.  Janis and Guillermo switch off instruction of the various segments, with both cueing fairly well (Guillermo sometimes counts in Spanish) and mirroring the viewer.  Janis, Guillermo, and their three female background exercisers all wear weighted gloves for the workout.

Guillermo begins the warm-up, introducing each of the four punches (jab, cross, hook, uppercut).  He includes both jumping jacks and push-ups, so my heart rate got up there pretty quickly.  Janis then takes over with some simple kickboxing choreography which feels very similar to her other videos, particularly the lower body segment of Quick Fix Cardio Kick.  The only time I had a little trouble following was when she added a turn sequence, but I just skipped this (no modifications are shown).  She transitions very smoothly into the first toning segment, mostly squats without using any weights.

Guillermo is up next.  Most of his sequences were performed to the side, which I found kind of different and liked.  He builds up his first kick punch combination, practicing this on both sides, then introduces a second kick-punch combination.  I was a little thrown off when he combined the two combos--they start of kind of similar, so it's easy to get thrown off--but I was able to pick it up once I realized what he was doing.  Next comes the first weights segment using dumbbells (I found that 5# weights were plenty heavy).  There are traditional moves such as bicep curls and shoulder raises, but there is a bit of a kickbox flavor added in.  My heart rate dipped a bit during both this and the second weighted segment.

Janis returns with another kickboxing sequence; unlike Guillermo, her choreography was front-to-back (without requiring much space).  This was quite different, with quick jabs and a hook kick.  Again, Janis included some turns, and again, I skipped these.  She then does a very short weight segment concentrating on the shoulders.  Guillermo returns, teaching the segment the same way as before:  he introduces one kick-punch combination, practices it on both sides, teaches a second combo, and then combines the two together (I caught on more quickly this time!).  There are some unique moves here as well, including a circle jab and a roundhouse-cross.  Guillermo also leads the final toning semgent, which is again unweighted; this short segment includes more squats and slowly performed side kicks.

The cool-down, which is performed entirely on the floor, offers some nice lower body stretches; it finishes in a seated position with some brief neck stretches, bringing the entire workout in at about 52 minutes.  The DVD also includes a bonus 10-minute Aikido workout lead by Guillermo.  This is performed on the floor, and it's an interesting mix of back-stretches (mostly rolling back from a seated position into a sort of plow pose) and some leg work in the form of seated side and roundhouse kicks; these moves are supposed to add power to your standing kicks.  The bonus segment ends rather abruptly with no cool-down.  It can be selected off the main menu, which is well-chaptered with the individual workout segments but which does not let you string several segments together for a customized workout.

Overall, this is a nice kickboxing workout that kept me in my target heart rate zone for over 35 minutes.  The workout was probably appropriate for low intermediate exercisers (there isn't much discussion of form, so I wouldn't recommend it to someone new to kickboxing), and the choreography is mostly basic, with some twists added in here and there as I mentioned above.  I would recommend this workout to anyone who enjoys fun, easy-to-learn kickboxing combinations and doesn't mind a bit of toning work thrown in, and I'd rate it 4 1/2 stars.",1160524800,20,4055,5.061746987951807
8049963,5,B0007P0YKE,"I think this is a good 60 minute workout that should make you sweat.  I'm sure there are some real cardio junkies who can go through a 2 hr advanced kickboxing workout and want more, but for most people this is a strong workout.  This workout will work you through basic puches (jabs, crosses, hook, and upper cut punches) and basic kicks (round house, forward, and cresent kicks) like many of the kickbox dvds out there.  The DVD moves continueously, but there are different things stressed.  Some components focus on cardio while a few focus on sculpting (3-15 lb weights are suggested).  I think this DVD provides enough of workout for the average person to feel worked out.  I would suggest watching the DVD all the way through at least once to try and get an idea of the instructors sequencing.  There is also a bonus abs section at the end that I found a bit challenging (approx 10 minutes long).  Overall, you should get a nice workout from this DVD.",1159401600,3,957,4.555555555555555
