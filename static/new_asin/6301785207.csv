7815085,5,6301785207,"I used this workout in my late teens and early 20's while training for prelims for Miss America and had a ""Pageant Body"". Now, I'm in my 40's and a mid-distance runner (5k's, 10k's, 10m's and 1/2 Marathons). I'm always on the look-out for new videos or programs that could help with training. Nothing compares to Joanie Greggains' great attitude as well as using proper technique. You don't need gimmicks, someone yelling at you, or ""Barbie Workout Models"" to lower your self-esteem while working out. It's just you and her. That's it. If you stick with her, you will see results. It's nice to mix it up and her weight exercises are a HUGE help prepping for my next race. Good luck~",1333497600,4,682,4.598360655737705
7815086,4,6301785207,"This is a very comprehensive 60 minute workout that covers everything:  A warm up, a low-impact aerobic workout and then a total body shaping workout that includes floor work and stand up exercise with weights. And as usual, Joanie makes it fun, while educating you on technique and giving you a really great workout.  The 2010 DVD version is the same exact workout as the original VHS version of Joanie Greggains' One on One Workout.",1294617600,3,434,4.773333333333333
