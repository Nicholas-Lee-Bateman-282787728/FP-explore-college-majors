2883215,2,B000S76NII,"So in The Masseur we have yet another story about male prostitution in Asia. One would start to suspect, from watching this film and such others as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Macho-Dancer/dp/B00005KCB7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Macho Dancer</a>or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Regrets-Standard-Edition-DVD/dp/B000NIQVVQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Regrets (Standard Edition) DVD</a>, that the majority of gay Asian work as escorts. But, unlike the far superior&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Regrets-Standard-Edition-DVD/dp/B000NIQVVQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Regrets (Standard Edition) DVD</a>, The Masseur fails to incorporate a story arc beyond that of the character's journey.

Our young masseur deals with the same issues we have seen in countless gay films - a youth of questionable sexuality is forced into a life serviving older men because of financial needs. Love is not portrayed. Familial duty is. American audiences may have difficulty with this.

While the back and forth movement of what passes for plot is inventive at time and showcases the local culture, it also fails to make a statement about the life of these masseurs. Yes, we know it's rough to be poor and to whore out your bodies. But no one else in the film but the main character has any story, any characterization, any depth.

The happy ending, as narrated, is ridiculous and comes out of left field and is not at all believeable based on what we have just watched.

This is the director's debut work. While it has some promising vision, he really needs to take new directions, tell new stories rather than rehash work we are all familiar with.",1203292800,3,1774,6.318181818181818
2883216,4,B000S76NII,"There is a reason this film from the Philippines has garnered so much attention and audience approval at festivals around the world.  Yes, it is a very low budget film (and technically that shows), but the message is a sound one.  Not just another film about the massage parlor antics created to titillate the viewer, THE MASSEUR (MASAHISTA) as conceived and written for the screen by Boots Agbayani Pastor is a close examination of the old conflict between father and son, expectations and disappointments, needs and failures to fulfill, and in the end the mourning for a relationship that never succeeded.  Director Brillante Mendoza has found the balance between sensual imagery and social comment that makes this little film work very well indeed.

Iliac (Coco Martin) is a handsome young lad who, because his alcoholic and carousing absentee father cannot support his family, has left his home to work as a masseur in Manila, assuming the financial responsibility of his family. Iliac works in a massage parlor - rooms like closets so close that conversations are easily heard - where he has his regular clients as well as newcomers, each of whom pays for massage an tips for all the 'extras' the boys are more than willing to offer for a price.  The film moves back and forth between Iliac's home and his work in Manila and after his father dies, Iliac must return home and be the one who must assist the mortician in preparing his father's body for burial.  This tradition becomes an analogy for the work Iliac performs on the massage table and the conversations and physical involvements between Iliac and client mirror the ministrations at the funeral parlor in a powerful and deeply moving way.  Iliac is able to cope with both sides of his lot until he discovers some secrets left in his deceased father's belongings.  At this point the concept of the film becomes touchingly apparent.

Though the cast is well known in the Philippines, only a few of the faces will be familiar to most viewers.  What Mendoza is able to achieve with his cast is a feeling of honesty and ensemble work that allows both sides of Iliac's life to be credible.  The film is in Tagalog with English subtitles and though the DVD cover would suggest this is a gay film, in reality it is a study of family life and the consequences of distance between father and son.  It is worth viewing.  Grady Harp, November 07",1195516800,19,2399,4.737980769230769
2883217,4,B000S76NII,"After a couple of years on the gay international film festival circuit, where it won several audience awards, THE MASSEUR (2005) finally made it to DVD, which was my first opportunity to see it.

The Phillipine-produced film tells the story of Illiac, a 20 year old young man from a small city, who is working in Manilla at a gay massage studio, where tips are based on the sexual favors given to the customers.  Illiac seems to be good at his work, and relatively happy being in demand, although he is indeed heterosexual and has a girlfriend back home.  One wonders about the ""back story"" that led him to that line of work, and this is soon revealed when he receives an urgent text message to return home.  It seems that his father is close to death.  Illiac doesn't make it home in time to say goodbye, but they hadn't really been on speaking terms since his father had deserted his family years ago, leaving Illiac as its sole breadwinner.

Although shot on a tiny budget, the film showcases the skill of the writer/director, Brillante Mendoza, who gives it remarkable pacing, including some initially confusing flashbacks and fast forwards, as well as some unforgetable touches, such as segueing between Illiac assisting the undertaker in preparing his father's body and a flashback showing him giving a sensual massage to a man about his father's age.  Later, Illiac has an emotional revelation when helping go through his father's possessions, and considers his future plans.  As Illiac, Phillipine actor Coco Martin shows significant range and sincerity, well deserving the acting award he received for it. As a tribute to an earlier Filipino gay classic, ""Macho Dancer"" (1988), Mendoza cast one of the actors from that film as Illiac's obsessed customer Alfredo.  Mostly in Tagalog with English subtitles, the DVD includes scenes from the film's premiere at the Toronto film festival.  I give the film four stars out of five.",1189036800,20,1934,4.904907975460123

8204604,4,B000S76NII,"This is the story of the two worlds that Iliac (Coco Martin - his first role) lives in.  There is the world of his family which was abandoned by his father and there is the world that  Iliac works in.  In order to help support his family, he goes to work in Manila as a masseur in a gay massage parlor which for him is not bad since he is gay..  (It seems that all gay films from the Philippines show the poverty of the underclass and that the only work for good looking  young men are as macho dancers or masseurs.)  The father dies and Iliac's mother takes on the responsibility to bury him because she is one he is legally married to.  The film goes back and forth between the two worlds and is not in a straight time line.  In the world of his family he has to deal with much including having to help dress his father's remains in the mortuary for the funeral and deal with members of the family including his brother.  In his other world, you see the squalor of the work place where these masseurs earn their money: a base fee for the massage and extra for the ""extra services"" provided which means pretty much everything else except for kissing when one of the masseurs tells his client that his lips are saved for his girlfriend.  (I guess she doesn't mind sharing his manhood since it is a money maker).  It is interesting that the camera takes you over the tops of the rooms so you become like a fly on the ceiling.  The rooms are small with just enough space for a bed and a night stand with a lamp. The other item furnished is the cockroach which the camera focuses on. (I guess since the cockroach looks clean, the room must be clean)  Let's be honest, the place is a dive like some by-the-hour motels in a tenderloin district. .Apparently the wall partitions are not connected to the ceiling because when one runs out of oil they can toss one over the wall. You see the usual clientele with macho types, queens, and just horny gays.  This story works around Iliac and a client named Alfred who goes by the name of Marlina Hidalgo (Alan Paule from Macho Dancer)  The film shows the interactions with other masseurs and their clients but the main focus is on Iliac and Alfred.  Originally Alfred wanted another boy - both were wearing yellow shirts - but was given Iliac instead which he complained about.  Continuing, they have a pleasant conversation and Alfred wants Iliac to be a bottom and we all know what that infers, don't we.  Iliac agrees for an additional fee which is agreed upon.  The ending is a little too neat and that is why I gave it a four out of five.  How do you fall in love with and want to live with someone who just screwed you our of your extra fee for screwing you?.",1413504000,,2704,4.295857988165681

8204607,3,B000S76NII,"The first scenes are blurred.  Whether this is intended or due to faulty camera work is uncertain.  While the cover art is provocative, the nudity in the film is not gratuitous and is integral to the plot.  The protagonist is believable and sympathetic and the juxtaposition between the preparations for his father's funeral and his work in the massage parlor is poignant and effective as a plot device.  However, the film feels incomplete--as though the maker ran out of money and had to abruptly singe the edges of the film together. Further, the camera angles throughout are sometwhat skewed and not in a purposeful way. But, the glimpses into the everyday lives of this young man and his family--especially the stark images of the funeral festivities and the 'normalness' of the work environment make this movie worth viewing.",1310083200,,830,4.992753623188406
