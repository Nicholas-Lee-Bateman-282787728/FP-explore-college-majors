7913584,4,B00000JWW3,This movie was really sexy. I enjoyed it. Mark Pellegrino has a nice ass. This is a soft pornographic movie. I am Zedsexual. So this was the perfect movie for me.,1491609600,,162,4.258064516129032

7913586,4,B00000JWW3,"Catalina Larranaga and LoriDawn Messuri are gorgeous! Very sensual, with a good plot. The fact that the movie is one of very few ""Sundance"" selections makes it all the more interesting. Avoid the US release rated R and get the Region 2 - Pal Uncut Edition",1218067200,,255,4.565217391304348
7913587,3,B00000JWW3,"I seem to be in a rut. Word of Mouth is the third softporn flick, in less than a month that I reviewed, that features Catalina Larranaga in the leading role.

I don't want you to get the wrong impression. I don't have a thing for Catalina. Not that Catalina isn't attractive. She is, in a wholesome, Sandy Duncan with dark hair sort of way. Especially in Word of Mouth, where she wears her hair short like Sandy Duncan did.(I know. Who the h*ll is Sandy Duncan?). If you're over forty you should remember Duncan. She was a popular TV actress in the eighties, that was known for her warm smile and her easygoing manner.

Appearing wholesome wasn't a problem in the first two movies, being a research psychologist in each, but in this film she portrays a high priced call girl and wholesome seems just a little out of place. Then again, she has made several soft-core movies so maybe appearances can be misleading.

Word of Mouth

Torrie is the subject of a documentary movie about a high priced lady companion. She has agreed to be interviewed and filmed by Darrow an independent documentary filmmaker and she even takes him along on some of her tricks. Darrow's girlfriend/editor notices that he is very defensive about Torrie and thinks he is getting too involved and falling for the prostitute. Darrow catches Torrie in a couple lies and wonders what her real agenda is. Torrie is constantly teasing Darrow and eventually he decides he must have her and they have a fling, the aftermath of which ultimately leaves both parties unfulfilled and disappointed in the other.

Conclusion

Word of Mouth, despite the positive hype was not one of the better softcore movies I have seen. True Catalina is an eyeful but she's not really a sexpot. Another fault I find with her and the rest of the cast is the sex scenes seemed wooden and unnatural. Personally I think if a guy was going to spend a couple thou a night on a chick, he would want someone a lot hotter that Catalina. That's another problem I had with the movie. Torries clients are ostensibly buying her services for all night and yet after a five minute tryst, they get dressed and say goodbye. One guy in a Limo all he got was a two minute BJ.

The cast was OK but I've seen better and the acting was average.

Okay, enough on the dark side. Problems I've pointed out aside. There is a lot of T&A displayed, though of the tamer variety and the film moves along at a good clip for ninety-three minutes. The cinematography is first class as we have come to expect from Playboy. Another oddity is of the three movies I have seen with Catalina, the director has been the same - Tom Lazarus. I wonder if Catalina and Tom have got something going. Not that odd? Sorry.

I give Word of Mouth a whopping 3 stars",1149552000,,3251,4.57439446366782

7913589,3,B00000JWW3,"If you want a fairly definitive video treatise on slam/performance poetry in general, ""SlamNation"" is the video you want.  ""Slammin'"" is a pilot for a proposed Tv series that never got made, and conversely loses some of the magic of the previous, longer ""SNation"".  When you have to not only describe the phenomenon, but show an actual bout unfold in under 30 minutes, you're going to get a little cheated.  This is most clearly typified by the smash-and-grab edit of interviews, as well as the showing of only parts of poems performed (which to me seems nonsensical, since valuable time was used up by indie poetry films added for spice; time clearly better used showing us the poems unfold).  The point that it's all supposed to be more fun than competition isn't driven home is problematic, since some of the poems clearly don't ring true in terms of being actually competitive or good.
If you're interested in slams, it's still an engaging, necessary piece of work to own, but if you haven't seen Devlin's far more comprehensive (and better) ""SlamNation"" first, you're doing yourself a disservice.  It is clearly, however, a necessary addition to any performing poet's library.",1024963200,2,1181,4.944444444444445
7913590,4,B00000JWW3,"The direction of this movie was exceptional - switching from black and white and different textures and angles made the film very interesting to watch and gave me an idea of each character's feelings.  Robert Rand and  Loridawn Messuri gave both believable and talented performances and are  stunning to look at.  Catalina was good at manipulation in the film.  Overall, a well done film.",949968000,,388,5.0
