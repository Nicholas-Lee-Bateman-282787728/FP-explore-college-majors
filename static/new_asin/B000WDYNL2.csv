8222842,5,B000WDYNL2,"I found this movie entertaining and yet terrifying as a child. I don't speak french and I wish an english version was available because I want to see it again and find out why it bothered me so as a small child.
This movie is still good though. It's even more creepy than ""are you afraid of the dark"" and ""goosebumps"" combined. I still think this movie might scare seven year olds. I think I was seven or eight when I saw this movie.
Though some seven year olds might be more resilient than I was at seven years old.",1249084800,,516,4.17
