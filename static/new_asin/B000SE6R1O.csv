2884167,5,B000SE6R1O,"I saw the first Love ain't suppose to hurt and I found it to be a very good play.  I was happy to see Love ain't suppose to hurt 2.  It was good to see that good can come out of experiences in one's life that perhaps were not so good. It was believable , not like some plays,or movies you watch that are suppose to relate to reality.  Keep up the good work. (Can we get a sequel in the house?)",1234742400,,393,3.768292682926829

2884170,5,B000SE6R1O,"If you saw the first play, this play is a continuation.  I was a little disappointed when Tony Grant was not in it, but Tommy Ford more than made up for it.

As always, the singing was delicious and the play was upbeat and had a very surprised ending.  I love Tyler Perry's plays and this could have been one of them.

It had a great message and was upbeat, flowed continuously and was well worth the money I spent.",1203206400,3,415,4.15
2884171,5,B000SE6R1O,I own the first one and bought the second one. This was was even better. The messages in this play are so timely and the singing was great. Tommy Ford did a great job as well as Carey Durrell and Marc Nelson. These were the newcomers in the second one. The musical arrangements and vocals were totally superb. May God bless their ministry of plays and I anticipate greater things to come for BCB records.,1187654400,11,404,4.4

This review is from: Love Ain't Suppose to Hurt II ""The Wedding"" (DVD)
If you have seen ""Love Ain't Suppose to Hurt"" part 1, you may be slightly let down by this movie like I was. One glaring omission was the missing, wonderfully talented Tony Grant, and I get the impression from this play they were trying to dance around the issue by not focusing very much on the relationship between the star and her fiance, by bringing in new plot lines without fully rounding out the plot lines established in the first play. A positive thing about this effort is that they were able to bring back the majority of the actors from the first play, and this allowed the viewer to get a sense of being back with old friends ;0

All in all, it was a good play and had the same vibe and uplifting spirit of the first one, and I would recommend it to anyone who was a fan of the first play.",1281312000,,946,4.308988764044944
