8026048,5,B0002CHJBE,"I received my copy in mint, unopened condition and showed it to my freshman seminar at our university. I was impeccable and everyone enjoyed this beautiful short, 20 film on Islam and the human brotherhood of the Muslim faith. It is a rare piece of pre 9/11 material that was made before all the fear and misunderstanding. Thank you Night Line and Micheal Wolfe.",1417132800,,362,4.671875

8026050,5,B0002CHJBE,"Maybe the most flattering portrait of Islam ever to run on American television, which makes it a fascinating artifact of our pre-9/11 consciousness. If you teach religion or World History, it makes for great classroom discussion.",1388707200,,229,5.388888888888889
8026051,4,B0002CHJBE,"Although this film is much shorter (22min) than ""Inside Mecca"" and doesn't cover the Hajj in as great a detail, it was interesting and included a couple of things that were not in the other longer film. For instance, ""Inside Mecca"" showed the sacrifice of the goats but did not go into the fact that the meat of all those animals are donated to the poor. It filled in the gap between cruelty and compassion. I enjoyed this video but still recommend that after this one, you should watch ""Inside Mecca"" for more details. This is more of a summary.",1347580800,,546,4.47

Journalist (and American Muslim) Michael Wolfe, takes us along on his second pilgrimage to Makkah. His first such spiritual journey brought us his book, ""The Hajj"". This time we get to go along, for a live look at the sacred rites. Wolfes's straightforward, clear-sighted insights - blending his journalistic abilities with his profound insights as an American convert to Islam - will help students of any age gain a deeper understanding of the fifth pillar of Islam. I loved his definition of Islam (a twist on ""submission"" or ""surrender""): ""cooperating with the way things are!""

Teachers/Librarians: 7th grade - adult VIDEO: 20 min. And for gaining clear and deep understanding of Islam, this has to be the best 20 minutes of film you can use in your classroom!",1303344000,,802,4.977611940298507
8026053,4,B0002CHJBE,"This 22-minute episode of ""Nightline"" is a good introduction to the Hajj, the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca. We join a European-American convert to Islam as he participates in the Hajj, explaining the origin and significance of various aspects of the pilgrimage.

If you'd like a more in-depth introduction to the Hajj, I'd recommend the National Geographic documentary ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inside-Mecca/dp/B0000BWVNA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inside Mecca</a>.""",1169596800,11,510,7.225806451612903
