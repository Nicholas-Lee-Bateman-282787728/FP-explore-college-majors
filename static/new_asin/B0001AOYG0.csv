8009221,5,B0001AOYG0,"Now these Snader Telescriptions are true treasure for us swing, mainstream and Ellington fans (Hamp's big band is good as well, but it's no matc for Duke's outfit). Only Hodges is missing from the usual Ellington line-up, but you have Cat Anderson, Willie Cook and Clark Terry (tp), Ray Nance (tp and vi), Quentin Jackson, Juan Tizol and Britt Woodman (tb), Willie Smith instead of Hodges (as), Paul Gonsalves, Russell Procope, Jimmy Hamilton and Harry Carney on various saxophones and clarinets (I believe Carney plays bass-clarinet on two occasions), with Wendell Marshall (b) and Louie Bellson (dm)... THEY ARE COOKING...

As for Hamp's part of the DVD, he does let some of his people some solo time, so you can hear (from what I've recognized or read in Mark Gardner's liner notes) Al Grey and Paul Higaki (tb), Benny Bailey (tp), Milt Buckner (p, o), Jerome Richardson (sax and flute) and Betty Carter sings one beautiful but oh-so-breaf chorus...

Maybe some digital restoring is in order by now, but if your're not a hi-definition blue-ray digital purist, I warmly recommend this DVD, another Storyville gem...
