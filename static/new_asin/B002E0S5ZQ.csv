8366645,5,B002E0S5ZQ,The movie is very enjoyable. It features some great stunts and the Metal Band Sorcery. The acting isn't Oscar quality but the action moves right along. If you like 70's Metal you'll love Sorcery. Turn up the volume and enjoy.,1525046400,,225,4.65

8366647,3,B002E0S5ZQ,"Stunt Rock (1978) features some of the greatest stunt numbers ever filmed particularly during the ""Sorcery"" segment which is performed by Grant Page. That good vs. evil heavy metal sequence alone is reason enough to see this film. And of course the title track during which Sorcery takes their most famous musical sequence is also highly entertaining. And the film does contain plenty of humor especially in the scene where Grant Page describes his early stunt career to the press as being glamorous and artistically stimulating while we see images of his past that contradict this fact by showing scenes of Grant Page himself being pelted by angry punters in a small music hall.

Besides, there's a masked keyboardist, stunts painfully gone awry, chicks in gold spandex with guns, wizards, demons, the amazingly awful heavy metal ""Sorcery"", whose live performances, as shown here, are filled with an audience who seem to all be wondering who the hell these people are.",1385510400,,969,5.05625
8366648,5,B002E0S5ZQ,"Seriously. This movie is horrible. The acting sucks, there really isn't any plot to be seen, and I didn't care a lick about what happened to the main characters. That being said though, this is still a ridiculously awesome movie. Throughout the movie the viewer is subjected to what are supposed to be flashbacks, but that is just a guise. They are really just a stunt reel that contain some pretty awesome stunts. Jumping off a buildings, car chases, getting set on fire, all those delightful chestnuts and more are feature. Also apparently there is a hair metal band involved with this, which is totally awesome because the band is a ""Wizard"" band. What I mean by ""wizard"" band is that during the band's performance, two guys(one dressed as a typical wizard and one dressed as Satan)have a magic battle. And by magic, I mean kinda lame stage magic. For some reason, all these elements make for one of the best/worst pieces of film I have ever seen. If you enjoy bad movies, this is by far one of the worst.

P.S. The ending is amazing.",1317686400,7,1037,4.575268817204301
