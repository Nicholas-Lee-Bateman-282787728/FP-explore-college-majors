8593606,5,B00DISNMAQ,"I loved this one so much I have now bought three so far- one for myself, one for my niece for getting into shape and one for my friend who's thinking of traveling there.  Not to sound too gushy, here, but I really didn't think there were any roads that resembled California's big sur enough to compare it- I love it!!!  Its even sunny like Cali!
The one drawback to this one may be that it has less variety than some of the others:  its mostly switchback mountain roads with awesome views of that deep blue Mediterranean Sea.  Which would be perfect for a more dedicated cyclist than myself... Oh, wait- there are about three towns (?) that give it some character and you do stop at a couple beaches- one sandy and one rocky, so I wouldn't dream of giving it less than five stars.",1374537600,,780,4.321917808219178
