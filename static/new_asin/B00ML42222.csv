Yes, another movie about Love.  However, with a new twist.  This is about an elderly couple married for forty year.  The have four sons. Three are married.  They also have an adopted son they found on the streets and raised as their own.  He is away studying but has fallen in love.  His parents give him permission to marry the girl, as soon as possible. Names?  The man is Raj and his wife is Pooja.
Raj has a good job but gave everything to raise his kids.  In his mind, the kids are his assets when he and Pooja are old.  Now, the kids have careers and live in different parts of India.  They have their own lives, families, and responsibilities.
Now, Raj has retired and the boys and their families are at Rajs rental house for a celebration of colors.  There Raj and Pooja tell the kids, it is time for the parents to move-in with one of the kids.  The boys and their wife are shocked and don't want Raj or Pooja to move-in with them.  They show their true colors.  I was shocked how the wives displayed their disdain for the boys parents.  They finally decide that one couple will take Raj and another couple will take Pooja.  Of course, this is only for six months than they will move again to another family member.  Always separated.  The kids are sure that the parents will not go along and find another way to live.  Needless to say, the parents are shocked.  They have never been separated from one another before.  Pooja convinces Raj to do this and not to make waves.  The kids are shocked of the acceptance and the next day, everyone goes to their homes with Raj and Pooja separated.
In Rajs residence, he shares a room with his grandson.  He is disrespected at every turn.  He is basically told he is a guest and quit making trouble in the household.  He finds refuge from a caf/music shop owner and his wife.  They have no kids.  The owner and his wife takes a liking to Raj.  He ends up handling the books for the caf. He is always talking about Pooja.  One day his glasses break and he has the owner and his wife to read Poojas letter to him.  There is so much love and sadness in the letter that she stops reading because she is crying so hard.  There are lots of kids that hang out at the caf.  One of them suggest that he write his feeling and possible a story of his love for Pooja and the struggle they went through raising the boys.  So he begins.
Poojas stay with her son and daughter-n-law is not much better.  Their teenage daughter refuses to let Pooja share her room.  So Pooja stays in the maids room and the maid is forced to sleep in the kitchen.  Then the maid leaves and of course, this is Poojas fault according to the daughter-n-law.  They continue to harass her and she is the blame for everything.  Pooja cries every night missing Raj. They talk every so often on the tele at night or when alone.
Raj in the meantime is writing his experiences, he names it Baghban (Caretaker).  The six months are up and they both pack to go to another couples home for six months.  Raj tells her to meet him at the train station in another city.  She agrees.
What happens next?  Hint, it is a happy ending.",1416614400,,3151,4.298126064735945
