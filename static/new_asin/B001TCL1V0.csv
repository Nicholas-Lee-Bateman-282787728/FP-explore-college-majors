8341003,1,B001TCL1V0,"Considering how many solid versions of this great play are out there, I wonder what this version is really about. Weak acting, poor stage direction, a disassembled script, plus lame commenting before every act, makes this video not worth the effort to watch. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news but this sad retelling has nothing going for it.",1527811200,,342,4.716666666666667
8341004,1,B001TCL1V0,"This is really really bad, and it was physically painful to watch. The editing was really bad and it is filled with commentary that it frankly unnecessary. And also the acting is regrettable, and Tybalt looks older than his uncle.",1517443200,2,230,4.775
8341005,1,B001TCL1V0,"This is a ridiculous attempt to sell a badly-made, expensive video to schools and teachers doing ""Romeo and Juliet,"" evidently. It includes repetitions, passages out of order from the play, and clumsy attempts at digitalization of actors against scenes from Verona, right down to Juliet caressing the air high above Romeo's dead body. If it ever becomes available again, do not buy this DVD.",1263254400,12,391,5.125
