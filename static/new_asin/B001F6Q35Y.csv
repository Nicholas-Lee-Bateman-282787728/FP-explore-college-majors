8301078,5,B001F6Q35Y,"I was thrilled to find this inexpensive DVD set with three classic Powell-Pressburger films. The Colonel Blimp is the version restored in 1983, with 20 minutes extra--the cutting of which damaged the film's continuity when released. And there's a documentary on the film included also. A Matter of Life and Death looks restored as well. Very nice print. I Know Where I'm Going uses a nice print, better than any copy I've seen when televised. I'm very surprised at the quality of prints here. I was prepared for lower quality, given the price, so I'm very happily surprised by this.

This is Region Code 2, so you must have a multi-region DVD player. I'm hoping we get to the point where people look for the region code in the description. Buying the better deals on British films often requires playing Region 2 DVDs. The alternatives are buying off amazon.co.uk and pay large shipment fees, or buying separate DVDs for each movie at anywhere from $16-24 for these Powell-Pressburger films. Criterion Collection DVDs are excellent and have lots of nice extras, but budget deals they are not. Let's keep these Region 2 DVDs and try to get people used to looking for the region code. Unless they buy the multi-code players (which are inexpensive these days), they are always going to be disappointed and low-ball the ratings on a lot of great films.",1521936000,,1348,4.810344827586207

8301080,5,B001F6Q35Y,I bought this collection so as to have a copy of Colonel Blimp which is in my opinion a great and underrated film. It may have faults but for an old sentimentalist this is real entertainment with some interesting acting. The other two films are of a completely different genre but are also funny and worth watching and it is fascinating to watch the young Wendy Hillier as compared to herself when she was older and dominated every scene. It is also worth noting that very few films have two directors with both having equal billing.- Powell and Pressburger were a good team.,1458432000,4,575,4.592233009708738
8301081,5,B001F6Q35Y,"Bearing some interesting similarities to ""Ghost,"" ""Always,"" ""A Guy Called Joe,"" ""Here Comes Mr. Jordan"" (and its remakes) and ""Cabin in the Sky,"" this film -- the one of this collection of three that's entitled ""A Matter of Life and Death"" --- manages to be surreally-different in its own right,  And is a worthy addition to the collections of all who love and enjoy that genre.  So it's hard to believe that for me to obtain it, I had to settle for buying it from a UK vender in a NON-Region-1 format!  It plays fine in my region-free player, but even though those are inexpensive and easy to obtain, not everyone has one, so for people to have to go through that extra hassle is absurd!  DVD ""regions"" are a nonsensical JOKE!!

  I won't spoil this film by telling you HOW it's different from the others in its genre that I listed above; I'll let you discover that for yourself.  Suffice it to say that if you loved those other flicks, you'll probably find THIS member of this DVD's threesome to be every bit as enjoyable!",1458259200,4,1024,4.467741935483871
