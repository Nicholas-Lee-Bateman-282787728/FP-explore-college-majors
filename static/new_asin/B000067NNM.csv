family entertainment.",1204243200,,163,5.52
1717853,3,B000067NNM,I love shephards. these two work great together and act like they have lived together their entire lives.,1178668800,,105,4.888888888888889
1717854,4,B000067NNM,"I loved this movie.  Not often do sequels do justice but K-9 - P.I. does.  Jerry Lee and Belushi are great.  Jerry Lee has really become the co-star of this series of movies.  He isn't just a dog, but Belushi's co-star.  Belushi is trying to retire but Jerry Lee discovers a crime in the making and Belushi just can't resist.  He gets involved when he shouldn't have and now they are holding his pension checks until this case is solved because Belushi has become a suspect in the case.  Never fear, Jerry Lee is here and will help Belushi get his retirement checks going.  Jerry Lee gets together with another pretty white poodle and he is still feeling good even after swallowing the evidence that will solve this crime.",1145404800,7,722,4.542635658914729
1717855,4,B000067NNM,"This movie is really good, although it's not as good as the first one.  Lots of action and plenty of comedy.  The connection between Dooley and Jerry Lee is wonderful.  It's worth watching just to see the two of them interact.",1120780800,3,226,4.463414634146342
1717856,3,B000067NNM,"In K-9, James Belushi plays Detective Dooley, who with his police dog, Jerry Lee, solves crimes in a manner that brings out the humorous best of both actors, human and canine. K-9 was a big enough hit to spawn a sequal K-9: P. I., that permits both Belushi and Jerry Lee to cover much the same sort of predicaments that they faced in the original.  This is not to say that the sequel is lacking in humor. In fact, in some ways it is better than the original. Belushi seems to have grown comfortable with the persona that he has developed over a movie career that spans more than 70 films.  In most of them he plays essentially the same lovable goof that most audiences can relate to.  As Detective Dooley, Belushi faces a new kind of enemy: retirement.
As the viewer watches Dooley relate to his sudden forced inactivity, a bell resonates in whose clinging-clanging reminds that viewer that not all retirements are calm and worry-free. What does an ex-cop and his canine friend do when bereft of his sanctioned badge and gun? Why, simply carry on and solve crimes in the same way that they did when they were getting paid to do so. After watching the two relate and communicate, Dooley with words, Jerry Lee with head-wagging, the viewer sees the charm and comraderie that is evident between man and dog.  At times, I could have believed that I was watching Toody and Muldoon from the old CAR 54 tv series. The plots of such movies are minimal, of course, designed mostly to place the two en medias res of a dangerous situation.  In this case, Dooley comes into possession of a stolen new generation computer chip which, in the wrong hands, can revolutionize American technological society.  Along the way, he begins a romance with two women, one of whom is not what she appears to be.  The best moments are not between man and woman, but between man and dog.  The many scenes of humor will certainly resonate with dog lovers.  This is not a great movie, nor does it try to be.  What it does is to remind the audience that the truly funny moments of life are just as likely to be observed only by a faithful dog than by an applauding audience in a nightclub.",1039219200,8,2158,4.482142857142857
1717857,4,B000067NNM,"This movie was funny just plain enjoyable!  It wasn't quite as good as K-9, but who really expected that?  Jim Belushi is always a winner, and always pleases me with an enjoyable movie!
The crazy antics the two go through, in their job as private investigators is just plain hilarious... there are times when things are just a little too silly... but that's the charm of Jim Belushi films anyways!  Like who in the world would take a bath with a dirty dog???
If you are looking for a silly fun film, this is it!",1036800000,13,511,4.3578947368421055
1717858,5,B000067NNM,"A lot of us found K-9 to be an enjoyable and very funny, albeit offbeat, buddy movie -- the buddies being a very competent but eccentric detective (Jim Belushi) and a very talented but equally eccentric German Shepherd, Jerry Lee. K-9 fans looked forward to the almost-inevitable sequal which was entitled K911. Although K911 gave us a second movie with Belushi and Jerry Lee it's buddy movie charm was mitigated somewhat by the introduction of a female partner and another dog. Now, somewhat unexpectedly, we get a second sequal to K-9 -- the one we've been looking for. No partner and other dog, just Belushi and Jerry Lee at their best -- or worst -- depending on your perspective. K-9:PI is strictly for fans of the original K-9, but they will love it.",1031875200,21,756,4.69172932330827
1717859,5,B000067NNM,"K-9 is Jim Belushi's best movie. The exploits of him and Jerry Lee are beyond entertaining. The perfect mix of action, comedy and suspence.",1027641600,4,139,4.833333333333333
1717860,1,B000067NNM,"A horrible sequel to a movie that was a moderate success 13 years ago! The DVD cover has lots of police tape on it saying ""Police line, do not cross,"" it also shows Jim Belushi taking a bath with his dog. I think that's the line that should not be crossed. Implied beastiality, poop jokes and so much more dreck have convinced me that we lost the wrong Belushi. If you buy this, they'll just make more of these horrible movies, and I will curse you until the end of time.",1027555200,2,471,4.186813186813187

1717994,5,B000067NNM,"I have always loved  any movie that included an  animal as a featured character and this was no let down.  The first movie is also excellent.  I am impressed with James Belushi's acting.  I think he had a lot to live up to with a brother like he had.  I do believe the first K-9 movie was the best, but I have all three in the series and have not been disappointed by any of them.",1396051200,,380,3.9342105263157894

1717999,4,B000067NNM,"K-9 - P.I. is a fun dog comedy with Jim Belushi.  It's the last in the series, better than the second, not as good as the first.  Some of the comedic devices from the first in the series are used again in this movie, leaving a feeling of a lack of freshness.  I like the extra features which include a commentary on how all 3 movies in the series were made.",1348185600,,357,4.0

1718001,4,B000067NNM,This movie was actually better than I expected after some of the negative reviews I saw before buying it. I thought the first two had good story lines and this one fits. If you enjoyed the first two I think you'll like it.,1267056000,2,222,4.186046511627907
