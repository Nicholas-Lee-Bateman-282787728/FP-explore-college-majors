8373661,2,B002M9FXVS,"Spartacus is less about the actual fighting in the arena and the rebellion than about romancing the Roman woman.  The fight sequences are very bad; it is obvious that the actors never had any actual training in how to handle a sword.  I have seen other movies done during this period and as a comparison, the acting & scenes are not very good.

Ben Hur is only about 10 minutes long and because of the length I actually expected it all to be about the chariot scene.  It wasn't; much of the book and later movies are different.  The chariot scene was poor.  In the book, later silent movie and Heston's movie, the brick falling on the Roman was actually done by Hur's sister and Hur took the blame.  In this version, he did it.  Although this was done in 1907, and was very short, at least a simple thing such as this could have been accurate.  The actors were pretty good, much better than in Spartacus.

SEE THE RAMON NAVARRO 1925 VERSION OF BEN HUR; IT HAS THE CHARIOT SCENE THAT INSPIRED HESTON'S (They are comparable; & Heston's version has to be taken from this 1925 version, because the book does not go into such detail as to be the sole influence of Heston's scene).",1499990400,,1175,4.398148148148148

8373663,4,B002M9FXVS,"Five stars for a brilliant and, doubtless, must have been expensive production from among early film-lore of the era of silent motion pictures, only four stars, however, for quality as processed for DVD. Martin R. Kealey's praise regarding ""Spartaco"" (""Spartacus"") as a cinematic work, in his comments for Amazon-U.S., are justified. So are his comments about the lack of historical credibility in any real detail vis--vis whatever that we know from the mists of antiquity -- admittedly not a lot -- about Spartacus, the gladiatorial slave rebel of the Roman Empire. In this 1913 film the action takes place nearly entirely in Rome, avoiding many changes of scenic milieu, apart from the Vesuvian retreat to which the slaves have holed themselves up at one point.

There is a lot of intrigue, romantic liaisons between slaves and the upper Roman class, lions to which to feed Spartacus after his capture (but which end up devouring his rival instead), the virtuous gladiator having been blamed wrongly for a patrician's murder, and so on and on, romantically free treatment, indeed, of an historical subject rather in the manner that 18th or 19th century opera librettists would have handled things. Leave it to film reference sources to handle details of the film's cast, plot, etc., rather than to belabour them here. In terms of any genuine history about Rome or Spartacus himself and the slaves, about the movement freely of lower and upper classes intermingling among each other, as depicted in the 1913 movie, it all strains credulity badly enough, it hardly needs bearing to state.

This edition of the film, without any bonus features, which would have been desirable to provide for an item of this cinematic antiquity, has used only a fairly decent copy (or copies) of the movie, not much enhanced with any sophiscated image-processing, from which to produce the DVD (Alpha Home Entertainment ALP-7508 as available on the North American market). However, Alpha's edition does include far more footage of the motion picture than what is available of it on some Web sites that can furnish downloads, but which offer less of the movie's footage than Alpha Home Entertainment supplies, making the DVD an important resource, although yet other download Web site(s) claim to offer still more of ""Spartaco"" than Alpha does so. (A pal, going by pseud., ""Spartapups"", pointed this out.)

In other respects, too, although making a good start at it, this is not the kind of film restoration that ultimately such a masterful cinematic work of its era fully would merit. The lighting varies probably even more than the original would have done so on screen; the images frequently are scratched; and the black and white contrast is not what could be achieved if more archival restoration effort had been expended upon the work. At least the reel speed has been gauged well and thus there are not the kind of quick, jerky movements that defile so many other silent films as made available for latter-day audiences; this one displays as much natural movement as one rightly would expect of a commercial film, even of that remote era of movie-making.

The pantomime that constitutes silent film acting is redolent of opera or ballet (that is, gestures common to both, not, of course, the latter genre's fancy footwork), as then was considered to be suitable to a serious, histrionic work of this nature, thus making comments on acting ability, for a movie that scarcely attempts to convey the like, to be rather beside the point. The actors, several of the men impressively handsome, the women quite pretty, are suitably noble, brave, sweet, venile, craven, and so forth, according to their respective characters. For those who do not dismiss out-of-hand the ""low tech"" (by later standards) of silent film, the 1913 ""Spartaco"" (""Spartacus"" as presented in North America) is a curiosity-satisfying and, really, quite enjoyable film for its time.",1447977600,,3936,5.050769230769231
8373664,3,B002M9FXVS,"The 1915 ""Spartacus"" is a fascinating view of the ""Sword and Sandal"" epic of a century ago.  This Italian production should never be viewed for any true sense of late Republican Rome or the Third Servile War, but as an early cinematic exercise in film epics.  The acting is characterized by the often histrionic nature common to early movies: understandable since, having no sound, these were actually pantomime captured on film.  The sets and costumes are surprisingly good, if inaccurate, and the film moves with a steady pace.  It is a shame that any similarity with real historical events is purely coincidental (Spartacus the 'hero' of Rome? wedding Marcus Crassus' daughter?); making the Starz miniseries seem like a historical treatise.  However, taken for what the film makers set out to do; i.e. make a romantic drama in a 'historical' setting, it hits the mark.  For any fan of cinematic history, ""Spartacus"" is a treat.  For Roman history, not so much.",1421366400,,963,4.98125

8373666,4,B002M9FXVS,"It must be admitted that these films are more interesting for their historical significance than for their entertainment value in the 21st Century.  However, I enjoyed SPARTACUS.

Its no accident that Italy, the country that invented grand opera, should be among the first to bring historic epics to the screen.  SPARTACUS (1913) is a feature length film (58 minutes) and is really quite good, if one can forget Kirk Douglas for awhile.  This version is based on a different novel than the 1960 version and the plot is considerably different.  It was state-of-the-art in 1913.  Nonetheless, if one compares it to D. W. Griffiths BIRTH OF A NATION (1915) and INTOLERANCE (1916) it becomes obvious that the state of the art was advancing rapidly and SPARTACUS quickly became dated.  It had the advantage of location shooting in parklands with Roman-inspired architectural elements and the studio-built sets are also quite well done for 1913.  The acting is generally good except for the leading lady (Maria Gandini as Narona, the daughter of Crassus and the beloved of Spartacus) who hadnt grasped the idea that acting for the movie camera is not the same as acting in a 3,000-seat opera house.  All of the actors tend to get a bit stagey with their gestures in scenes of high emotion, but are otherwise quite acceptable.  Mario Ausonia as Spartacus is particularly good.  There are plenty of thrills, battle scenes, a chariot race, and hungry lions in the arena.  Its well worth watching.

On the other hand, BEN-HUR (1907) is an awful film even by 1907 standards.  Its so bad I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.  To begin with, it runs all of 13 minutes.  When I bought the DVD I thought that it was a 13-minute excerpt of a longer film.  By 1907 studios were turning out features 40 minutes and longer.  But this film attempts to tell all of BEH-HUR in 13 minutes.  Its no wonder that the heirs of Lew Wallace successfully sued the studio for infringement of copyright.  Its believed to be the first film to have that dubious distinction.

The acting and direction are beyond pitiful.  In crowd scenes one can practically hear the director shouting Everyone raise their arms!  Everyone take two steps forward!  Too far, one step back!  Speaking of crowds, the crowd for the chariot race is all of about 15 people.  There are more horses than spectators unless some of the chariots ran around out of camera range and came on again, which is quite likely.

For me the interest in this film was the presence of William S. Hart (in his film debut) in the role of Messala.  Hart is remembered today for his many westerns and adventure films that were notable for strong characters and careful attention to historic detail, but in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries he was a very successful stage actor and originated the role of Messala in the stage version of BEN-HUR.  Alas, in this film he has about 30 seconds of screen time and is virtually unrecognizable as there are no close-ups.  The only way he can be recognized is by the way he crosses his arms when challenged by Ben-Hur. It was a pose captured in publicity photos for the stage version and a gesture frequently seen in his later films.  Otherwise, I would have had no idea which of the actors in fuzzy focus was Hart.

I can recommend this DVD for SPARTACUS, but you can do better for BEN-HUR.  For example, MGM made a superb version of BEN-HUR in 1924 and its available as a bonus feature on the 2-disc DVD of the 1959 version.",1392249600,4,3495,4.649265905383361
8373667,3,B002M9FXVS,"Some words of comparison between this Grapevine DVDR here and the Televista DVD http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B002M9FXVS .
1) The Grapevine runs at a higher frame rate which partly explains why it is only 58 minutes long and the Televista 71, but the Televista has nevertheless indeed more and longer shots, especially the battle against Crassus soldiers is much truncated in the Grapevine, e.g. the whole descent from the mountain is missing.
3) The Grapevine has two instances of blue and red tinting which are quite appropriate, the Televista is black & white only.
4) Grapevine's soundtrack isn't exactly great, but the inappropriately jaunty Televista soundtrack essentially parodies the film and is to be avoided at all costs.
5) The Televista has in three instances the shots badly out of order, while the Grapevine always gets it right. This happens
a) after roughly 7:20 on the Televista when Spartacus and his two friends are in the cellar, the picture suddenly jumps to them in other positions and then the young woman is taken away. Obviously the scenes after that with Crassus promising the young woman to his wife and the soldier walking to get her belong at the moment of the picture jump. Since the shot of the hall where the soldier is passing through to get her and then taking her to Crassus is filmed in one take and only was broken up in editing, it hilariously looks on the Televista as if she were waiting outside of the frame to be taken.
b) at roughly 26 minutes Spartacus is passing a white fence, pausing and then walking on. The Televista cuts to Crassus' wife preparing and walking to their meeting and back again to Spartacus rival .. and we still see his foot leaving the picture on the left frame! Obviously the Grapevine is right by not cutting away and first letting the shot of Spartacus and his rival at the fence run through and then cutting to the woman. Generally I have the strong suspicion that this, I assume, US release copy was cut up for speed and reworked quite a bit.
c) the absolutely worst mistake comes at the end when the Televista goes haywire after the title card ""Into a dungeon beneath the the Circus Maximus - condemned to be devoured by the lions!"". Just watch the Grapevine and you see that Spartacus is lead into the cellar, becomes aware of his friend there, gets a guard so she may tell the truth outside, then he is taken away by the soldiers, passing some friends who mourn him, while his friend informs Crassus wife so he may be freed. The Televista reverses this into a jumble with the friend informing Crassus wife before she has been freed!!! Obviously the people at Televista don't watch their own releases.
6) The picture quality of the Grapevine is worse, it is tighter framed and too dark and contrasty. the Televista is still obviously too greyish and bleached out, but on the whole better.

So the Grapevine has the advantage of a better music and coherent shot sequence which especially matters at the end where the Televista has you scratching your head in wonder. But even if you don't mind the darker picture, you have to deal with missing shots which can be no less confusing than Televista's bitching of the end. Especially the situation of the slaves who are first encircled by Roman armies on the mountain is suddenly resolved on the Grapevine by a sudden victory over the Romans which makes no sense whatsoever until you see on the Televista what's missing.",1369872000,,3448,4.7275747508305646
