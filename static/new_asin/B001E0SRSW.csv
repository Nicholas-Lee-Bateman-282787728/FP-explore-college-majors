8471512,1,B001E0SRSW,"The Fanglys is literally the worst horror movie I've ever seen. I felt myself nodding off within the first 20 minutes so I turned it off and took a nap. When I got back up and turned it on I was dozing off again before the ending. There's a dude playing the witch and the director playing a retard, or maybe he wasn't acting at all. The budget was all of 99! It went straight out of my DVD player right into the trash!",1350864000,,418,3.988095238095238
