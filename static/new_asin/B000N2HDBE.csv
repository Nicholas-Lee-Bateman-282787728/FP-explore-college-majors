8174103,5,B000N2HDBE,"I love watching Dave and Dave! I watch it most Saturday nights at 10:30 on PBS channel 13. This DVD is to my knowledge the best collection of their television work available on DVD. I'd like to see a ""best of"" collection of their half programs on DVD sometime, but I don't know if there's a large enough audience to warrant any release of that kind. Anyway, I'm glad to have this, and I'm sure I'll watch it over and over again, and also visit some of the fine restaurants featured in this extremely enjoyable hour-long special. It should also be noted that the DVD contains plenty of bonus material, so the actual running time of all the material on the DVD is close to 2 hrs. Enjoy and Bon Appetit!",1232755200,2,700,4.351145038167939
