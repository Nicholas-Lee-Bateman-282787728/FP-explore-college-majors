8532563,1,B000V9KF2I,"The basic plot is plausible but the overall storyline isn't at all. A school girl gets pregnant so an ageing hooker who can't conceive pretends she's pregnant as well, befriends her and when the teenager is nearing term, has the baby cut out of her and tells her husband (a drug king) she just gave birth to his child. Even though the teenager is the only one of the two to actually have been to a doctor who know she was pregnant, police aren't interested in even questioning the hooker. A waitress simply backs the hooker's story that the teen said she didn't want a baby and gave it away. Ignoring the whole giving a baby away would be a crime in itself so they should be following that up, seems the obvious thing to do in this situation would be to sieze the baby, swab it's mouth, swab each claimant mother and give the baby to the one whose it is and arrest the other. But as we said the police aren't really interested in looking for the hooker (who fled town with her husband), even when the couple return to town.

There's a heap of other stuff that makes no sense either. You've got a fake medical clinic in a small town with signage saying so, in a building that's been vacant for ten years, yet one it has electricity, and two no one in this small town noticed the signs or cars parked there? Why is the teenager found staggering down the rural highway, wouldn't she have staggered to neighbouring buildings in town? The big question though is what is the hooker feeding the baby with? She obviously wouldn't have breast milk and why wouldn't her husband be asking why she isn't breastfeeding? For that matter how would he not see her naked for nine months to not notice she wasn't pregnant? Plus if he's this ruthless drug guy who everyone is afraid of, why didn't he just kill the teenager when she tries to take the baby? I seriously doubt the teenager wouldn't have just killed these two either, what court would sentence her to any time? What was the husband trying to achieve in his final scene anyway?

The biggest flaw is even mentioned by a cop in the movie when he dismisses the possibility of the crime, how would the hooker hope to get away with this crime? A simple DNA test would end her plan. If she had killed the teen so no one was the wiser and sent texts or something saying she'd run off with her baby because her sister wasn't being real supportive and then hoped no one ever suspected her would have been the only way.

Not to mention Tracey Gold didn't look at all like a high school student, a high school students much older sister maybe, but not a high school student.",1458345600,2,2607,4.371134020618556
