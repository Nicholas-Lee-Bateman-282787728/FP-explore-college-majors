6242375,5,B00HX8CJ5Q,This review was previously just a link to where you could get this title cheaper but now that Amazon has it for $30 I'm changing the review.  Tombstone Territory is great action packed western.  The series stays great throughout every season.  The biggest appeal for me is Sheriff Clay Hollister (played by Pat Conway) is a no nonsense lawman.  Unlike in other series this lawman doesn't mess around...if you don't go with the program you end up six feet under (where most of the bad guys belong).,1410566400,12,497,4.67816091954023

6242382,5,B00HX8CJ5Q,All the episodes of this 50's western although black and white the video and audio are of excellent quality. The writing is better than I remember it as a 12 year old.

6242387,5,B00HX8CJ5Q,"As an old timer  from the early TV days I enjoyed this series when it was first aired. I was delighted when the complete series came up to be purchase. Certainly movies, TV etc. have changed and it may , like many of the early TV shows  be considered old hat today, however many are such timeless classics as to be still being shown on TV and cable shows i believe testifies that there is still an aging audience for them . The series of  Tombstone Territory is one and not to have to wait for the next weeks""exciting episode""as we told each week is now at my pleasure  and i am still enjoying them. How much truth there is to the fact that they are based on stories of the times from the Tombstone Epitaph I do not know  but it is a splendid half hour western and I am a sucker for westerns, so much that  I have had the pleasure of visiting Tombstone a few years back for a regular replay by local actors of the Gunfight at the OK Corral. Similarly I have visited the USA on some 22 occasions and on each visit treated my self to  visiting places of my interests ie boxing, the old west, civil war sites and your marvellous national parks. I recommend to any armchair cowboy out there.",1503446400,4,1187,4.1798245614035086

6242391,5,B00HX8CJ5Q,"Tombstone Territory is a show I hadn't know before I began watching it on Get TV. I thought I would buy the entire series on DVD and I am glad I did. The price is very reasonable for all the episodes contained within. I'd say it was one of the better Westerns of its day, even though it doesn't seem to get a lot of publicity. I like the novelty of having each episode ripped from the pages of ""The Tombstone Epitaph."" Whether they really were or not doesn't seem to matter as the show, told by the narrator and newspaper man Harris Claybourne, does have an authenticity to it. Pat Conway is good as tough sheriff Clay Hollister. If you like TV Westerns, give this one a try.",1502323200,2,675,4.24031007751938
6242392,3,B00HX8CJ5Q,"The TV series is excellent. I am pleased to add it to my movie library. The engineering design of plastic case is inferior to all the movie cases that I have. The DVDs are all stacked on a central hub. There is no place to safely store each dvd that I watch. I had some old plastic dvd/cd cases that I am using to store dvds in after I watch them. This will help keep them from getting scratched up. After I finish watching series, I will return the dvds to the original case.

I wasn't a great fan of them. But there were I would watch. Death Valley Days was one.
And the Other was Tombstone Territory! I
Unfortunately the Western is dead as far as television is concerned.
Movies have revived the Western...some what. But  there are few good quality ones made today. The last good western I saw was The Revenent!
As for this series, my rating is 5 stars the show. But only 3 for the disc. As the set that I bought from a 3rd party merchant had a defective disc, that wouldn't play. And I paid WAY too much for it!
I shoulda waited a few years until the price went down!",1499731200,3,770,4.273972602739726

But all so far have been excellent, all come in clear, sound is great, stories great. Black and white of course. Most are from 1958, so far. Great acting, a lot of action, a lot of gunfights. Good scenes, with variation...not just same old places. Was surprised to see some pretty famous actors and actresses on some of them. I paid twenty five dollars for mine. Bought last year when prices were higher. All the TV episodes are included. Good buy, even at the higher price. Nice case for the discs...they slide on and off the spindle easily, but when you put them back they stay put and sort of lock into place until you push down on spindle to remove them.",1498780800,,814,4.3618421052631575

6242435,4,B00HX8CJ5Q,"I watched this show when it was on television originally back in 1957 - 1960.  Remembered the theme song but could only remember enjoying the show without remembering the actual show itself so I picked it up.  So very happy I did.
Pat Conway stars in the show as Sheriff Clay Hollister and Richard Eastham as Harris Claibourn, the owner and editor of the Tombstone Epitaph.  The episodes are good, interesting and some even have guest stars that most people are going to be familiar with.  To name a few, Michael Landon, Pernell Roberts, Jack Elam, Lee Van Cleef, Leonard Nimoy and Angie Dickinson among others.  The stories are good and some would even stand up today.  This was a half-hour show that was on the air for three seasons.  While Tombstone is a very real city and the Tombstone Epitaph the real city's paper, the stories are fiction and should be accepted as such.  I'm half way through the episodes and on occasion they throw in a character who was real like for instance Johnny Ringo.  But please remember that the stories are fiction.  When researching before filming the show, the producers checked out the kinds of stories that were in the Epitaph back in the 1880's so that the stories would be true to its day and they checked with an historian also.  Very much recommended.",1468454400,8,1294,4.631578947368421

The best thing about this series was the theme song, and I love hearing it again.  But the acting by the two leads is merely adequate, the plots mundane, and the gunplay, which is minimal, often preposterous.  I think the price is very good, for 40 hours of viewing time, and the quality of picture and sound excellent.",1467244800,4,425,4.48051948051948

6242439,5,B00HX8CJ5Q,"A very good value.  The case is OK and the DISCS are protected.  Most of the episodes have action and the plots are good.  Season 1 had 40 episodes.  Season 2 was short only 12 episodes and was cancelled when they lost their sponsor.  In an unusual but welcome decision the TV studio decided to proceed with a Season 3 of 39 more episodes thinking ahead for syndication.  This series holds up well against any other western of the time - I found them very enjoyable.  One other observation that has nothing to do with the episodes or packaging:  The opening sequence has a very dramatic musical sound which builds your expectations.  However, the ending musical theme is a silly song that can stick in your head and you can't forget it.  When the show ends I suggest you skip over the credits or turn the sound off or you will be humming that tune all day long.",1466812800,3,861,4.3924050632911396

6242454,4,B00HX8CJ5Q,"This unusual 30-minute Western follows the adventures of Clay Hollister, Sheriff of Cochise County, Arizona Territory, and based in Tombstone, the county seat and a ticklish mix of ranch and mining economy.  Clay, played by Pat Conway, is apparently intended as a sort of hybrid figure combining all the better features (and none of the worse ones) of the various peace officers who called Tombstone their home base in the 1880's (he never encounters any of the Earps, for example), since each episode is given a definite date in that decade (and they jump around from 1881 to '84 to '82 to '89 and...you get the picture).  His closest friend is Harris Claiborne (Richard Eastham), editor of the influential Tombstone Epitaph, who, like Clay, seems to be based on a real person, in this case John P. Clum, who did indeed found the Epitaph and edit it, though not for the entire decade: the two of them often dine together, Harris sometimes rides on one of Clay's posses or acts as an unofficial deputy, he and Clay once start a campaign for mine safety laws that draws the support of the Governor, and twice he's held as a hostage to force Clay's cooperation.

Like most TV series, this one displays a notice in its credits that ""any similarity to actual persons...is purely coincidental,"" but immediately below that comes the declaration that it's ""produced with the full cooperation of Clayton A. Smith, editor of the Tombstone Epitaph, and D'Estell Iszard, Historian.""  Certainly Clay and Harris do encounter some historical figures--Johnny Ringo, Geronimo, Nellie Cashman, Bill Doolin, Buckskin Frank Leslie, Curly Bill Brocius, Doc Holiday (in Durango, Colorado, where he claims he ""never heard of [Clay]""), and ""Elizabeth Blythe,"" a female journalist who may be an analogue of Nellie Bly.  They also cope with range wars, feuds, lynch mobs, bank robbers, rustlers, a visit to the local Chinese quarter by a pair of big hatchet men, even a female rustler (Rose of the Rio Bravo) and a man who strikes silver in the street and digs a secret tunnel from his house to mine it.

Clay is incorruptibly honest, but has little sympathy for reformist sentiments and knows and even respects some outlaws, like Johnny Ringo, who he thinks is being persecuted.  He's a soft-spoken, level-eyed man with a quizzical tilt to one eyebrow, a jaunty angle to the hat above it, an easy sauntering walk, and a smile that can go from sly to sardonic to genuine and warm.  He's subtle (he and Jim Crown of ""Cimarron Strip"" would understand each other) and has a keen insight into character, as when he deputizes notorious rustler kingpin Brocius to help him collect the county taxes in Galeyville, and earns the man's undying respect (""That's a man"").  He's also not only an excellent rider (Conway was in fact raised on a ranch), but bonelessly, fantastically graceful in the actual way of top gunhands (watch for his drop-and-twist in the third-season segment ""The Vacation"").

Although the guest roster features numerous names that were unfamiliar to me, it also includes Charles Aidman, John Anderson, James Best, Peter Breck, Diane Brewster, Kathie Browne, Harry Carey, Jr., John Carradine, Anthony Caruso, Lon Chaney, Jr., James Coburn, Russ Conway, Elisha Cook, Jr., Angie Dickinson, Andrew Duggan, Dabbs Greer, Virginia Gregg, Ron Hagerthy, Alan Hale, Jr., Douglas Kennedy, Keith Larsen, Gerald Mohr, Ed Nelson, Leonard Nimoy, Kathleen Nolan, Larry Pennell, Mala Powers, Andrew Prine, Denver Pyle, Rhodes Reason, Pernell Roberts, Bing Russell, Fay Spain, Guy Stockwell, Liam Sullivan, Regis Toomey, John Vivyan, Harry Lauter, Roy Barcroft, James Westerfield, Perry Lopez, and Tony Young, besides two-time names Myron Healey, Leo Gordon (who also wrote several of the episodes), Paul Richards, Ralph Taeger, Michael Landon, Ron Hayes, Jack Elam, Lee Van Cleef, and Robert F. Simon (both times as the Territorial Governor), and three-timers Warren Oates and John Doucette (one of whose roles is Geronimo!).

6242457,5,B00HX8CJ5Q,"Timeless Media/Shout! Factory is to be commended for its first-class presentation of ""Tombstone Territory:  The Complete Television Series.""  This great DVD box set contains all 91 uncut episodes with sharp, crisp black and white images and strong, steady sound.

As a kid growing up in the 1950's and early 1960's, I was glued to our big mahogany, black and white television set. Television in those days, along with reading and art, were my avenues of escape.

Today, years later, I remembered ""Tombstone Territory"" as being one of my favorite TV Westerns, but I had long forgotten why.  Now this new DVD box set has brought it all back to me in spades.

""Tombstone Territory"" was a major cut above many of the horse operas that populated the television landscape.  The series revolved around a real newspaper office, ""The Tombstone Epitaph,"" and the relationship of its editor/publisher and the town's tough-as-nails sheriff.  Each episode is fashioned from actual happenings pulled from the old back issues of the newspaper.

Looking for ideas for a new Western series, the producers discovered that fact could be much more interesting and exciting than fiction.  And this discovery was made while browsing through ""The Tombstone Epitaph"" back issues from the 1880's and 1890's. And, so, ""Tombstone Territory"" was born.

Enlisting the help of then-current (1957) ""Epitaph"" editor Clayton A. Smith and noted Tombstone historian D'Estell Iszard, numerous stories and situations were discovered, culled, and developed into screenplays that would become some of the best Western episodes ever broadcast on television.

These true-life stories form the core of ""Tombstone Territory"" and provide a realistic look at the rough-and-tumble West that was Tombstone, Arizona Territory.  Sheriff Clay Hollister was played by Pat Conway who, in real life, was raised on a ranch. By the age of 10 he was an expert rider and roper. Conway was also from a show business family.  His father was film director Jack Conway and his grandfather was silent film legend Francis X. Bushman.

""The Tombstone Epitaph"" Editor and Publisher Harris Claibourne was played by veteran actor Richard Eastman whose deep, stirring voice provided the narration for each episode.

At 6' 3"" tall, the handsome Conway played his character in a tough, no-nonsense manner. Sheriff Clay Hollister was an expert pistol shot, but he preferred the use of a double-barreled shotgun to get the attention of lawbreakers in Tombstone.

He often used this deadly weapon to exact the maximum amount of damage in the minimum amount of time, and few bad men enjoyed staring down the barrels of Hollister's shotgun.

The scripts are often nuanced, multi-layered, and thoughtful.  Sometimes the bad men aren't always so bad.  The sheriff even pins a deputy's badge on a few of them when the need arises.

""Tombstone Territory"" has some of the most amazingly beautiful black and white cinematography found in any TV Western, and this was done under the talented and skillful supervision of Curt Feller.

The viewer will notice some aerial shots in just about every episode.  These were done by helicopter, a rarity in 1950's series television.  This adds a lot to the visual impact of these adventures, especially in conveying the vast expanse of the American West.

Another noticeable aspect of the series is that ""Tombstone Territory"" has a big-budget feel to it, even though it was made by ZIV Television Productions, a company often known for its quality TV series done on shoestring budgets such as ""Highway Patrol"" and ""Sea Hunt.""

The actual town of Tombstone used in the series was Gene Autry's Melody Ranch.  This was the same shooting location seen in ""Gunsmoke"" as Dodge City.

Melody Ranch was almost completely destroyed by a brush fire on August 28, 1962.  This was a terrible loss for the film industry that relied on Melody Ranch whenever an authentic-looking Western town was needed.  Autry did not rebuild his beloved Melody Ranch.

Timeless Media/Shout! Factory has produced and made available on DVD many great TV series.  Quite a few of those series have been obscure and nearly-forgotten.  ""Tombstone Territory"" was one of those, but thanks to this great, new DVD collection, this fast-paced Western can be enjoyed once more.

So, pardner, don't forget to check your guns over at the sheriff's office when you ride into Tombstone.  Otherwise, you might find yourself on the business end of Sheriff Hollister's shotgun.",1442016000,41,4488,5.134986225895317
6242458,4,B00HX8CJ5Q,I bought this classic western for my mom who grew up watching this show. It bought back memories.,1442016000,,97,4.444444444444445
6242459,5,B00HX8CJ5Q,"I had never seen this show until the Series One DVD box set was released. Having thoroughly enjoyed it, the only way to watch any more was to buy the Complete Series. Until recently, this was only available through third-party sellers at an eye-watering price. Fortunately, Tombstone Territory: The Complete TV Series is now being stocked & sold by Amazon at the correct price & I've added it to my collection.

If you aren't familiar with this show but are a fan of TV westerns I'd say give it a try as, in my opinion, it's as good as any other of its era (1957-60). Good stories, well told & acted, with occasional guest stars. The episodes appear to be complete & unedited & it looks like the original 35mm prints were used, as the picture quality is very impressive for a series over 55 years old. You may need to raise the brightness, but the detail & clarity from these black and white shows is excellent.

The series was a Ziv Television Production and the company made a wealth of classic shows. I reckon they even re-used the incidental music on here that had been heard in Sea Hunt & Bat Masterson. It's every bit a good as those, too.",1441670400,13,1145,4.421800947867299

6242468,5,B00HX8CJ5Q,"Haven't seen this series since I was a kid. Whether it was in syndication at the time or in prime time I'm not sure. Two things remained with me throughout the 50+ years between then and my writing this. The first is that I remember really liking this TV show even though I could not remember any single episode. I did remember the major characters and the basic structure of plotline for the series. The second was the theme song which remained solidly entrenched well within my brain, never wavering, line for line. And now that I've had the opportunity to revisit Tombstone through this excellent 10-DVD complete set I must say that my first impressions were right on target, as this is certainly one of the finest TV Westerns ever produced and the Timeless Media release is outstanding, presenting crisp, clear episodes that belie their age. It's like reliving my childhood all over again in Tombstone, Arizona. This is a great product that will hopefully remain available for some time to come. Highly recommended, of course.",1428192000,42,1030,4.824858757062147

To answer a query from another reviewer, there were 93 episodes shown originally but two of them were re-runs. I can't quite recall which episodes they were. I think Walmart may have made a mistake by thinking they were selling the Complete Season One and not the full series......Now I have watched the full series and I feel this set is still by far, the best available. I have purchased this series four times from various ebay sellers and this is far better than them all. Some of the episodes have variations in picture quality and some have the old TV advertisements for Liptons Tea etc. I certainly would recommend this set to lovers of the old black and white TV westerns.",1418601600,22,938,4.3352272727272725
