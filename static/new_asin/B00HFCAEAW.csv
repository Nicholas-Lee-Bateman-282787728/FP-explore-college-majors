6161588,5,B00HFCAEAW,Excellent,1404604800,,9,9.0
6161589,4,B00HFCAEAW,this last series was not as good as the last but it was much better than dragon destiny thank to a better story and the return of the origanal cast of voice actors which was much better than dragon destiny ova was o.k. but not special if you like the original you should like this one.,1400025600,,285,4.107142857142857
6161590,3,B00HFCAEAW,"The Ikkitousen series continues its delivery of brutal fighting and eye-catching ""cheesecake.""

In ""Xtreme Xecutor,"" Bachou Mouki (thanks, based Cherami Leigh) gets introduced as the main cast fall into a trap set by someone known as ""Kentei."" There's a familiar aura surrounding the evil Kentai, by the way. (Oh, and credit for playing Moukaku goes to Jessica Straus; she voices Street Fighter 4's Juri.)

In the Shugaku Toshi Keppu-roku OVA, the main cast visit Kyoto and... You Guessed It! They're fighting again. With each other as well as the fighters of Kyoto (who don't get that much spotlight time AT ALL). The delivery of cheesecake remain the same.

I applaud FUNimation for dubbing this and bringing back the old case from seasons 1 and 2. (I'm saddened that Media Blasters didn't get the chance to do this, but I blame bad luck and sabotage from haters more than I blame MB.) I still wish to see Koukin do and be more than just being the ""sane one"" / tag-a-long / sorta self-insert, though.",1398038400,,1002,4.780346820809249
6161591,5,B00HFCAEAW,I would recommend this series to all anime fans. It is fun and exciting series with humor and fights. A++++!!,1397520000,,109,4.5
6161592,4,B00HFCAEAW,"This is a review of the DVD version.  It came with three disks, the last one of which was a 45 minute OVA.  It also has 6 OVA shorts on the first two disks that are the pure ecchi ones. The last episode was more like an OVA also, and, in fact, wasn't fully animated. The first two disks were in a plastic sleeve that had broken it's hinges so the sleeve rattled around inside the package. This package is rated MA for nudity and violence.

If you aren't familiar with the Ikki Tousen franchise, the basic premise is that big hairy warlords from China's 3 Kingdoms period 1,800 years ago have been reincarnated into well built high school girls. Different high schools are led by different reincarnated leaders, and they are constantly battling against each other. By this fourth edition the number of characters is quite large, so if you want a refresher on the characters without wading through 4 Seasons worth of Ikki Touson you can watch the 6 hour live action Chinese film ""Red Cliffs"", or watch the one season Shin Kohime Musou. (both available from Amazon)

As the girls battle each other they are constantly beating each others clothes off, resulting in bare breasted girls in battles.  The evil dude in this season is a guy running a high school in what looks to be a Tibetan monastery that looks like a medieval castle inside.  The main heroine is Hakufu, who is such a klutz that she provides comic relief in the middle of everything.  She is also so overpowered that she has to enter battles at the end, since she invariably beats all the bad guys to a pulp.  As you can tell, there isn't much plot line here, it is all about watching bare breasted girls battle it out.  Just be glad you don't have to pay for all their clothes that they waste.",1397174400,3,1755,4.459375
6161593,4,B00HFCAEAW,"This Ikki Tousen is very much like the pervious but seemed to be a more action oriented set. Its got the same basic set of characters and much of the themes are very familiar to most Ikki Tousen fans. It's not bad. I seemed to notice more action in this set rather than plot. Basically it's ""good against evil"" which most stories center about, but it this series it seems this is the main theme. I think some of the character developments lose in this way of dealing with the plot, but this is STILL a very good anime worth getting.",1395273600,,532,4.2772277227722775
6161594,5,B00HFCAEAW,"The fourth season of the Ikki Tousen series introduces the long-awaited significant warrior of the Three Kingdom saga,Bachou Mouki in the form of a Ryoshue High first year auburn-haired spunky and fiesty cutie wearing pink high-top sneakers,pink fighting gloves, a pink backpack filled with snacks,especially gummy bears...and with a real hatered for Kyoshou Academy's head,Sousou Moutoku,the person that killed her precious older brother. After the show starts off with a 5+ minute recap of previous events in the series,Bachou starts this season by coducting a one-fighter raid on Kyoshou Academy,looking for Sousou. It would be too much of a spoiler to give the results of her attack here but the girl definately has serious ""game"".
A ""person"" in a mask,calling ""himself"" Kentei,(the name of the last emperor of Gokanouchou of the Three Kingdom Era) appears,first before the two evil sisters,Moukaku and Mouya,joint heads of the remote Nanban High and offers them the power to take over the Kanto Region if they follow ""him"". Thus starts this season,one of prolonged and violent battles,intended to be to the death of the fighters;that is the goal of ""Kentei"".
While most known players in this series make either brief appearances or are otherwise accounted for, in the end the principle players are; Bachou;Kan'u and Ryomou (Mou-chan) locking in a death struggle orchestrated by Kentei,Ten'i,the very attractive ( and probably the one that spends the most time naked)  psychotic devotee to the late Shiba'i;Hakufu and Koukin and Kyocho,the very large soft-spoken protector of Sousou that wears the number ""12"".
For those that have always wanted to see the icy-cold silver-haired swordswoman,Cho'un Shiuu,naked, this will be your lucky day.
The art work has improved,the toplessness/nudity seems to have increased,the action is intense and is at least if not better than the other seasons along with,it would seem, a hint of more to come,probably involving both Bachou and the exceptionally attractive but psychotic Tin'i.
Highly revommended,even for the first-time viewers of the series.",1390262400,12,2091,5.414110429447852

6161609,5,B00HFCAEAW,The film was awesome.  The movie was quite entertaining. And I like the fact that it had an OVA film included.  I recommend this to kids over 17 years old and all adults who love anime.,1427328000,,185,4.111111111111111

6161612,5,B00HFCAEAW,"More of what you've been used if you follow this series. Definitely plenty of fan service. Ditzy heroine. But she's got the muscle and the moves when it counts, along with her friends. Lots of action, good story.",1410912000,,212,4.605263157894737

6161614,5,B00HFCAEAW,"Some are turned off by fan service but this anime has improved with every season. It's first season has more blantant fan service than the rest but like the first three has a very interesting storyline, some epic fights, humor and characters you can love. I'd watch it with or without fan service. And after watching it with Japanese audio, it's great to finally have it in english... Nothing wrong with Japanese language, I just simply prefer to hear it in english since that's my native language.",1405123200,,498,4.735632183908046

8632389,3,B00HFCAEAW,the ending to the anime and it left me felling like they just change main characters thru every season instead of focusing on the characters that made me like this series from the beginning.the voice acting and animation style are still of high quality so it still has that going for it but would only recommend in completing the sires,1513036800,,335,4.6

A good buy  with speedy delivery.",1456790400,,76,4.6923076923076925
8632395,4,B00HFCAEAW,"Okay, this next version of Ikki Tousen follows the previous one with a little more of a story line and a little deeper drama. You have the same beautiful teen female warriors doing their fight thing, and those scenes are pretty decent. Overall a good addition to the series. If you liked the others, you'll definitely like this.",1453420800,,328,4.672413793103448

8632397,4,B00HFCAEAW,"Animation and voices are ok; Story, as usual, has an open ending for more episodes. Animation realism and focus is changed from DD, i.e. this R rated series has changed the R a little more on the realistic side: Sayto girls with their single layer sailor tops (and others) now show their teats directly thru, fewer  panty shots and those that are there are not pretend nude shots with white colored flesh pretending to be panties. Now in battle the girls lose most of their entire top with out the upper half impossibly covering their teats, also breasts used to have built in bra structure within their flesh, they hang more normally now.  This type of show with battling women has sex as a given attraction, BUT in keeping it just R rated now they at lease offer something that is more realistic.  UPDATE just finished my 5th viewing; still great BUT I noticed another annoyance: every last girl has the same teats, with is impossible in real life; one shot shows 4 different girls and looking closely that is the same on each one.  In one close up that girl's teats are different; but in the next sequence her aurora's impossibly shrink?? Looks like different artists render these conveniently the same as they wish; and change for effect when someone else does the close up. Anyway this show is worth purchasing although the artists still draw characters for effect than using a character model for sequences.  Worth watching and still not a porno with sex scenes; just lots of action to keep one's attention.",1448496000,2,1513,4.694339622641509
