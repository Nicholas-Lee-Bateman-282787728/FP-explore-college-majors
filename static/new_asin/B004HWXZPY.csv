8429735,4,B004HWXZPY,"I purchased this DVD from the author's website but later found it on Amazon.  This is an exercise method that combines isometric exercise with a belly breathing technique.  Anyone can do this.  I have purchased videos and DVDs on Oxycise and Bodyflex who both combine breathing with static stretching.  The problem for me with both of these methods is that the breathing techniques were so complicated, I couldn't figure out when to inhale, when to move, when to roll my stomach and when to exhale!  I like this gentler breathing technique.

The exercises are demonstrated by the instructor.  There is no class of students.  The instructions for each exercise are given by a voice-over accompanied by soothing classical music.  The sound qualilty is excellent in that the music does not overpower the instructions.  You can exercise along with the instructor.  I have only two criticisms:

1) It looks like no effort was put in to make the set visually appealing.  The background is a wrinkled gray sheet.
2)  There is no individual menu so that you can choose to review individual exercises or versions separately.

On the DVD you get a beginner version and an advanced version.  Also included was a booklet, Isoband and tape measure.  If you would like to learn a unique exercise method that anyone can do and don't mind the things I mentioned above, this would be a good purchase.",1304035200,4,1383,4.8418803418803416
