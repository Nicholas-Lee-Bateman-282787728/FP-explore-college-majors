1908443,1,B0000AMJEL,"This abysmal mafiosi thriller about a war between the families in an anonymous city lacks anything in the way of flair, charisma, or momentum. During his prime, veteran director Richard Fleischer was a creative force to contend with, and he made his share of great movies, but ""The Don Is Dead"" is one of his least memorable epics. Clearly, this lackluster actioneer exemplifies the old studio system of making movies and the blame for its pedestrian quality must be traced back to its producer, the legendary Hal B. Wallis of ""Casablanca"" fame and his associate producer Paul Nathan. After Wallis left Warner Brothers in a dispute over ""Casablanca"" with Jack Warner, Wallis set up shop at Paramount, and he ruled with dozens of landmark films, among them ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral"" and ""Becket"" with Richard Burton. Once Wallis left Paramount and wrapped up his career at Universal, the quality of his craftsman went down. ""The Don Is Dead"" is a well-produced crime thriller, but it is as lifeless as the don in its title. The pacing of this 115 minute movie is leaden, and a number of fine actors are left to wander around aimlessly in the screenplay by Marvin H. Albert. Albert is best known for ""Duel at Diablo,"" ""Tony Rome,"" and ""Rough Night in Jericho."" Matters are not helped by the dire lack of realism. Virtually everything in ""The Don Is Dead"" was lensed on a Universal back lot, and it is clearly obvious from fade-in to fade-out what a numbing picture that this is. Surprisingly enough, the Motion Picture Association of America gave ""The Don Is Dead"" an R-rating. Mind you, there is no nudity, the violence is standard-issue, and that startling loud red blood that appeared in 1970s era films was sparingly put on display. None of the gunfights stand out for their distinctive flair. The only thing that does stand out is how the Robert Forester character avoids a hit in a crowded underground parking lot. He holds himself up on the bumpers of two cars so that the gunsels cannot see his feet. Fleischer helmed ""The Don Is Dead"" between the sci-fi thriller ""Soylent Green"" with Charlton Heston and western ""The Spikes Gang"" with Lee Marvin, two films that rise about the flat quality of ""The Don Is Dead."" This is the kind of movie that only completist in the Mafia genre will want to watch. Anthony Quinn looks terrible and he has no fire in his performance. Robert Forster is pretty good as a temperamental young man and Frederic Forrest is the man to watch.",1396051200,,2477,4.722863741339492
1908444,4,B0000AMJEL,"Don is Dead is a Mafia-related film, which has good dialogue, decent acting, and fine direction by one of Hollywood's best directors, Richard Fleischer. The widescreen picture is good and enhanced for 16:9 TVs.",1318809600,5,210,5.205882352941177
1908445,5,B0000AMJEL,"This is a real good movie, If you collect mob movies you'll notice the 70's mob movie has a different flavor to it than those of the 80's or past that, the blood scenes may look a little fake but that's because it's probably being compared to those movies that came after. The film makers where probably testing the waters' with blood letting, and special effects where not as advanced. Anthony Quinn always does a great job in movies so it's no surprise he's great in this, Charles Cioffi does a good job of manipulating Robert Forster and The Fargo Boys are outstanding! As with all mafia movies you've got to look more to the eye-contact than the blood letting to get the real story, it's the expressions that tell the mood of the movie. A great addition to any mob movie collection.",1303689600,6,786,4.503496503496503

7997691,4,B0000AMJEL,"I never heard of this movie before until I came across it while looking up movies with Anthony Quinn. When I read about this movie, I got it, watched it and liked it very much. It's a nice little Mob movie with plenty of suspense and great performances by Quinn, Fredric Forrest and a nice little performance from Abe Vigoda in a bit part. Al Letteri and Robert Forrester play their usual characters, Letteri as a gunman and Forrester as a hot headed guy as he always plays. I have a feeling the producers of this movie (Legendary Hal B. Wallace) was trying to compete with ""The Godfather"" with this one. He doesn't succeed but he did make a nice, entertaining movie.",1400284800,,667,4.475409836065574
7997692,5,B0000AMJEL,"Those of you who are criticizing this film, please do me a favor and STFU!!!
This movie is much better then all the parts of God Father combined together.
The guys in this film make Vito, Michael and Sammy Corleone look like 8-year old girls.

You might ask what is so special about this movie?-- well for starters the non-stop violence
reminiscent of the Italian produced mob movies of  the 1970's, add to this Jerry Goldsmith's
swanky 70's music, and compelling plot-line with a very interesting ending, and you have yourself
a gritty-action-mafia movie.

Interestingly, there is a scene in this film at the beginning of the movie, involving a Cadillac, Nevada desert,
and a guy being beaten up with a baseball bat, a scene one can see in the movie Casino (1995).",1397520000,,765,4.7368421052631575
