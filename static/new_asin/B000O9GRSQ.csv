8184070,4,B000O9GRSQ,"I have to admit to collecting Disney videos from their animated classic, Disney Parks and select live action films. Most of the Disney Parks videos are more like informercials, but this collection including four individual releases for each park, plus one on their Disney Cruise Line is pretty good as an overview of the park illustrated on the cover. This one The Magic Kingdom runs approx. 30 minutes give or take and has several options to make the experience more enjoyable and gives some replay value.

You can watch the video, or add the Trivia Track which adds fun facts in text at the bottom go the screen. Another option is Disney Details where you can click on the Mickey icon to bring up stills and short video footage of different events and old footage from WDW. There is also so short video footage of first person ride throughs on some of the more popular rides.

The menu is a bit tedious with no play all feature, but it isn't too irritating to navigate. You can probably spend an hour an a half viewing all that is here and it is certainly better than the informercial style DVD's out there. The video quality could be better, but it is improved on over the older version released under the title Happiest Celebration On Earth DVD collection. It's the same exact video with very minimal material added to this newer set. This collection is entertaining for what it is and if you can find them at a reasonable price it's worth it for Disney collectors. One more note this was released in a 5 disc box set under the title When Dreams Come True. This newer set is the better of the two sets, but it really has very little new added to it.",1405728000,2,1653,4.470198675496689

8184073,5,B000O9GRSQ,"This is a 5 DVD set that highlights all the neat things to see and do at Disney World---rides, shows, characters, etc.  There is one disc for each theme park (Magic Kingdom, Epcot, MGM/Hollywood Studios, Animal Kingdom) and the 5th disc is Disney Cruise Line.  My kids like watching these over and over again to remind them of our Disney World vacation.  It would also be a great way to prepare for a trip, to see all the different things you can do and help decide what you want to do when you get there!  Sadly, there is no coverage of the waterparks (Blizzard Beach, Typhoon Lagoon) but the coverage of the 4 theme parks is wonderful.  We did not do the cruise but after seeing that disc, hope to be able to someday.  I would not pay $200 for the set (I see some joker has listed it at that price) but I paid $95 at Disney for my set and feel like I got my money's worth.",1217030400,2,874,4.1420118343195265
