8008652,4,B000197G7K,"This is the first of this series I have seen, a series of at least 12 train travelogues.  The narrative, cinematic and production qualities are very nice - almost BBC quality.  There is a pleasant balance between scenic and train interior content, and there is generous historic and geographic information.  It includes travel and schedule information sufficient to outline an holiday excursion, and includes a few extras - including links for making reservations.  The tone is refined and low key - very light on any commercial influence.  This title is about an historic train line in Australia, and I will be looking for other titles in the series. All-in-all, an enjoyable and informative 57 minute diversion.",1501372800,,713,5.112068965517241
8008653,2,B000197G7K,This was more about the train than travel.,1407801600,,42,4.375
8008654,3,B000197G7K,"While the DVD was quite informative, I considered that it lacked adequate content of the scenery during the train trip.

It is also somewhat outdated as it does not address the extension of the route between Alice Springs and Darwin.

DVDs of the updated Ghan train trip are available in the PAL format.

An updated version of this DVD that would include additional scenery as well as the expanded trip to Darwin would be a useful tool to persons who planned to take to trip as well as a keepsake for persons who have taken the trip.",1229299200,,533,4.474226804123711
