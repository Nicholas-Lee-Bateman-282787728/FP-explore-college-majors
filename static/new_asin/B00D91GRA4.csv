5778020,5,B00D91GRA4,"The ""Man of Steel"" movie is both action and plot heavy, dealing with complex spiritual issues as well as what it means to be human. On the other hand, the action is heavy-handed, with punches, bullets, and other weaponry being thrown at people on a regular basis. This combination of depth and intensity creates a powerful film, both visually as well as in theme. The performance of the story was breathtaking. As expected, the visuals were stunning; the special effects were phenomenally crisp and the scope of the camera was often wide, presenting the scenery itself as a spectacle. The acting was exceptional as well. Shannon's Zod was angry, driven, and resourceful, everything a good soldier is meant to be. His lines were powerful and his intentions and thoughts were practically visible on his face as he acted. Cavill's Superman also performed exceptionally. Each line was delivered with honesty to the character. His part was not really dialogue heavy, but his role was emotionally demanding, requiring sadness, fury, remorse, and empathy at various points in the film. His character is vulnerable and emotional, unsure of himself, which Cavill communicated well. Adams as Lois Lane was an interesting choice, and her role is not given as much screen time for development, but she did do a good job playing a driven reporter, dedicated to her work, even if it means bending the rules. It will be interesting to see where her character is taken in the next film (which is confirmed as a Batman/Superman movie according to news from Comic Con). The standout performances are definitely the two fathers, Costner and Crowe. The fathers, without giving anything away, are given numerous occasions where emotional scenes are required of them. Their sequences were powerful and convincing. I almost cried in the movie twice, and they were involved in them both. Their performances were moving.
The story itself was the highlight for me. The story fearlessly stepped into religion, humanness, choice, evolution, and power, stepping out unscathed. There will be many who disagree with the film's presentation of the ideas, even I would disagree in places, but, by dealing with them, they gave the film depth. Also, besides philosophical depth, the movie's plot was gripping from the beginning and, overall, solid. The film revealed just enough of the plot to keep the audience informed and then continued, using flashbacks to catch the audience up as necessary. The plot had no real twists, but the plot was not necessarily predictable (I have not read the comics, but the comics could deal with the story. So, comic book fans could be familiar with the plot; I am not sure). The story was compelling, emotional, and relatable. This film ranks, in my opinion, as the best so far this year. The acting, story, and music were all great, giving the Man of Steel a five star return to the big screen.

5778021,4,B00D91GRA4,"First of all, I'd like to point out that overkill is vastly overrated. That being said...

Yes, here it is! Another re-boot of a classic comic book (""graphic novel"") ready to be one of the box office smashes of the summer. Be warned...this thing is looooong (143 minutes), so watch your liquid intake! I found it interesting that in the packed screening last night, I didn't see ONE person dash out for a quick potty break, everyone was fascinated as we watched a little boy learn to cope with x-ray vision, super hearing and uncommon strength. I had never given it a second thought, had you?

We have:
  * Henry Cavill (""Immortals"") is our appealing new Kal-El/Superman. I hope this Brit is ready for the inevitable wave of publicity. He certainly looks the part and didn't embarrass himself in any way. He's craggier than Christopher Reeve, but has that same impossibly good-looking, sweet presence.
  * Amy Adams (""Trouble with the Curve"") is Lois Lane, the bright-eyed reporter who is in his face from the get-go. She's too smart and is eager to spill the beans about our hero's identity. What a scoop!
  * Russell Crowe (""Les Miserables"") as Jor-El, sends his infant son from Krypton, his own doomed planet. The heart and soul of this 90-minute plot is contained in that decision.
  * Kevin Costner (""Hatfields & McCoys"") is Jonathan Kent the wise corn farmer who pulls that infant from the space capsule and raises him as his own. He convinced ME he was from Kansas...
  * Diane Lane (""Secretariat"") is Martha Kent, Clark's beloved ""Ma.""
  * Laurence Fishburne (""Contagion"") is The Daily Planet newspaper publisher Perry White, in a nice update of the character.
  * Michael Shannon (""The Iceman"") is General Zod, the main villain from Krypton, a zealot who never doubts for a moment that what HE believes, is absolutely right and true.
  * Antje Traue (""Seventh Son"") is Faora-Ul, another survivor of Krypton; she proves to be just as indestructible as the other two.

As directed by Zack Snyder (""300""), we have a charming 90-minute movie expanded to 143 minutes by padding it with LOTS of fisticuffs, Computer Generated Imaging, blowie uppie stuff, gunfire, space ships, missiles, collapsing skyscrapers, a planet split in two, a school bus sinking into a river, space debris, and a nice farm in Kansas (shot in Illinois). When I complained about all the CGI, my companion noted that it's the only way Superman can save the planet! ...sigh... This means you'll LOVE your DVD from Amazon so you can Fast Forward!

This is PG-13, so expect surprisingly little blood, minimal profanity, one chaste kiss, many delicious bits of humor and the joy of watching decent people trying their best to do what's right. Oh! And be sure to suspend disbelief; this is, after all, a comic book.",1370995200,16,2786,4.825263157894737

Nothing is perfect, but all quibbles aside, this movie has a ton of heart and passion.  If you want to watch an 'adult' superhero movie, this is the one to watch in my opinion (followed by Wonder Woman).

It's a real shame that Warner Studio meddling and greedmongering ruined most of the DCEU movies that came after Man of Steel.  Batman vs Superman is only palatable really in the special extended DVD version & the theatrical release of Justice League was also a mutilated/butchered travesty of what it should have been.

5778036,2,B00D91GRA4,"I'm sorry to say that this movie is really quite awful. It's as awful as Wonder Woman is excellent. I'm writing a review at all because I don't want you to spend the money unless you just really want to.

I went into this movie hoping for the best, having enjoyed Snyder's 300 despite its man-boy feel in places, although Watchmen's ending, which upended and gutted the entire story (read the fantastic graphic novel and see why), made me angry enough to almost leave the theater. (I'm a comics fan but not a rabid facts-only viewer - if the movie is true to the characters and honors the core of their stories, I'm happy.) Watchmen got the feel right, at least, and gave fair if not full treatment to the characters.

I can't really review this movie's badness without getting into spoilers (and trust me, there are plenty of examples), but here are some nonspoiler comments:

PROS:

1. Visuals. The imagery of Krypton is especially notable and almost poetic in places, verging on Guillermo del Toro's visionary style. Costuming is also carefully crafted, and the Krypton armor is futuristic but elegant. There are multiple scenes that capture parts of the story well in single shots, the sort of pictures that tell a thousand words, although these are badly undercut by sometimes gratuitous or even inexplicable placement (Superman reaching toward the sun at one point makes absolutely no sense story- or setting-wise).

2. Score. While not as good as much of Zimmer's work, it's still good, and in too many places it's the only thing that lends a scene its gravitas.

3. Casting. The actors do the most with what they've got. If like me you found the first three Star Wars movies (1, 2, and 3, that is) to be gorgeous but painfully flat in story, you know exactly what I'm talking about.

CONS:

1. Story. It's just utterly ridiculous in so many ways and has plot holes you could drive a planet through. So many actions on the part of the characters just don't make sense: they don't follow logically; they demonstrate too much knowledge in an attempt to bridge story elements; they have little emotional backing; they indicate a lack of foresight that borders on idiocy. Granted, Nolan's films sometimes suffer from the plot hole issue but make up for it, mostly, via their poetry and character development. This one doesn't. It also suffers from some extremely poor transitions between major sections. It's mostly a repeat fightfest  with a lot of CGI thrown in. By the time you get to the extremely predictable mano a mano faceoff, it's just boring, and doesn't even make sense from the POV of the main ""bad guy"" because revenge doesn't follow from his programming.

2. Character depth. Outside of the actors'  notable attempts to lend this to their roles, and the periodic exception (such as Costner, who has one very well done scene in particular), there just isn't much. Snyder apparently expects fans to bring too much comic-created meaning to this movie. You're not supposed to rely on backstory to do this. Superman is such a strong DC storyline, it's just that much more pathetic that this movie fails to evoke serious connections to its characters. Scenes meant to be momentous fall flat or don't ring true. Again, it's a lot like Star Wars' 1, 2, and 3: great material to draw from, to little avail.

3. Scripting. It's eye-rolling bad in places, especially for poor Clark, and Zod doesn't get much better treatment. The script overall takes itself way too seriously. The one joke is Clark's line to Lois after they kiss (hardly a spoiler), and it's truly terrible. Compare to the Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy scripts, which show you how to include plenty of wit and humor without robbing the characters or story of their depth, and often actually contribute to both by expressing the characters' humanity, personality, and ability to find something funny in the midst of horror.

In short, Snyder suffers here from much the same strengths and shortcomings as George Lucas: striking cinematography, lackluster script and characterization, borderline storytelling that showcases major expected elements but fails to knit them together. Actors doing the best they can with what they're given, but a bad plot remaining just a bad plot.

This movie could have been so much more and wasn't. I love to get lost in good stories, and I was already critiquing this one in my head fifteen minutes in. Several times I thought about just stopping watching. I kept hoping it would get better. It never did.",1527033600,,4516,4.825355756791721

5778047,5,B00D91GRA4,I love this take on Superman. Christopher Reeve was GREAT when He was Superman but he was an awful Clark Kent because he always purposely acted like an idiot when he was Clark Kent which was like half the movie. That always made me cringe. It's refreshing to see Superman (Henry Cavill) act like a normal human being here when he is not playing the role of Superman. I always thought acting like a idiot when you are Clark Kent would draw attention to yourself anyways. It's better just to act normal.  The origin story of Superman is wonderfully told in flashbacks. Kevin Costner is great as his earthly adoptive father and Russell Crowe does well as his real father on Krypton. Krypton is a feast for the eyes visually. The story is exciting and action packed with incredible visuals and special effects. Amy Adams is wonderful as Lois Lane. I highly recommend this film.

5778049,4,B00D91GRA4,"I realize this is not IMDb but I'm going to say this anyway, they started off with a more serious story here with Man of Steel and outside of Wonder Woman, (which even some of those fight scenes seemed a little bit shorter and the movie was more light-hearted), all the stories that followed just seemed like they were trying too hard to make some things funny or extreme and somehow the fight scenes got shorter. Personally this is my favorite or possibly second favorite in this era of DC movies. Not in all DC movies across the board of course. I like Clark's story here outside of Kevin Costner's... hurricane scene.",1525737600,,620,4.544642857142857

5778072,5,B00D91GRA4,"I remember seeing this film in theaters and thinking to myself ""WOW, if this is what I can expect from the DC cinematic universe, I'm going to love every movie they release!"" Of course, that's not the case, because Warner Bros. are unprincipled hacks who just want to copy Marvel, and have continued to ruin every incarnation of DC characters they can find (Read: Justice League) and have no interest in making something original or creative. They were looking for a studio hack who would follow the copy and paste method and make the company hundreds of millions off of bland and forgettable bullshit. Instead, they hired an auteur who delivered 2 and a half hours of breathtaking visuals, meticulously crafted sound design, an epic and memorable score, moving drama, and moral hardship, along with a well developed villain, and some of the best comic book action to ever grace the screen. The decision to shoot handheld on 35mm film creates movement that I, as an aspiring filmmaker, adore and cherish. Very rarely do I get immersed in films as much as I did with this gem, and I give mountains of credit to EVERYONE who had the privilege of working on this film.

The ONLY criticism I will give any of you heathens who think this movie sucks, is when Lois is falling even though everything else is being sucked into the phantom zone. Other than that, I will continue to loathe the fact that I won't ever be able to see a Zack Snyder comic book movie like this.

Gorgeous cinematography, heart-pounding music, exhilarating action, and an intelligent, fresh, complex handling of a character and story that the world thinks it knows because of Chris Reeve and Richard Donner. This is not Reeve's and Donner's Superman. If you want Reeve's and Donner's Superman, watch the Reeve and Donner Superman movie. This is a fresh take on both the character and the story, one that becomes more enjoyable with subsequent viewings. The characters are rich and compelling and complex and layered. I liked it when I first saw it in theaters. I liked it more when I watched it again when it came out on disc. After my 3rd time through, I started to appreciate the layers and the world building and the character development even more until I started to recognize the genius that is Zach Snyder--in his casting, his visuals, and the beats of his storytelling.

5778080,3,B00D91GRA4,"A different take on a very old story. I did miss Marlon Brando's exquisite dialogue as his son sailed forth in space on his long journey to Earth -educating him about his past and preparing him for the people he was about to meet. Russell Crow did an abbreviated version, which is fine for today's viewers.  We have the same themes from the Christopher Reeve version, and that is that Krypton is being destroyed, and Russell Crow must send his only son to a new habitable world.  The native Kryptonians have engaged in artificial reproduction and have harnessed other worlds for their expansion through out their known universe. The movie mentions evolution, which is a theme you don't really see that much in today's movies,  The Kryptonians want Earth for their new home, and they want the humans gone. There is only one small problem, Superman.  However, he's a bit reluctant to engage the transgressors, basically his own people, and sides with the people from Earth, and a massive battle ensues, which is incredibly long, with a lot of devastation.  At times, it seems Superman is having a hard go at it, and it looks like he's in a lot of pain, but he prevails in the end. The movie was shot in different sequences, as we see shots of Clark growing up in Kansas, and using his power to save a school bus, but attenuating his power when he needs to. It's definitely a good movie, with great character development (you should know Superman by now), and great acting by all involved,  It's a definite go see and a real CGI spectacle.",1522281600,,1536,4.608058608058608

5778082,4,B00D91GRA4,Just watched this movie again in 4K.  This is my 4th viewing of MOS.  As for the 4K HDR version- in my opinion the grainy nature of the film and limited use of HDR does not make a big difference vs 1080 streaming (I own that version also).  The 4K image (watched on an OLED HDR set and premium 4K player) is not as good as I would expect- image grain is everywhere.  HDR also limits the depth of blacks on this film- a tradeoff I do not like.  Now as for the movie itself; it is good.  The first part- on Kripton; is completely unnecessary and a 5 minute version of that would have helped the pace of the movie.  As for the rest I found to enjoy it a lot- it is much better than I recall on the first watch- that might be to the depth of some of the imagery and story- that I can now recognize with the repeat viewing.  I like better than Chri's Reeve Superman; I just re-watched the Richard Donner's version and it is good- but like this version better,1521936000,,953,4.031914893617022

5778090,4,B00D91GRA4,"Man of Steel(2013) is a reboot of the Superman movie series. It's a UK/US co-production directed by Zack Snyder and written by Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer. It delivered what the audience wanted. Superman punches the bad guys! Did the Kryptonian bad guys have to trash an IHOP? How waffle! There's also post 9/11 imagery with buildings crumbling into gray ashes. Henry Cavill was cast as a young Clark Kent/Superman. Michael Shannon shows some flair as General Zod. The Amy Adams Lois Lane treats Clark Kent like a human being. Diane Lane is really good as Martha Kent. Hans Zimmer's percussion heavy music score is very good. He didn't recycle any John Williams music from Superman The Movie(1978). Laurence Fishburne was cast as Perry White. Rebecca Buller was cast as Jenny, an ultra-pretty brunette who works at the Daily Planet. Is Jenny related to Jimmy Olsen?
 In Man of Steel, Clark Kent/Superman has to stop General Zod from taking over the Earth and killing off the human race. Part of the film is a coming of age story about Kal-El/Clark Kent being raised by Jonathan and Martha Kent. Clark Kent finds out who he really is while searching for a derelict Kryptonian space ship. The flashback scenes add texture to Clark Kent. In one flashback, he rescues some schoolkids as the school bus sinks into a river. The scene where Superman flies into the sky for the first time is amazing. Batman vs. Superman Dawn of Justice(2016) picks up where this film leaves off.

Horrible mischaracterization of the world's most inspirational and iconic superhero, in this film he's douchey, unlikable, and wooden. Henry Cavill has shown in other places that he more than likely would have the charisma to play Superman right, if given the chance. However, this is not that chance. Zack Snyder seems to be the main culprit here. It's hard to not recognize this as a Snyder film. With the ugly color grading, tacky CGI, rampant and unnecessarily excessive levels of violence and destruction. Superman is selfish and a murderer. Lois Lane seems to appear magically wherever the plot needs her to be, which is exceedingly annoying because she is such a thinly written boring character, who only serves as a bland love interest. A tragic waste of Amy Adams and Lawrence Fishburne. Michael Shannon exceeds in the role he is given.",1519776000,,945,5.025477707006369

5778105,2,B00D91GRA4,"I don't know what I can add that 5,600 people haven't already said. You either like Zack Snyder's vision or you don't.

I'm a don't.

There are a lot of things I find untenable about this version of Superman. Letting his dad die; his moody/surly attitude; the instantaneous affection for Lois Lane; but, of course, the colossally stupid way the fight with Zod ended is my main turnoff. I don't like to go into scene specifics, so I'll just say there were dozens of other possible ways to do this more to my liking.

There are also lots of good pieces to this movie. Clark growing up was well done, showing both his challenges and his vulnerabilities as a man beneath the super. And Henry Cavill strikes an impressive and heroic figure. The special effects are also well done (a long-time strength of Snyder's).

But DC already has a tall, dark broody character, He's called Batman. This Superman seems too much like that character and it's hard to imagine this one inspiring other heroes and regular people. Thankful, sure. Inspiring? Meh, not so much.

DCU is too dark on screen already. A little light is needed to counterbalance that darkness. Note, light does not necessarily mean ""lighthearted"", it more refers to one hero providing a beacon to look up to. This movie didn't offer that.",1519516800,,1291,4.72
5778106,5,B00D91GRA4,"Never thought that Russell Crowe would be in it, as Jor-El but he did a marvelous performance. Diane Lane did a great performance of Martha Kent. Amy Adams is really cute, she also did a great performance as Lois Lane. Love the scene the way Superman punched General Zod from the air. Great story. Awesome acting.

5778108,4,B00D91GRA4,"Great movie, especially for someone who's never seen a Superman movie, show, or comic before. A little too much violence - they seriously destroyed an entire city, and how many people must have been killed? But I like the humanistic side they show of a young Clark Kent grappling with being different, respecting and trusting his parents so much that ***Spoiler***... plus, I like the way he and Lois meet - their relationship is done quite nicely. Altogether, a pretty great movie.

You don't need to see any movies before this, and don't rush to watch Batman v Superman - it's a bit of a downer. You can see my review here: https://www.amazon.com/review/R1SYNQA1U7TP34/ref=cm_cr_srp_d_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8",1518998400,,703,5.221238938053097

5778110,5,B00D91GRA4,"So it begins. The DC Comics Extended Universe, a wide scale movie universe encompassing its great comic book superheroes into a movie franchise of epic proportions to rival Marvel Comics has begun.

Superman started DC Comics, so its starts with Superman. Funded and flourishing under Watchmen and Sucker Punch director Zack Snyder, this is definitely as step up from Bryan Singer's noble attempt with Superman Returns. With great actors and actresses involved this movie brings forth Superman in more awesome telling of DC's history.

Its the same story as before, a planet is doomed to extinction but the noble efforts of a scientist leads him to save his son from the apathy and arrogance of his people. His son grows to become a mighty being that learns the truth of his origins and becomes a force for good. Basic premise though compounded with an even more fiercer villain. In many ways this combines the original Richard Donner Superman Movies into one movie with General Dru-Zod, the tyrannical Kryptonian leader commanding an army to rule the Earth and his former friend's son. Though told more with a much more serious perspective and with a much more dangerous threat for all mankind.

Zach Snyder does a great job, almost every minute of this movie is great because of him. Henry Cavill is a great Superman, the man has the look and the gravitas but he lacks the late Christopher Reeve's charisma and hope. Russell Crowe proves his bad boy mettle by equaling if not surpassing Marlon Brando's acting in the role of Jor-El. Michael Shannon is more than worthy to be Terence Stamp's successor in the role of Zod. The action is ten times stronger than it was in Superman Returns and certainly worth a sequel. But this movie is not without its flaws. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are weak in their depiction of the Kents. Amy Adams is only slightly better than Kate Bosworth, and she is nowhere near Margot Kidder's excellence in the role of Lois Lane. Some parts of this story are pretty weak, I also didn't like certain things in the movie. Plenty of controversies in this movie. Someone shouldn't have learned you know who's secret and she shouldn't be his girlfriend. Some of the destruction that happened was unavoidable. Another thing is for certain, I do believe in the concept of a Righteous Kill and I have no problem with what happens to Zod.

This was a great start for the DCEU and can't wait to see it come full circle. Because I Still Believe A Man Can Fly.",1518739200,7,2479,4.71824480369515

5778143,3,B00D91GRA4,"Contrary to popular opinion, this movie along with Batman vs Superman Ultimate edition really grew on me.  Bvs Ultimate is a completely different film. However I'm going to talk about the quality of the 4k.

It's a definite upgrade from the 1080p blu ray.  Where the BD is soft, this is more detailed.  However it is also darker than the bluray so you lose some viewable detail.  The movie itself is dark by design. With the 35mm stock grain they also seem to have added digital grain to possibly help blend the 2k visual effects.

Few 4K discs have a full 4K workflow.  Logan and Lucy are two that are very close to that. This was shot in 35mm with 2k visual effects, they did a 2K digital intermediary and then upscaled to 4K.  Overall it's not a great representation of 4K. However if you love the movie, it is worth the upgrade, and a definite buy if you don't own any prior versions.

The best representations of 4K is yet to come. Studios are doing visual effects in 2K still because workflow and server strain for 4K visual effects is double the cost.  This coming from a visual effects producer friend at Method in Santa Monica.  When they shoot in 4k or higher, do visual effects in 4K, scan and have the digital intermediary in 4K, then we'll have actual real 4K content. The upcoming Blade Runner 2049 4K UHD disc is supposed to be an example of this.  Then of course there is a plethora of cameras all with their strengths and weaknesses. 3.5k, 4k, 6k, 6.5k, 8k, digital, 35mm, great with low light, terrible with low light etc. Etc..

Till then each 4K disc will be a toss up and need to be individually reviewed for all the elements above to determine the presentation quality.

The sound on these 4K discs is almost always Dolby Atmos now and the sound design, mixing and presentation is remarkable with a lot of arriving in the rear speakers and overall spatial delivery.  Times have changed.",1512777600,10,1908,4.489855072463768

I really hope that JL has the original cut somewhere still. I guess I don't enjoy the sweaky bright superhero movies anymore a more darker gritty tone with fimiluar characters is what I prefer I guess with some more cinimatic tones. This movie seems to have that. It is a bit heavy on cgi. The cast is actually great  ensemble, Henry nails it, the characters are drawn loosely from several of the most popular story lines so for purist you can see some discrepancies.

5778162,3,B00D91GRA4,"Rebooting the Superman franchise from the beginning, rather than continuing from the old movies from the '80s.  Also not connected to the plot of the film ""Superman Returns.""  This one sets up the story that will lead into the film ""Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice"" which will in turn lead into the Justice League movie (2017) that will feature Batman, Wonderwoman, the Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg as the hero team.

As a movie on its own merits, it was action-packed and entertaining.  You also get a little bit of family drama showing how Clark Kent integrated into his human family and school while learning to control his powers.  Most of the plot revolves around the destruction of Krypton (Superman's home planet) and General Zod's attempts to use Superman's ""genetic codex"" to revive the Kryptonian race... by wiping out the humans and terra-forming Earth to become the new Krypton.  And then of course much time is dedicated to the fight scenes where Zod's genocide squadron faces off against Superman and the human (American) army plays a minor role as a third combatant force.  The human authorities are not sure at first if they should trust Superman, but much of this deliberation is implied off camera instead of fleshed out on film, which I think reduces its effectiveness as a plot element.  Also, the fight scenes were intended to be epic - basically Zod and Superman are like gods on Earth - but they sort of fell short of the mark.  Still good fights, but I wouldn't call them ""epic.""  Most of the city of Metropolis, and pretty much all of the town of Smallville, are destroyed in the struggles, but nobody so much as bats an eye at the damage.  That, too, makes the film a little hokey/cheesy.

The musical score for this one would be pretty good on its own as background music for a road trip to someplace epic like Norway, but it was a little over-done and at times the music tends to sort of step on the toes of the action on screen.  It isn't bad, but occasionally it is a little bit distracting.

All in all, an ok action movie but I felt it was lacking in plot development and most of the characters were one-dimensional and utterly forgettable.  I also recently watched the Batman vs. Superman movie and it was more of the same, unfortunately.  Wonder Woman was a little better though, so I still have a small hope that Justice League will be worth the price of admission.",1510790400,,2403,4.618823529411765

But the ones that appreciate his work understand the level of brilliance he has.  He casts superman in a very unique light and in my opinion a much needed and interesting light never really seen before.  The visuals are outstanding and with Zacks unique film style he's able to create such atmosphere and depth strictly due to how he shoots the visuals.

I love this movie! I don't understand it's hate. It has a great story with great action. It probably has the best action in any superhero movie ever. It is so epic and General Zod is a fantastic villain. It perfectly sets up Dawn of Justice and it only makes sense to introduce Superman into this universe first since he is practically the leader of the Justice League.

The only thing that I can understand that people of a problem with is Jonathan Kent dying and Lois and Clark's relationship. Jonathan Kent originally died from a heart attack, and in the movie he dies from a tornado. I thought it was very weird and I liked the thought of his father dying from a cause even he couldn't prevent. However, I thought it still worked for what they were going for and it wasn't wrong, it was just different. Lois and Clark's relationship seems to move forward rather quickly, which I actually didn't like. They could've made the movie a little longer to flesh that out, but it was alright. Hopefully they will continue to flesh out their relationship in future films.

Overall, it's a fantastic movie that I always enjoy watching!

I can understand why some people hate this version as it's a little dark, but honestly, I feel like Snyder breathes new life. Showing Clark's struggles with holding back, and being an outsider literally was a genius move. I can't think of any other adaptation that does it. Plus it has the humor and heartwarming moments as well.

5778296,5,B00D91GRA4,"I have purchased this DVD for my hubby.  OK SUPERMAN IN 3D COME ONE people need I say more?  It was visually a great movie, we loved it from the start to the finish.  It was a great movie.  The collectors container is great my husband LOVES it.  Flashy and one of a kind. Seller is great!  I am giving this product a 5 Star.

* 1 star (Nope, DO NOT LIKE IT AT ALL!): I would either return or throw away this product. It was a waste of my money and not functional. I will never order again.
** 2 star (Think twice before buying - don't like it): I'm not a fan of this item and I won't order it again, but it has at least one positive quality.
*** 3 star (Its ok): This item has both positive and negative qualities. It may work for some people, but I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase or recommend it.
**** 4 star (I like it): This item arrived and functions as advertised. I would change a few things about this (including pricing), but is a good product overall. I would use this item.
***** 5 star (I love it!): This item is AWESOME. I will use it and recommend it to others! I just LOVE it! It works as advertised and is an all-around great product.

All of my reviews are written with the hope of helping other Amazon customers make the right buying decisions for themselves. To help increase awareness of a particular product it might be positive or negative, but in the end it is honest.  Thank you for reading my review.  I hope it has helped you.

5778298,3,B00D91GRA4,"Regardless of whether or not this plot is true to the original comic books, the movie is just too long.  This is because of seemingly endless fight scenes between Superman and General Zod (who managed to escape Krypton before it exploded). The first few times they each crash through a building were great.  After a while it becomes tiresome.  Make sure your BD player remote control has a fast forward button. On a positive note, the special effects are excellent.",1496448000,,465,4.7875

But Synder's reinterpertation has refined the comic book character, for me. With its realistic dilemmas which pass over to the Batman vs Superman film, I was hooked! With Wonder Woman now in theaters,of which I have yet to see, I am looking forward to Synder's DC Comics Extended Universe.

The men are doing what they do best - focusing on what they believe is the action to bring the right result. Zod and the Earth's leaders illustrate this well.

And he hasn't had a truly good role since.  Head back to England, Henry, before Hollywood turns you into a joke. The script, as so much of the Superman and Batman movies, is atrociously badly written, though I am certain that the grade one students who wrote it had fun, none of which the movie goers had. Perhaps he needs a new and much better agent as anyone who encouraged him to do this and the sequels, must have been money mad and totally insane.

Not only are the actors top notch, but the story line accents former gray areas in Supeman's origin story.

All star line-up but the cheese was heavy and the hammy acting was thicker than a ham sandwich due in large part to the SHT script. Choice words I can't write in an amazon review but the guy who wrote this script should be fired. It was terrible. How is it that for such a huge budget movie you never once feel emotionally invested in any of the characters. Zod is the only one who but for a brief moment you care about and that's because the actor managed to squeeze some juice out of a total lemon of a script.

Movies like this crap are the reason I so rarely rent anymore. Two hours of misery. Man of steel...more like steal two mother @(@$ hours of my life. Suckfest on crack.",1483660800,,740,4.103448275862069
5778399,5,B00D91GRA4,"A solid re-imagining of a modern American folk tale.

Zak Snyder's visual instincts are strong. He pulls heavily from the decades of ample source material. Henry Cavill presents a strong Superman, a stronger Clark Kent, and the performances by Diane Keaton and Kevin Costner as the Kents are some of the best of the career.

Far superior to the droll Batman V. Superman and Suicide Squad movies of later years, this original foray into the DC canon - with the inimitable Michael Shannon seeming an almost worthy successor to Terence Stamp's Zod and Russell Crowe turning in a performance as Jor-El that in no way steals from the iconic performance of Brando - seemed full of promise and brought back childhood memories of discovering for the first time that a man could fly.

The Blu-Ray/DVD/DigiDownload Combo was definitely the right choice, offering the best of all viewing opportunities. Substantial extra features - common for most of Snyder's earlier outings as well - round things out nicely.",1483660800,,999,5.006024096385542

5778403,5,B00D91GRA4,"As an adult who grew up watching Superman and the Justice League, I have to say that I can understand why some people have their reservations about this move. I, on the other hand, love to see Clark Kent/Superman struggle from an early age with the fact that he is an ""other."" This is SO relatable now a days when so many people feel like they don't belong or are an outcast. We see him struggle with his powers and identity and spending a lifetime looking for answers.

After his adoptive father's death (and finding out about his origin), we see him believe that the world is not ready. The movie portrays a human side to him and a ideological pathos from a young boy to eventually superhero when the planet he grew up is under eminent danger. Overall, this movie is a five star in my book. The fight scenes are believable and not too over the top. This, however, is my personal opinion. You may dissent.",1483401600,6,906,4.392857142857143

5778416,5,B00D91GRA4,"DC movies, as of late, have been getting a lot of dislike. I'm not going to say that ALL negative reviews are inaccurate or biased, but I'll say that Man of Steel deserves more credit than it was given. This movie marks the beginning of the DC Extended Universe, the DC equivalent of Marvel's cinematic universe, and in my opinion it is an excellent way to introduce the DCEU. The movie not only shows an accurate origin story for Superman, but it also emphasizes that Lois Lane is more than a catatonic and stereotype superhero love interest. This movie shows how intelligent Lois Lane actually is, while also showing that, despite being from a different planet, Superman IS in fact human at heart. It's not only a great Superman movie, but it's a great Superman movie, Clark Kent movie, AND Lois Lane movie all in one.",1482796800,,820,4.623287671232877

5778455,4,B00D91GRA4,"This is a very good movie.  As an older viewer, I have to say I prefer movies of another era.  Great acting is always great acting.  However special effects have evolved to a point where there seems to be no limit to the scenes being portrayed.  The special effects keep improving.  But ever since the movie ""Independence Day"" I feel like a lot of these War of the World's, Us versus The Alien, type movies resemble each other thematically.

There seems to be a lot of symbolism involved in this movie.  Is it just a coincidence that Clark Kent lived on the planet 33 years when this story takes place?  They said it twice that I recall.  I sort of got the feeling there was some sort of religious allegory going on.  If I am correct about that, I did not care for that.

I enjoyed watching this movie.  But I don't feel it is the greatest movie I ever saw.  Personally, I sort of prefer the more classic movie making.  Probably just a function of age.  Thank You...",1480032000,,966,4.318435754189944

Henry Cavill is superb as the title character, and his supporting cast is brilliant.

As a remake of the Superman (the 1978 version) movie this is a poor remake. I didn't care for it in that sense.

As a Superman movie on it's own.... it's okay. You get more of a back story about Krypton and all that that wasn't in the original movie BUT truth be told... I want the Superman Story....not the back story.

Nothing against Henry Cavill...he play a good Superman but hands down Christopher Reeve will always be the ultimate cast for that. Every movie will always be compared to the original and they will always fall short for me.

I enjoyed the movie for the most part....but it's not one I would ever rewatch. The story line drug at times and I just didn't like the fact the whole storyline took a new path that just seemed darker to me",1475625600,,792,4.331081081081081

5778505,5,B00D91GRA4,"As a grad in film production I so very much welcome Zack Snyders's dramatic take on the Superman mythology. I won't get into details but this film rocks. Note that I wrote ""film"" and not ""movie."" If you're looking for a movie, see Marvel. If you want a thoughtful take on the Man of Steel, check this out. Death is real, the characters feel pain, the sense of danger and peril is present, and the iconography is moving. Drama is at the center of what's now the beginning of the DC Extended Universe, and that bodes well for the creative success of their properties. I only hope that the rest of their lineup doesn't trade drama for needless humor, as some of the best sci-fi action adventure films focus on 3 dimensional characters that live in 3 dimensional worlds.",1475280000,,766,4.517985611510792
5778506,2,B00D91GRA4,"MAN OF STEEL is actually a remake of the 1978 SUPERMAN THE MOVIE
pretty terrible one if you ask me
an attempt by warners to try remake the old classic for some crap reason, probably more for the next Generation of fans i think
Warners had to name it MAN OF STEEL so it would avoid confusion with the 1978 film, that's what i think
i'm a huge fan like many fans of the original 1978 film
but when i gave this remake a go, i tried to watch the whole film i only got about half way thru it and lost interest in it
Henry cavill does play a very Good superman but Chris reeve is the ultimate best
i found out when watching it the tone, texture, plot was very different to the 1978 classic
the 1978 version is more comic book fantasy based, this so called remake is very serious in tone, texture, and in story
more like Action/thriller than a light hearted comic fantasy
there's only one superman and that's chris reeve i love chris reeves version and will continue to love it
this new remake i believe is more suited to new Generation of kids/teenagers or young Adults
but it really is matter of taste
2 stars for the film based on it's either terrible or tolerable to watch",1475280000,,1169,4.223214285714286

Since Superman is an alien & comes from another planet, of course your first reaction would be of fear. Humans don't know what he brings, even if he says peace & help everybody when needed.

Henry Cahill as Clark Kent/Superman was very good. Amy Adams as Lois Lane & Russell Crowe as Jor-El also well done. Michael Shannon as General Zod stole the show. I was surprised to see Christopher Meloni from Law & Order SVU in a supporting role.

The special effects were very well done.

5778578,4,B00D91GRA4,"This is my review from 3 years ago with a few slight edits...

Just to add in my two cents... This was the best Superman I've seen on the screen. I've watched the old black and white episodes. Stood in line as a kid when Reeves first portrayed the character.. I've seen the animated pieces old and new blah blah blah. The ""tone"" says it all. Personally I like my superhero movies to be on the serious side. I sometimes get tired with the campy comic relief when its used too much. I think it sometimes cheapens super hero movies.

People complain about the lack of humor... well it's not a m****** *****n' cheesy action comedy buddy cop flick. Its a what if this really happened and ""if I don't stop Zod we'll all be dead"" kind of flick! Some critics say that the movie isn't good for a variety of reasons.  Some people didn't like it because it wasn't full of jokes and one liners. But the bottom line is that you need to see if for yourself. I recommend it for people who want to see a movie with a solid tone. If you want to see a comedy go see This is the End.

If this is any indication of what BVS and Justice League will be like, I look forward to it!

Oh and to the critics that don't even like super hero movies... do us all a favor and stop reviewing super hero movies!

I give it 4.5 stars out of 5. I'd do a few things different but I really enjoyed it.  I think this movie could be better with time and when all of the DC movies can be binged.  I think some might have a better appreciation after seeing all of them.  I also like that it's different from a Marvel movie.  All of our super hero movies shouldn't be too similar.

You'll dig this movie if you like X-Men moives, Blade, V for Vendetta, Bourne, Watchmen, Edge of Tomorrow, Looper",1471046400,,1754,4.144542772861357

5778581,4,B00D91GRA4,"Arrived on time and in good packaging.  The movie begins like no other Superman iteration.  Does Russell Crowe add that much to this story?  In a word, YES!  An imaginative and explosive beginning just keeps going, with new and innovative plot lines that make the original (Christopher Reeve) and its two followups all rolled into one.  Is Henry Cavill ""better"" than Christopher Reeve?  That is purely subjective.  Almost two generations separate the men and their technical support (CGI), so it is a matter of personal preference.  Some of the activities are a bit hard to swallow, but if gulp a little, what's the harm?  It is, after all, a world of Super-Heroes and finally, a fantasy.  But as fantasies go, it's a REALLY good one!
Kevin Costner and Diane Lane add to any film they're in, which justifies having them cast well as Father and Mother.  Be prepared to reach for the remote when ""the shootin'  starts"", as the sound might just - figuratively - blow you away!

As far as I can tell, the answer is ""because the director is too lazy to come up with a better idea"".

5778585,4,B00D91GRA4,"I like how they worked Batman throughout the movie, well done for that. Superman.....I really don't like everything Snyder has done with his story, from MoS to now. I love the Superman story, from George Reeves to Christopher and all the comics made pre-1990's. Some of the changes made returned Superman back to the old serial with Kirk Alyn and I like it a lot. I just think some old traditions of his story should of been left untouched, like his real parents being trapped within crystals rather just his dad inside of a computer on a ship.

Lex Luthor. Yes and No!!!! There were parts when he was fantastic and other scenes where the actor didn't seem to be trying hard enough. I also think that his timeline was not snycing up with the timeline of the story. He should of been older.

Overall it is good and the best we are going to get for the next decade or so. I will still take the Christopher Reeves films and Christian Bale Batman any day.

5778643,3,B00D91GRA4,"Superman is without a doubt one of the most iconic superheroes in existence. Zack Snyder brings Superman to the screen again since his rather mixed appearance in 2006. Snyder presents Superman in a modern context and a more tragic broody figure than what we are accustomed to seeing. The last true son of Krypton (literally the first/last natural birth on the planet in decades), young Kal-El is sent to Earth before the destruction of his planet. Here he grows up and becomes more powerful thanks to Earth's yellow sun and atmosphere. Kal-El's story is slowly unveiled before Lois Lane's eyes who seeks to actually tell his story to the world. Kal-El isn't thrilled by this idea, but his hand is forced when Kryptonian criminals return and threaten the planet that he now calls home. What hurts the most about this movie is the fact that there is so much potential in that premise alone, yet Snyder doesn't deliver or at least he delivers a mixed bag at best. I am not a fan of Zack Snyder's at all. His directorial style and his quirks (endless violence that quite literally bored me in this movie, though it was beautifully done) are not very appealing to me and sometimes shaky camera movements and obnoxious zoom in shots make the movie very difficult for me to watch sometimes. Aesthetics aside, Michael Shannon as General Zod really isn't a strong suit in this movie so far as performances go. Zod is over the top and hammed up by Shannon that I can't really take him seriously sometimes, and the character in itself is an awesome figure. The characterization of Superman is way off in this movie, he does numerous things in the course of the movie that are just out of character and essentially isn't Superman at all. The movie portrays a very human Superman, that I will say, but Superman takes all of that and rechannels it for good, in this movie I don't see that. The special effects and action are very good, but I think that Snyder's style tends to drag out the action too long to the point where I was getting bored. Overall, characterization and some performances aside, the casting is very good and to me no one is seriously out of place. I love the new relationship between Lois and Clark. Henry Cavill is great as Superman, it's just the script and characterization falls flat at times, but there are moments where I catch a glimpse at the classic Superman that I am familiar with. There are a ton of cool easter eggs in the movie which is kind of fun to try to spot. But overall the movie has it's good moments but then it has it's bad moments. A rocky start but hopefully DC/WB has learned from this going forward and will try to present us with a more fulfilling version of this character in the future.",1468800000,,2725,4.551934826883911

5778657,1,B00D91GRA4,"This story is a mishmash of events that bear very little resemblance to the classic story.  The list of things that differ is too long to bear documenting.  I grew up with the comic books and George Reeve on TV in black and white - and really liked the (first) Christopher Reeve show - and I'm even a big fan of the Smallville series. This movie is not worth your time, unless you just want to see the big-name actors playing out a different storyline than the classic one, and a bunch of buildings being smashed up.  The way in which Superman defeated Zod was totally implausible, given that Zod by then seemed to have duplicated all the same powers.  It was a waste of time.  The 3D effects were not good, nor was the surround sound.  Don't buy it.",1468368000,,750,4.321428571428571

5778659,5,B00D91GRA4,We love this movie. The fact that DC will be releasing more in this cinematic universe makes it that much better. The actors in this latest reboot are well cast and the direction is spot on. It's a little bit darker than past Superman movies but in that way is more honest. It keeps to comic book story lines more than past versions. There is also a moment where Henry Cavill actually resembles Christopher Reeves as a way for the director to show respect to the original. I think this movie is well made and definitely worth trying out whether you're a comic book fan or not.,1468281600,15,576,4.392523364485982

5778712,5,B00D91GRA4,I really enjoyed this movie. Its much better that the last superman movie. Henry Cavill killed it as the man of steel. This reboot finally did Superman justice. The acting was superb and this orgin story was unique. The visuals were great and the last battle sequence with Zod blew my mind. Cant wait to see all the up coming Justice League movies.

5778742,4,B00D91GRA4,"There are a lot of reviews for this movie, but having listened to this debate for 3 years I want to put my thoughts down.  My first viewing in the theatre I came away going ""wow that was intense and a new take on Superman"".  Then I started reading the criticism and that started changing my mind about what I saw and even debated one of my friends who loved the movie about its faults. Then I watched it again and realized the reviews and myself were wrong.  This movie receives a lot hypocritical flack for no reason.  I also read a bunch of Superman comics to see where they were coming from in the criticism .  Let me say this, there is no definitive Superman only your definitive Superman. If you prefer Reeve that's fine, but there is room for multiple interpretations. People saying Snyder doesn't know the character are wrong as well. Lines and shots are taking from Birthright and John Byrnes Man of Steel. This is a very post 1987 Superman and really resembles more of the stories from the new 52 and early 2000s such as War of the Supermen, For Tomorrow, and Earth One.
This film is a roller-coaster. From the intense opening to the calmer coming of age then the 2 big battles.  Once we get the invasion from Zod the movie doesn't slow down.  On first viewing that can be alot to take, but again repeat viewings make me enjoy it more.  There are shots in this movie that are absolutely gorgeous and breathtaking.  The score compliments the movie greatly and even though there is no charging theme Zimmer's more subtle work feels right.  There is joy in the film as well, but it's not spoon fed to you. It is subtle like many of the themes in the film. Another aspect of the movie i love is a great villain who believes he is right and will not stop to achieve his goal. Snyder puts Superman in extremely difficult situations and he has to make hard choices. If any other character did what he did at the end of the film no one would blink an eye,  but because it's Superman everyone freaks out.  However, as I said this villain would not stop and there was no prison to hold him so Supes made the tough choice.  You can clearly see the pain it caused him.  If you have issues with this movie please see man of steel answers on youtube. I think as more time goes by this movie will get the respect it deserves.",1463961600,129,2319,4.313364055299539
5778743,1,B00D91GRA4,"The actor playing young Clark Kent can act. Not so our Man of Steel. He sucks. The movie descends rapidly into the same old Violence Porn, and it left me feeling awful.

Zack Snyder has become one of my favorite directors as well.

Well written/produced movie with powerful supporting actors - i.e. Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Lawrence Fishburne, Christopher Meloni, Richard Schiff & Russell Crowe.
And I LOVED Antje Traue who played Faora!  I didn't know of her work before this movie. What a sexy, kickass character, played by the beautiful German actress.

5778802,5,B00D91GRA4,"People hate on this movie for the stupidest reasons! People complain about it being too dark and stuff like that. And I'm just like STFU, its realistic! People always complain about the destruction in this movie, but somehow they don't realize that when Supermans fighting Zod, its not possible. You can't just expect there to be no destruction when Supermans fighting not 1, not 2, not 3, but an entire army of kryptonians that have all the powers that Suerman has! Some may say that Superman could've taken the fight somewhere else and fought the kryptonians in the middle of nowhere. That would be a terrible solution! Since Zod would be smart as the kryptonian general, he would have 3 kryptonians fight Superman in the middle of nowhere, while he'll send the others to destroy cities across the world. Ok, so lets say Superman beats the kryptonians that Zod put against him. Well by the time he defeats them, the kryptonians that Zod sent to destroy the cites in the world, would have already destroyed the cities while Superman was fighting the kryptonians. And for all the people that say too many people died in the movie, well what I just exlained would only cause more deaths. The point is, when Superman is fighting Zod and his entire army, its not possible for there to be no destruction, and its not possible for Superman to save everyone! And lets also note that Zods army is military trained and Superman is new at being a hero and has no training whatsoever. Superman may be powerful, but he's not a God. When he's fighting kryptonians, he can't be everywhere at once and he will not be able to save everyone. And for those who say Superman didn't save anybody, um hello? He saved Lois Lane 2 times! He saved his mom! He saved a guy in the military during the battle in Smallville! NOT TO MENTION HE SAVED THE ENTIRE EARTH! People also complain about the film not having humour (facepalm). Let me ask you 1 question. Would you be laughing if the entire earth might get destroyed? Probably not! I'm not trying to go all fanboy here, all I'm trying to say is that people have all these unrealistic expectations for superman. The movie had a great story, all the
characters were well developed, great action and a great soundtrack! Don't listen to the stupid critics and superman haters. This movie really good. If amazon would let me give it a 4.5 instead of a solid 4 or solid 5, thats what I would give it. On a scale of 1-10, this movie is a 9.

I prefer the original Superman story, on the radio he arrived on Earth fully grown, but I can enjoy the different takes Hollywood has come up with.  The movie starts with Clark Kent as a 33 year old man hiding his powers, which even he doesn't know the full extent of, and through flashbacks we see his birth and arrival in Kansas.  When General Zod arrives and starts terraforming Earth into a copy of Krypton Kent dons his cape and engages him in battle.  The military considers the guy in the blue suit to be as much of a threat as Zod so Superman gets it from both sides.

5778875,5,B00D91GRA4,"When I first watched the film, I hated it because I listen to other people that were trashing the film. I watch it again when preparing to see Batman v superman, and I was wrong with the criticism I originally had. The way superman was portrayed in this film feels real and somewhat related to us. The superman we see is real and not perfect like his comic book counterpart. He has parents that are concerned about his secret and believe he could do great things, but not yet. Jor el, his real father tells him that he needs to be the bridge of his people to the humans. He becomes the superman and is willing to lay his life in defending his home. People say he is supposed to inspire hope, but he has done it to us. I felt hope form him and that is the point of his character.

Zod was a complex villain as his goals were to save his planet and is not doing it for the sake of evil. He is not beyond brutality to get the job and is stuck in the past in believing the old ways of people should press on forward

Superman was not responsible for the destruction of the city. That was the world engine and Zod. Superman need to kill Zod because it was never about the family, rather it's the realization that he has the chance to stop Zod now, or he will kill more people.

Personal man of steel is my favorite superhero movie and it is also misunderstood.",1460332800,,1355,4.144486692015209

5778882,1,B00D91GRA4,"This is the most boring train wreck of a superhero film that you will ever see. It adds nothing new to the previous films. Instead it takes away from the origins of superman and leaves you wondering why you ever cared about this character. The direction is a mess and the events tedious, considering you've seen them happen in the 80's versions. What a disastrous disappointment.

5778885,4,B00D91GRA4,"(This came with 3 discs: 1 DVD, 1 bluray, and 1 bluray with extras plus a digital code, all in new pristine packaging with no fingerprints on any disc. The digital code sheet says it's expired but it still worked when I used it with VUDU.) I'm very easy to please when it comes to certain types of movies and will give most movies a viewing if it strikes my fancy in any way. Note that I do not regularly read comics (other than on occasion The Walking Dead) but I love watching action and super hero/comic book movies and this movie has the right amount of action for me. I also love apocalyptic/post-apocalyptic/destruction movies and this did meet that as well for me. I did not at all expect such destruction. Personally I thought that was great and awe-inspiring. The fight scenes were great as well. The movie looked and sounded great on my small 1080p HD TV with cheap Sony 5.1 surround sound. I was a-ok with the darkness and I guess grayer/muted tone of the movie that some people seemed to hate. But then the brighter, lighter types of films such as most of Marvel's movies aren't my thing. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy them too but just not nearly as much (P.S. my faves are the X-men series especially the more recent ones). My only superman knowledge comes from the original Christopher Reeve movies, some cartoons, some episodes of Smallville, and Superman Returns so I can't really judge on it by it's comic book lore or lack of it. I wasn't too sure about Henry Cavill when I first heard about him being cast as Superman but after watching this once I admit he makes a great Superman. I'm content with his rendition. Overall I was thoroughly entertained by this movie. I found nothing annoying about it. It's not academy award winning but then I don't watch films for that. Movies are my escapism from reality and this met that very well. 2 thumbs up from me. ",1459728000,,1875,4.482456140350878

5778889,2,B00D91GRA4,"I can appreciate the need to refresh Superman's brand, honestly. The character has been stuck in the '50s since, well, the '50s and the world's gone through a few cultural shifts in that time so an update is overdue. His core principles remain essential, though, and in visiting such dark territory, Zack Snyder's iteration completely whiffs on that. There's a complete lack of joy, or even optimism, in this grim, sepia-swathed world, least of all in its noble hero. Saddled with guilt by his adoptive father, who adamantly stresses (even to his dying breath) the dangers of revealing his powers to the public, Superman seems defeated even before he takes flight. His biological dad, visited briefly in holographic form, merely points him like a weapon at the bad guys and evaporates. His relationship with Lois Lane is happenstance and hollow, more rendezvous than relationship, with a lack of mystery and next-to-no emotion. It's a drain to watch, a dysfunctional mess just to think about. The film is technically impressive, though, with a strong talent for emphasizing the magnitude in both the scenery and the inevitable superhuman brawls. I enjoyed the imagination on display during its brief Kryptonian prologue, too, and would welcome a little further exploration on that front, minus the austere gravitas of its impending demise. So the effects work is top-notch, if occasionally shaded by the nagging indulgences that continue to plague CG sporgasbords. Sadly, that's one well it visits too often, and by the climactic closing battle my eyes had glossed over. Troublesome and messy, this is a grand mismatch. Superman isn't just Batman with heat vision; he's a symbol of hope, of the power of positive thought. A counterpoint to Bruce Wayne's cold, isolated self-reliance. Lacking those nuances, the character is nothing more than a hammer with a red cape. Smotheringly bleak and stressful, I feel like I suffered mild PTSD from this experience.",1459468800,,1956,5.154088050314465

There's too many flashbacks in the movie. I love Russell Crowe's version of Jor-El better than Marlon Brando's version. Ditto for General Zod, even though that guy looked more like a Romulan from Star Trek TNG than he did as Kryptonian. One thing I would like an explanation of is why, if Kryptonians could fly, they used huge eagles instead? And if they had all these outposts established long ago, why they didn't evacuate the planet earlier than the impending disaster. I'm glad that Jor-El explained what the big S signified: It's the symbol of hope for the El family. The Superman movie really didn't explain how Jor-El knew of 13 known galaxies: If he knew them, why didn't he choose one of them instead of the Milky Way galaxy and Earth?",1459296000,,888,4.55625

This MoS did not get great reviews for some reason. I liked it though. Canonically, it did not have the Son of Supes issue SR had, and gets the Krypton back stories more canonically accurate than the screen has yet seen, though this one has the other issue that the world doesn't yet know him when he introduces himself and simultaneously defends Earth from Zod issue, and the, I let my father die so I could be anonymous issue. Anyway, Cavill plays a convincing man in blue, and we are all set up for a Brainiac sequel, and if they don't use that as a sequel, well, that is why Marvel is beating your pants in the movies, DC. Word to the wise.

Highlights: aqua bus, ocular cautery, holo-dad, and Fiora.

Chromatically, nearly all the scenes have a metal color tone. Was that intentional?

5778955,5,B00D91GRA4,"This is everything that a Superman movie deserves to be. The story was amazing, great changes to a classic to ensure that the story stays current with known science. The protagonist is great which shows his struggles and accomplishments while growing up. Martha and Lara were both cast very well I think and they both portrayed their parts quite well. The change of the classic of how Jonathan dies I wasn't fond of. The cast of this movie is quite amazing. The antagonist (Zod) does a great job which shows the struggle he goes through and the fact that no matter what happens he shows what he was bread to do.

With such a great movie I wonder where they went wrong with the sequel. As always there were many changes from the classics in the  plot in the 2nd movie but I don't think that what hurt it the most. I don't think the actors are to blame because they did a great job at least not all of them. I think Lex was too crazy in this movie compared to classic Lex where he is a mastermind instead of a lunatic. Also the whole premise of why Bruce is pissed off seems unlikely. Bruce often does his research but somehow he misses what's going on here which is not like the rest of the Batman series  so this is where I think the story is hurt the most which makes the movie overall seem like its a catfight of teens upset at each other. If they let Batman be portrayed as the intelligent and cautious individual then this movie would of been more amazing.",1459123200,,1460,4.282608695652174

5778957,2,B00D91GRA4,"I think I'd like to have my $3.99 back. Snyder makes a big, loud movie that totally misses the point of everything that makes Superman a worthwhile character. I mean, yeah, the pacing isn't great, and there are plot holes that you could drive a bus through, and there is not an ounce of humor in the movie (except for the closing scene, I guess), but the real soul-killer is just the total reinvention of an iconic hero. Hancock makes a more likable protagonist than this version of Superman does. The entire story was so transparently written to set up Batman vs. Superman (which is, itself, ridiculous -- the comic story had to jump years into the future to a time when the US was essentially a fascist state in order to set up the conflict) that it just seemed silly.

For what it's worth, Cavill looks the part and doesn't do a bad job. It's the writing. And the directing. And the editing. There's a lot of stuff packed into this movie -- it handles both the origin story (and man, did the Krypton part drag along forever) and Superman's coming out by defending the planet from a Kryptonian invasion (which seemed like a near endless set of destroy-the-scenery fights). The characterization just is totally uneven throughout. Superman destroys half of his home town because someone threatens his mother?

5778980,4,B00D91GRA4,"I'm not a huge Superman fan (I've always found Batman to be a more interesting character), but this movie was well done.  First of all Lois Lane discovers Superman's identity after a few months of investigation instead of sitting next to him for years completely clueless.  She's supposed to be a world renowned investigative journalist and yet she can't figure out the guy she works with is Superman wearing glasses?  This has always been a huge issue for me so I'm glad they fixed this in the movie.  Also, I like Amy Adams.

Second of all Henry Cavill  does a good job with the character.  He plays him confidently and you really believe that he wants to help.  He also looks the part.

Third:  I liked the fact that they didn't just write him as a boy scout.  He was a little bit arrogant and a couple of times did things that weren't so perfect (what he did to the trucker's semi with the logs is really funny).

There are a few problems with the movie but honestly they are pretty small and considering the overall quality of the movie I can overlook them for the most part.  I don't even feel it's worth bringing them up because some people might not notice them anyway.

Everybody should just give this a chance.  If you haven't seen it ignore what everybody else says about it and make your own conclusions.",1458172800,2,1316,4.447698744769874

5778994,3,B00D91GRA4,"This is an odd movie.

It's definitely not good, but it's not bad, and it's not boring either. It's highly ambitious but extremely bloated and humorless.

It's like they are trying to cram (or even recycle) 50 different Superman stories into one ponderous film, while also trying to be a gritty Ridley Scott-esque sci-fi/horror film. Weird, and mostly not in a good way.

On the plus side, Henry Cavill is a very good Superman, much better than the cheap Christopher Reeve-clone Brandon Routh who preceded him. He has a warmth and decency to him (which is a nice breath of fresh air in the otherwise oppressively apocalyptic tone of the movie), and he's beautiful to look at.

I was disappointed with Michael Shannon as General Zod, especially given how much I loved Shannon in BOARDWALK EMPIRE. I admit that I'm a huge Terence Stamp-as-Zod fanboy, and it's hard to live up to that performance, but Shannon doesn't even do a serviceable job. Very wooden and dull.

On the other hand, Amy Adams and Larry Fishburne did a serviceable job as Lois and Chief Perry White.

Russell Crowe is almost always good in everything (though he's so unlikable!) and nailed it as Jor-El.

Diane Lane and Kevin Costner were WONDERFUL as Ma and Pop Kent

But General Zod's subcommander, played by the wonderful Antje Traue really stole the show with her evil-hot facial expressions and big blue eyes.",1457827200,3,1381,4.7974683544303796

This is an idealistic superhero we relate to not because of his faults, but because of his humanity, and I like that.  Kudos are in order for Cavill and Director Zach Snyder.",1457136000,3,506,4.651685393258427

5779047,4,B00D91GRA4,"I'm not as excited about superhero movies as I was ten years ago, and honestly was never a fan of Superman comics like I was Batman or Spiderman as a kid (BTW I'm 41 now).  The novelty of these movies has worn thin for me as I feel inundated with poor storylines, cheesy dialogue, lackluster villians, and crappy CG effects.  The studios are cranking out garbage at a high rate.  Micheal Keaton was a good Bruce/Bat, and I enjoyed Nicholson as the Joker, because for the time, it brought an edgier persona to the characters that the old TV series cartooned/lampooned.  There wasn't much to compare too then, but Danny Elfman and Tim Burton killed all that pretty quick.  Years later, Christian Bale (minus bat-voice) and Heath Ledger were IMO the best versions of the characters to date, and Heath will forever be the BEST villain.  These movies made the genre watchable again.  I hated the Toby Maguire Spiderman series, although he did a good nerdy Peter Parker.  The absolute worst Modern Superhero movies have been consistently the Fantastic 4 in every group of actors.  The Ironman/hulk/avengers/Thor/capt A have had some great actors and characters, but I find myself tired of watching and even keeping up with the universe as a whole.  It got monotonous.  Loki from Thor was like watching Pee-wee Herman with horns, and as great as Hugo Weaving is as an actor, the Red Skull in Captain A was just awful.  I could go on, but should focus on Superman....I wanted set the stage for my opinion.

Superman as a character, for me, has always been too much.  Too not human, too perfect, etc.  The Smallville series was watchable because he hadn't mastered his full powers. Tom Welling played a good young Clark. Lois & Clark series was awful in every regard, and Superman returns was simply a poorly scripted attempt to reintroduce the character to the big screen, (Kevin Spacy as Lex good/Brandon Routh as Superman meh).  I enjoyed George Reeves as a kid, and of course Christopher Reeves series (I should revisit those though....).

So, you get an idea of where I stand on the genre and Superman, and I have to say that I really enjoyed this movie.  I had no expectations, no I expected it to be as crappy as Superman Returns (2006), and was surprised at the all-star cast.  My biggest complaint is that the movie was too long.  The epic battle finale simply drug on wayyyyy to long.  I wasn't aware until watching there would be such A-list talent!  Diane Lane, Russel Crowe, Kevin Costner?!!  I had no idea going in.  I only knew Henry Cavill's name from random spotlight features on him during filming, and assumed he'd be just another handsome face to put in spandex for the role, but he did a really great job.  He not only had probably the best physique of any other Superman thus far, he looked the part, and played both his human and ""super alien"" roles very, very well.  I'm actually looking forward to him VS Batman now.  Micheal Shannon, who played the key villain, General Zod, was also quite good both character and acting.  All in all, great actors, great characters, and a pretty decent reboot of Superman with tons of action.",1454976000,6,3143,4.665454545454545
5779048,3,B00D91GRA4,"It's okay... interesting for what it has now set up in the DC film franchise, and an entertaining watch. Henry Cavill is a good choice, and hopefully some of the charisma that peeks through will be allowed to broaden in future movies. Amy Adams doesn't sell it as Lois, especially in the wake of far stronger tv performances by Teri Hatcher and Erica Durance. Michael Shannon is great as Zod, and in general there is a decent (if underused) supporting cast. My biggest problem is that in many ways, it tries to be The Dark Knight - understandable since that film made so much money (although that film is highly overrated in my opinion). A Superman film should not be dark or broody, it should be inspirational. Fingers crossed for the next one!",1454976000,,745,4.609022556390977

5779054,5,B00D91GRA4,"This movie was a fresh (slightly dark) take on the original Superman mythos.  They bring Krypton to life in it's final moments, and Kal-El turns out to be special even for his own race.  The action is intense, and it's just what you'd expect it to look like, given the powers involved.  I always disliked it when someone gets slammed through the air by a super-powered hit, and they slowly soar through the air.  Even the Matrix had this annoying tendency.  Well, these action sequences make more sense, albeit they are far more destructive than you're used to.  Well, get used to it.  Especially with Batman v Superman coming up.  If you haven't seen it yet, I think you're missing out.  The only thing I may have had an issue with was the love relationship that was poorly developed.

The only thing I didn't care for was how they tied Superman into the Catholic religion during the movie. I also read how the movie makers marketed this film to the higher-ups in the Catholic religion so they could gain media support and higher movie attendance with suggestive, religious writing..

(I have nothing against Catholics, or any religion, or spiritual practice. I was raised Catholic and went to Catholic school. However, I deprogrammed myself years ago from this fear-based religion, so I didn't care to see this marketing tactic used in the movie.)

5779098,5,B00D91GRA4,"This is a brilliant movie. I have always been a fan of the Christopher Reeve movies, and this movie lived up to my expectations. Yes, it is a bit darker than we've ever seen Superman before. There are more questions and struggles for Clark in this movie, which are looked at more intensely than in any of the previous movies. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are fantastic as Clark's parents, and their chemistry with Henry Cavill seems effortless. They have powerful roles in the movie, and many of my favorite scenes were ones that involved them.
Speaking of Henry Cavill, I had seen him in Count of Monte Cristo, as well as The Tudors, years ago. When I heard that he had been casted, my first thought was ""But he's British!"" I had my doubts, even though I knew that he was a good actor (not to mention easy on the eyes). Then, they released the first picture of him in the suit, and I must say, I was blown away! Throughout the entire movie, I still never got over how cool he looked. His physique, the suit, his mannerisms, not to mention the fact that he bears a striking resemblance to Reeve. He stands out, even though he is surrounded by an all-star cast. I must add, if you have not heard the story of Henry Cavill meeting Russel Crowe when he was young, search for it! I found it quite fascinating.
Anyway, I went to go see this movie at the Seattle Pacific Science Center, on their giant IMAX 3D screen (the largest in the world, I believe) and man, was it incredible! This movie was absolutely made for the big screen. It was emotional, it was funny, it was intriguing, it was nostalgic, it was hopeful, it was badass, it was everything you could want in a Superman film. By the end of the movie, a fantastic scene introduces the classic Klark Kent, working at the daily planet. Zimmer's incredible theme blasts, and I felt like I was a little girl again. The audience was cheering, clapping, ecstatic.
This movie, for some reason, gets a bad rep that it doesn't deserve. Ignore the critics, go watch this film. It's fantastic!",1453507200,,2036,4.461126005361931
5779099,5,B00D91GRA4,"For any superhero/sci-fi/action fan, this is the thing for you.  I love comics, and superheros, and action movies all the same and i definitely love it when I can have all of that in a snazzy looking case that looks great on display.  The movie itself is great and if you haven't seen it yet you need to see it! (Especially before Batman vs. Superman comes out.)  The classic story of superman with a darker twist and incredible CGI make this film extremely enjoyable to watch.  One of my favorite details in the movie is how heavy the hits sound when the battles happen, when watching is surround sound you're just blown away by the impact.  With this collector's edition you get the movie in 3D, Bluray, DVD, and Ultraviolet Digital formats, a little advertisement about additional Superman stuff that you can buy and of course the awesome metal collectors case with plastic stand.

5779107,4,B00D91GRA4,"It's difficult to fathom that it has been more than 34 years since the original Superman: The Movie.
Within the years that followed, Warner Bros. has twice attempted to reboot the franchise,
failing miserably with Superman Returns in 2006, and now with a totally reimagined take
of the story in Man of Steel.

Actually, the story here hasn't changed as much as the way it's being unveiled -- and that
can be a good thing.  Everything that is familiar about the origins of Superman is still here,
but the story tends to quickly jump ahead throughout its timeline, eventually answering
many of its questions through numerous flashbacks.  I thought this was an excellent way
to approach the story as it now seems rather fresh than rehashed.

As the film opens, Jor-El (Russel Crowe) and Lara (Ayalet Zurer) have just brought their
first son, Kal-El,  into the world through natural childbirth, which has been outlawed on their
planet of Krypton since the introduction of natural selection. With their world now crumbling,
and under attack from General Zod (Michael Shannon) and his army, Kal-El is launched into
space, bound for Earth where it is hoped he will be a saviour to its people.

The film quickly jumps ahead in the Earth timeline, first introducing us to Kal-El (Henry
Cavill) as a young, bearded, Alaskan crab fisherman.  We quickly realize that this man is
still an outsider of sorts -- never quite fitting in with human society.  He is often bullied, but
yet despite those hardships, he risks his secret identity to save the lives of others when
they are greatly threatened. This causes ""Kal"" to quickly disappear, moving from job to
job never quite realizing the reasons for his existence.  Through flashbacks, we learn
of his human parents (Kevin Kostner and Diane Lane) and how they helped the young
boy deal with his inner struggles while helping him understand his destiny.

In an attempt not to give too much more of the story away, I'll summarize by saying
that Kal eventually realizes his purpose on Earth, meets a young reporter named
Lois Lane (expertly portrayed by Amy Adams) who becomes suspicious of his super
powers, and then attempts to save mankind when General Zod breaks free from the
Phantom Zone.

Yes, it all seems so familiar -- and I have to be honest -- I did everything I could to
stay away from this film during its theatrical run.  I read the mix of positive and
negative reviews and the complaints of its somewhat burdened pace, poor casting
choices and and its failure to capture the essence of its main character.  However,
now having actually watched Man of Steel, I found have to say I thoroughly loved
this re-imagined tale for modern audiences with its underlying message of realizing
one's talents and potentials to become the best person that we can be.

As expected, Warner has given us a terrific transfer on Blu-ray.  It's not colorful
by any means as Director Zach Snyder gives preference towards a more muted
palette.  However, picture is sharp and well detailed.  Earlier I talked about the
span of 34 years since the original Superman movie.  It's mind-boggling to see
the differences in what was cutting-edge film technology then compared to what
it is now.  And, while I don't particularly care for over-the-top CGI created worlds,
I have to admit that I was rather blown away by the action sequences that took
place on Krypton and throughout the rest of the movie on Earth.  Man of Steel
was shot on 35mm film and contains 1500 visual effects shots -- many of which
that look amazingly complicated, yet perfectly executed.  This is about as cutting
edge as the technology allows today and all of it is rendered perfectly

At times I had to struggle with the necessity of 3D for Man of Steel.  Certainly,
the studio saw this as a money-making gimmick, but perhaps it would have
been pulled off better if the film had been natively filmed in the format.  Instead,
we have something that was unconverted in post production.  If you want to
know why I think this film was even considered for an upconversion, I would
probably say it was show off the abundant amount of lens flare that shows up
in just about every scene in the movie.  No kidding -- you could make a drinking
game over the amount of times a layer of flare appears -- and it becomes so
exaggerated in 3D that it just becomes plain annoying after awhile.

With varying levels of depth throughout the film, the 3D does tend to make
the landscapes look more vast.  In addition, there always seems to be something
floating within the screen, be it specs of dust in the air (seen even in the opening
logos), flame embers, snowflakes or flying debris.  Nothing ever protrudes from
the screen with the exception of one moment, towards the end of the film, where
the woman who plays Zod's second in command is lunging a knife forward.

So, as to the question of whether it's worth paying the premium to buy
Man of Steel on 3D Blu-ray?  It's difficult to say.  I suppose I found myself more
immersed in the action with the added dimensionality, but really, I don't think
this becomes a better movie because of the upconversion that was done.

The one thing about the in-home Blu-ray experience that is really worth talking
about is the film's 7.1 DTS-MA soundtrack (downconverted to 5.1 on my system).
You know, many recent Blu-ray reviews I have done tout the fact that it has one
of the best, most aggressive soundtracks to date.  Well, I am about to say the
same thing about Man of Steel, but really, this one takes the prize as being the
most immersive sonic experience to date.  Every single channel is actively at
play here, seemingly at all times, providing effect sounds (such as the whispering
voices of children to the computer commands in the Genesis chamber) that
seem to emanate from every corner of the room.  However, what really needs to
be talked about is Hans Zimmer's haunting score that just dominates this aural
experience from its loud, pounding drums, to its soft, sentimental piano chords.
There isn't a hint of John William's Superman theme to be found anywhere in
this track, but damn if the new theme doesn't manage to give one goosebumps.
LFE?  You better believe there is an incredible amount of rumbling support to
be had here.  This is simply one of the most incredible audio tracks to be heard
on any home presentation.  You can take that to the bank!

I have to go on record by saying that the original, Superman: The Movie, still
remains the best film in the series.  However, I have to give a huge amount of
kudos to director Zach Snyder for his unique retelling of this story in a manner
that seems completely fresh.  Furthermore, thanks to cutting-edge effects
technology, the action sequences provide a real punch to the senses.

I am a bit disappointed that Warner's most expensive film of the year received
the upconversion treatment rather than being natively lensed in 3D.  The
post conversion looks fine, but doesn't really offer the extra bang for the buck.
Still, Man of Steel in 3D is probably more immersive than its 2D counterpart so
if you are thinking of making the upgrade, it might be worth it.",1453075200,,7156,4.704089815557338

With hindsight you can see how the seeds were planted that led to the failure of the DC Cinematic Universe. To make the film a serious Science Fiction film is a very good idea and many of the fight scenes (especially the one in Smallville) are spectacular. But this conflicted, self absorbed and uncaring man is not Superman. Supermans greatest power is to inspire the good in other people, Grant Morrisons All Star Superman gets this, Zack Snyder doesnt. Its tragic that they put people in cahrge of these characters who have no idea why these caharcters are so great and hav endured for nearly 80 years.",1445731200,,756,4.734848484848484

5779197,5,B00D91GRA4,"I have a friend that is very knowledgeable about comic book cannon & I asked him what he thought about this ""Superman"" movie.  He told me he felt it was the best one ever made.  Superman has been around way longer than I have & I have enjoyed the many incarnations of the character offered over the years but I must agree this is the best ""Superman"" movie I have ever seen.  The Christopher Reeves Superman movies are endearing for there time but this movie ""Man of Steel"" gives you Superman's back story & brings a emotional level to Superman's character that has been lacking in the past.  Especially dealing with Superman as a child growing up with these strange unique super powers.  This version of Superman also has modern technology on its side giving a whole new scope to the cinematography & realism of the special effects which are all on a ""Super"" scope!  I would agree with my friend that this is the best ""Superman"" movie to date.  It sets the bar & I consider it the new gold standard to which any new Superman movies will be compared.  Superman is one of the oldest super heroes around & his biggest flaw is he is so close to invulnerable its hard to come up with villains worth his concern.  But he definitely has his hands full in this movie facing foes from his home planet & not even aware of his full potential yet.",1445385600,,1335,4.394308943089431

One half is moving and thought provoking, the other a testosterone fueled, building bashing demonstration of power. Both aspects necessary, but the explosions and windbag villain seem to go on for...ev...er. I came away wanting more about Clark Kent growing up. Perhaps even his making a gradual appearance before society.

I give it four stars for great actors, beautiful cinematography, part one and the very end. Cavill was perfect for the role and Kevin Costner's Johnathan Kent was very touching, Crowe believable as Jor-El and all the other actors who played to the blue screens so well. I'm not a DC Universe fan, so I don't follow the genre.  The fans views are unknown to me, and I approached this film like any other.

Everything about him felt connected to Christopher Reeves. This movie is so bad (story, direction, overdone special effects etc.) there is NO-WAY I will spend a dime to see the absurd sequel coming ""Superman vs. Batman"" with (Lol) Ben Afflack!?  Seriously?? The Producers expect US to believe that a mere human playing ""Batman"" would stand a chance against Superman??  Sorry, but in that world it would be IMPOSSIBLE.

However, I can not accept combining elements from lord of the rings into the Krypton story line. What where they thinking? This ruined the beginning and the whole Krypton story is lost.

5779309,5,B00D91GRA4,"This new Superman film is became one of my most favored films. Personally believe Zack Snyder did an outstanding job, the film gave a major impact of origin and legendary production for Superman, and the action was excellent for they had a touch of True Comic imagery on the film. Superman was normally portrayed as the savor similar to Christ, but more so the American figure, so Superman in comics always was a major character of inspiration to us Christians, not to be worshiped but inspiration to uplift men for a something greater. I believe Zack did excellent, personally I'm a fan of his work! When it first came out in theaters I was one of the first to see it, honestly, something about the trailer made me think this film was the real deal, and when it first was released on Blu-ray I brought it that same day. That tells the reviewers whom maybe reading this that I was a strong fan of this film, in fact so strong of a fan that all the Superman films back then, I don't even watch and not part of my collection. Zack Snyder's Man of Steel and the sequel to come is the best rebirth of Superman films and will continue to collect the upcoming films. Very excited about the Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice film coming out 2016, and personally believe it's going to be even better. The truth is I believe anytime Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan come together in comic films, they will be excellent, now imagine if Michael Bay tagged along the film making, imagine how even greater the films would be.
Visual Effects were amazing as well, and storyline was very good for Superman's origin, I believe it could have been a little more stronger in inspiration and wisdom to the audience.
I've come to notice that majority of the films that come from Legendary Pictures are actually more mesmerizing and capable of becoming Legendary, in this film reach that potential, a film that you can literally watch repeatedly because it's so good, WB Production choose another excellent film to be partied with.

The first half dragged a bit..... origin stories..... what can you do?

The second half was very good though, much of it a rolling fight sequence of massive destruction.

As for the fight ending. Some have (whined) that Superman would never do that. Having read the comic over the decades....
Hogwash.
His actions were completely correct (in character) and completely necessary. It was handled very well.

Trite ideological babble about ""Justice"" and ""Hope"" can have impact if backed by sufficient character development, but sadly, in this case, the only noteworthy character development happens in the first ten to fifteen minutes on the planet Krypton, where the main conflict doesn't even take place. For the rest of the movie, all of the primary characters are flat and unchanging in their desires and expressions, leading to an un-engaging and dull attempt at making something meaningful out of content that the audience has to try way too hard to connect with.

I look back at him as an old man and think what a waste of time for him.  He should be devoting the time wasted on making his fortune.  This superhero crap along with the personification of the animals has so skewered  the perspective of our own world that we wallow in this stupidity.

It is a solid story driven by characters whose deeply held--and interesting--beliefs create the central conflict of the story. Zod is portrayed brilliantly and Cavill does an enjoyable job as Superman. The supporting cast carries their weight and the action scenes are over-the-top destructive--which is what you would expect from a clash between Superman and Zod (and a few other Superman-level foes).

This film isn't likely to convert non-Superman fans, but that is more likely to be due to the basic Superman character than to any shortcomings the film has. It is kind of like sushi. I am not a fan of sushi, even when someone has me try ""amazing"" sushi. Others enjoy sushi so much they can still enjoy the low-quality versions. Superman tends to be that kind of character.

Packaging [4/5]
The packaging is a simple concept and it gets the job done. I would ore so call this a steel book limited edition than a true collector's edition, because there isn't much here to offer, but for the price I am not complaining. The inside sleeve folds out in to three folds with singular discs attached. It also includes a small stand for the case - again nothing spectacular, but given that this set includes the 3D version and still at an affordable price, this is still an amazing bargain.

Movie [4/5]
I don't want to get too in-depth with this review, because I feel ""Collector Edition"" reviews should be more about the product, not the movie. I will simply say this is finally a worthy Superman movie. There are some nuances to glance over, like some moral decisions that goes against character and his overall sloppy techniques when he was supposed to be ""holding back"" as a teenager, but this is a more realistic spin on Superman and I can respect that. I was slightly bummed that Brandon Roth wasn't given another chance with a good script backing him, but Henry Cavill was a good logical choice as a replacement.

5779378,2,B00D91GRA4,"That was one of the worst super hero flicks I've seen of late.

On the positive side, the special effects were gorgeous and the actor LOOKED like Superman. On the negative, I was so bored! An hour in, I thought it was almost done, and felt relieved, but since I paid for it already, I kept going. The actor's expression was apathetic 99% of the time, and I felt no connection to him. And since he was the one the movie primarily focused on, without taking the time to really develop anyone else or any relationships, I felt no connection to ANYONE. I think the mom was the most sympathetic character.

Furthermore, giving his father complete sentience as a hologram robbed the emotional resonance of his death. Other things were completely illogical, too. For example, Zod and his men were shot into space as punishment, but Krypton blew up a millesecond later, immediately freeing them. Superman says he's been on Earth for 33 years. That's the same amount of time they're amassing their forces. What was the freaking point? There are tax evaders who are in jail longer than Zod, Jesus. Why didn't they just keep him on Krypton and let him die with the others?

Because DRAMA, that's why. But really, it's just melodrama. I think that answers every question of ineptitude regarding this movie. I rolled my eyes at the extreme scale of destruction and some of the nonsense conflicts it drummed up for Superman, like the metallic snake thing. Sure, it LOOKED cool, but it was all show and no substance, without the proper rationale and context and emotional resonance.

And, last but not least, the sound was completely messed up for me. They were talking way too quietly most of the time, and I had to jack the tv's volume up to like 50, and then suddenly the music would blare ridiculously loud, and I'd have to put it back down to 12. There wasn't a good middle ground, between the quiet dialogue and the loud music, and that alone lowered it another (half a) star for me.

This movie just reminded me why I prefer Marvel - which isn't completely fair, because I find both Arrow and Flash entertaining, and find Agents of SHIELD, much like this movie, to be wasted potential, but that's tv. The Marvel movies were ALL entertaining to me (though to varying degrees). THEIR giant metal snake monster alien made more sense. ...But that's just being petty.

Now, I just hope Batman vs Superman isn't godawful.",1436659200,,2407,4.651764705882353

5779395,5,B00D91GRA4,"Don't listen to the hate! This is a really great superman film! Christopher Reeve will of course always be the absolute best, but Henry Cavill does an excellent job of portraying the man of steel too. Cavill is great as Clark and great as superman too, alot of the things people say about this film are lies. Superman doesn't save anybody? Superman is a murderer? Superman saves people throughout the film and never kills a single human being! Overall this film is well written, well acted, and has really great visual effects. If I had to give one complaint, is that supermans outfit is supposed to be bright red, bright blue, so why in this film does it look so dark that it almost looks black? Aside from that, like I said don't listen to the hate this is a great film and worth picking up",1436227200,,792,4.431506849315069

When first saw this movie in Theaters that was my first time going into the movies by myself to watch the movie. The fighting was very impressing and it had a lot great scenes.,1435708800,,351,4.415384615384616

It was super good, I love that it wasn't a typical ""origin story"" time waster where the first 40 mins of that movie are the superhero in high school.

I wish more time had been spent on character development and less time spent on blowing up everything... It was exhausting and almost painful to watch!  I love the actors in the film, and they did a great job with the dialogue that they had, but it wasn't nearly enough!  I would like to see a sequel, but only because I think it could be awesome if they let the actors act and not just blind us with computer generated mayhem.",1435536000,2,567,4.485436893203883

5779419,3,B00D91GRA4,"I thought it was better when I saw it in the theater. Now it seems way too contrived. It's a bug budget effects movie with simpy dialogue and predictable and unimaginative plot. This character isn't what I envision as Superman- all interior motives and bare emotion- but it's an interesting take on it, poorly executed. The 3D is uninteresting, and really doesn't add anything, except for some of the CGI shots. I'd bet the live action wasn't shot in 3D. I bought it cheap used.

I got to the last 20 min of the film, and just quit being intrigued.  So I quit watching.  I couldn't take any more extreme action without plot being moved along.  I think that's the great, and bad thing about superman.  He's inhuman, so all action sequences have to be inhumanly crazy and huge, and extra dramatic and loud in every way.  Don't get me wrong, I love heroes like Superman, but it just felt overdone.",1434844800,,525,4.285714285714286

5779448,4,B00D91GRA4,"I hesitated for a long time about seeing this movie. I mean, lets face it, how many times do you want to see the same story retold? I have to admit, this was a pleasant surprise. There is a certain amount of the storyline that must be followed, but this movie brought some fresh (and welcome) perspectives to the original tale. In this version, Clark Kent wanders around the country trying to fine himself after the death of his father. He moves from state to state, and job to job until he does something that might expose himself (like wrapping a truck around a couple telephone poles when a trucker teases him), and then he moves on. Lois Lane figures out his identity before he ever dons the cape and booties by following the news reports of strange occurrences. The storyline shows a little updating to todays world by allowing the Lois Lane character to be a real person instead of the 1940's version of a damsel in distress. All in all, this was a well made movie with a much needed update to the storyline.",1434412800,4,1014,4.456989247311828
5779449,3,B00D91GRA4,"This is merely another redo of Superman's early life on Earth.  The faithful will love it, but I found it a bit too familiar to the previous version with Christopher Reeves.  This version, with newcomer Henry Cavill, had a good cast of characters and a particularly convincing villain (General Zod).  The ""fight"" scenes between the Man of Steel and seemingly invincible villains were too repetitious for my likes, but otherwise entertaining in terms of special effects.  Worth seeing on streaming video as a rental, but not the price of admission during its theatrical release a few years ago.  Glad I waited.",1434412800,,609,4.99009900990099

Then, Superman goes ff to rebuild his mom's home for a few weeks and returns to a completely rebuilt city, with not even a single change....the streets have all been repaved, the architectural details unchanged....WAY too much a suspension of disbelief.

But:  Am I the only one who's insulted by the never-ending ""battle of the titans"" sequences throughout the rest of the pic?  I expected a plot/story-line a little more thoughtful than this.

Also, it makes any Superman/Clark Kent rescue scene (as with the oil rig in the beginning) seem meaningless, when a reasonable person can assume thousands-upon-thousands of innocent deaths in the collapse of all those high-rise buildings destroyed in the juvenile battle scenes that take up the last 2/3 of the movie.  Metropolis suffers death & destruction equal to an H-bomb.

Even the action scenes were boring to me. I don't like to be critical of other people's hard work, but this was a waste of my money. It was probably the most boring super hero film that I've watched since Hulk.",1432425600,8,480,4.228260869565218
5779511,3,B00D91GRA4,"I have always loved the character of Superman, so when I found out about Man of Steel, I began to get excited to see it.  I had hoped it would be the start of a great new movie franchise around this character.  Unfortunately, the result didn't live up to my hopes.

The movie opens on Krypton.  It is a planet doomed to die thanks to the way it has been abused by its citizens.  In the midst of this, Jor-El (Russell Crowe) sends his son to Earth.  And General Zod (Michael Shannon) tries to lead a revolt only to be sentenced to the Phantom Zone.

Fast forward 33 years, and we begin to follow Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) as he wanders from one job to another.  When he is on an army base in the frozen north, he encounters Lois Lane (Amy Adams), a reporter who is there to cover a weird something that has been found in the ice.  But as Clark begins to discover who he really is, his past from Krypton catches up to him.  What will that mean for the citizens of Earth?

I had heard before going to see the movie that the problem was the lack of character development.  Unfortunately, that critic got it right.  We never truly get to know any of these characters, something that makes it hard to care in the climatic battle.  In fact, by the time it came, I was bored and ready for the movie to be over.

Now I'm not going to fault the actors.  They all did a great job with the material they had.  In fact, I was a little worried going into the film that Amy Adams wouldn't work for me as Lois Lane, but she did great.  (Don't know why I doubted; she's a great actress.)  There wasn't a false note in the bunch.

The problem is the movie emphasizes special effects over anything and everything else.  We rush to get to any scene where the effects can be used, and then we slow down to enjoy them.  And let me tell you, the fights?  Long and repetitive.  There's enough property destruction to fill several movies, and I avoid property destruction movies.  But that's not what I was going to the film to see.  I wanted more with the characters.

And really, if I don't care for anyone in the film, the stakes can be raised to the sky, and I won't care.  Oh wait, they were.  And I didn't.

For a movie to be this focused on special effects, you'd expect them to be awesome, right?  I hate to break it to you, but there were a few times I could tell they were special effects.  Most of the time they were great, but they certainly weren't perfect.

While I am mainly ragging on the film, that's because it leaves you with the second half.  The first half, which introduces the characters and gives us Clark's origin story is actually interesting.  If they had kept that pace and developed the characters more, I would have enjoyed the entire thing.  Ironic since I something complain about how formulaic the origin story can be.

Man of Steel is another case of effects over character, and that never ends well.  Unfortunately, that happens again here.  Hopefully, they will remember to give us good characters if there is a sequel.",1432252800,,3030,4.304964539007092
5779512,5,B00D91GRA4,"This may be the most divisive film adaptation I've ever known. Lots of naysaying and nitpicking and outright vitriol about everything, from the mere fact that Zack Snyder directed it, to the sheer amount of destruction in the climactic third act, and maybe most infamously, the way that the villain was resolved. They say that everyone is entitled to their opinion, but that notion has been carried away with Man of Steel's reception.

Personally, I was on-board with the movie from the moment I heard that Henry Cavill was chosen to play Kal-El. He's a great choice. He carries the strength and dedication of Superman as well as the burden and loneliness of being the Last Son of Krypton. And though we don't get Clark Kent as much as we have in previous films, Cavill gives Kent the purposefully unassuming an humble personality that most would expect to see. Props to the casting directors for going back after Cavill for this role (he was passed over for Routh in Superman Returns).

The destruction and the massive scope of the final act was befitting a fight between super powered beings over the fate of the world. It's a standard trope, but it works because it's still effective. Nobody batted an eyelash when the Avengers destroyed New York during a massive alien invasion, so why it would be so different when seeing this film is puzzling. Perhaps it speaks to Superman's role as Earth's protector that the expectation is there for him to take the battle away from the skyscrapers. Well, firstly I want to say that a Superman movie that lets Superman really flex the full extent of his power has been asked for and begged for for such a long time, and they delivered on that here. Second, this IS an origin story: the world's first glimpse of Superman, Superman's first real battle, and also his first fight against foes of equal or greater power. The battle went about as ""perfect"" as one would expect it to go with those things considered.

As for the way the villain was resolved? That's been the part I've debated friends and strangers in the most. It's going to be debated endlessly. The review section of Amazon's instant video page is probably not the best spot for it, so I'll do a Superman and keep that away from here. I'm open to discussing it with anyone though.

What really matters is that viewers, by and large, feel as though they've seen Superman. And this film does just that. I'm excited to see what comes next, and I'm excited to see my favorite superhero on the silver screen for many years to come.",1432252800,,2530,4.640625

5779540,2,B00D91GRA4,"It's hard to really pinpoint where this movie goes wrong, mostly because there's very little that went right. I will say that it is, visually pretty beautiful. The action scenes that seem to be such a point of controversy are really pretty well directed. A lot of summer blockbusters tend to overwhelm with jumbled, confusing CGI and, even though it's used pretty heavily here, you never feel like you're losing track of what's going on. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of it's poorly executed plot. None of the characters are ever really given any clear motivations and seem to just move from situation to situation as the story sees fit, regardless of whether it makes any sense for them to be there.
  It continually attempts to explore bigger ideas like, how our race might react to the existence of a being like Superman, but this is never realized in any kind of satisfying way. If anything, it sort of contradicts itself every time a character DOES become aware of him, since that reaction pretty much boils down to them saying something about how the world is going to just FREAK, even though they all take the news just fine. Almost, passively, really.
  The villian's arc is equally convoluted and even more ridiculous, for more reasons than I can even get into. Not the least of those reasons, is that most of his plan is totally unnecessary to achieving his goal. Much of his actions seem to be purely for the purpose of making sure you just KNOW he's a bad guy.
  This movie is also overly long, due, in part to a pointlessly extended opening exposition. Again, it's all very pretty to look at, but none of it is very story essential. Most of what is relevant could have been whittled down to a much more efficient length.
  All in all, I kind of hate to bash it, because I think a Superman movie is uniquely difficult to do well, and I think this one had some good ideas. A lot more time in the editing room may have made some significant improvements. Hopefully, some lessons are learned before the sequel.",1431216000,2,2028,4.582872928176796

It kinds of grinds on to me as time moves on though.  I don't care for the gloomy camera coloring and everyone in the film feels over stressed.  Kind of feels like they all need a quick bathroom trip so they can face the day better.

The Krypton opening is over wrought and long.  Plus their technology looks lame rather than advanced and other worldly.  I can't imagine how difficult it must have been for the actors to deliver those lines somberly.

Smallville still represents the most accessible and real Superman to me.  Taking a few cues from it was smart.  Maybe they'll continue to brighten up Superman instead of making everything Batman gloomy Gus.

Plot holes, more than bearable I think even considering every movie has plot holes but this one just has, a lot.

The best way to sum this up is, it's a transformers movie with kryptonians instead of transformers. The exact same formula except there's no sexy model turned actress. Amy Adams is the female lead and she can actually act. They try to make her character strong but they failed. Not faulting Amy Adams she did the best with what they gave her it was just a poorly written movie.",1430352000,,921,4.615853658536586

However, why the movie felt the need to alter Superman's history on earth was a little disappointing.  And I might have given it 5 stars if the lighting and mood wasn't such a knock off of Batman movies.  Yes, the dark, moody lighting adds to Batman's demure.  However, I didn't feel it worked for Superman.  Search the story on the internet about the company that added more lighting and color to the movie and you will understand what I am trying to say.",1430006400,,569,4.222222222222222
5779588,4,B00D91GRA4,"This comes with 3 discs, which kind of surprised me... a DVD copy, your Blu-Ray, and then your Special Features. All of which played extremely well on my PS4. Also comes with the Ultra-Violet redeem code sheet. Recommend this if you liked Man Of Steel, I personally did, so it was a great buy to add to my movie collection.",1430006400,,323,4.4
5779589,2,B00D91GRA4,"This is specifically for the BluRay 3D version of the movie...

Mixed reviews by me....  First, the good... I liked the plot and story line.  I liked the fact that they combined the original Superman and Superman 2 into one movie.  I liked the changes to Zod's back story, even though I liked Terrence Stamp a lot in Superman 2.  I liked the character of Faora-Ul a lot too.  And, I'm a Henry Cavill fan, so it was good to see him begin his tenure as Superman with a good performance.  I also thought Kevin Costner was good, although in a muted and non-dynamic role (like everybody else unfortunately).

Now, the bad....  OMG, Zach Snyder should go back to film school and learn from people how to make a movie in 3D.  I was watching this with my teenage sons and we were about to vomit after 30 minutes.  We had to take the 3D version out and switch it to the regular BluRay.  The amount of shaky/hand held camera work was nauseating.  It was like watching the Blair Witch in 3D.  For those who actually went to the Blair Witch and had people vomiting in the theater, you know what I mean.  An example is where the army is having a discussion inside of a war room.  The General is on one side of the room and elevated.  He and his staff are talking about WTF is going on.  The camera is on him and then rotates quickly around to the other side of the room for the response.  Then spins back to him.  They do this repeatedly throughout the film.  OMG vomitville.  Also, the little film making tricks like zooming in and out of live action constantly was also irritating.  A show that did this a lot was Battlestar Galactica whenever the vipers or cylon ships were flying.  They would always start zoomed out and kind of ""searching"" for the ship and then zoom in when they found it and keep it shaky like a handycam.  Just annoying.

This film also does some things that I frankly consider amateurish.  The sound levels force you to constantly raise and lower the volume as you watch it because the dialog is frequently very low and in the very next scene there is an engine or explosion that would make your windows rattle.  There is no sweet spot where you can have the best of both worlds.  Also, while I'm all about suspension of disbelief, sometimes you have to offer a sentence or some type of explanation to tie unbelievable things together to make them plausible.  This film has too many ""why didn't they just do this"", or ""how did that person even know that person was at that location"", or ""this person is destroying everything but decides to stop and monologue so the good guys can get there just in time"" type of things....  Really annoying.  The Incredibles taught us about monologuing and Austin Powers taught us you don't need sharks with lasers, just shot the person and get it over with.

All in all, if you take Wolverine, add in a healthy dose of War of the Worlds, X-Men, Avengers, The Matrix, and then mix in some blatant Mass Effect imagery, you've got much of the Man of Steel.  Especially The Matrix.  Would be hard to rip off a film more.  Great actors were wasted.  Plot holes were huge.  The amount of devastation is really massive... very cartoonish in its ""over the top"" approach.  And you really, seriously, do not care about anybody.

In the end, it is worth seeing if only for the reason that it is a new beginning with a new Superman and there will be a new franchise around him.  Some of the special effects are quite good.  Henry Cavill was good.  BUT, do not see it in 3D.  Regular Blu-Ray is fine.",1430006400,,3533,4.385802469135802
5779590,2,B00D91GRA4,"I really wanted to like this. The trailer is far more artful than the film itself. Snyder is capable of creating some memorable images, but not of sustaining them into anything resembling a coherent narrative. I found myself groaning over and over again at the ham-handed dialogue (which often consisted of characters, much like freshman composition students, transparently summarizing the action), the wincingly bad acting (even from top notch actors; I can only assume Snyder has no feel for actors and included bad takes without realizing it); and the pointless, pointless action sequences. Superman's a tough project for adaptation in the first place; he's simply too powerful. Any straightforward fight with him turns into rock'em sock'em robots with high collateral damage. This film really cemented for me Snyder's status as a hopelessly juvenile, amateurish filmmaker. He wants very badly to have something to say (and for his audience to believe it is so), but his efforts to philosophize are so shallow as to make me feel embarrassed for him. It's a shame, because there were isolated moments of real beauty amidst all the rubble.",1429920000,,1140,5.201086956521739

5779604,4,B00D91GRA4,"First off, I'm not a Superman fan. Personally, I think he is an overrated super hero who is trash bucket of ""Have you ever heard of this as a superpower? No, but Superman has it"".

That being said, this is a fairly good movie. It back tracks through Clark's history sort of, and has some pretty exciting fight scenes If you're into super hero movies at all, you will probably like this one enough to sit through it and not question too much.

My biggest problem with this film is the end. After Zod and Superman fight and destroy a very large portion of the city, likely killing plenty of innocent people, the fall into a train station and Zod threatens to use his heat vision on 4 random people if Superman refuses to quit. It is at this point Superman decides to kill Zod...if it was that easy why didn't he just do it before? Or if the straw that broke Clark's back was he couldn't let Zod kill anyone, why didn't he move the fight, I don't know, away from people?  That's my only gripe. Otherwise it was a good movie.",1429660800,,1021,4.27979274611399

It was, however, a goldmine for those who love to watch really bad movies for the sake of making lighthearted fun of it.  We laughed our way through the fight scenes, the plot holes, the lack of variety of facial expression.  Favorites include the ever-furrowed brow of superman, and everyone running from collapsing buildings.  There was a golden moment, a beautiful thing, when a building was falling into a street and, wait for it, three characters ran perpendicular to the building and actually lived!

It just felt like it kept going and going far longer than it needed to. I guess they ran out of one liners and dialogue at the point in the screen play.

Also, I purchased this Blu Ray version without Ultraviolet Digital copy because Ultraviolet is total crap and a waste of time. I actually purchased iTunes Digital Copy for $7.99 and I bought this for $8. I would rather spend $16 dollars for Blu Ray + iTunes Digital Copy than purchase a Blu Ray + Ultraviolet Digital Download for $8.

5779710,1,B00D91GRA4,"I missed this in theaters; so, I bought it on Amazon. I liked Henry Cavill very much on ""The Tudors"" and looked forward to seeing him play Superman. He looked young and almost boyishly attractive in the beginning of the series. Unfortunately in ""Man of Steel"" he usually looked grey and haggard because most of the movie was depressingly grey and lacking color. His costume appeared to be made of woven rubber instead of vibrant cotton/nylon in bright comic-book colors. His mom said, ""Nice suit, son,"" even though the myth names her as the maker. It seems that at the point of making a choice, almost always the wrong choice was made. In fact, the movie should have begun where the special effects at the end began. Almost half the move was wasted on Zod/Krypton crap which is boring. That mythic Phantom Zone foolishness also destroyed many episodes of ""Smallville."" Except for Cavill, the casting was inept. I did not notice that the cast was replete with has-beens: Kostner, Fishburne, Meloni, and Crowe; maybe never-beens is more  propos. I learned years ago from movies like ""Midway"" and ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" that a cast of faded stars indicates a bad film. Martha Kent looked as if she were at death's door. The Kent house was dilapidated. Part of the film was made in Vancouver, where ""Smallville"" was made; why wasn't that pleasant Kent farm used? The most egregious example of bad casting was that of Lois Lane. She did not appear to be a plausible newspaper reporter and college graduate; she appeared to be of high-school age. The I-Hop and 7-Eleven product placements were cheesy touches. The DVD was in that asinine letter-box format where one gets only half a screen, but pays for a full one. The ultimate absurdity was the unnecessary second disc, which attempted to justify the incompetence of the writer, producer, et al. I have never seen such a ""Special Edition"" performance before. At least the makers realized that they needed to give excuses, if not reasons, for such a bad movie. I truly feel sorry for Cavill, who worked so hard to get his body in such fine fettle, even though it was never properly displayed, although I have never seen a hirsute Superman before. This movie probably ruined his career through no fault of his. Obviously, he was locked into this fiasco before he
realized what a disaster it would become. The confusing inserts of Clark as boy were another dumb idea.",1426464000,2,2406,4.76978417266187

5779734,5,B00D91GRA4,"This is the type of movie that just gets better with repeated viewings. I think coming out so close to Avengers hurt it cuz most people just think ""superhero movie"" and probably went into this movie thinking that it was going to be something similar to Avengers' silly & fun action but in reality the DC and Marvel movie universes are completely different with DC being darker and having more of a mature feel to them. I prefer this kind of tone and to me the Batman Christopher Nolan's Batman movies and Man of Steel have overall more artistic depth than all the Marvel movies. If you are coming from watching Marvel's stuff to this I think you will be disappointed because your perception of a superhero movie is something lighter and easier to digest than this but if you watch it more than once I think you can adjust to the tone of the movie much better and get what the director/writers where going for.",1425340800,,909,4.481927710843373

In this movie, Cavill's character embodies the phrase:  ""with great power comes great responsibility"".

There have been very few movies I can say are 'favorites' to me, but this is most definitely one of them.  If I'm feeling down, I see THIS movie.  Superman does indeed embody 'hope'.

Don't listen to those complaining about much destruction of cities they see.. they seem to forget that Zod is evil, and couldn't care less how many humans die, and he plays a part in where the fighting happens.

I do indeed have a love for the older Super movies.. but they are a tad too campy for me to really believe.  This is much closer to 'real' with the 'what if'.  And it is very easy to suspend disbelief.  I was amazed.",1425168000,,893,4.404907975460123

5779760,4,B00D91GRA4,"I was a big fan of Superman when I was a kid, so I suppose I chose to buy this DVD/Blu Ray as a means to get the nostalgic feelings back. But I'm no longer a kid anymore so I'll just have to judge on the basis as an adult. Note: There will be spoilers in my review.

PROS- Lots of action scenes. Comic book movies fill a niche in the industry and MoS doesn't disappoint in this area.
-Superman when he's flying, actually looks pretty cool. Sometimes doing something different actually works. On that topic, several of Superman's powers look great in this movie. If you want to see Superman powers updated from the old Superman movies, look no further,
-Lois Lane doesn't need to be constantly rescued in the movie. Yes sure, Lois does need rescuing, but not constantly. Lois is the definition of a plot device in the Superman universe, it's good to have something more then a one dimensional character this time around.
-Music: The music for the movie is pretty good.
CONS- Before I mention these, I would like to say that in my honest opinion the PROs outweigh the CONs, but I mean to each their own. And there are massive spoilers below because they have to do with the actual plot and characters of the movie.
-Villains are not very bright. Zod and his wife come to Earth, and become essentially gods among humans. Instead of living as gods, they want to terraform the Earth so that they can become mortal again. Makes sense right?
-The villains have the ability to terraform planets. They can even enlarge the planets. The villains choose the Earth and not any of the countless other worlds orbiting the Sun.
-All the debris in space just happens to fall right into Metropolis. That was crazy.

There are other cons probably but because I don't remember them, they're kind of similar to the ones I mentioned. I'm not overly fed up about these particular ones either, but suffice to say its just nitpicking the movie and overall I don't feel that it detracts majorly from the movie.",1424736000,,1985,4.5418994413407825

The special affects are superb !!
It is almost as if it has taken over 60 years to get to the point
of developing Superman's actual powers which exceed the Human
imagination.
I can't wait to see the next Superman film and hope that the producer/director
will more fully develop Superman's full potential or at least see part of what He is really capable
of. If you saw the Superman(George Reeves) television series as a kid like I did in the late 50's, you can appreciate the
special affects much more as it ""partially"" explains what ""Faster than a speeding bullet"" really means.

But I do think the script writers/directors re-imagining of the traditional Superman story and above all the over-reliance on CGI special effects made for a weaker plotline and a sometimes silly movie.  I am a fan, growing up with Superman comics, through the Chris Reeves movies, and I even own the 50s TV series DVDs. I also realize that todays audience expects special effects out the wazoo. I just think this movie went overboard in that aspect at the expense of good old-fashioned storytelling. But, as I said, I did find it entertaining and I intend to add this DVD to my collection.

5779818,3,B00D91GRA4,"This some what expanded retelling of the Superman saga is by far the best one yet. The last one fell far short of just being okay.

There was more thought put into this film as compared to the last one or any of the Christopher Reeves versions from the 80's. Guess what I mean is that the script writers were able to layout a more thorough backdrop to his origin and why his home world was destroyed. They also did a decent job to giving General Zod a more in depth role in the beginning which laid the groundwork for everything else that happens.

This is a grand film with a much bigger budget and better special effects than its predecessors. With that said it still didn't meet MY expectations after the credits started rolling. First thing is with all the action and violence that ensued in this movie we the audience don't get to see the hundreds if not thousands of casualties from the collateral damage caused by the epic fights between Superman and the exiled Kryptonians. No one was held accountable. No mention of how many people were affected by the mega battles. Second, why didn't Superman use his heat vision to destroy that tentacle from that gravity weapon in the film. His heat vision can be pretty darn destructive when applied right. And then there is his relationship with Lois which was unbelievable and a distraction to me. Lastly, we don't get to see the regular common folks weighing in on the whole Superman thing after the he and the Kryptonians leveled half of Metropolis. The overall story felt rushed as if the studio execs thought audiences would fall asleep if it went past 2 1/2 hours. Maybe they might have.

Now we all are waiting on Batman vs Superman. Hopefully that one won't be so epic in its scope that it loses certain key details like this one did.",1422662400,,1790,4.535603715170279

5779821,5,B00D91GRA4,Henry Cavill is a talented young man. I do hope he continues to play this character.,1422576000,,84,4.3125
5779822,4,B00D91GRA4,"The film begins on Krypton and introduces Jor-El played by Russell Crowe (Gladiator). Supermans biological father attempts to save his species by delivering the codex of his race off planet.  He wants to do this because he knows its going to explode and he sees that as the best option for Kryptonian survival.
General Zod, played by Michael Shannon (Boardwalk Empire), upsets these plans and tries to take over the government in a separate yet violent attempt to save his people. Zods coupe fails, Jor-El dies in the process, and Krypton explodes all within the first ten to twenty minutes of the film. Then we enter Clarks story.
Scott Snyder directed Man of Steel. He is renowned in a good and bad light for two films: 300 and Sucker Punch. David S. Goyer wrote the screenplay and story for Man of Steel. Goyer garnered experience writing Batman Begins and The Dark Knight Rises. Christopher Nolan produced Man of Steel and helped write the story. He is known for writing and directing The Dark Knight, Inception, and Interstellar. Henry Cavill stars as the thirty three year old Clark Kent/ Kal-El. He starred as Theseus in the 2011 film Immortals. Amy Adams played Lois Lane and she is known for the 2014 film Big Eyes, the 2013 film American Hustle, and the 2009 film Julie and Julia. The film also includes Diane Lane as Martha Kent and Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent.
There are a few things I truly appreciated in this film. They get Superman right. Now that is a controversial statement in the comic book world because of his fight with General Zod in the end, but its more complicated than the black and white view people like to see it as.
During the first half of the film it goes back and forth between Clarks childhood and his adulthood. What I absolutely love is when Clark struggles with his powers as a child. You see Jonathans influence when Clark is on the road trying to figure out what type of man he is and wants to be.
At one point Clark works at a bar and a truck driver gets disrespectful with a waitress. Clark steps in and restrains himself from crushing the truck driver, then walks out. The next scene shows the truck drivers semi-truck mangled with a telephone pole.
The scenes of Clarks childhood pay homage to Smallville the television show because Dylan Sprayberry, who plays the thirteen year old Clark, looks like a thirteen year old Tom Welling who played Clark in the television series. The film also shows Clark as a child struggling with his powers in school.
Man of Steel finishes this back and forth time with Clark returning home to his parents house in Smallville. Diane Lane to me is a bit of show-stealer as Martha Kent. Her acting is strong yet so subtle when Clark tells her he found his parents. You see her just ever so subtly wince and that little bit communicates her side of the story. That one moment shows her love for her son.
Henry Cavill embodies Clark and Superman in this film, but in that scene Diane Lanes experience shows. He is a young, inexperienced man taking on a military general. Clark may have experience on Earth over Zod and greater control of his powers, but he just started flying an hour earlier in the film, which was less than a week story time. Seeing him learn how to fly gives me goose bumps every time.
The controversy of the Superman and Zods final confrontation comes at the end of the film when Clark tries to defend Metropolis. Superman and Zods final fight destroys much of Metropolis.  I think that was Zods intent, to make Metropolis a pile of rubble. And in story it makes sense because Superman can be blamed later in Batman v. Superman. Superman cannot completely stop Zod from leveling Metropolis, but he can stop Zod.
It confuses me that people expected little destruction, like in the when they clearly show that Zod wants to destroy Earth halfway through the film. Superman is Superman, but the story shows he has very little experience as Superman.
The most controversial scene in Man of Steel is the final fight of Superman and Zod. Superman is forced to make a choice: Earth and humanity, or New Krypton and Kryptonians. He chooses those he grew up with instead of the people trying to destroy his home. Fans of Superman were flustered by how Clark makes his choice. I never heard those people ask why he chooses as he does but it explains to me why he doesnt kill.
Scott Snyder gets the displacement Clark struggles with. He understands Clarks struggles with being an orphan. Snyder also visualizes Clarks journey not only into manhood, but becoming that ideal that Jor-El speaks of in the beginning of Man of Steel.
For all the things I liked there are still things that bug me. One thing is the rushed relationship of Lois and Clark. Now, everyone knows they end up together, but the clich kiss is not needed. Just because they end up together doesnt mean they have to kiss in this film.
Another thing that I thought could have been done better is Pa Kents final scene, (it foreshadows Supermans respect for authority). Jonathan tells everyone to go get under the overpass. Anyone there would have questioned that judgment call. Hes from Kansas and he should know what happens to things under an overpass when a tornado comes by. Why that couldn't be a little more realistic, like say, he tells them to get as far away as possible? Hollywood I guess.
The next live action DC film releases next year, so, I recommend it for next year. In the mean time I recommend their animated feature lengths films Justice League: The Throne of Atlantis, Batman: The Dark Knight Returns Part 1 & 2, and Batman: Year One. I recommend these because DCs animated films and even television series, (like Young Justice) have incredible depth and are worth your time. I also recommend their television series Arrow, The Flash, and Gotham. The quality of these shows rival films and are all extremely entertaining but also intriguing.",1422489600,,5912,4.651051625239006

Man of steel is different. Although I did not start with high hopes, and the beginning of the movie makes it feel like we are in for another missed opportunity, it actually picks up and once you get into the pace of the movie, it really gets very good. Do not expect any emotional connection with any of the characters, it is also not what they intend to do with this movie. It is a dark story of Clark Kent, and told in an impersonal way so that the situations and that really shines.

5779875,3,B00D91GRA4,"In celebrating Superman's 75th anniversary, the 2013 mega-budget action epic ""Man of Steel"" somewhat succeeds as a dark, revisionist epic take rebooting the once-proud Superman movie franchise.  Instead of your traditional Clark Kent/Superman as an assimilated alien otherwise living an ""ordinary"" Metropolis life, he has been re-imagined here as an alien outcast struggling to determine when/or if ever to reveal his existence on Earth.  The arrival of dark forces from the long-dead planet Krypton soon force him to make that ultimate choice.  It is a great premise (in theory), but the film suffers some major storytelling flaws.

Other reviewers have already addressed well this movie's most derided creative decisions (i.e. murdering Zod to prevent further mass destruction; Jonathan Kent's revised, Uncle Ben-like demise; far too much emphasis on CGI mayhem, etc.).  And their assessment is very much accurate.  In my mind, this Superman's conscience (or remorse) is rarely made evident by the filmmakers.  In other words, there was once Christopher Reeve's humbly compassionate, old-fashioned Superman ... and now there is Henry Cavill's morally conflicted Superman.  But there is something more that is vitally missing from this new Man of Steel than a poignant sense of heroism.

I was among those who noticed that this movie deliberately omits the timelessly charming ""Superman"" march by composer John Williams.  It is a certainty that the film wished to avoid (unfavorable) comparisons to Reeve's best Superman films or even to 2006's ""Superman Returns.""  Despite all of that 2006 film's mistakes, at least it understood the importance of one key element: the inspiring sense of heroism linked to John Williams' classic theme song.  THAT music epitomizes Superman!  In ""Man of Steel,"" as Henry Cavill's Superman races off to save Metropolis, I kept waiting for a familiar music cue that disappointingly never comes.  Even a mere echo of Williams' heroic anthem in the movie's battle-packed finale would have made a huge difference!  It would subtly imply that Superman's legendary movie franchise hasn't been completely erased in favor of an ultra-violent, video game-styled reboot.

More importantly, Williams' instantly recognizable march would have also enhanced Henry Cavill's credibility as the new Man of Steel ... much like how the signature James Bond tune links the six actors who have played the part as still being the same character.  Or how the musical scores from the two ""Star Trek"" reboot movies incorporate Alexander Courage's original TV theme helping audiences to embrace Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto as the new Kirk & Spock.  Simply put, in this instance, some nostalgic musical continuity could have really been a crowd-pleasing highlight.  That kind of applause is priceless, as it can also help viewers forgive the filmmakers' various mistakes. In fairness, composer Hans Zimmer's poignant score does its job for ""Man of Steel"", but it is hardly distinctive from his many other works.  His musical score's neutrality doesn't signify Superman movie magic like Williams' theme still admirably does.

Hence, the absence of Superman's signature theme is really a disappointment.  Despite my unhappiness, I thought ""Man of Steel"" was at best a watchable action epic with mostly stellar special effects.  It's just too bad that the movie emphasized CGI spectacle over graciously appreciating the reliable Superman that we already know.

Maybe I am just an old fashion Superman type of guy, but I really didn't like the way the story line flowed in this movie. Nor did I care for the pretty boy playing the role. Although it had lots of action, I got really bored watching the fighting. Superman hits bad guy so hard, he wrecks half of the city. Then bad guy hits Superman so hard, more damage is done to the city. People scream and run crazy like, dashing falling buildings. Back and forth, back and forth. It felt like it would never end. Then the quirky one liner about Superman being ""hot"" was the icing on a bad movie.

5779950,4,B00D91GRA4,"A new Superman for a new century.  This is an excellent re-imagining of the iconic superhero with a very conceptually strong retelling of his origin with an effective emphasis on a SF-nal approach and less tongue-in-cheek characterizations than the older versions.  It manages to integrate the iconic story of the ultimate immigrant into a tense action thriller that incorporates elements from the various eras of the comics and nods to the more recent Smallville incarnation, shifting the focus to intense action set pieces and moody character flashbacks with great visual imagery.  This may render the result less charming and optimistic than what old fans were used to associate with Superman, but a character so powerful and lasting is open to more than one interpretation.  While several plot elements and choices could have been better handled and prove less divisive for the audience without diminishing the narrative at all, that did not stop me from enjoying the film.  It is easy to be editors in hindsight.

Henry Cavill makes a fantastic Superman, earnest, kind and physically impressive, showing well the tentativeness of a man finding his place in the world when no previous standards could prepare him.  The script needed him to appear emotionally guarded and reactive,  slowly making him grow into the persona that Reeves could depict in full early in his first movie, but Cavill's strong charisma kept his Kal-El engaging, and while it may seem anathema, I think he may be an even better depiction of my idea of Superman than Reeves was.

Amy Adams certainly was the best depiction of Lois Lane ever, and the changes to the standard formulas in the Lois-Superman relationship are positive to me.

Some friends refused to see it at the theaters because they were convinced that Superman was boring.  I lent them my copy and they were quickly proved wrong.",1418947200,2,1871,5.022653721682848

5779974,2,B00D91GRA4,"Let me say up front that I've never seen the original movies or cartoons, have never read the comics, and pretty much all I know about Superman comes from Sheldon (& Leonard, Howard, & Raj). So I really did go into this with a fresh perspective.

I don't know what it is with movies lately, but so many of them suffer from CGI overload. Whether it's Legolas bouncing off people's heads, Kaiju destroying coastal cities, or Superman bouncing across the pavement - it's all a little too ridiculous for my taste. I appreciate cool special effects, but only when they ADD to the movie, not when they ARE the movie. It really seems like Hollywood directors have forgotten how to just tell a great story.

The other major problem I had with this movie was the ENDLESS destruction. Again, what happened to just telling a story? We're not all mindless sheep that need to have things blowing up constantly to keep our attention. This movie just seemed like one battle scene after another, most of which were completely ridiculous. It was cool to see Superman fly. It was tedious to spend two hours watching him repeatedly smash his way through buildings.

It's sad, but action movies seem to have lost their stories and become nothing more than mindless destruction. No heart, no story, no emotion. Glad I get these things free from the library so I know not to waste my money on them.

**UPDATE - I was curious to see how Man of Steel compared to the original, so I went back to the library for the 1978 version. And WOW - what a difference! Now THAT'S how to tell a story! Sure, it was dated and pretty cheesy, but it was still fun to watch.

I have no idea what the mythology of Superman is *supposed* to be. I'm not comparing the two for anything other than entertainment value (for an average person who knows almost nothing about comic book heroes). That said, Man of Steel was a dark, depressing, computer-generated mess. I wish they had spent more time developing the characters & story, and less time on throwing people & cars through buildings. The Man of Steel version of Superman just wasn't heroic - he was attacked by the General and so fought back - thus saving the military who happened to get in the way. But he lacks the heart of the original Superman - a guy who saved people simply because he loved humanity. A guy who rescued cats from trees, for crying out loud.

The original movie may have dated special effects by today's standards, but overall it was a much better movie. Man of Steel made my head hurt and left me feeling bored & angry. The original Superman was silly, but it made me smile and feel good. Not hard to figure out which version I'm going to buy!",1418515200,11,2678,4.48870636550308

5780040,1,B00D91GRA4,"Colorless. Joyless. Soulless. I was truly hoping we'd finally get a fantastic Superman movie. Instead we got a Superman who's motivations are unclear. Originally, Superman's father died in such a way that Superman couldn't possibly save him. This was a major driving factor in why Superman saves everyone else; because he couldn't save his father. (Spoiler Alert) - Here, Jonathan Kent dies because he arrogantly refuses help. He puts himself into a ridiculous position that he could have survived; he basically just chose not to survive. This lessens the impact of Jonathan's death, as well as the drive for Superman to be a hero.

And then, the movie was filled with an incredible amount of shaky camerawork. I understand that in action movies, you want to convey action. But if the way you convey action is just by shaking the camera, it gives the impression that the action on the screen is not worth looking at. The best action sequences are the ones we can see, the ones we can follow. If the fights had been choreographed better, perhaps they wouldn't have felt the need to shake the camera so much. The worst part is when they use the shaky-cam for quiet moments between characters where there should be no shaking. It's all very poorly done. If this movie had been from Lois Lane's perspective and she was telling the story of Superman, I would have been able to tolerate the shaky-cam. But it's not. This just reeks of lazy directing.

And this is what sets the tone for the future of DC movies. They're all going to be colorless, joyless, soulless versions of the comics. Ah well...",1416960000,11,1593,4.726618705035971
5780041,2,B00D91GRA4,"I REALLY wanted to like this movie. The trailers made it look interesting and I was especially looking for the ""magical"" elements that make Superman well, super. I was looking for some wonderful flying scenes, some special saving people in trouble stunts and a certain charm that Superman in the comics and under both George and Christopher Reeves had. I thought sure Henry Cavill would be able to pull it off. But, it didn't happen. Instead, I saw an action flick that had the destructive elements of Independence Day, Cloverfield, Transformers and every other disaster flick, without a believable or likeable hero - Superman himself.

Once again we see Krypton, more fantastic than ever before, an alien world but one that is remarkably human because - they're at war with each other over something or other, with General Zod being the intense bad guy. They aren't the gentle enlightened people of the futuristic society that was in the comics, they're just like us, with weird technology that makes a good platform for confusing  CGI effects.

Once again we see a young Clark Kent struggling to come to terms with his difference. Only now, instead of discovering his power, he is struggling to accept it and getting beat up by the other kids in a prophecy of what General Zod is going to do to him in about an hour, for just being him. We don't see a wise Ma and Pa Kent guiding him in the ""truth, justice and American way"" of the comics, instead, Pa isn't sure if Clark should save people and risk exposing himself as different. Huh?

Once again we see Lois Lane, only this time she's a rogue reporter who releases stuff to Internet trolls when her paper refuses to publish her story about the discovery of an alien at the North Pole (or wherever the ice and snow were). She has none of the integrity of the comic character, nor the charm of earlier movies.

Once again we see Superman in a really nice looking costume but it is WAY darker than the comic or anything that came before and looks like it is made out of rubber or some uncomfortable fibreglass composite. In the comic, his costume was made out of his soft but super strong baby blankets. Apparently this new suit is a suit of some kind of Kryptonian armour.

We see Superman fly, only now he takes off like a speeding bullet (I think they took the ""faster than a speeding bullet"" metaphor a bit too seriously) with a bang and is gone in a flash. It's just not elegant as it was in the other films, and it is about as exciting as a speeding bullet too. Half the fun of Superman is that he is a MAN who can fly - not a man who is a rocket. Reeves made him an elegant aeronaut, this move makes him a projectile.

And then there are the fights - lot's of them. If humans aren't picking on Superman, then Zod and his cronies are. Can't the guy get ANY peace? And the super fights - seen lots of these in EVERY other action flick for the past 10 years. Easy formula - destroy everything. And don't forget, make it REAL apparent that humans are completely brainless, duplicitous and helpless. Oh, and they're really stupid because they will still spend men, machines, bullets and lives trying to beat the impossible-to-beat enemy. If it's obvious that you can't beat someone with strength, then you have to try something else. The humans in this flick don't figure that out.

And this new Superman, well, he's not very likeable. He's confused, more than anything else and just doesn't have any charm. I can't imagine him saving a kitten from being up a tree, or saving Lois from falling off a building. He doesn't like humanity (who can blame him in this flick?) and the feeling is mutual. Way to truly kill a super hero and destroy a cultural icon.

Newer isn't necessarily better. The earlier Superman films had much better class, charm, story lines and action. I had hoped, with the cast here, that this movie would have followed that tradition and been something really stellar,

Instead, it stumbled over itself. Which is too bad, I really wanted to like the movie. Instead, I fast forwarded my way through it (DVD has its values!)

Oh, maybe THAT's why Superman was flying so fast? Hmmm.

I'm just going to ask simple questions...  why does superman wear body armour ?  Why is the look of the costume different ?  Why couldn't they hire an american actor to play him ?  Why did jonathan kent die in such a violent fashion?  Why did britsh superman break the hero code and murder zod ?,1415145600,,460,4.241379310344827
5780093,5,B00D91GRA4,Best Superman ever. I like the serious side and what seems to me to be more practical than the previous superman films. This one gives a more believable (if that's possible) history and puts us right in the middle of the suspenseful tale.,1414972800,,238,4.558139534883721

5780103,1,B00D91GRA4,"VOMIT! Yes, the cast STINKS! There's no Lois Lane, just some air-headed priss vacantly ""reading"" lines with the name Lois Lane. (picture watching Seinfeld with Elaine suddenly being played by Lana Del Rey or Jessca Alba.) There's gotta be 10 women in every town ON EARTH more suitable to portray Lois Lane. Crowe seemed even more bored reading his lines than Brando(!)
Pa Kent, who's good-natured altruism is more essential than flight and heat vision to Superman, is also ABSENT; Clark is instead raised by a gritty handwringer who thinks busloads of dead kids beats a world trying to dig a terrific superhero. But really i pity them: with dialog like,""LET's GET ONE THING STRAIGHT..""Look out behind you!"", & pleny of ""NOOOOOOO!!!""'s, the creators let everyone know they don't care to make anything imaginative, just take the paycheck thank you.
Michael Shannon is riveting, as always, Ma Kent is good, Perry White has an earring, Superman has no spitcurl, no chin... Ok, whatevs. But Snyder directs our graceful hero to grunt and growl like he's pumiping iron at boot camp. He dodges a gas truck which explodes in large office building (in a city of gawking rubberneckers with ZERO evacuation skills,) PLUS the objecive is KILL EVERY KRYPTONIAN: does this sound like Superman to you?",1414627200,3,1285,4.981395348837209

I also very much liked a Clark Kent with anger management issues.

Martha Kent (BTW, Jessica Lang is still a good looking woman) was very well done.

Jonathan's Kent's ""decision"" was very well done.  I really liked that bit.

In the previews where Lois is questioning ""the alien"" it came across as totally wrong.  But that scene is later in the movie after she, especially, and the rest of world have had a bit of time to come to grips with, as Jon Kent put it... ""Are we alone in the universe?""",1413417600,,677,4.5

The movie is very well cast and all of the parts were nicely carried out with absolutely no complaints. One thing was missing, however, and that was John Williams' Superman theme. In my mind that music is always associated with Superman and it's absence left a big hole in the story. I know that's silly but we're talking emotions here, not logic.

5780224,3,B00D91GRA4,"Man of Steel
 Man of Steel will be an enormous box office success.  It has already made history as the best June opening weekend in movie history.  The $225 budgeted PG-13 blockbuster has brought in a staggering $197 worldwide in the Thursday through Sunday opening.  With the innovative director Zack Snyder running things, the man who gave us the interesting, entertaining and unusual Watchman and 300 we have a director that can be counted on to give us something special.  In Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer, the men who also co-wrote all three of the outstanding Dark Knight films, we also have a writing team that is capable of working at the highest possible level.  Nolan also produced Man of Steel.
 The acting from a team of very well practiced, popular and impressive actors includes Russell Crow as Supermans biological father and Kevin Costner and Diane Lane as the Kents, his Earth parents.  All three turn in touching performances, particularly Costner as the protective father.  Laurence Fishburne appears as the hard boiled newspaper editor Perry White.  And Amy Adams, just off her great and complicated role in Trouble with the Curve is the best Lois Lane ever.  Only Superman himself, Henry Cavill, showed little acting ability.  To be fair, his has the look and especially the physique of a Superman but he was mostly asked by his director to look good and frown.  He had no problem with either chore, but it isn't acting.
 So what happened?  This movie will be seen by millions across the globe.  The cast and talent behind scenes are the very best around.  Why did this prodigious effort produce only a mediocre three saw blade film?  Working against their history, I think the genius behind the film simply sold out.  They knew that they had a chance to make a billion dollar film and they took it.  And they will no doubt be vindicated on that basis.  But what a shame.  They could have just as easily have made something like the three Dark Knight films, films that will be seen and studied for generations.  Man of Steel will be studied only by accountants.
 I won't do a spoiler but let us say that the brilliant writing team let in a huge clunker that was so obvious and so important as to be laughable when it popped up.  And the ultimate battle between Superman and his Krypton born super opponent went on and on and on and on you get the idea.  The film was two hours and 23 minutes long.  There was plenty of room to snip out a few minutes of repetitious slugging between two super heroes who cannot be harmed.

5780280,5,B00D91GRA4,"Henry Cavill really did his thing.  I am always skeptical of any new/updated superhero movie, and with Superman being my all-time favorite, it was my duty to hate this movie before even seeing it....but then I saw it.  I'd never heard of Henry Cavill, I didn't watch the previews, and the only reason we bought this movie was because my wife wanted to see it. (again, I'm the skeptic).  The background story was very interesting; I loved how Krypton was portrayed and how their technology was super advanced yet organic.  General Zod makes his appearance, and he along with his henchmen are always the perfect bad guys.  Just as in the original, his female lieutenant was my favorite, and she showcases amazing physical abilities, easily surpassing what was seen of her in the original Superman II movie.  The movie gives you a bit more perspective on the struggles he had growing up amongst mere mortals, and I appreciate how one of the characters from his childhood is carried over to later scenes in the movie, which made sense since he grew up in a very small town.  Lois Lane was really nothing special to be honest; Margot Kidder was much more memorable and interesting in my opinion, but the new girl does just fine.  The visuals in this movie are outstanding, and the juxtaposition of Krypton's and the General's dark, muted color palette of a dying world and doomed soldier against the bright, vibrant scenes on Earth (superman included) make for an interesting visual contrast that's sure to please anyone who can appreciate quality visuals on a nice HD TV.  The sound is equally impressive, and this movie spares no expense in subjecting your ears to a very wide dynamic range auditory bliss, whether it be moments of comfort between the young Cal-El and his Earthly parents, or the ear-splitting sound of machine guns, burning and twisted metal, and superbeings smashing each other through countless buildings and other concrete structures.  The sights and sounds are so much, that you might almost forget about the plot as you sit back and let the audio/visual goodness wash over your undeserving carcass.  If you like Superman, or action movies in general, and especially if you have a nice TV and surround sound, don't hesitate.  It's that good.  Buy it.",1410220800,,2269,4.847150259067358

5780299,4,B00D91GRA4,"This is a  action packed flick with convincingly beautiful landscapes and fight sequences. Colors, pacing and effects exquisite- lots of fun, a modern hollywood adrenaline tour de force, Yet, it represents a complete failure of the cultural values that captured our imaginations and made the story meaningful to us young humans so long ago.  But I'm sure it makes a great video game.
  Honestly , after a long lifetime of superhero models I've  had it with this super hero thing. Their suffering and accomplishments have become increasingly nonhuman. Superman might as well be a giant lobster as a handsome looking ""human""  that he is so clearly not.  Perhaps if he looked like a blue lobster sent from Krypton that dusted humanity to save his ""fellow"" red lobsters we would understand just how painfully irrelevant the main storyline has become. It's just a propaganda line now.  Anything earthly, never mind human, has all but disappeared.
  Poor Lois, good luck softening and loving this hardshell tin man. The romantic thread feel like a sticky note stuck onto the story. Poor men, there is no real reason left for him to defend and fight for us . His moral righteousness no longer justifies the colateral  damage. The classic point of him protecting bystanders is stretched to an completely unbelievable point, as with several other classic rules of the superman motif.
 The movie left me yearning for examples of realistic human bodies, minds, and spirits coping with unexpected but possible situations. Our real possibilities and limitations are amazing and difficult, great material to allow the script writers a broad stage.

It seems like most of the other movies that portray superman were a  bit  weak in the nodes, if you catch my meaning. When you have the ultimate powers, how do you deal with jerks you could crush with a finger? This movie is different. It really cuts down to how a man becomes more than a man.

5780318,3,B00D91GRA4,"Growing up the heroes of DC comics were always held up on a pedestal.  Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, the Justice League- those were the superheroes of my childhood.  Marvel wasn't even a blip on my radar!  That is why I'm sad to say Man of Steel, the starting point for DC Comics Cinematic Universe left me feeling cold.

Now, there are many people who have already discussed the merits and issues with this film ad nauseum, so I'll try to keep my opinions brief and to the point as to why I didn't feel this film worked as well as it should have.

As in Batman Begins the film attempts to tell Superman's origin through flashbacks intercut with a present day narrative.  The film wants to follow Christopher Nolan's example, and there are some great moments (such as when a young Clark can't control his x-ray vision in school) but they just don't mesh together

Most of the second half of this film is a nonstop action sequence, and to the filmmakers' credit these scenes are spectacular.  These are definitely the superhero ""God against God"" matches fans of the genre have been waiting for. Zach Snyder thankfully doesn't rely on his trademark slow-mo from 300 and Watchmen, nor does he use obnoxious shaky-cam tactics that make it impossible to follow the action as in the Transformers films.  For that reason I can understand why some people love this movie.  For me, after about twenty minutes it just begins to wear thin.  Don't get me wrong, lots of work clearly went into these brawls, but it just goes on for too long.

At the end of the film I had one question: ""Who is the Man of Steel?""  It seems like a simple question, but the more I think about it the less I know.  If this film is anything to go by he's a cold demigod whose character is always kept at a distance.

My problem isn't that we're seeing Superman engaged in these destructive battles.  No, the problem I have with this film is that it does little to setup what kind of Superman it is we are dealing with.  This movie does little or nothing to explain Superman's views on the sanctity of life or that he wishes to protect the people of Earth.  This movie starts by assuming everyone knows Superman.  While that is more or less true it doesn't hold up well if this film is supposed to set the tone for an entire cinematic universe.  Zach Snyder and Warner Bros. are allowed to change the image of Superman.  That is their right, but they need to first establish who this new Superman is.  Snyder's film is so focused on getting to the giant set pieces, action, and moral dilemmas that it forgets to establish who this film's Superman/Clark Kent is.

Superman can be a complex character.  There is nothing wrong with being a ""big blue boyscout"" if it's done right.  This film doesn't establish anything about this universe's Superman.  This film is just so determined to set itself apart from the the hopeful, optimistic nature of the Christopher Reeve's Superman that it never stops to determine who exactly Henry Cavill's Superman is.

I think the main reason Man of Steel fails where Batman Begins and The Dark Knight succeeded is the fact that Zach Snyder isn't a patient filmmaker.  Christopher Nolan knew when to slow things down and flesh out his characters properly, which made the action feel more important.  With Snyder character interaction seems forced, like the film can't wait to get to its next special effects sequence.

I fear that will also be the flaw in the upcoming sequel, ""Superman v. Batman: Dawn of Justice"" where it appears Warner Bros. and Snyder are so determined to set up a ""The Dark Knight Returns"" style battle between their two lead superheroes and set-up 2018's Justice League that they once again will sacrifice character development in the name of action spectacle.

While I don't hate Man of Steel I certainly feel it was a misstep for Warner Bros. establishing the DC Cinematic Universe, and from what we know of the sequel it's one they're likely doomed to repeat.",1409788800,,3983,4.623044096728307

When I see images of SUPERMAN, and METROPOLIS, I picture the world of tomorrow...a ""bright"" tomorrow. (which I believe was SIEGEL and SHUSTER'S intent). Plus, for those of you who didn't notice, this is basically a re-make, we've already seen SUPERMAN go up against GENERAL ZOD (only it was more epic in the 80's, let's be honest, and uphold Truth, Justice and the American Way here). In the ""future"" considering the technology Hollywood has available today, I would love to see Superman contend with foes like BRAINIAC, METALLO and SILVER BANSHEE. Of course, I like LEX LUTHOR, but not when he is being portrayed as silly, aloof and has that crazed Joker laugh. (Yeah Kevin Spacey, I'm talkin' to you).

5780347,5,B00D91GRA4,"As everyone likely knows this movie yet again resets the Superman franchise, and of course sets up the upcoming D.C. comic slate of movies including Batman vs Superman, and the Justice League. It tells a twist on the origin story, with Russel Crowe taking over the Jor-El role. The fist third or so of the movie shows the events leading to the destruction of Krypton and sending Superman to Earth. Then flashes between adult and child Clark (played by Henry Cavill) as he discovers his powers and eventually becomes Superman.

There are many elements from the story that are recognizable in the movie, but they are almost all variations on the origin story of the comics. How krypton is destroyed, how Jonathan Kent dies, the Clark-Lois relationship are all told differently. You have to know that going in, and if variations from the comics or the Christopher Reeve movies would upset you then this is definitely one you would want to skip. I think the acting is very good (I think Amy Adams' Lois was the standout) and I think Cavill did a good job both as Superman and Clark. His Clark was far less of a doofus than Christopher Reeve's version was, which was again one of the different twists. That said we do not really see the Daily Planet version of Clark in this movie except for a couple seconds at the end. I also think Diane Lane as Martha Kent did a great job, and loved that they gave her more to do that any of the other movies did.

For those that get the Blu Ray, the movie looks and sounds great. There are are a lot of bonus features from behind the scenes cast and film-maker interviews, deleted scenes and commentary. So if you like going through the bonus material there is quite a bit there for you. If you can accept that it is a different story, and will take the franchise in a totally different direction, then I think the movie is enjoyable and worth checking out.",1409443200,,1890,4.491279069767442

5780352,2,B00D91GRA4,"Bottom Line: Good effects, reasonable sci-fi/disaster movie dragged down by strange writing and directing choices and a bizarre pseudo-religiosity. Skip-able.

A little less than half of the movie is a perfectly acceptable fight scene if hyper-violence and depictions of cataclysmic destruction are things you can get into. In fact some of the best parts of the movie are when the good guys' plan runs into a snag and when ordinary citizens are heroic. The special effects are good. The music could be lost tracks from Inception. There are space animals that look like they are on loan from Star Wars and the space scenes seem to owe something to Battlestar Galactica. There is plenty to see if you don't mind the Lightly Used, but overall the movie is a disjointed, convoluted, soulless mess.

If this was a move about Hyper-Guy or something it would be a brilliant almost satire, instead it just takes apart the Superman character. Instead of two saintly foster parents this orphan from a dead planet gets an earth father whose paranoia leads him to compel Kal-El to participate in a tragedy so traumatic it would make Batman say ""That's messed up."" Rather than growing up secretly blowing off super-steam and learning about his powers this Kal-El becomes a repressed drifter with a habit of doing property damage to express himself. The intriguing supposed major theme of this movie, humanity's reaction to the presence of a powerful extraterrestrial among them, comes to nothing. A crisis exposes Kal-El and the rest is exactly what you would expect.

The worst thing about the movie is the heavy-handed attempts to equate the Man of Steel, a refugee who beats up bad guys (especially this Man of Steel) with Jesus, you know, the turn-the-other-cheek guy. The comparison is so stupid and irritating that if the rest of the movie was perfect that might have ruined it. The rest of the movie is not perfect, though it seems like Henry Cavill would make a pretty good Superman. Maybe someday someone interested in making a movie about that character will give him the chance.

Misc: At least one very life-like, very graphic and very final act of violence makes this absolutely not for young kids. Also not for sensitive viewers expecting only bounce-back fantasy fighting.",1409356800,,2274,4.945026178010472

I watched Superman Returns in the theaters, and while I was happy to see another Superman film, I was a little disappointed.

I then skipped this one in the theaters because of all the bad reviews. Biggest mistake in my life. Let me tell you exactly what's going on:

This entire film is a reboot of the Superman story. It covers his origins in more detail than ever before. Sure, Krypton is more stylized than Richard Donner's vision, and admittedly, I thought it was a bad George Lucas joke the first time I saw. But then I got through the film, and EVERYTHING made sense. The second time I saw it, I loved Krypton. The reason being, and this is a theme for the origins of Superman's humanity and feelings of alienation, Goyer and Snyder take the time to show you where we've come from in order to show you where we're going and why we went there. It is a magum opus of the Superman universe. Likewise, Henry Cavill has an impressive physique that only lends to his ability that he can handle playing Superman.

Calling it epic means nothing today. All I have left to say is that it is my new standard for when I need my Superman fix.

The majority of bad reviews spited Superman for his actions, or the destruction represented. As someone who witnessed 9/11 in person, I'll admit that the last battle scene in Metropolis evoked some post-traumatic feelings in me, but I was OK with that. When two alien gods from another planet fight in the middle of a city populated by millions, it is meant to be traumatic. Real life isn't as gory as horror films would have us believe, but death occurs all the same. While they don't show any gore, make no mistake, a lot of people die in this film.

Superman is no small thing, and neither is this film. Here's hoping for a re-release in the theaters.",1409011200,,1944,4.461971830985916

5780491,3,B00D91GRA4,"This movie was supposed to be DC's iron horse? Their chance to launch a franchise similar to the Avengers? Instead it felt like a rushed attempt to jump start a franchise and get it off the ground fast. Like some suits were sitting in an office yelling behind the scenes at the 75 writers putting together the script that, ""we need more buildings to get destroyed because it worked so well in the Avengers..."" And, ""We need more sonic booms around Superman while he's flying because it worked so well in Iron Man.""

The movie had so many harsh timeline cuts all over the place that I would sometimes find it hard to keep track of what was going on.

Why was Lois Lane allowed to ride in that military helicopter? That scene with Perry trying to get the girl out of the rubble felt like it was written because Laurence Fishburne didn't have enough screen time.

I liked the Krypton backstory. I liked most of the cast. Amy Adams is a babe. I liked the way Zod was portrayed in this better than Superman 2 (though I'll always have a sweet spot for that film). It was a good movie but it wasn't great. I think they had the right idea though: Make Superman an outcast who doesn't want to be exposed to the public because of the fear he would be rejected by society and feared... And then give him no choice when Zod showed up. Loved the scene when he was ""captured.""

This yarn seems to have been recounted enough times already, and the current version, while visually grand, soon deteriorates into far too much computer-generated cataclysm and combat, with Superman and Zod rocketing back and forth, destroying most of Metropolis in a battle that seems to go on for half the film.

The sheep will hate this review. Depending on who you are you may like this movie or will hate it with a passion. It usually depends on your maturitiy or your exposure to other great films. Like wine, you either always like the cheap stuff or you grow to like more complex varieties. You like what you like and that is fine. This is where we get the term ignorance is bliss. If you can enjoy these movies, great. But it certainly doesn't make them any better than awful. Sorry sheep.

DC comics has one blunder after another and Marvel is beginning to falter. The Ironman 3 was horrid and I have heard that Guardians of the Galaxy was not that great. I loved the Ironman 1 and 2, the Avengers 1 and 2, and I liked Thor -Although the last Thor could have been better, it was still decent.

Movie Review

Almost all of the acting was decent. Amy Adams is clearly the weakest of the group but even she does not ruin this one. The lines they gave her and the situation they put her in made her look stupid. The lead and support acting were strong, even from russell crowe who can be a 30/70 hit or miss for me. Superman actor was great. Having never seen him act, I was most suprised by the lead - superman - who did an excellent job. Unfortunately for him, the writing killed this film.

There were some major out of context moments/dialogue which is either the director or editors and writers fault. They should never work again. The story line was completely moronic and I am even fine with the fact that it didn't exactly follow the comics. Superman deserves better writing because, well, he is super. The good actors in this film deserve better because they will be most criticized.

If you can overlook the storyline or any sense of logic, then you will be fine and will enjoy.

However, many are young and I have been there. You love everything you see. Well if you are so young that you love everything you see then this will be fine.

Again hollywood making a dollar wher it could make a billion. And with Bale repeatedly returning as an awful Batman what is next Brit Spears as Wonder Woman? Oh wait, make one of the Jonas Brothers an Iron Man replacement or why not even the Hulk. Yet, with all the drugs and rediculously hilarious cult religions in which they invest themselves, I suppose the end of Follywood and their counterparts is inevitably predictable.

5780614,3,B00D91GRA4,"After Marvel's insane success with The Avengers and all accompanying films, DC has decided they are going to take on their rivals on the field of movies with a cinematic universe of their own! And that universe began in 2013 with the release of Man of Steel, a reboot of the Superman series.
This film is great, but it also has it's fair share of flaws, so i'm going to get all the negative stuff out of the way first.
The dialogue during the final fight between Superman and Zod was terrible. It sounds like David S. Goyer's kid got a hold of his dad's laptop and rewrote everything because there are lines like ""Your a Monster Zod, and I will stop you!"" and ""There's only one way this ends: either you die, or I do!"". Oh, and who can forget the general's line at the end ""Are you effing stupid?!(Seriously?). It's funny because the dialogue was fine up until that point.
The plot was pretty overstuffed at times, particularly with the Kryptonian stuff. The whole ""codex"" subplot, involving information of Kryptoneons yet to be born or something like that, was so confusing and convoluted. The Krypton backstory in general was so confusing and convoluted. Something about outposts and genetically modified babies and that leading to the core collapsing or something like that. There's a scene when Jor-El tells Clark that he was Krypton's ""first natural birth in centuries and that was the reason they risked so much to save him. I mean wait, hold up, I thought the reason you saved your son was because he was your ""effing"" son and you ""effing"" love him! Im sure thats not what he meant, but still.
Also, Lois always magically shows up wherever the plot needs her. Zod requested her to come on his aircraft. WHY!? Durning the final battle, shes on the aircraft carrier flying into a war zone. WHY!? She even finds her way to that train station at the end! Dont get me wrong, Lois is great and Amy Adams is a great actress and did a great job in the role, but it's frustrating how the writer unapologetically makes her show up everywhere without anything resembling a explanation!
There are other things I could complain about, particularly the character development or that the film was really lacking in wit, but nah, I want to get to the fun stuff!
Aside from all that, I thought this movie was absolutely fantastic!
The opening on Krypton was so freaking awesome! Krypton openings in Superman stories are always very talky, so it was such a pleasant surprise when during the council meeting the doors just blow up out on nowhere. Everything that follows is just so flipping fantastic, from the effects to Hans Zimmer's incredible music.
It was very smart having Zod as Supermans first villain! The whole story was kind of epic, in that Zod was Jor-El's nemesis and now 33 years later becomes the enemy of Jor-El's son on another planet. It's kind of an epic story. That's probably just me though.
Zach Snyders directing was so good! So many visually fantastic shots. And that brings me to the action sequences, which thanks to Zach Snider are all so epic and awesome!
The whole cast is very good, especially Michael Shannon, who is outstanding as Zod! Seriously though, Snyder brought in an all star cast who all do fantastic jobs bringing these beloved characters to life.
And, Hans Zimmers score is amazing! Seriously, one of the best movie scores this decade!
My favorite part of the film is that this is the first movie and Lois already knows that Clark is Superman! I just think that is such a great route to take that saves us so much time with the whole Lois can't figure it out thing not just with this film, but for any sequels!
Overall, this is a great movie that has me excited for everything to come from the DC Extended Universe!",1407283200,3,3747,4.610778443113772

I really like what they did with Amy Adams and they modernized the relationship and allowed her character to be bright and strong. I want more. I hope the batman/superman movie isn't terrible. No one can replace Bale IMHO and Ben Aflack is just meh. Maybe Cavil can carry that movie. A long wait until 2016.,1407110400,,440,4.313253012048193

5780657,5,B00D91GRA4,"I am not a big Superman Fan, I have always felt the character was really just granted new powers and abilities off a whim constantly to keep raising his power and abilities that made no sense... Anyway that's another topic.

I went into this expecting to be let down, having heard all the negative comments about destruction and lack of story etc. I have to say there is a good amount of destruction with no care of the rest of civilization and then no mention of the deaths and damage caused but that is the ONLY flaw and frankly it's not all that important, could it have been touched ones but other than that it's nothing to dislike the movie for.

For someone who never liked Superman I have to say I enjoyed every character in this movie, they did not really jump to deeply into his childhood only having enough to explain the character and what he was going through. His Father on Earth, a few scenes of him growing up and that is it.
This dealt more with him coming to terms with his life and showing how it started. It also really told you a lot about his home world and that culture and I enjoyed it. I was moved by the story more than once and I think each actor did a great job. The conflict he felt about watching his father on Earth die, about finding about who he was, about meeting people from his world and accepting who he was and can be.
This Superman is one I enjoy, hopefully it keeps going and continues the great character and story growth seen in this movie.

You will not regret seeing this installment, it is a great starting point for the Superman Series, but I still do not think anyone can play Lex Luthor better than Kevin Spacey, I hope they bring him into this version.",1406505600,,1700,4.289719626168225

5780663,5,B00D91GRA4,"This is an impressive modern retelling of a the tale of the classic hero Superman. Overall, I found it to be very enjoyable. I enjoyed this new take of Superman and Lois Lane's relationship as well. But most importantly, I loved Kal-El/Clark as the traveler and loner trying to find out who he truly is. Another character element I loved is that this Superman is still the kindhearted and respectful person we've come to know and love but is not too much of a boy scout. In fact, I'd say that though Clark/Kal-El is inexperienced as a new hero in this particular film, he still exudes the confidence and backbone of a man who is super who has big decisions to make. Those are important character traits that I really liked.

Another interesting element is that the film showcased the ""alien"" aspect of Superman's origin, while at the same time it showed how Kal-El/Clark as a casual, regular guy who tries to figure out exactly what he should do when General Zod shows up as a threat. On that note, I found General Zod to be a pretty good villain, though not the best. In some ways his goals were understandable, but overall it would not haven been good for earth in the long run.

When it comes to viewing movies such as this there will be varying opinions. You will hear many different things from many people about this movie. For me, I always look at the source of the opinion. When people tell me about a certain film I always ask myself, ""Is the person a negative person? Are they cynical and overly-critical of things? Because if they are, then of course they will pick out every flaw of every movie. Are they a positive person? What kind of films do they generally like? Are they generally open-minded to new things?""  -  - These questions help me weed out the opinions of those who I find to be non-credible. I did the same for ""Man of Steel."" Then I watched it with an open mind. I'm glad I did, because this was one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in a long time as comic book movie, a Superman movie, and as a science fiction fantasy with sensibilities of gritty realism. The movie has a great soundtrack, spectacular visuals, and the action scenes are incredible.

5780667,5,B00D91GRA4,"I wasn't expecting a good turn this time around with the tale of Superman. For one thing, re-boots can be hard to swallow for longtime comic book readers / speculative fiction fans and for another, the last go-round in 2006 was IMHO, a bit lackluster. It is easy to fall into the trap of Ass/U/me - ing that I already know the story, what more can they do with it? Not to mention that superman has never been one of my favorite superheros. I enjoyed the Christopher Reed films in my youth, but the idea of a completely invulnerable here (a ""brick"") can leave one lacking a feeling of connection with our hero. The best writers to tackle Superman have found ways to expose vulnerabilities more complex than just the simple ""Lois Lane is in trouble!"" trope - although it is a palatable component of an overall whole.

Man of Steel shines a different light on the familiar tale by highlighting that fact that Superman is, essentially, an alien. This may not strike one as significant, however in the past, traditional tales have focused on his superHUMAN-ness and Man of Steel takes us on the journey based upon his alien nature. To be sure an alien immured with humanity such as to be, in many ways, more man than alien, but still an alien nonetheless.

So besides the great retelling of a well known, iconic tale, perhaps even a modern fable if you will, the crafting of said lore is beyond solid. The telling felt fresh. Even a jaded mid-forties comic collector such as myself had to admit to more ecstatic moments than I would have ever guessed this film could have elicited. The speculative technologies and their presentation were, in short, badass! The CG physics of the action scenes are stirring. The strong moral compass of our hero, touching and the various nods to nerd-dom and fan peeps seeded throughout the film, rousing. Foolish me for not giving it a chance on the big screen, but even at home on my modest 32 inch TV, it was well worth the viewing.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",1406419200,,2002,4.524861878453039

No jimmy olsen?? and whats with the penis shaped rocket ships?? This movie has great effects, great action, and some truly great krypton stuff, but changing the characters core is lame.

5780704,4,B00D91GRA4,"I recently revisited this movie after initially being disappointed in it and I have to say I am glad I did. This movie is more of a sci fi action movie than comic book movie in feel. This is probably one of the biggest reasons why many left the theater slightly disappointed, myself included. Being the nerd I am, even though I was disappointed I had to buy in once it came out on blu-ray.

One thing that I think this movie succeeds in doing is giving what many fans were looking for, which was a more realistic and less cheesy version of the Man of Steel. Many people have complained about the amount of destruction but lets face it, if there was an alien from out space that had god like powers and their were villains that had the same powers battling, chances are that's what the end result will look like.

The second point I would like to bring up is that it is a sci-fi movie. Superman is and always has been alien and for once you had a movie that really explored that aspect of the character. The early Donner movies basically just grazed the surface of this back story. This really does a good job of bringing that aspect of the character to life.

Man of Steel is by no means perfect. This film probably could have been improved with better editing and different execution of the first 15 minutes, which I believe put many people off. There could have also been a little more done with Lois Lane since she seems a little two dimensional throughout the picture. If the writers could have found someway to cut the first part of the movie slightly and expand some of the character development of those surrounded by Clark on Earth. I would have also liked a more linear approach instead of the flashbacks. These moves probably would have been much better received.

In general if you are a fan of Sci-Fi and action movies you will probably enjoy the movie. If you are coming in expecting a Marvel Universe or Dark Knight Trilogy (which also is more of a crime drama than comic).",1405641600,3,1987,4.405994550408719

5780740,4,B00D91GRA4,"I bought this movie for our 9 year old as a reward for completing his Kumon goal durning June. He loves action packed movies so I'm rating it based on his comments. He loved all the special effects but got tired of the grunting and the angry faces. At one point the magic of the movie was fizzling and he was making funny sidebars. He did not like the very end. I understand why, it was graphic for his age group. Other than that it was age appropriate.  It was an exciting movie to watch. I was being frugal and did not buy the high definition. The quality was fine with the regular however I think HD would have been superb.  I told him he has to see the Superman I saw when I was around his age in 1978..mind blowing at that time. So Christopher Reeves is on our next to watch and compare. My point of view: this movie was PACKED with A list movie stars and they all did a fantastic job in their roles. They could have saved money and used unknown actors because the writing was very limited with few lines to deliver. The cinematography was dull and sets the tone for gloom and doom. This isn't a deep philosophical movie just action pack with kind earth people. A nice movie to escape into another world with your tween kids. You won't regret chatting with them about it.",1404691200,2,1276,4.246913580246914
5780741,5,B00D91GRA4,"I'd heard of Superman before, but this was the first movie I really watched about him. It's awesome!!

Clear parallels are drawn between Superman and Jesus. It's so nice to have a real hero again, not just a self-centered, bratty, immoral guy who's trying to ""find himself"" and ends up being a hero (e. g. Iron Man). Kal, son of El (I like the reference to God there too, as God is called El by Israel in the Bible) is a true, moral, upstanding man who really wants to help people and stands firm against evil.

5780746,4,B00D91GRA4,"I wanted to absolutely love this film.  I wanted to give it five stars and hold it up to the same praise as superhero films like ""The Dark Knight"".  But I could not.
  I could not for a number of little things that just added up and cost this film here that fifth star.  And, with about two minutes of extra footage and maybe a dozen or so more lines, a number of these issues could have been eliminated.  My best example is the reason for why the Kryptonians brought Lois Lane onto their ship.  I'm fairly certain I know why they did this, but I won't spoil it.  Had the film added just a bit more footage and a line or two and I wouldn't even need to bring it up.  If you want to think about it and other similar issues long and hard, go ahead and watch the film as is.
  Second, too many characters were either too calm or too soft spoken most of the time.  The biggest offender for the latter was our new Cal El/Clark Kent/Superman, Henry Cavill, who almost always spoke quite softly.  Apart from that, he was beyond a fine successor to the likes of Christopher Reeve and Brandon Routh.  As for everyone else, they all lost their calmness about halfway through the destruction of Metropolis...and I mean in the entire film, including the flashbacks.  Speaking of flashbacks, they were sometimes placed rather randomly, like during the rescue on that oil rig...kind of a bad time to be reflecting on your past, Mr. Kent.
  My final complaint is that Kevin Costner and Christopher Meloni didn't get enough screen time...goes back to that little extra footage thing I was talking about earlier.  Though I'm a fan of both men, I do have another reason for bringing this up.  Christopher Meloni wasn't really built up for the audience, so when he was in the battle and when he informed his fellow military men that Superman wasn't the enemy, it didn't leave as much of an impact as it could have.  I'm sure he had the rank and reputation for his fellow soldiers to take him seriously, but for the audience, it's just ""movie speak""...the general, played by Harry Lennix, was built up better and the line in question would have had a bigger impact on an audience because of this alone.  Kevin Costner was great as Jonathan Kent and I just didn't get enough of him...that's all there is to that, even though he too was a little too calm during that tornado.
  Without a doubt, my favorite in this film was Amy Adams as Lois Lane and she could never get enough screen time.  She's been wanting to play this role for years and, now that her chance has come, the wait was well worth it...it's a performance I won't soon forget.  As I mentioned earlier, I actually liked Henry Cavill as Superman, once he got loud every so often.  I'm glad to see the tradition of casting unknown actors in the role continues, because that definitely helps me absorb the character than someone's performance as that character.  I had no prior expectations of Mr. Cavill himself, but because the rest of the cast was filled with such heavy-hitters from Hollywood like Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, and Laurence Fishburne, the bar for whoever would play Superman was set pretty high.  Mr. Cavill met that bar and, for the most part, surpassed it.
  Apart from my previously discussed issues, the cast all did very well.  Laurence Fishburne was a tough boss as Daily Planet editor Perry White.  I normally have no opinion of Russell Crowe, but I really liked him as Jor El.  My favorite scene in the entire movie was the one he shared with Amy Adams on the Kryptonian ship.  Michael Shannon played a fine General Zod, even if his behavior wasn't always conducive to military conduct.  Of course, Zod pretty much lost his mind and was now writing his own rules as he went along, having not sat down and done so beforehand.  Overall, the cast all did fine.  By the way, Faora was the original comic book character in her position as second-in-command and Ursa was a newly-created homage for this character in Superman II.
  Overall, I still really liked this movie.  The story was good, giving us a new twist to a tale told about a thousand times before.  The new darker, edgy Superman wasn't something I spent my life waiting for, but now that it's here, I like it as much as the first two Christopher Reeve movies, which were campier.  Also, it's nice to see what will be the first in a superhero's movie series where the superhero's arch enemy wasn't in the first movie.  Despite all my complaints, I do appreciate the effort that went into making this film and I look forward to its sequel(s).  Enjoy.",1404518400,2,4600,4.5236363636363635

5780761,4,B00D91GRA4,"This movie gets way too much criticism than it  deserves. It's certainly not on par with Spider-Man 2 or The Dark Knight, but it's still enjoyable. Honestly, I don't understand why people say that there's too much action. Yes, the prologue and half of the first act is a bit bloated, but the movie does calm down until the final act giving us an intense final fight. I was never a fan of Superman, he just never appealed to me. When I went to The Dark Knight Rises midnight screening, the first trailer that played was the Man of Steel teaser trailer. I said to myself, ""I need to go see this when it comes out."" I did, and I was greatly satisfied. The only real complaint I have with the film is that it takes itself WAY too seriously. Snyder and David Goyer could've thrown in some more humor into the film. Not the best superhero movie, but certainly not the worst out there. Also, the bonus features are fantastic. The features go into the action of the movie, some of the main casts workout sessions, Hans Zimmers experience on making the film's score, and watching the movie and learning how the film was created simultaneously. If you had to pick between the Blu Ray case or steelbook, get the steelbook. The regular Blu Ray case stack the discs on each other.

It was a good first viewing (obviously as I watched it again)... but it quickly becomes a long sit for anyone to just watch a bunch of fighting.

If you prefer watching MMA or fighting, okay, all the more kudos.

It is, by far, probably the best Superman movie on film, but at the same time, I feel like Man of Steel was just competing against Avengers in terms of ""How do we make this epic?"" And apparently, that was to completely copy the alien-invasion story from Avengers, and throw in a Neo vs. Smith from Matrix 3 fight sequence with the names of Superman and Zod and call it epic. That formula worked and people bought it... but at the same time in retrospect it is a let down that the makers couldn't come up with something a little more original.

I'll be interested in seeing how Batman vs. Superman tops it, and hope that it enjoys the success of sequel-toppers of the Nolan Batman franchise instead of joining the sad category of sequel-letdowns...",1403827200,,1214,4.434977578475336

Krypton is doomed and yet Zod fights Jor-El.  For some reason, Jor-El and Zod both intend to somehow repopulation Krypton on another planet - Earth.  How these individuals would be born and how the genetic makeup could be transplanted into Kal_El's cells is not explained.  Nor is how they will be born and raised or why Earth's people would agree.  This caused the whole problem: Zod wanted Earth for Kryptonians alone.  He even could have chosen another planet, but didn't.

As for the rest.  Our hero is good, but not smart.  Instead of having his son learn to use his powers as efficiently as possible and learn best  how to keep his identity secret, Jonathan Kent waits for a sign that the world is ready to accept his son.  This caused his own death as his obedient son lets his father die.  I understand.

5780787,5,B00D91GRA4,"I have read a number of harsh criticisms about the film and, broadly, they can be attributed to a failure to (a) understand the nature of the players involved (Kryptonians) and (b) understand the comic book origins of the film.

One of the central themes of the comic book was that, although Superman was born on an alien planet and although he possessed superhuman abilities, he was raised by an American family, embraced traditional American Values, was a fundamentally decent and honorable human being as a result of his upbringing and that he held 'Truth, Justice, the American Way' as important values to live up to. In fact, one of the saddest parts of 'Superman Returns' (the prior reboot) is that Superman said, ""truth, justice, all that stuff"". But Superman, as a force for good, always held that America, the nation, and Americans, in general, had the capacity to be tremendous forces for good in the world. Thankfully, Man of Steel returns to that belief in American Exceptionalism and, in his early years, struggled with balancing his desire to use his powers for the benefit of others against the need to keep his family safe from intrusion and  so, the need to remain behind the scenes, more anonymous. We see this inner tension in many of the earlier scenes in the movie.

As to the critiques about the destruction and (potential) death depicted in the movie, well, they are nothing short of absurd. Independence Day depicted entire cities being obliterated. War of the World depicted human beings being pureed by the thousands and turn into alien mulch. 2012 - arguably a terrible movie - depicted the death of virtually the entire human race. The bottom line is that, although Man of Steel did depict death and destruction, it did so in service to the telling of a fundamental part of the story: what could happen should a technologically superior race of people encounter another race of people with less technological advancement and a desire to conquer. If this theme is uncomfortable, well, that's a good thing as this very theme has played out repeatedly over the course of human history. And, frankly, anyone who believes that an alien invasion of Earth is going to end up at all well for the human race is, frankly, delusional. Absent some sort of 'deus ex machina' narrative device, human extinction in such a scenario is all but virtually guaranteed.

And, yes, in a way, the existence of Superman ought to count as such a narrative device. But, he is also an important allegory. His story in this film - his triumph (and subsequent ascension into public service as a superhero) is a snapshot metaphor of all of the good that America has done in the world - no matter what her critics might suggest. His story affirms that Truth, Justice, Loyalty, Love, Self-sacrifice, Patriotism and, yes, the American Way are sufficient to defeat tyranny, subjugation, bigotry and genocide. That's what both world wars were about and, yes, the Cold War were all about, and it was to the benefit of the entire world that Truth, Justice, and the American Way won the day in each of those instances.",1403395200,,3108,4.803738317757009

5780792,5,B00D91GRA4,"I can understand why a lot of people are critical of this movie, and I even understand why certain people hate this movie with every fiber of their being.  To sum it up: people do not like having anything intelligent and profound thrown at them, and this is exactly what ""Man of Steel"" does to to great heights.  Director Zack Snyder gives a Superman who is full to the brim with inner conflict, and Henry Cavill plays the role with heart and poignancy.  His is a Clark Kent who has been raised to harness restraint, and not embrace his power.  A scene that flashes back to a young Clark being bullied by older boys demonstrates this beautifully, and the scene is balanced with wisdom by Kevin Costner's Jonathan Kent, the only father that Clark has ever known.

Critics have cited the level of destruction at the end of the movie as gratuitous and, as one reviewer put it: ""just plain dumb"".  I vehemently disagree.  The idea is simple: if a being with that much power actually existed in our world, he/she by their very nature, despite his/her best intentions, would potentially bring great harm to our way of life.  This is the philosophical tenet that Snyder captures with his Superman in brilliant fashion.  There is an incredible amount of subtext in all of Zack Snyder's films, and to reveal everything that lies under the surface of ""Man of Steel"", would be to deprive another person an epiphany or potentially startling realization.  A bold claim? Perhaps.  See this incredible movie, and judge for yourself.  I promise that you will not walk away disappointed.",1403222400,,1570,4.731617647058823

The FX are of course state of the art...but like most FX-driven movies, they overpower the story. Henry Cavill is good, though not consistent in looks. I was much impressed with Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent. I've never much cared for the actor, but I found him quite convincing in this. In fact, most of the cast was good.

5780800,1,B00D91GRA4,"Didn't like this AT ALL. First they told the origin story again which took up 30 minutes that could've went to something else. They do a lot of those flashbacks which were pretty good but slowed the movie down a lot. This movie was about a half hour too long, there really isn't much to the plot or the characters. Most of the action that came towards the end was so over the top I was amazed by now ridiculous it was. They need to tone it way back with the violence and endless destruction of Metropolis. What about all the civilians? Why are they able to smash each other through buildings like that and then at the end the villain dies fairly easily. Just makes no sense it was really silly.

And thats really my main complaint with the movie is that there were just too many silly things going on for me to really care about any of it. I could've forgiven a poor plot if the movie itself wasn't so lame and ridiculous. Superman himself isn't an interesting portrayal and he lacks personally as does Lois Lane. Not a good superman movie and it's hilarious how hyped this whole series has become with the whole superman vs. batman nonsense.

as far as flaws. i believe that little more character development couldn't hurt. i wanted to see more of lois' intuitiveness and cleverness as a reporter. i felt that she was the weakest link in the movie. clark (henry cavill) was on point. he was exactly how i pictured superman in my head. as far as fringe characters, i think everyone held there ground.

5780818,3,B00D91GRA4,"This movie was ultimately received poorly.  I am also a fan of Superman, so I did have a bias going into it, please keep in mind.  Who will save us when we're at our worst?  HE will.  He is a symbol of hope, the one who is going to save us.  Many had complained over the years that he has become far too Boy Scout like, that he was too good and almost a goody two shoes of comic book heroes.  Here he used his super powers to do some bad as much as he did good with it, and people still complained about it.  Because Superman is such an old character, it's difficult to inflict changes upon him and have the general public just accept them as such.  Still, this movie had it's pitfalls as much as it had its good points.

Like all reboots, we started at the beginning once again: Jor-El, a wise scientist from the planet Krypton, sent his infant son to Earth to save him from a dying world and who would become the Earth's greatest protector.  This was about seeing Henry Cavill's ripped and toned body to be sure (which was no small feat to achieve by any means), and the updated Superman costume.  Where this movie fails is that the story being told is choppy, jumps from place to place in terms of time and events, and there was a feeling like they were trying to squeeze too much into one movie.  They ""updated"" the relationship between Lois Lane and Superman / Clark Kent into an equal partnership and where she will know of his persona before he begins his job at the Daily Planet, which didn't seem like it had much of a difference whether or not she knows or doesn't know that they are the same person.  Superman fights General Zod and his minions, but it's more like he is preventing an alien invasion rather than the dilemmas faced in Superman 2 (which, like it or not, we measure this against).  The special effects were wonderful, but it wasn't enough to carry the movie unfortunately.  We got lost in a bunch of nonsense that didn't seem to make much sense once we got to the halfway point.

Still, I have hopes for the franchise.  Henry Cavill is set to be in another movie (this time with Batman to pick it up more by adding the DC character who surpassed him in popularity about 30 years ago), and we'll see what we'll see.  Look up in the sky ...",1402185600,,2263,4.259953161592506

5780825,5,B00D91GRA4,"Superman always seems to have been difficult to portray on the silver screen. It seems the critics and the viewers tend to forget that this hero, who incidentally seems to be a combination of Hercules/Gilgamesh and Jesus Christ, is originally from the comic book world so standard ""realism"" doesn't fully apply. That said, this reboot tells a tale that I felt was very apt, both in its warning to not mess with the created order, as well as giving hope to mankind that we can overcome. As a Christian, I feel that there are a lot of good analogies to the Christian life in general: being incognito and misunderstood, having been given a gift that the world is not really ready for, having to choose whether you're going to trust someone even if they are untried.

Special effects-wise, the movie is spectacular. It's very violent, but it's also realistic because of the death toll and the effect on the standard civilians. I like how we also see heroes among the civilians who are saving their friends (something that I felt was lacking in The Avengers). The only section that I felt was a little over-the-top was Superman's struggle with the world engine. I loved what they did with Jor-El and the story behind General Zod. In the end you even feel a little for Zod and for Kal-El's decisions regarding him. It was much more fulfilling than the story line of the original Superman and Superman II movies from 1978 and 1980 respectively; not to mention the incredibly annoying Superman Returns.

I wasn't sure about the casting of either Russel Crowe as Jor-El or Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent, but in retrospect both were perfect for their roles. (The trailers actually paint Jonathan Kent as a character completely opposite to what he is in the full-length movie.) Henry Cavill was, in my not so humble opinion, also excellent, especially as he reminded me a lot of Tom Welling in the Smallville series. Casting Amy Adams as Lois Lane was a wonderful idea as well. I enjoyed seeing Christopher Meloni in a role outside of Law and Order.

For me, watching this movie the first time sealed the deal: this one is worth owning and watching again and again, because there are so many little details that you don't see the first time.

Some of the complaints that people has for this movie is just being too picky.
Example (Spoiler alert) : Superman kills Zod, and most people don't like it. Well, throughout the entire movie that involves Zod, he told Superman that he would stop at nothing to kill all humans and take over the Earth, Its either he dies or Superman dies. No prison can hold Zod so Superman has no choice but kill him at the end.

Anyways, if you're a superman or comic book fan of any kind, this is one of the best movie, the best to me. Its a must see or you are definitely missing out.",1401667200,,714,4.0928571428571425

I like Henry Cavill as Superman (though Brandon Routh was a fine Man of Steel and ""Superman Returns"" a much better film), and in fact all the casting is adequate.  I wish the movie hadn't been completely filmed in the over-saturated, washed-out style.  That would have worked well for the antiseptic scenes on Krypton, but it is especially inappropriate for Kansas and is very tiring to the eyes after 2+ hours.

The story of ""Man of Steel"" is engaging, but rather bleak.  I wish this had been a joyous, uplifting Superman film, as the first was, but the second half of it is better in that regard than the first and, all in all, I'm happy I paid my $12 for the blu-ray + DVD.

5780839,1,B00D91GRA4,"If you liked Christopher Reeves, if you think Superman is a good and simple man, a man who always stands for simple old fashioned American ethics, if you think Superman is strong and unwavering in his righteousness, and these are the reasons you like the character, then please do not watch this movie. I'll warn you, you're going to get angry when you try to sit through this thing.

This movie is just one more example of Hollywood's sickness: taking everything that was previously good (and I mean good in the altruistic way) and turning it into a contorted modern flawed ugly thing. They have destroyed so many of the nice and righteous parts of our culture by rewriting them or ""rebooting"" them. This is another sad example of how the soulless Hollywood machine can no longer express any goodness. Everything, even Superman is flawed, gray and unattractive. Nothing can be simply brave and true and simple anymore. They think that's progress. They don't see that it's actually digression. Sad.

Superman over the last 76 years has stood as a fictional symbol of simplicity, goodness.... well, as he used to say: ""truth, justice and the American way."" Now we see the media machine pumping out a driveling, pathetic self pitying little floppy haired pouty boy as the ""Man of Steel"". It is interesting that as American itself doesn't any longer stand for truth and justice, neither does it's central comic book symbolic hero. The whole altruistic good vision is gone from the minds of our movie makers. They've lived too long in a gray shadowed existence in their all too real world of corporate compromise. Gone are the days of simple good male character finding their way onto the silver screen. And when they do come back they are changed beyond recognition. The saddest thing about this is that the younger generation will just eat this up and think that this Emo-Superdud is what this character is!

Here's some annoyances you'll have to swallow if you decide to torture yourself with this movie:

(1) Krypton is failing because of their environmentally unsound industrial practices. Oh my. How obvious can the brainwashing agenda be?!?! Can't they just make a movie anymore !?! Or does it all have to be some sort of message device, a soap box? When I pay to be entertained I am not paying to be preached at yet again about how terrible we are to the planet. Guilt guilt guilt. O.k., I feel crappy about using fossil fuels, now what? I can't just watch a Superman movie for an hour or two and then get back to the guilt after that? No. Can't we just watch a freakin' comic book movie and have a little fun? No. No you can't. Everything must be on message. Uh... such a waste. Inevitably all these dvd's need to be thrown in the dumpster.

(2) Don't worry though... if you like being preached at they've got more for you. Old self-pitying Superbrat needs to save the off shore oil rig from itself in a big explosion scene. At least this stops his super-poutying teenage angst for a minute or two. But again, can these soulless Hollywood types think their own thoughts at all. No. They saw oil spills on the news and it was getting ratings and so they thought that was a good idea. Preachy and transparent. I really dislike movies that aren't really what they're supposed to be and are actually about getting bullet points or messages into the audience. Again, I thought I was buying a comic book movie.

(3) This may seem small, but to the Superman fan it is not. It's a detail but I've always thought them smart to avoid. The scruff, the beard, shaving. In almost all Superman movies and tv, they avoid this issue, very wisely I think. What on the planet can he shave with. Bullets literally bounce off his pupils, so what does he shave with? Almost all other directors and producers cared just enough about the suspension of disbelief enough to avoid this issue. These filmmakers thought it more important to make him look cool or dramatic than to make the character make sense. Again, if you're not really a comic book person, sci-fi fan, or Superman buff, you might think this point silly, but it is not.

(4) Krypton. Originally it simply died of old age. It was vague way back when. But it is clear that there was no rebellion or internal war. It is so pathetic that Hollywood has to take a place of enlightened higher level beings and lower them down, not only to our brutal human level, but to this very moment of war and brutality. No longer is Superman and his race a dream or ideal of an advanced species we might try to be like, no longer are we in awe of their peace and beauty. No, they are dumb and warlike like us. Great right! Don't you just identify with them so much more now that they cannot focus on the environmental issues tearing their planet apart because they're too busy killing each other. Isn't it great that they're just like us? These stupid filmmakers think people tune into Superman to see ourselves!!!!!

No, Superman is supposed to be an ideal, not a reflection of our own inadequacies.

(5) We can get into Zod and all the rewriting if you like, but let's just cut to the chase: they have no ideas in their manikin heads out there in Southern California. Everything is a pale rewrite of some previous material. They cannot simply pick Superman up where the last movie left off and writing from there. No, they have to retell the beginning because they have no original thoughts.

All the media machine can do is regurgitate the same plots... each time releasing it with more bile left all over the product than the last time. So we have to use Superman II ideas. We have to retell the beginning of Superman I. And we have to puke it up through the ugly and contorted lens of our modern gray minds. They've forgotten what good looks like. They've forgotten how think, and apparently they don't seem to hire those people... what are they called.... oh, it's been so long since we've seen one... oh, yeah they're called writers. ""Re-writers"" seem to fit the bill just fine.

Note to any Hollywood ""writers"" out there:

 If someone asks you to take an old idea that was good and touch it, rewrite it, or otherwise make it palatable for the modern audience, you should remember that you're a artist not an office secretary. Artists create, they do not destroy other people's creations and call themselves artists. No one calls themselves a painter when they've painted a new Mona Lisa. We call them forgers.

I mean, this movie is an amalgam of pop culture hot words: terraforming, oil spill, coup d'&eacute;tat, military investigation, genetic engineering... blah, blah, etc. Tiring, obvious soap box big media messaging, wrapped in a flesh of a childish unmanly super-emo-man, who's self doubt and pity are pathetic.

This is certainly not Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster's Superman. You actually like that guy.

Max Fleischer's Superman would not understand this movie at all. He lived in a different time, a simpller time, when good was obvious and Superman was a symbol of strength. Period.

George Reeves' Superman was like your ideal, strong, caring, dad figure compared to this super-brat, who is like your wimpy, video game playing, pouty teenage emo son.

And Finally, Christopher Reeves' likable, kind, simply, strong, bold, loving and brave Superman would simply shake his head and feel sorry for this pathetic little thing. Christopher as a human was immensely more charismatic, and as an actor was, well, a good actor ! You believed he was Superman. And finally, you liked him. And you like Superman. You wanted to be like him, and as a parent, you didn't mind your child wanting to be like him.

I do not think Man of Steel is appropriate for small children the way almost all other Superman series were. I certainly don't want my son to be like this guy.

I'd suggest passing on this movie. I wish I could give it zero stars.

It's the worst Superman anything... ever.

Finally, Superman does not kill. He is supposed to be a good person. Period. Therefore, this is not Superman. So sad, so very, very sad...",1401580800,26,8059,4.652601969057665

Literally, I did not know what it would take to kill one of them. Meaning there was no tension at all by this time, just a detached sense of morbid curiosity about that bad guy's impending doom.

Or maybe it was seeing Kevin Costner surrounded by corn fields that I couldn't stop wondering if they build it, will he come?

This film gives Superman a soul, one that has a bit of human fallacy.  He is capable of retribution in this film, where purists believe is above such petty things.  He was raised on Earth people!

The largest complaint I have heard is the ending, as Superman is forced to choose an evil.  It is his kobayashi maru (Star Trek: Unwinnable scenario) and must decide which wrong street to take, for there are no others.  I am sure he would have chosen a different route, but his hand is forced.

My only complaint in the film is that Henry Cavill yells a few times, and they all sound exactly the same, as if they were one audio file used many times.  Fight scenes with the Kryptonians were amazing and I loved the super speed effects.  Awesome!

5780861,1,B00D91GRA4,"Man, I was excited to see this film. The trailers looked so ... tense! So atmospheric. After a few outings which were of mixed quality, maybe this was the Superman film to really knock people away?

It isn't.

If you watched  the first Superman film, and thought ""what this needs is Superman fighting other super-powered people, and much less charisma"", then you're  going to love this film. Friends of mine were *ecstatic* when one super-powered person grabbed Superman as he tried to fly away and threw him back to the ground.
I admit, that was a pretty cool scene - but it was only one moment, and it lasted about 10 seconds.

So why didn't I like this film? It brings ""gritty"" to Superman, it's extremely loud, Superman isn't a hero so much as a secondary character, and it had no uplifting moment to speak of. Oh, and Space Jesus.

~~~~~~
1. True Grit.
Superman has never been this Gritty before. To show how gritty it is, all the colours in the film are bruised just a bit. Superman *is* red, white & blue, but it's one with a lot of Grit added to it. But this isn't just a colour scheme thing either - oh no. This Superman kills the bad guy, wipes out any number of kryptonian embryos (guess we know where he stands on abortion), casually leaves Metropolis while whole buildings fall to fight a robot on the other side of the planet, and then makes out  with random reporter lady **on the ashes of lord knows how many dead**.
To me, Superman is an appeal to all that is good and decent in a person, to show that good and decency are themselves enough, that there *is* a greater power that embodies all the best qualities .This Superman, however, doesn't have any of that, everything is dark, angry and very very

~~~~~~~
2. LOUD
Are you hard of hearing? I said, ""are you hard of hearing?"". Oh, what's that, you just  watched Man Of Steel and cannot hear anything? Fair enough.
Everything in this movie is just the loudest. It seems it wasn't enough to make superman all dark and angry, but every punch, explosion, scream - and in a movie where super-powered goons duke it out, you can bet this happens a lot - every sound effect is very very loud.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3. Heroes Wanted
This is a Superman film where Superman does nothing of his own volition. Have you watched/read the Twilight series? If so, did you think Bella was actually a worthy hero, or someone who things ""just happened to"". The vampire loved here. The werewolf loved her. They fought - throughout the whole first book (never made it past book one), Bella isn't a catalyst so much as a bystander.
This scenario is actually amplified in MoS. From the start, we learn that Superman doesn't actually look to do good - no, he actually lives as an effective hermit, hiding from everyone else, until a disaster happens right in front of him. It's not like the oil rig explosion happens in the distance and Superman is on the lookout - it literally happens *right* in front of him.
And it only gets worse - he doesn't fly out to meet the invading aliens, he has to wait for them to ask for him. Then he has to wait for the US govt to get to Lois.
Then he goes to see the aliens, and instead of suggesting, quite reasonably, that  they settle on any of the other planets that their kryptonian spaceships scouted for, he just sits around until they try to kill him.
Then he doesn't really fight them until they try to attack his mum.
The end of the film isn't even him stopping widespread devastation in Metropolis - it's him flying to the other side of the world! And then the Big Bad has to *tell* him he has to kill. Superman never, not once, takes a step in the right direction.
And he's 33! He's not some 20-somthing kid, he's a fully grown adult!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
4. Not a happy ending
At the film's end, Metropolis lies ruined, untold millions are dead, and Superman can only be viewed by humanity as a whole as an unstoppable murder man who might just cause more aliens to attack earth.
That's the end. That. Not ""everyone is happy"", not ""he  helped the  aliens with logic and they came to a happy conclusion"", no, just millions dead and  widespread devastation. That isn't a happy ending in anyone's book, and it is just  galling in a Superman movie.

~~~~~~~~~~~~
5. Space Jesus.
Superman is 33 in this film. He poses like Jesus at every opportunity. He has stain-glass windows pointing at him, and in the end he sacrifices himself for humanity and his own species by giving his... oh wait, no. In the end he snaps some guy's neck and flies off. Space Jesus rolls different, yo.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
6. Bonus: Plot Holes
 - Why do bred Kryptonian warriors fight worse than bred Kryptonian scientists?
 - Why wouldn't Kryptonian Warriors want to live on a world where they had super powers?
 - Why doesn't Superman just fly with the aliens to a different planet, terraform that, and help grow Krypton there?
 - What happens to Zod's gang after superman's first fight with them?
 - Why does the US govt forget where they got the alien spaceship from?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Conclusion
I really really dislike this film. I nearly left in the theater after the  Space Jesus pose when he left the Kryptonian aircraft. I cringed at every loud  sound effect.
I *did* like the ""early Kent"" scenes, but they were too few and far between, and lost in the noise. Also, I think it might have been a Pavlovian response to them, because they were blissfully quiet scenes.

This is a desperately cynical, pointless film that didn't need to star Superman - it's bogged down by a billion loud sounds and a billion punches. Superman is a bystander in his own film, and pretty much everybody dies in the end.

5780867,5,B00D91GRA4,"Man of Steel's compelling theme is acceptance vs. rejection. The story's moral idea is whether Superman can be accepted by humanity and America despite the unfamiliarity and fear his presence naturally cause. His human adopted father believes implicitly that Clark will be rejected, and thus he tutors Clark on the need to always conceal his identity and powers. The father wanted to prepare his son for the pain of rejection. Thus Clark grew up believing, expecting that humanity could not and would not accept him. He simply saw this as inevitable, yet it didn't stop his intervening to rescue humans in mortal danger. Thus he chooses the good for the sake of the good, without hope of reward. This is a superb theme, it would resonate for all viewers, whatever their station in life. How often do we feel a similar fear of being utterly unable, existentially, of ever fitting in, of being rejected. So this story hits home almost immediately, rising above its genre.

How is this introduced? - in the Inciting Incident.

Reports surface that an alien ship (one of the scout ships serving Kryptonian outposts) had been discovered in northern Canada embedded in an 18,000-year old glacier. Lois Lane shows up to investigate. Clark is already there as a technical worker onsite. At night he enters the area of the excavated ship and ; Lane follows him. He activates ship sensors with the 'Superman' Hope icon ('S'!) left with him in the pod-ship that brought him to Earth. The icon servitor attacks him, and he turns it off.  Lane follows him and she she too is attacked. Clark saves her life, leaves the excavation site and returns south. He always knew he was 'different', but not how or why. Now he has the beginnings of knowledge of who he is and where hes from. Hes caught between an Earth that likely cannot accept him and a possibly-vanished Krypton.

Just a quick comment on Krypton's social system, depicted in detail in the movie's opening. Krypton was a hyper-controlled Platonic Republic where each individuals birth was genetically programmed to fit him into a specific position in the State. 'Difference' was thus not an issue on Krypton, but at great cost.

Thus the film's superb, non-stop action is given a moving thematic frame that humanizes Superman. If such difference can be the source of profound estrangement and rejection, the story delivers a life-message that's as illustrative as the film's fine moments of awesome spectacle.",1400457600,,2453,4.915458937198068

5780870,4,B00D91GRA4,"Henry Cavill was spot on as Superman. He portrayed Superman instead of pretending to be Christopher Reeve.
Michael Shannon did an excellent job as Zod. Again, his portrayal of Zod and not imitating Terrence Stamp.
Russell Crowe was excellent at Jor El and had a commanding presence.
I felt the only weak link was Kevin Cosnar's portrayal of Jonathan Kent. He was too wooden, his philosophy was flaky too.
I am glad Young Superman didn't listen to him and go ahead and save those kids.
Lawrence Fishburne did a fantastic job as Perry White. Amy Adams gave a graeat portrayal as Louis Lane. She nailed that role. I like how she was confident and ambitious and not one to back down.
This movie builds up to an explosive battle with Superman, a band of human military against Zod and the renegade Kryptonians who want to terraform Earth.
It also shows the reality of two super powered beings battling on Earth. Lots of comic book destruction, beings punched through buildings etc.

Lois Lane is finally a butt kicker, Henry Cavill is PERFECT for Clark Kent/Kal El, and I was just blown away by the beautiful and clearly heartfelt and thoughtful editing and pacing. Zack Snyder really wanted you to care about the lives at risk and about what was happening to Clark and the Earth, and he more than succeeded. The ball flew out of the park!

This movie is a craft of true love for the heart of Superman. It's a love letter to all the things that make his story great and endearing, and, like the great interpretations of Batman, it's allowing Superman to finally evolve into something brand new and improved.

I liked Superman Returns, but most people didn't because there wasn't enough action, or Lex Luthor wasn't a fighting villain. That's not a problem here. About the first hour or so is all biographical, unlike Returns which kind of took place after Superman II. If you don't know Superman's origin story, this will suffice, though Marlon Brando's Krypton was prettier. Bottom line it sets the groundwork for Kal-El's journey, not to mention General Zod's. Only flashbacks allude to Clark's younger years, making the story feel less like a coming of age story. The second half however is almost all action, from huge world-saving extravagance all the way to super-powered fist fights. The very final action sequence reminded me of an episode of Justice League or Superman: The Animated Series, which aren't bound by the limits of what can be put in front of a camera and see battles that cross the entire planet earth and sometimes beyond. No live-action film in the superhero genre has captured the feel of such a battle in this way, and I couldn't help but tear up as it started to take place. Man of Steel won't make anyone forget about Christopher Reeve's performance or the story he was a part of, but this isn't about that.

Goyer for writing a mature script and taking cues from some great Superman story-lines: Mark Waid's Birthright along with John Byrne's Man of Steel, Geoff John's Secret Origin & Last Son and J. Michael Straczynski's Earth-One. Henry Cavill is amazing as Superman, along with Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Russell Crowe as Jor-El, Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent, Diane Lane as Martha Kent, Laurence Fishburne as Perry White, and Michael Shannon as General Zod. One of my favorite directors, Zack Snyder delivers on the mind-blowing action but also the emotional character moments of the film. Finally, due to all the criticism on character development, I'm certain that was intentional seeing as the origin story for Superman is very rigid and this film served to show why he becomes Superman and therefore reporter Clark Kent. As for the controversy on Zod's death, Superman HAS KILLED in the comics (when it was necessary) and it's very important to welcome a new Superman for the 21st century and leave the Christopher Reeve version to rest (which I love as well).

5780900,5,B00D91GRA4,"**some mild spoilers**

Growing up during the 70's like all kids I had my stacks of comic books.  I'm a girl, so I had my Wonder Woman, but I had Spiderman and my favorite right after Wonder Woman was Superman.  But I was never a purist when it came to comic books.  We had a local books store that my parents and I visited weekly that I would take my foot thick stack of comic books down to, to trade for new ones to read.  Eventually I moved on to reading novels - but I never lost my love of super heroes

When Man of Steel came out I was a little hesitant.  To me Christopher Reeves had been THE Superman.  I did like Dean Cain as the TV Superman and I enjoy that series. (yes, I did watch George Reeves too)  But to me, it seems that it would be really hard to fill Christopher Reeves shoes.  It always will be, but man-o-man-o-man one look at Henry Cavill with his hairy chest, his body on fire, framed in that door, set to rescue those guys on the oil rig, really caught my attention. (note to guys, one thing that many women find very appealing about guys like Henry Cavill and Hugh Jackman is that well built hair chest - shaved chests aren't always sexy)

Okay, hormones on the back burner.  I really like the intensity of this movie.  There was a very dark vibe to Cavill's Superman and I understood it.  It had to be tough growing up being so different, being bullied and not able to defend yourself.  I really didn't like Costners' reply when Clark asked him ""should I just have let them all die"" and he replies, ""yes, maybe, I don't know"".  That was WRONG.  That is not the values that the original Kents raised Clark Kent with.

And how Clark's father died was extremely upsetting to me.  First being the year on the tomb stone was the year that my own father died, I will not expand on that.  The tornado was too much for me.  My family is from Texas, right on the tornado belt and I'm am deathly afraid of tornadoes.  I've been thru way too many of them - imagine being woken up as a 7 year old from a dead sleep, yanked out of bed by your father and carried at a dead run for a storm cellar.  The cellar is small, filled with more than 10 people, 1 big bed, lots of preserves and other types of items folks on farms keep in storm cellars and the entire time the grannies are praying.  I had to stop the video and go take a walk outside.

But moving on - you can see why this movie was stirring a lot of emotions for me - first part of the movie was much more detailed than the original movies and I caught an interesting detail.  That the family's name was actually El.  For all these years I had thought Superman's first name was Kal-el, when in fact that was his full name.  Funny thing is my husband's name is Jorel, but it is a German name, where the J is pronounced with a Y sound....we have joked over the years about this.  People always say, ""oh, like Superman's Dad's name"" - Now he can say, ""no, his dad's first name was Jor""

Also seeing all the babies in the bubbles didn't make sense at first until I listened to General Zod rant later in the movie - then it dawned on me why he was so driven.  I knew that Jor-El and Lor-El had conceived and birth the first natural born child against their societies laws from the first part of the movie, but I didn't realize WHY it was against the law.  With Zod's rant it became clear that while the babies were growing and maturing in their little bubbles they were being ""programed"" to fit into society within a specific job.  Zod for example was bred to be a warrior, it was hard coded into his genes to look after and protect Kyronite citizens.  With all the citizens dead, he had an over whelming drive that verged on madness to jump start the race again so that he could full fill his purpose in life.  He was willing to do anything to see his plan thru, his genetics had too strong of a pull and drive, forcing him to go over the top.

As for the violence during the fights that happened between Superman, Zod and his people - it was rather shocking.  Usually Superman would have tried to lure the enemy away to a place that didn't have human population or building to fight.  I was rather surprised that he didn't use that technique, but HEY, it's a movie - most of it was CG.  In the end the way that he killed Zod, I didn't buy it.  All that fighting, punching, slamming, etc and he simply snaps his neck?  First he should not have been able to snap his neck - Zod's skeletal structure should have withstood it.

But did it upset me to see Superman kill, yes and no.  Some reviews have said that Superman has always been held up as the ultimate Boy Scout and that is true.  He has always kept in mind that his strength is much greater than those of us on earth and never killed a human enemy.  But in the case of Zod, he wasn't human, so I pretty much look at it like this - All Bets Were Off.  The only way to stop Zod and his people were to kill them, because their genetics would have driven them to continue their efforts and there would have never been peace.

I do highly recommend this movie.  If you pay close attention it might give you some things to think about after the fact.  Or you can just enjoy it for what it is.",1399334400,,5209,4.14556331006979

5780903,1,B00D91GRA4,"I thought this movie was awful. It's nothing like Superman should be. Grim, cheerless, joyless, humorless, depressing, and boring. Are those the words that should come to mind when someone thinks ""Superman""?

Probably the biggest problem here is Superman's motivation. Here we have a Superman motivated by childhood trauma. Where in all other incarnations, Superman is motivated by a sense of personal responsibility and his own goodness, instilled in him by both his earthly and other-earthly fathers. Having a Superman motivated by personal confusion, fear, and pain just doesn't work.

There's no joy in this movie. No love. Everyone in it is so serious at all times, if anyone dares crack a smile, it seems forced and out of place.

The father relationships in this movie are off, big time. The Kryptonian father has nothing to do with his son at all. Only pops up in the middle to answer a question or two, that's it. His earthly father spends all his time obsessing over making Clark feel so worried about his own powers that he shouldn't DARE use them to help humanity. The whole thing is just weird!

People in this movie don't act the way real people would. When little Clark saves his classmates, instead of their parents saying ""thanks""! and thanking God for the miracle, they just get all spooked and serious. (Oh that's right I forgot, because in this movie anytime something interesting happens, it's time to double down on the seriousness...) Give me a break.

Another big problem in this movie is there is no chemistry between the leads. When Supes is in prison and Lois Lane is interviewing, they both start getting all smiley and making googly eyes at each other. I'm sorry, but this just does not work. It seems forced and phony. It's there just because the plot dictates that the two are supposed to be together. But the problem is, this idea works against the character of the new Superman they created. By changing the backstory, they've made a Superman who has no business caring about or loving anyone. This is a Superman who is so self-absorbed, so wrapped up in his own childhood trauma, that he couldn't possibly step out of that for a few seconds and smile.

I hated the muddled plot in this movie. It made no sense whatsoever. Kryptonian genetics? An argument over eugenics? What is all this nonsense? The core problem of Krypton is its imminent destruction - not stem cell research!

No natural births on Krypton... Oh-kay. And Superman is the only one in years. Why? Because his body holds ""the codex"" that's supposed to... I don't know. Allow him to repopulate a new Krypton later after he assembles a harem of 1,000 willing females? The whole thing is just goofy.

(And speaking of the ""Codex"", is that kind of like the ""All Spark""? Are we watching a Transformers movie here or what?)

Everything about this new Superman was bizarre and wrong. Ironic, since he has an enemy in the comics called ""Bizarro"". I guess if they made a Bizarro version of the Superman in this movie it would be a Superman we could actually like.

It is strange to think that I can look back on ""Superman Returns"" and say with no hesitation that that was a far better movie than this one. That movie wasn't perfect or even great by any means. But it had heart. At least that Superman cared about others. When Bryan Singer made that movie, he didn't get so wrapped up in the special effects that he forgot to give it a soul.

For me, the biggest indightment against ""Man of Steel"" it is that it is NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY. Grim and grisly are not words that should come to mind when I think of Superman. Yet here we have young Clark terrified as he sees the skulls of his teacher and classmates. An older one letting his father DIE because... well, who knows really? To add to the drama, I suppose. And we see a Superman sinking into a field of skulls. How to explain THAT one to your kids?

I hated this movie. It disgusted me. It had awesome special effects, sure. But it had no heart and soul. It was a Superman Parody, a generic product for the masses driven by egotism and greed. Grade: F.",1399248000,6,4097,4.597260273972603

5780906,5,B00D91GRA4,"When it comes to the man of steel, I think the real problem is what generation of superman you like, versus whither or not man of steel isn't any good.

First off: To the 1930s or Chris Reeves superman fans out there. Granted I loved the first superman film, and being familiar with his mythology in comics, that version of Superman was at best, very whimsical, light hearted. This is all great and wonderful about that version of Superman. But that generation of Superman hasn't existed for over 30+ years in the comics.

For folks like myself who grew up reading 80's+ comics, you all know the books have taken a more somber and serious look at Superman over the years, to even in the point where he (spoiler) Killed when he had absolutely no other choice in the books, plus many times has fought in cities and destruction arises ( DoomsdayVsSuperman for example).

So to squash the argument, I think Man of Steel is a film more for folks who know the more recent version of Superman.

With that said, Man of Steel is more of an action packed sci-fi film it's played on that level, more so than a children's film like the 70""s Superman. In addition to the scifi elements I love the fact that they humanized Superman, shown his growing pains with his powers, being an orphan and being an outsider at a young age, and finally find himself as an adult.
This movie is more of an origin film than anything else, we also see what would happen if a real life superhuman existed in real life and how would the world react.

Like an earlier reviewer had mentioned, this is film is not so much of a superhero movie, and that's a damn good thing!

5780908,4,B00D91GRA4,"Man of Steel, yet another version of the legend, is familiar - yet different, however, in an entertaining way. From a personal viewpoint - introduced to Superman in comic books, on radio, in two comical Columbia Pictures serials, on TV - the standout remains the late 80's mega-budget Christopher Reeve version. That film managed to push all the right buttons to satisfy any film fan. Man of Steel's initial look at an adult Clark Kent casts him not as the mild mannered reporter in glasses but more as The Fugitive. It also made an ancient Superman joke to mind; if Superman grew a beard, what on earth would be sharp enough to shave it off? That aside, I admit - as an action fan, enjoying the multiplicity of spectacular events. Disc two offers unusually satisfying behind the scenes special features.",1399075200,,804,4.75

Also the concept of natural bigotry against someone with whom they have never seen before and has abilities that no one else has brings out our dark side. This story also brings out how superman had to go through many of his own personal dilemmas and make very hard choices.  Well written, directed and starred. Everything flowed together in the weaving of the tale, which again was not the way it was originally written, but definitely was still true to the basics of the original story so it did not alienate the ones who grew up a long time ago with the first Man of Steel.",1398988800,,977,4.582857142857143

In this reboot of possibly the most famous superhero of all time, Henry Cavill dons the new and improved steel blue suit with the large S inscribed on the chest, with the long red cape and boots. Many of you probably have not heard of Cavill, but you will absolutely know who he is after you watch this fantastic film. One of the most beautiful and talented actress, Amy Adams, plays as Lois Lane and she fits the role perfectly. Michael Shannon plays as General Zod, the main villain in the film, and he portrays Zod as the true warrior that he really is. The casting just keeps on getting better and better after this as well. With Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane and Laurence Fishburne also among the cast, you truly expect one hell of a performance from everyone and that is exactly what they give in Man of Steel.
What to expect when watching this film? Well, for starters, a detailed story about Supermans home planet Krypton, which plays a huge role throughout the entire movie, continuous action sequences that will definitely be an attention grabber, the fantastic work done from director Zach Snyder and a little help from a producer that most of you have heard of in Christopher Nolan (Batman Trilogy anyone?) and just a storyline that, for the most, stays true to the origins of Superman.

5780930,4,B00D91GRA4,"In order to enjoy this movie, you have to do two things.  First, you have to realize that the original Richard Donner Superman starring Christopher Reeve will be the penultimate Superman movie and nothing will surpass it.  For it's time, it captured the essence of Superman perfectly.  Second, you have to realize that the world of Superman in the comic book realm has changed; it is a darker world now and not the one portrayed in Donner's movie.  There is no sharp contrast between good and evil, there are blurred lines in this ""New World"".  The Donner movie of 1977 would be completely out of context in the 2013 world of DC Comics.

I really enjoyed this for a few reasons, not the least of which is that it followed the same mood and context of what was initiated in Batman Begins.  I think this movie takes some knocks because it doesn't have the comedy that Gene Hackman presented so brilliantly in the original.  This is a fairly dark and serious movie.

5780932,1,B00D91GRA4,"And I say I wasted 1.5 hours because that's all of the movie I could sit through. I didn't even bother getting to the end. The worst thing is that this movie had a roster of great actors (Michael Shannon, Amy Adams, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Russell Crowe, Chris Meloni, Lawrence Fishburn) but couldn't do anything with them. Their talents were wasted in this flick. The script was poor and the storyline didn't make sense. Did anyone who produced this movie read the Superman comic books? One of the main parts of the original comic that makes Superman fascinating is the fact that no one knows who Superman is, particularly Lois Lane. The Clark Kent alter ego makes the story interesting. Instead they make Clark out to be some drifter with no purpose in life. What nonsense!!

Also, what made the original Superman movie (and other big budget films of the 70s like Star Wars and Close Encounters) was that less is actually more. Its time for Hollywood to get off its CGI addiction and get back to simple, down to earth special effects. Back then, the production effort was spent on characters, storyline and special effects. These days its all about the visual graphics and not about the story. Its a direction for disaster. Its why low budget films like The Kings Speech make $100M and run away with Oscars and Man of Steel lays a fat egg at the box office and burns a hole in the movie studio's wallet.",1398384000,28,1408,4.587301587301587

5780935,5,B00D91GRA4,"Surely by now you have seen Man of Steel, and have already developed your opinions on it. Henry Cavill truly provides an excellent portrayal of Clark Kent/Superman and hopefully is permitted to remain in the character until the conclusion of the much anticipated, although unannounced, Justice League. The bonus features explain what it took to get his body transformed to the chiseled physique witnessed in and out of uniform, as well as the changing that took place mentally that literally caused him to take on the persona. Such characters as Superman come with a lot of weight due to the portrayal left former actors that have become iconic, and in this instance it is none other than Christopher Reeves, who acted so superbly and therefore his movies have become seared in the minds of us who are old enough to draw from that experience. I do not know if Cavill can ever hope to top the legacy Christopher Reeves left with the way he owned the character, and that may not be his aim. But nonetheless he knows this is the expectation; at the very least to come close to the pinnacle even if he does not stand atop of it. That will be cool, too because he now stands in a very exclusive club of men who have donned the blue and red. That aspect alone is something to share with family & friends and treasure for the rest of his life. The supporting cast molded together nicely, and even with the Man of Steel having to kill General Zod rather than banishing him to the Phantom Zone as done previously, was shocking but clearly showed that struggle anyone can and could face when there is no other option. So if you are reading this and have not watched it, know that will be money well spent.",1398297600,,1695,4.5064935064935066

Since I am not a purist from comic book days, I found myself really enjoying the background story, from the scenes on Krypton, to the
coming of Kal-El (later Clark) to Earth as a boy and later a teenager as a ""son"" to Kevin Costner.  I wish these scenes were longer and
more in depth, as they really captured my interest.  But at about 80 minutes in, when General Zod reappears to battle Superman, the film
went totally wrong.  Way too much CGI in super fast motion and endless cliched destruction, which went on for nearly 50 minutes.  This
reminded me of ""Avatar,"" which was extremely involving and original, until it degenerated into a long, dull, predictable CGI battle which
resembled a Transformer movie, best aimed at 10-12 year old boys.  Still worth 3 stars due to the original and involving set up and

I kept seeing signs that the makers of this flick had actually read more than an origin issue of the comic.  The Krypton robots reminded me of the bots in the comic.  The mass destruction of Smallville and Metropolis ...  that kind of destruction happened in the comics frequently.  So frequently that the fact governments couldn't afford to rebuild was actually mentioned in the books.  It was a high action flick and that was very reminiscent of some of my favorite issues.  Even that final scene with Superman and Zod reminded me of a Superman story I read back in the 80s.

The only thing I had an issue with was Jonathan Kent entertaining the idea that it might have been better to let a busload of children die.  I could see what they were trying to do but that though just clanged in my head as wrong.  Other than that it was a nice modern take on the story.  The military was a little smarter than we generally see in the movies (the ridiculous reluctance to recognize a friend)  though they did continue to shoot after ample evidence that the Kryptonian armor was even being scratched.  :-)

Henry Cavil was a great Superman, Michael Shannon was a fantastic General Zod, and the rest of the cast was good.  The only casting I didn't like was Amy Adams as Lois Lane, I don't see her as Lois at all.

The plot was great, the action was the BEST action fight scenes I've ever seen in a film, the character development was great and it had the same level of depth that the Nolan Batman films had.  It had a few plot holes, but made up for it easily.  Definitely the best super hero film of 2013, much better than Ironman 3, Thor 2, and The Wolverine.",1397347200,,657,4.1015625
5780966,5,B00D91GRA4,"I bought this a long time ago because I am a fan of Superman and I did like the Christopher Reeves remakes of the old legends. This one was different perhaps because it was updated. As a young man he faced a great many obstacles knowing he was different but having to hide what and who he was. The flashbacks were done very well as his youth and young adult life is explained as tragedy overtakes his family and while he can do something about it, he cannot for fear of revealing his powers. He wanders across the country going from job to job, helping in one disaster after another then disappearing. Enter Lois Lane, intrepid and determined reporter who finds herself in mystery she is determined to solve. And solve she does but Perry White refuses to go with her story. She finds a way. Unfortunately the consequences are devastating not only to Clark's family but to Earth as a threat from Krypton arrives. Once again, more insight, better explanations of a world and culture long dead make it a far superior storyline. And when General Zod comes calling, it is anything but the antiseptic battle of the old Superman as Metropolis is under siege and while it is carefully edited to show no real bloodshed, falling building, explosions and upheaval as well as destroyed jets and downed copters tell us there are a great many casualties. Worth the wait to see it and would see it again. Great cast!",1397260800,,1401,4.585657370517929

Superman is too shallow in this movie and has absolutely no layers as Clark Kent or Superman. If the writers would focus more of their scripts on a contemporary version of what Clark Kent should be: a complex hero who has to deal with a mostly ungrateful humanity in this very unforgiving and cynical world (he should at least have twitter account) then an even more complex and interesting version of Superman can and should emerge and hopefully an entertaining movie that you talk about after you leave the theater instead of why you spent twelve dollars to see this movie and even more on stale and overpriced popcorn.",1397260800,6,1113,4.54228855721393

A serious, well handled script, with none of the camp or self-conscience humor that spoiled the previous adaptations. A solid cast and direction. Excitement, pathos, large and small scenes balanced well, and relationships development naturally out of the story situations.

I cannot wait for the sequel.

NOTE: There are those who have major complaints about two things that Supes does in this film that they believe break Superman ""canon"", but I would point out that this is NOT a film about Superman. This is a film about Clark Kent BECOMING Superman. He is not yet the wise, all knowing, seasoned Boy Scout icon that has been ingrained into everyone's minds today (whether they have ever read or watched a Superman comic, movie, or TV episode or not). This is Superman at the very beginning of his life as a ""superhero""; untrained, unsure, and all to ""human"".

5780972,1,B00D91GRA4,"I don't know where to start with this. I guess i will preface this by saying i loved the 1980's Superman movies alot. The first 2 for sure. They were funny, full of action, thoughtful and had a really great kick of comedy. That being said; this movie is pure garbage. On every level. I say this too as someone who saw it in the IMAX theaters when it was released and at home on a 3D tv. I gave it every chance. The funny thing is that's the exact reason why this movie is garbage;  The efx. Its obvious the director was obsessed with throwing efx in your face from all different angles, all with the apparent goal of distracting the audience from the story. So they were impressive, but what about the story ? U had little pods popping up and fighting with people, flashbacks that could happen at any given moment that had nothing to do with the story. In the 1980's version there was an arc ! Superman withdrew from public eye and his enemies came after him and there was a magnificent battle ! Beyond all that, Superman protected the ppl !! *Spoiler alter* virtually the whole planet dies in this movie. How would the real Superman ever let that happen ??? What you are looking at with this movie is basically an attempt to suck off on the success of the dark knight series. Sadly, Superman was an upbeat hero not a confused and tortured soul. What boggles my mind is that throughout the entire filming process, no one thought to stop the Director and say ""hey Snyder you are making a really horrific film, maybe you should go back to the drawing board and re do this whole thing"" ? It was that bad. In my honest opinion, this guy should have his director's license (i know there isn't one) revoked and he should not be allowed to make any more movies after disgracing the Superman legacy like this. To anyone who thinks Bryan Singer's movie is no better you are crazy. That movie was average but at least it had some style, some clear nods to the original and a story that had a flow to it.

It made me feel for some of the characters, which is uncommon in most high-action/high-effects-budget movies nowadays.  It would be nearly impossible to retell the Superman myth with much originality but they added enough interesting backstory and character development to make it fresh.

Not as good as I hoped: I suppose I should try and get d Blu-Ray if I. Wanted even more special effects & features.
Man of Steel the movie is a bit all over the place. Zod a soldier, Jor-El a scientist; there's no scenario in which the geek beats the jarhead in hand-to-hand smack down. Then the general has to kill him like a coward? Seriously?
Lois knows who Clark is from the get-go - way to ruin the fun. Personally, I think that was taking the easy way out. Clark didn't date Lana & he & Pete weren't childhood friends?
Of course, the romance was forced & needless & could have waited till part II. And then, Supes learns to fly in 2 mins flat... It would have been sweeter if he had picked that one up in desperation while fighting Zod... & call me traditional, but I always loved the red panties.

There should have been another 5 to 10 minutes spent on Clark in the second act trying to discover who he is, and interacting with his dad played by Kevin Costner. They could take a few minutes out of the third act to help keep the run time down, I would start with the world engine for a little cutting here and there. More than anything, Man of Steel sets us up for Man of Steel 2 which could be a really great film like ""The Dark Knight Rises"" was to ""Batman Begins"".",1396828800,2,694,4.072992700729927
5780985,4,B00D91GRA4,"I watched ""The Amazing Spider Man"" awhile back, and I found it neither amazing nor about a man.  And forget about the spider even.  I really thought that that film was a huge misfire, and for the life of me I couldn't figure out why they rebooted that series.  Oh, that's right; I know why.  They just wanted to trap more of your money in a web of lies.  For the second time.  At any rate, my title for that review was ""Boot the Reboot,"" which to me usually holds.

But this series is different.  First of all, the ""original"" with Christopher Reeves -- there were surely Superman films before that -- was made over 30 years ago.  Naturally, special effects have vastly improved over that time frame, while in the Spiderman series, the films were made so close together in time that those effects didn't improve much.  And times have surely changed; we're not really fighting the Russians nowadays (or perhaps we still are?)  So I'm not sure that the subject matter of the Reeves films necessarily fit into the Zeitgeist of our day.

But most importantly, I believe that Henry Cavill is a huge improvement over Mr. Reeves.  Yes, I know that the latter died tragically quite a few years ago, and yes, I know that the first sentence of this paragraph will upset some people.  But the truth is the truth, and Mr. Cavill doesn't come across as being cheesy here; he seems to be a ""super man"" if you will.  And I also found the Amy Adams casting a huge upgrade too; sorry to you Margot Kidder fans out there (and I'm not really one of them).  And finally, throwing Russell Crowe into the mix always adds to the story.

Without giving away much plot, I also liked how the writers changed the story up here a bit.  The whole Clark-Kent-is-the-mild-mannered-journalist-thing is gone.  Sure, he's a little bit too much of a pacifist for my taste, but overall, you know that he will eventually come around, kick some tail and take some names.  That's what Superman does.  And I did like how they made the overall look and feel of this film darker than the original, while not taking that darkness too far.

Surprisingly, almost a five for me.  In reality, because of the genre -- I'm not really a fan to tell you the truth of superhero flicks -- I almost should go five because it's so much better than most of these films.  I'll go with a pretty big recommendation here, and I'll change my mind about the general case to boot:  maybe we shouldn't boot the reboot, after all.",1396828800,4,2464,4.4708520179372195

Here are some samples of the dialogue.  Earth authorities as they detect an alien spaceship positioned above the earth: ""I'm just speculating, but I think whoever is at the helm of that thing is preparing to make a dramatic entrance.""  Space alien from Krypton to Diane Lane: ""The craft he arrived in -- where is it?""  ""Go to hell.""  As you can see, the dialogue is stilted and amateurish and awful, the kind of stuff that makes you feel very embarrassed for the actors.

The movie is one of self-discovery of where he comes from, who he is and what he must do. Henry Cavill plays Kal-El/Clark Kent with the perfect mix of reluctance and self-doubt. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner are perfect as the loving surrogate/adoptive parents (Martha and Jonathan Kent) who know the truth and love the boy. As Clark grows and discovers his extraordinary powers, he retreats. He almost seems afraid of 'who' he is. In time, Clark Kent is told he is not of this Earth. As a young man, Clark begins a sojourn of self-discovery and flight. Eventually, he becomes a solitary force of one who helps others in dire straits. In time, an intrepid reporter,Lois Lane (Amy Adams) tracks him down. Simultaneously, an enemy, General Zod (Michael Shannon) of his father, Jor-El (Russell Crowe) comes looking for revenge and Kal-El. It is when the world is threatened and his loved ones are in peril that Clark/Kal-El embraces the mantle of protector that he becomes a hero, a symbol for the world.

I can forgive a lot in this film but there a just a few weird things that really confuse me.

A few thoughts.... Spoiler-ish....

Zod is fantastic and I almost started rooting for him in the end.

Superman's story would have worked if they had presented it in a linear story and didn't break our interest with flashbacks every two minutes.

Near the end, the terraforming machine is making everything in the area rise towards the sky, cars, buildings, water, metal, bodies.... but Lois Lane falls out of the airplane that is caught in the magnetic pull and is hurtling towards the ground and Superman has to rescue her..... why is Lois Lane heavier than an airplane?

Why was Lois Lane taken by Zod? Why did he ask for her? How did he know who she was? It is never explained! She escapes with Jor'els help before she is interrogated? Why?

What was with all the product placement in the big fight scene?? I paid to see the movie, not commercials for Sears!

There are more, horribly frustrating things but I'm going to stop here. I will add that this is the first time Krypton has been made to look so good! And it is nice to get a look at the kruptonian culture, if not to understand it (why didn't Jo'rel just rake his family and go, guys? Come on!!)

There were parts of this film I really liked and other parts that just confused me. If you're in the fence about seeing this film I encourage you to see it. It really is worth watching, at least once, if only to see what everyone is talking about and to get a good look at Krypton.",1396396800,2,1766,4.429012345679013

There seem to be similarities between the Man of Steel and the X-Men movies in the way the movie was presented. It starts in the middle, instead of the beginning.

Superman, Aquaman, and The Green Lantern were always on my reading list. It wasn't till just recently, with the advent of technicians that could build the sets e.g., Superman's Fortress of Solitude or Batman's Bat-Cave. And Computer Graphics that make any scene seem ""Super Real"". On top of this, the Costume Department have stepped up to the plate and now design costumes that are not just a leotard with a pair of BVDs worn on the outside. Anyway,"" Man of Steel"" is a really good film in all departments and I will be sorely disappointed if there aren't at least two sequels.

(Sort of been there, done that, i.e. I have seen too many of them in movies to excite me any longer). This movie had thought. Costner's ""maybe"": expressed the human condition of a today's father talking to his son about the school bus incident. It caught my attention as well as the need for Costner to die as he did. Again, it made me *think* and not be caught up in waves of sentimentality of this is not how the first Superman movie played out. I do not think a remake entails repeating the same story over and over and over again of the first movie starring Christopher Reeves and/or is needed. Just buy that 1979 made movie DVD.

5781034,4,B00D91GRA4,"This rendition of the Superman story is fresh and new. Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer's story breathes new life into this all to well known story. Gone is the crystal world of Krypton and floating ghost heads. In it's place is an intriguing take on the downfall of an ancient society and the choices and struggles of young Clark Kent to either preserve his people or those of the earth. The visual presentation of Krypton is spectacular. Hans Zimmer does the unthinkable and outshines John Williams' original Superman theme. The music is superb and perfectly conveys the inner struggles of characters and drives the plot forward. A solid 5 Stars for Story and Visual & Musical Presentation.

The only problem I have with this movie is the action. Yes, it's a super hero movie. Yes, Superman is supposed to be able to do everything he can do in the comics. But, this is a live action movie and not everything transfers well to real life situations. My main objection to this film is the excessively over the top fighting scenes. When CGI'd confrontations between individuals is required, credibility is instantly lost. This is the case as we watch CGI characters demolish their surroundings using each other as tools of destruction. These romp fests last way too long. When the ash and dust settle and you think the movie is over, on comes a 15 minute brawl the destroys half of metropolis. So much for Saving the day. 3 stars for over the top Action.

Excessive action aside, If you loved Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy and wish for more heroes without marvel's flash and camp, this is for you. A solid 4 out of 5 Stars.",1396224000,3,1635,4.693379790940766
5781035,4,B00D91GRA4,"This film has recieved a number of negative remarks, especially from the internet.  What I will state in this review is the good and the bad regarding this 2013 summer epic.

1. Henry Cavill did a fantastic job, I really liked his performance and he is worthy of the role the late Christopher Reeve made famous.

2. The action and drama, including a very different but detailed take on the planet Krypton and Superman's origins are explained in much better detail (just like Christian Bale's Batman films) then the original films.

3. The special effects and computer animation are great.

4. I did very much appriciate the inclusion of the US & Canadian Militaries in this film, especially their very active roles in fighting the villains.  The fantasy heroes are depicted fighting side by side with the real heroes of this world.

5. The plot angle involving General Zod's character is much more convincing and more complicated then the original ""Superman II's"" version with actor Terrance Stamp's classic work.

6. Superman's human parents, with Kevin Costner's appearance were also good and made the story convincing.

Now what was missing:

7. No Lex Luther character.  Lex Luther is a central character with most of the Superman stories, so why is he missing from this film entirely?

8. Where is John Williams's amazing music??  This film, even though it is different from the classic originals, needed the song at the start and at the end.

 Over all I give this film thumbs up and I cannot wait until the next film comes out.",1396137600,3,1534,4.823754789272031

5781038,2,B00D91GRA4,"Of course the graphics were amazing... I can even get behind the extreme use of flashbacks as the basic driving narrative force of the movie. But there are two major problems that more or less make a joke of the film for me: the first, and more egregious, is of course the insanely overbearing Christian club with which we are beat about the head and shoulders with from about the middle of the movie onward - not only that, but even an overt anti-evolution statement thrown in, as if the horse was not dead already. The second major problem is really two fold, and it's a problem driven by the industry: a) and I'm sure there are plenty of people who will disagree with this first point - there is way too many long, drawn-out fight scenes. They take up a pretty enormous amount of the film, and despite being very visually impressive, they become boring after the thirtieth or fortieth time someone is thrown through a building... Ultimately it feels like an apple pie, where apples are the narrative center, and CGI the sugar and butter, only they baked this pie with a single apple slice, filling the rest with only sugar and butter... this led to the second part of this problem: the story is condensed into what amounts to hollywood clichs: shallow love interest, save the day puffery, etc... My feeling is that the makers of the film really didn't have much respect for the intelligence of their audience, thinking that they prefer to be spoon fed flashy graphics, vapid narrative tropes, and noxious, populist Christian slop.

The cast being as good as it looks on paper really doesn't blow you out of the water like it should with some characters coming off as annoying probably due to the script: Overall not bad but should have been so much better.,1396137600,5,657,4.181102362204724

5781054,3,B00D91GRA4,"Henry Cavill (The Tudors) fills out the suit, and Zack Snyder (300) takes directing duties in this re-imagining of the Superman story.  Eschewing the trappings of any of the previous films, this goes back to scratch, effectively a remake of Superman 1 and 2 rolled into one.  It follows the demise of Krypton, Russell Crowe as Supe's dad sending him towards earth, and then wraps into that the story of General Zod (the always good value Michael Shannon), as a nemesis for our man of steel.
So what do we get - an origin story, which is quite well done, and a coming of age story for Superman as he grows up on earth.  This is all told in quite condensed and non-linear format, and I for one was left wanting to see a bit more of Kevin Costner and Diane Lane as the conscience of Superman, his adoptive parents.  It segues in to a final half which is a long, oh yes, really too long, series of action set pieces as Zod and Superman face off.  Frankly, it has a few endings too many, Snyder belying his love of action over substance, and the action becoming more and more devoid of thrills.  As a whole then, it's just impossible not to compare to the original, and it really does serve to remind you just how clever the structure of that first Superman movie was.  Cavill is a wonderfully brooding and intense Superman - but where is the vulnerability of Clark Kent?  There is just something missing in the beats of how Kal-El becomes Superman, the elements of him learning about what it is to be human.  The sci-fi elements might surprise you, and the colours are very muted in contrast to the primary coloured days of Christopher Reeve.  Hans Zimmer has delivered an effective score underlying the dark and serious tone - but as with the rest of the movie, it all lacks just a tad of humour which would have made it all easier to swallow.
Ultimately a reasonably well put together movie with genuinely decent effects is let down by its lack of the one thing that Superman was really all about - humanity.  Instead of gaining an understanding of humanity by looking at it through an aliens eyes, the movie spends its time trying to understand the alien looking through humanities eyes.  Still, if action, sci-fi and set-piece after set-piece are your thing, then go ahead, you'll have a blast.  For the rest of us, we will mourn the passing of the Superman we once knew.

moves fast past into a great new story

I didn't buy the 3D version, because like Mr. Nolan's Dark Knight saga, there's no need to.",1395619200,,402,4.52054794520548
5781069,5,B00D91GRA4,"This movie was much more than I expected.  Although Im a fan of comics and like most people, I love when a movie lives up to the original comic/graphic novel  I had no such expectations for Superman.  Mainly because Superman was introduced back in 1938; at 76 years old, I couldn't imagine how they would make Superman super.  I expected boring.  Aside from his super powers, his character is hokey and has become the foundation for every tired comic clich ever.  Seriously, he puts on glasses and suddenly no one recognizes him??  Thank God for the creative genius of Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan.  And to top it off, there is this delicious eye candy by the name of Henry Cavill (who also happened to be a very good actor).  Instead of hokey, they made Superman a Gentleman (which is lacking in our modern world); and it worked because seriously, if a man with the kind of powers that Superman possessed were anything but gentle hed be the ultimate nemesis.

I had first thought that Russell Crowe would have a small introductory part, but he was a huge part of the movie  which I believe is one of the reasons why this movie was intense.  Russell Crowe is a great actor and he makes any movie more memorable.  Amy Adams was wonderful as Lois Lane (she played a strong independent woman; not just someone sitting around waiting for her superman).  But my favorite was Michael Shannon as General Zod.  If you have ever seen him as Nelson on HBOs Boardwalk Empire, then you know this guy does crazy evil perfectly!

Superman, Man of Steel was dark enough to make needing a super hero believable.  This movie is incredibly entertaining, and I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed a movie with a good storyline.",1395619200,,1720,4.605263157894737

5781074,4,B00D91GRA4,"The Movie

There are a million reviews of this movie online you could go to for more in-depth reviews. That said, it's a good movie. This movie shows a Superman who is concerned with protecting people and saving lives. Throughout the movie, we see Superman do his best to help people in need.

This is an action movie, and it is wall-to-wall action. It is also very violent, PG-13 (which is is rating) level violence. The end of the movie is quite controversial for it's violence. If you want a family Superman movie, one appropriate for young children, I'd recommend the original Christopher Reeve movie or any collection of Superman: The Animated Series. Those are great for kids. But, if you have older children/teenagers. I think the level of violence is appropriate those age groups.

I saw this movie in the theaters and I really enjoyed it. The movie is only four starts for the brutal violence in the movie, plus a few minor issue that only I care about, like not having a Clark Ket at the Daily Planet until the very end.

The Physical Media and Transfer

You get three discs: one blu-ray movie, one blu-ray special features disc, and one dvd.

The transfer is great. I really enjoyed the quality on the blu-ray disc. The main movie disc also has a number of special features that I liked. One was about the design of Krypton and how they blew it up. Another was about the filming of the movie (and some really interesting stories about filming the underwater scenes). Also there was one about all the physical training that goes into making a movie like this.

The Special Features disc has two special features on it: a version of the movie that is overlaid with interviews from cast, crew, designers, pretty much everyone and cometary from said people. It's quite good and is a good substitute for the typical director's commentary.

I feel that, at the current price, the movie is worth in this format.

Digital Copy/UltraViolet

If you are already plugged in and invested in iTunes, then UltraViolet isn't for you. It's a competing standard that has its good points, but for anyone who already has a large collection in iTunes, the hassle probably isn't worth it.

UltraViolet is a DRM standard where you can download or stream a movie from a variety of content providers. When you redeem the code, you can do so from Flixter, Vudu, or some other service. I used Flixter to redeem the code. With Flixster, you can stream the movie to your computer from the website. (It uses Adobe Flash to stream.) Or, you can download the movie to your computer. Fairly straight forward. There is also a Flixster app for both iOS and Android.

The Flixster app doesn't get good reviews on iOS. I've used the app to watch this movie on my iPad and I liked it.

The Flixster app on Android however, is highly rated. I watched this on Android phone and it worked just as well as it did on my iPad.

The nice thing about UltraViolet, however, is that you're not tied to one app or service. I signed up to VUDU after redeeming the movie on Flixster and I was able to associate my UltraViolet copy with VUDU no problem. Like Flixster, you can stream or download a copy.

Note that when you download or stream an UltraViolet movie, you can choose between standard definition or high definition. You have access to both formats as long as you own the movie.

People often say that no one buys a blu-ray or dvd for the digital copy. But I know this isn't true. I think that the UltraViolet system is a great system for owning streaming/downloadable media. Particularly since you have a choice between services. I do prefer iTunes, for a variety of reasons that have nothing to do with this review, but it certainly has it's advantages.",1395532800,2,3725,4.59577677224736
5781075,4,B00D91GRA4,"Basically combines the story of the original Christopher Reeve Supermans I and II, but without Lex Luthor.

My only complaints were with the first 1 minute, and some of the fighting/action sequences went a bit long. Overblown action is usually a big issue with me,  but they managed to keep it throttled enough that I won't fault them for it. Could stand a slight trim... but all in all, a fun and interesting new take.

The best part is that the film's hero isn't constrained by the cliche character development that plagues so many of his human counterparts. Superman is a guardian angel, a divine being, goodness incarnate. His problems are extrinsic, not intrinsic, and not bound by human frailty, and because he himself is more than human, his story seems far greater, and the film feels strongly significant.

It was nice to see his mother- Diane Lane as an individual and Kevin Costner was moving as his adoptive father.

With that said, I think the 3D aspect of this film was done terribly. I usually vet my 3D titles pretty thoroughly prior to buying them and wouldn't averagely just go out and purchase one on a whim. Alas, I did this with Man of Steel, figuring that it's pretty much the ideal movie for this medium. Boy, was I wrong! My feelings on each aspect of the film are as follows:

Audio: 5/5
This is one of the best parts of this film. I was thoroughly entertained as every aspect of the film was tied extremely well to sounds that surrounded you. The use of LFE, the surround speakers, and the score itself were all exceptionally fun to listen to and well implemented.

3D: 1/5
This was depressing. Just watch the 2D version and save yourself some money. The best 3D that you'll see throughout the entire movie is the title screen. This was a movie that was very obviously rushed or not geared towards 3D during the filming, and it shows. Most of the movie has a fatigued graininess to it that does not convert appropriately to a 3D setting. 3D requires sharp clean lines, Snyder went with an aged look for the filming method when scenes in the past are taking place and much of what would have added depth to a scene was intentionally made blurry for a 2D rendition. Simply put, I felt like I was watching a 2D movie with the 3D glasses on, and it took away from the experience. If I had watched it in 2D I'm fairly certain that the visuals would have been much better than what I got with 3D.

Regarding the 3D: I do not only look for and gauge the 3D quality by the gimicky pop outs, but take depth into consideration. There are a few scenes in this movie that the 3D does benefit the movie, but they are few, far between, and insignificant to the bigger picture. Post conversion films are hit or miss when it comes to the quality of the conversion. This one was simply a miss.

2D Version ?/5
I will update this review once I have a chance to sit down for two hours to watch the 2D version of this film.

Movie: 4/5
A very enjoyable reboot of a series that has seen hard times. While this particular film seems to be hit or miss with a lot of people, I think that it sets the groundwork for future films that required a pretty solid base. I enjoyed how Snyder developed Superman's character and how he represented his ties to humanity, etc. I think the next (superman standalone) movie has a lot of potential.",1395014400,,2568,4.308488612836439

5781125,1,B00D91GRA4,"This has got to be the hands down worse Superman movie I have ever seen, the one with Richard Pryer was better than this one.

I am a Russell Crowe fan but I did not even think he did a very good job playing Jor-El the paternal Kryptonian father of Kal-El A.K.A. Clark Kent A.K.A. Superman though he was the best of the cast.

 Kevin Costner did a decent job as Clark Kent's Earthling father Jonathan Kent and at certain parts I could almost see John Schnider's portrayal of Johnathan Kent from Smallville. There were just certain things in the facial expressions and the way the lines were delivered that I could see the way John Schneider played the part.

Amy Adams portrayal of Lois Lane was less than impressive to be perfectly honest.

Henry Cavill's portrayal of Clark Kent / Kal-El has to be the absolute worst Clark Kent/Kal-El I have ever seen in my 44 years on this planet. I hope I never see this guy in anything else again.

The Portrayal of Zod by Michael Shannon was one of the better roles.

The other problem I had with this movie is it was not very well told and seems confused at parts and also there was way more special effects than there was acting. I understand trying to keep a plot moving and suspenseful, but when you have to do that with Special Effects only and do not use the story and acting to do the same you ALWAYS wind up with a very poor movie.

To some it up I had the choice to rent the movie for $6.99 or buy it for $10.00 and I bought it and wish I had never even considered doing either. I will be swapping this for a extra copy of The Avengers with a friend that has not seen this, I don't even want this film in my collection.",1394841600,8,1668,4.190625

Yes, there is a different set of special effects - but since we know that it all comes from a computer, and isn't much better than a video game...why would we want to see this again.  Indeed, most of the film was special effects loosely tied together with the Krypton, Kal-El comic mythology - and if those effects had been cut down by 75%, the story would have lost nothing.  Theater owners may have liked the longer format because it allows for more popcorn and drink buying...but if you see it, do so on your big screen TV and be prepared to fast forward through the destruction of hundreds of building in NYC and repeated scenes of the military trying to kill clearly invincible forces with machine guns and even a pistol.

5781136,5,B00D91GRA4,"I have been a Superman fan for as long as I can remember, reading just about every comic/ graphic novel, and seeing every cartoon or movie about Superman (or any DC Comic character). I have to say Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan have done the Man of Steel perfectly. The new way of looking at Superman they have given us is a great adaptation and addition to his story. The way the movie was shot is amazing, the way they incorporate flash backs to help us understand the back story in a fast and detailed way is miraculous. Some will say this movie was horrible in the way that the story is or how Superman is portrayed, but you have to keep in mind that several dozen writers across the decades have written countless stories and their own adaptations of the Krytponian hero, and this is no exception. Zack Snyder made Man of Steel his own version of Superman, while still sticking to the basic story of him.
If you are a fan of the Dark Knight Trilogy then definitely pick this up! Obviously the same staff and company made Man of Steel, and the artistic style and storylines are similar. In my book, this is the best Superman movie out there, even the Chris Reeves ones. Henry Cavill brings a great acting style and new life to Superman that is very welcomed. The only downfall to this movie is the fact that it was a slow start (even though I thoroughly enjoyed this, many may not) then a huge fight for the last third of the movie. This was an origin story for the trilogy, so it was understandable to shoot it this way. Watch this movie before the next one comes out, which will include, Lex, Batman, Wonder Woman and another awesome story!",1394668800,,1649,4.409836065573771

5781139,4,B00D91GRA4,"The ""Man of Steel"" is like only the movie magic of today can produce.  To me Christopher Reeve is the movie Superman.  Alas, those movies were charming, spectacular for the day, yet wearisome as more stories were added to the series.  Gladly they have been surpassed by the latest version. The Man of Steel is nothing short of breath taking when it comes to the special effects.  Just like the latest Spiderman movie you really get a sense of what it would be like as the character.  Like a lot of movies today, the movie is a little long winded at times.  Of course you have to set the story line, but lets not dwell on it.  After all it is basically the same boy to man growing up in Kansas story from other versions.  The producers did add a twist to this one.  We get to watch Clark wander around, doing different jobs and doing 'super' things in his spare time.  Even coming through flames, shirtless, to save oil rigger workers at sea.

My advice is to ignore the negative reviews and give this movie a chance.

If you are a fan of superhero movies (or just fan of good science fiction) this one won't let you down.

I think the level of detail and the interpretations will make this movie withstand the test of time and will become a classic.",1394236800,,618,4.339130434782609

Henry Cavill does a fantastic portrayal of an alien who has totally embraced his new home world, and when that new home is threatened by his own people, he truly defends us with(and through) all his might and HEART (I emphasize that because he does not relish defeating his own people--he actually sobs while clinging to Lois after snapping Zod's neck only as a last resort to end the war).  Hats off too to Amy Adams, for portraying the most Lady-like and compassionate Lois I have ever seen (oh yes, great reporter too), truly making herself the perfect partner at the side of the MAN OF STEEL.",1394150400,,791,4.448275862068965

5781249,2,B00D91GRA4,"First off, I have never read any reviews on ""Man of Steel"" since it was released and wanted to give it an honest chance.  I am a big fan of the Superman franchise whether it be the Christopher Reeve films, ""Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman"", Smallville and even somewhat liked Superman Returns despite its awful reviews by critics and fans alike.  The common denominator in all of those different Superman incarnations was that they all stayed true to the comics and felt authentic in their executions and portrayals.  I remembered reading IGN's preview of ""Man of Steel"" and seeing that Zack Synder wanted to make it different than the other more authentic Superman movies/series'.  While some things were okay to change[like Superman's costume] other things were simply inexcusable for me as a fan of the Superman franchise.

The whole film seems like sci-fi drama mixed with action which in the end made the whole movie pointless.  The overall pace of the movie borders on intolerable and excessive especially in numerous long running action sequences.  The first 20-30 minutes of the film was focused on Krypton's destruction, which might have been nice if it didn't look like futuristic alien homages to past sci-fi action films.  If that weren't bad enough, wait there's more!  The better part of the last hour or more is solely one big action sequence between Superman[I use that term loosely here] and the Kryptonians[mostly Zod].  This isn't the Superman II action sequence most of us remember from the Christopher Reeve films which was classic not even close!  Superman of the Reeve films was all about his sense of morality and humanity when dealing with his alien foes.  He went out of his way to save the people of Metropolis from collateral damage when the fight started getting heavy.  He flew away and drew his foes into his fortress which then allowed for a smarter fight on his turf.  Not in this movie.  There are numerous people caught in the crossfire between Superman & the Kryptonians.  It is all collateral damage and action.  No forethought is given to the ensuing fight sequence and how it affects the people of Metropolis in regards to Superman's strong morality and sense of being a protector[which super heroes do, btw].  The least of all these evils is that Superman breaks one of his cardinal no-noes and KILLS Zod.  Superman stands for all that is right and moral, yet he has to kill Zod to defeat him which is simply unacceptable as a fan of this series and pretty much crushes all the things the iconic superhero stands for.  Plus, it seems like very lazy and poor storytelling.

In the end, ""Man of Steel"" does not even come close to being anything resembling a Superman movie.  Everything from the look/feel of the film combined with Zack Synder taking all the liberties he did makes this film suck!  Take Zod for example.  In the Reeve film[s], Zod was a very likeable villain who people could love to hate.  His ""Kneel Before Zod"" is never even uttered in this film, which is bastardizing what Terence Stamp made Zod in that role.  In ""Man of Steel"" Zod is an impulsive psychopath who has no clever wit about him and doesn't come off as a real threat overall.  Which is another I hated about this movie: It is said over & over by Jor-El and others that Superman will defeat Zod, with no surprise in how it ends aside from the fact that Superman takes a life to save more.  Some of the concepts in this film were risky which some might see as admirable but most die-hard fans of Superman will absolutely hate!  This comes off as being a low-rent, bad imitation of a superhero movie let alone a Superman film.  It is more Avatar/Aliens meets War of the Worlds.  It is less about Superman and how he becomes a superhero and more about changing everything that made the prior version[s] of Superman what they were.  I am glad I rented this instead of going to theaters because it is exactly what I thought it was going to be: just another horrible reboot that took away the identity of what made the original[s] so great.

5781252,3,B00D91GRA4,"Superman is a difficult icon to bring to the big screen.  That's sort of counter intuitive, since the Man of Steel is the premiere action superhero.  However, there are several hurdles that the screenwriter needed to clear, and I believe that, for the most part, he succeeded:

1.)  Which Superman? (popular media) - Everyone has their own idea of who Superman is.  In addition to the comic books, he has a long history on television, in movies, and in other merchandise and media.  Everyone can agree that he is iconic, but how is that American iconism supposed to be conveyed?  Should he be a boy scout?  Should he hearken back to the sort of gee-gosh moralism and simplicity from which he emerged in the WWII era?  David S. Goyer manages to avoid all of the hokiness and goes for a modern appeal.  (Pa Kent dies in 1997 when Clark is a teenager, so he likely arrived in Kansas in the 1980s and came to adulthood in the the 2010s.)  He is charming, but not in an outdated sort of way.  He also isn't a comedic figure as Clark Kent, as he increasingly became in the 1970s-era Superman movies.  As for his supporting cast, there is no sign of Lex Luthor or Jimmy Olsen, although we do see some lesser know characters (popularized for a wider audience in the Smallville television series) in Lana Lang and Pete Ross.

2.)  Which Superman? (comics) - He is undoubtedly a post-Crisis Man of Steel.  Goyer could have went for a Morrison-esque, All-Star Superman vibe, but he wisely goes for a less flamboyant Superman.  He isn't super-intelligent, and his powers are well defined, even though they are never spelled out in the movie.  This is a huge positive.  The viewing audience learns about Clark's powers experientially as they develop.  The only modern iteration of his powers we fail to see is his super-breath, which I don't recall him using.  It was also interesting to see which iteration of Krypton Goyer used.  Of course, he blended several versions, with director Snyder taking some visual cues from pre-Crisis Krypton and the more recent Johns era Krypton, but with modern updates.  Krypton is very dark; however, we do only get to see it in its death throes, so that's fine so far as it goes.  Also, apart from the look of Krypton, the feel of Krypton evokes John Byrne's version--sterile and loveless.

3.)  Superman is Boring - Most people don't associate Superman with deep pathos, and that goes hand in hand with viewing him as a bright, invulnerable do-gooder who never fails.  In the comics, unfortunately, this characterization is still predominant.  Goyer was very careful to avoid having Superman come off as shallow.  To be captivating, we need to be able to form an emotional connection.  Some may think that Goyer overcompensated here, making Clark too dark--even depressed/depressing--but overall he strikes the right balance, especially considering that the theme of this first film is alienation and finding your place in a complex world.  At the beginning of Clark's life, he's a tortured soul--having to keep secrets, unable to fight back, in a rocky relationship with his adoptive father--and by the end of the movie, he's still tortured, owing to the fact that he is forced to take a life.  (This was a gutsy decision by Goyer.  In this film he opts to depict Superman doing the one thing he rarely ever does--kill.  To Goyer's credit, he needed to take this route.  The movie needs to culminate in a one-on-one battle with General Zod, and by the end of it, there can only be one Kryptonian left on Earth.  Also, there is precedent for this in the comic books; the post-Crisis Superman similarly kills Zod and agonizes over it.)  Despite the stark realism and dark camera work (which Snyder is known for), for the larger part of the movie Superman can actually be fun (without being corny).  Deftly, Goyer has the character of Lois bring this side of him to the fore.

4.)  Everyone Already Knows This Story - This is true.  Cleverly, Goyer undermines this by throwing in curve balls.  The first part of the movie spends a great deal of time on Krypton, a place the casual audience may not be very familiar with from the previous films.  The story also isn't linear.  It proceeds this way:  Krypon->Adult Clark Finding Himself->Flashbacks to Childhood->Present->Flashbacks to Krypton->Present.  This keeps the viewer feeling fresh and challenged.  The groundwork for the present plot is actually laid out in the Krypton scenes, where Kal-El isn't the focus at all.  (Jor-El, played by Russell Crowe, is the focus.  And he is brilliant.)  The issue could be raised that we've already seen the General Zod plotline in the 1970s Superman films and that it's now time for some new villains.  That may be true, but here the choice of the Kryptonian adversary is thematically mandated.  This film seeks to dissect Superman as man and alien, so the threat of Krypton must be felt.  If he wanted to be daring, Goyer could have opted to use the Eradicator as the Kryptonian villain rather than Zod, but plot-wise, having the villain try to terraform Earth in the image of Krypton atop the bones of humanity was the only way to go.  And it was a smart move to keep Luthor out of it altogether.",1393545600,2,5214,4.747216035634744
5781253,5,B00D91GRA4,This movie is alright but it shifts from Clark's childhood and events of his adulthood which makes it hard to keep up with the storyline at first.  The only discrepancy is that in the movie Lois knows his secret throughout the whole movie and that does not happen in any other TV show or movie made for Superman.,1393545600,,312,4.379310344827586
5781254,3,B00D91GRA4,"Gosh, I loved Christopher Reeve as Superman, it was who I grew up with. Then there was Superman Returns and that was...painful. Then there was Man of Steel and wow, did I really want an injection of a good Superman movie that just made you feel good about being alive.

Well this movie tried but fell short. It could have ended then could have ended again and then could have ended again and would have been a good movie. It appears the editing just failed to hit the mark and figure out a place to stop that would have been good.

This new man of steel is not my man of steel and a total waste of time and money. Many younger viewers will enjoy this new version with all its gritty realism, but to me the script is as though it was written by a high school freshman with far too many plot holes for me.

5781261,3,B00D91GRA4,"I'm seriously quite disappointed in the character development. Clark Kent seems to almost completely lack personality. We see that he HAS morals, and that he HAS feelings, but there is no real reason for the viewer to actually care for him or about what he feels, nothing to CONNECT us to him more than we would be to a random stranger down the road. Sure, we are rooting for him to succeed, but this is truly only out of this simple necessity: if he doesn't, everyone dies...
They did, however, seem to set him up for some good character development in a future movie, so I hope we get to know the person of Clark Kent some more in the future.",1393459200,,644,4.330578512396694

I'm a sucker for superheroes and great soundtracks, though, so I enjoyed this movie.

My main beef with this movie actually has more to do with Amazon--I ordered it once and downloaded it, but the computer to which I downloaded it crashed before I could watch it. So I went to go watch it from my video library only to learn that rentals disappear from existence once they've been queued for download. I understand limiting downloads to one device...but deleting the purchase altogether? If I wanted to watch it from Amazon, I would have had to purchase it all over again.

5781330,5,B00D91GRA4,"--Not that the action was understated, but that the language and delivery was gracefully understated.  It was beautiful.  This is the sort of film that one must actually watch and listen to understand.  Of course, isn't that all film?  one might ask; to which I would respond not quite.  It takes watching the expressions and listening to each word to really get the impact of this film.  Lois Lane is hungry for truth in rough places.  You see it in her face.  Clark Kent is a country boy from Kansas who is conflicted about his also being an alien from a super advanced civilization somewhere out there.  But you really feel them when you watch their faces.  Zod believes in his mission.  The colonel really has to make a decision to trust that is not less momentous than Kal's.  Speaking of trust, what about that gem-- ""Sometimes you have to take a leap of faith first. The trust part comes later.""
Throughout, the themes of free will and destiny rang true and even though the violence was high and fierce, when the film was over I was struck with the almost contemplative nature of the film.

In this movie you get a great story about how this guy became superman( ps hes not superman until the last 30 sec) and mind blowing action. I liked superman returns but now we get a superman movie that is modern. Michael Shannon as general zod is great. This is one of my favorite superhero movies right up there with the first Iron man and the dark knight trilogy. This is a movie for superman fans and casual views. I have shown this movie to 10 people and everyone of them loved it. There ages covered from 15-55. One even said how he didn't want to watch it but after he couldn't stop talking about how amazing it was.,1392768000,,672,4.2578125

5781338,4,B00D91GRA4,"Which is what I've always wanted to see since Superman '78!

Even with some stilted dialogue, I still really like this movie. At first I wasn't a big fan of how Krypton was portrayed as I've always favored the ice theme from the original but I can give Snyder and company credit for doing something new with the whole look and culture of the planet.

There are some cool 3d moments that have good depth to them, mainly the quieter scenes with large vistas or the plains of Kansas.

Why I'm giving this a 4 out of 5 is due to the extras. While there's some cool info with them, I wish they had had the entire art gallery or all of Snyder's storyboards to look at.

The most vexing extra is what amounts to an hd travel brochure for New Zealand showcasing locations where the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings series were filmed. It has nothing at all to do with Superman but I suppose it's on here because Weta Digital did a large portion of the VFX for Man of Steel and that's where they're located. Still seems out of place though.",1392681600,,1027,4.251282051282051

The beginning was interesting, but, once the 24 hour thing, it felt like they were just trying to fill in the time.

5781358,5,B00D91GRA4,"I feel like Man of Steel was a great superhero movie, sure it had some faults but easily better than the Raimi Spidey films 1,3 as well as Captain America, Thor, and various other superhero genre films. It's rare to see a film so well reviewed by the audience in contrast to the critics. I hate to say it, but the brand loyalty of Marvel films seems to give the critics a bias against DC. Sure Green Lantern wasn't special, and Catwoman was a flop and a half... I guess we just ignore the failed Hulk movies, Daredevil, and Wolverine films though? I dunno. It just seems to me that if this were a Marvel film release the critics would have been easy going on it.

The action is the best I've seen on screen. Remember he doesn't wear a mask, so to make this hero seem legit with flight and all of his powers? Awesome. Amy Adams was amazing, though I didn't want a Lana looking redheaded Lois at first. She was so good at spunky Lois :p I did not mind Perry White race being changed, the role was well taken care of by Fishburne. I hate people that complain about a race change in a movie when it doesn't affect the plot at all. Cavill looks as much like the comics coming to live as Reeve did. Also his voice sounds much like the animated series. Very convincing. All in all a solid effort and successful re-launch!",1392595200,2,1314,4.256

5781360,2,B00D91GRA4,"""Man of Steel"" is a classic example of how you can cast all the stars you want and still wind up with a dud. Two important roles, for example, Jor-El and Pa Kent might as well have been played by anyone while a lesser known actor, Shannon, steals the show as Zod. Adams and Cavill have zero chemistry here, leading you to wonder just how easy it is to get a job casting movies in Hollywood. Then there's the matter of the movie's pace; it takes an hour to get around to seeing Supes in uniform? Well, that could have worked had Clark Kent been given something to do leading up to his transformation instead of bumbling around the country giving long dramatic stares. Is there any action in this movie? Certainly; too much in fact. I say that because just punching each other around for 45 minutes kinda gets old at some point. And that's where Synder's vision of Supes fails - too much brawn and none of the brains that Reeves' Superman displayed. I still gave the movie two stars for Zod's portrayal and the swerve Supes takes in the end of this movie, but overall, this didn't blow me away. (In fact, Supes never uses that power in this movie.

There's a profound canonical error in the film: young Clark learns a life lesson about the limits of his powers when Pa Kent dies of a heart attack that he cannot fix. In the film, Pa Kent gets caught up in a tornado that Young Clark could have easily and, likely, anonymously prevented. Major faux pas, Mr. Snyder. The rest of the film is...boring? Uninspired?

5781395,5,B00D91GRA4,"I liked this movie a lot.  Yes, it was a little different take on Superman than most modern people are used to, but not so different from the original.  Right away, I would like to say this to all the people that are upset about this Superman:  This character has been around for 70+ years and has gone through many changes and additions in that time.  The original Superman could not fly, only jump really far, and certainly couldn't hover.  He was not invulnerable, just really really tough.  He wasn't strong enough to lift or punch anything, just really really strong.  Many of his other powers weren't there in the beginning. He could get tired or hurt and had to sometimes strain to do something he was trying to do.  He wasn't perfect.  He got mad and sometimes he even did the wrong thing.  The point I'm making is that a character that has been around this long doesn't stay the same.  That's a good way to  stay interesting and to explore different aspects of the character.

So, this Superman is a very good real take on him.  For those who were looking for a full blown Superman, this movie has something much more interesting, a Superman that is trying to discover what and who he is.  He wants to know what his relationship should be with his adopted world and is concerned about how they will treat him.  These are all issues that a real, human person might experience.  Christopher Reeve has always been my personal favorite for being the most like the Superman I imagined in the comics.  He also breathed a great deal of realness into the character.  The first two movies, especially are awesome Superman movies, even though the whole Krypton/Fortress of Solitude thing was completely reworked and reworked well.  The reason I mention all that is because this movie feels very related to those Christopher Reeve movies.  This Superman might be the one we would see before he was quite so sure, quite so calm, or quite so confident.  To me, its OK for our heroes (even super heroes) to be real people.

Superman stands up for himself and makes us all proud.",1392163200,,2073,4.573369565217392

5781397,2,B00D91GRA4,"First of all, this movie is many times better than ""Superman Returns"" of a few years ago.

With that said, I didn't like it. If you new to Superman (maybe for little kids) it can be entertaining, but for the rest of us who expect a decent plot, or for a movie to stick close to what the character is supposed to be about, its not good.

What is good?  The acting is pretty good.  Henry Cavill is a very good choice.

What is bad?  The action is over the top, and in a bad way.  What good are fight scenes where everything is destroyed except for the characters fighting if nothing comes out of it?  Yep, until the VERY end, Superman is in some fights where buildings are toppled over, yet after every punch and every building they are thrown through, they just keep getting back up. And this goes on for WAY too long.

The final problem is the biggest.  The way the the main confict is finally resolved is contrary to what Superman is about and his whole character.  2 hours into this reboot he does the very thing that Superman is not supposed to every do to keep him as Superman. He betrays the one thing that is charcter is more about than anything.",1392163200,9,1152,4.238532110091743

If you like big spectacle movies, with lots of action and special effects, this movie will be right up your alley.  If you are even a passive Superman fan (i.e. saw the old movies when you were a kid, and read a few of the comics and watch the animated TV shows and movies) then this movie is a little harder to love.  It just doesn't really get into what makes Superman the iconic character that we all know and like/love.  It is the 1st movie in obviously and ongoing story/universe, so there is still time for them to address a lot of those issues as the stories progress.  The Blu ray itself has a very good transfer and the audio is nice if you have a good sound system.  Amazon had this Blu ray for $10 when I picked it up, and I feel like that's a pretty decent price for this flick.

the actors trying to keep from laughing or wincing at the words they
had to say. A lot of the lines are written as if they are supposed to
be Big Pieces of Wisdom but they are anything but. Lois Lane is reduced
a damsel in distress waiting around for Stuporman (he is so DULL) to
save her. They have no chemistry. Despite the big names, there isn't
much acting in it because the special effects are supposed to keep you
occupied. I thought the CGI, and the costumes, especially on Krypton,
were laughable. What acting there is doesn't really uplift the movie
much. (I never realized just how bad an actor Kevin Costner is.) Amy
Adams comes across as a little girl trying to sound tough and grown-up.
I usually enjoy Russell Crowe but for some reason he just wasn't
convincing. The movie keeps cutting back and forth so quickly in time
and place, with no titles to guide you, that it's hard to keep up with
the plot. At the same time, the movie just drags on and on.",1392076800,,1036,4.429319371727749

They actually made some changes to the origin story, which in my opinion improved the story.

People that are complaining should just watch the 1970's Superman version again, I on the other hand welcome more depth to this iconic character on the big screen.

It's nothing like the superman series that we are used to from the past, though.  Much more similar to the other big budget superhero movies we are seeing a lot of.  Like wolverine or something.  Lots of fun special effects, lots of violence (real violence, where people die), fast paced action.

Actually comparing it to wolverine is pretty apt.  The story is a little less compelling and interesting, but still more so than most of the old superman movies.  It has a certain grittiness to it.

She knows his secret from the get-go.  This detracts from the story as Clark does not have an alter ego.

Second, Zod gets killed by Superman snapping his neck while being unable to break away from Superman's grip.  Ridiculous.

Third, Zod should have carried some Kryptonite with him from the remains of Krypton so Kryptonite could be introduced into the story.  In the real comic book story  There was no Kryptonite in the movie anywhere.

Fourth, the ""red"" on his suit was more maroon than red.  That was a totally unneeded departure from the real story.

They dropped Brandon Routh into the roll in ""Superman Returns"", 2006, trying to ignore that he wasn't the same actor from the 4 previous movies, and although I thought he actually did a fairly decent job, he was disregarded.  The revamp gives you the feel that the roll is this actor now, however right or wrong. Plus, Henry Cavill, yummy!!!  But I digress ;) ........BE SHARP HERE FOLKS , THE FOLLOWING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS.....I TRY NOT TO GIVE MUCH AWAY, BUT......... The movie starts us back on Krypton (which for some reason made me think  of  Star Trek's planet of Vulcan, not sure why), where we see his birth to Jor-El and Lara and learn the significance of this.  It flows into his travels to find himself, interspersed with flashbacks of his days with his Earth parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent, and his struggles to fit in with humans as his powers emerge.  This movie is not played for camp.  It takes us on this journey as with real life, humor where it may be found, but no over the top comedic villains here. General Zod and his cronies are deadly serious as is the solution to this infamous enemy. We end with Clark joining the Daily Planet, in his veiled disguise (as it should be, we as humans only see what we want to see, glasses are sometimes enough), with an already clued in Lois Lane (so no hide and seek with their relationship).  It was a more mature, grownup version (not to take anything away from Christopher Reeves, I loved those movies, but time and place), meaning less cartoon, which was also enjoyed by my 14 year old daughter, who can't wait for a sequel.",1391731200,,1684,4.531353135313531

This isn't Siegel and Shuster's Superman, a cipher of hope in a world where too many people are the victims of the powerful.

This is a new Superman who seems to have no interest in how many bystanders are killed, or how many buildings are destroyed, and seems to find it unnecessary to hold himself to a dictate that killing is never the answer. This is a Superman who kills. This is a Superman who kills by accident, who kills when he fights, kills when he flies, kills when he falls, and worst of all, this is a Superman who kills on purpose, by ""moral"" calculation. This is a Superman who is no super man.

Siegel and Shuster's Superman was supposed to be a superior being, a morally superior being, not just a physically superior being. The writers, studio execs, producers, of this movie, ostensibly about the DC comic book character Superman, probably decided that the post-9/11 world needed a more morally ambiguous Superman, a Superman who could fit into a Zero Dark Thirty world of black sites and private prisons. The opposite was true; the opposite remains true.

5781483,3,B00D91GRA4,"Let me get this out of the way - I enjoyed this movie. The action was incredible, the special effects were pristine, and the music was great. I really enjoyed the way this movie had more of a science fiction feel to it compared to the Christopher Reeves / Brandon Routh movies.

But there were a couple of things that really bothered me about this movie, and no, neither of them were the end of the Zod / Superman fight (Possible spoiler alerts):

1. I didn't like the way they handled Jonathan Kent's death. Seriously? He can't get away from the tornado and he holds up his hand to stop his son from saving him? I understand that he wanted to protect his son from the world, but the writers couldn't find a better way to do it?

2. In this movie, Superman's arch nemesis Zod is fought and beaten, a giant terraforming device attempts to destroy life on Earth, and half of Metropolis is destroyed from the final battle. Where are the movies supposed to go from here? How can they evolve after a movie like this? Sequels are always built to be bigger and better, but I have no idea how they can ever go bigger.

So in the end, this movie is fun to watch, but there was far too much thrown in it. I honestly feel that the reason Man of Steel 2 is now Batman vs. Superman is because the writers have no idea how to write a stand-a-lone story that can be bigger. Give this movie a rent before you buy. Some people love it, some people hate it. I stand in the middle.",1391644800,,1462,4.210714285714285

5781492,5,B00D91GRA4,"So, if you're an old school Superman fan (Christopher Reeve) this film essentially combines Superman I and II into one very well done, action packed Superman reboot.  When it comes to almost any superhero film there is always drama across the internet because you have varying factions that, when taken as a whole, never will like anything that comes out.  It's either too sanitized so it will appeal to a wider audience, or the character isn't exactly as it appeared in print, or character interactions or back story don't mesh exactly as they have before.  While I can appreciate super fans know a ton about their favorite characters, the general public (in my opinion) just doesn't care that much about the small stuff.  This is why some are frequently disappointed with what is otherwise a great movie, as is the case with the new Superman: Man of Steel.  If you are an open minded Superman fan that wants to see Supes on the big screen struggling with everything that it means to be Superman and defending humanity from the the ravages of General Zod give this film a chance.

I really like the new story line and this new perspective on how Superman came to be the great hero he is from our childhood, and even present, times.

5781511,3,B00D91GRA4,"I watched this movie with medium to low expectations. Critics weren't too impressed with it; only one person I know raved about it. It sure looked like another clunky Superman film. Many complained about the modern revision of Superman.

We've seen these characters before, but they are all given some different twists. Clark Kent/Superman is interesting in that there is no big contrast between the two. Clark spends the first half of the movie in hiding and not knowing about his Kryptonian origins. He's a drifter with no life of his own--he'll work a job until something happen that causes him to use his powers. Then he moves on so people won't know what powers he has. Even after he gets his background story and his suit, he has almost no""Clark Kent"" life. The ""mild mannered reporter"" is set up at the end of the film, so maybe in the future they will explore that duality. For this movie, he's a bit of a lost soul who finds his place on Earth.

Lois Lane is a lot smarter than in previous movies, though she does fill in the ""damsel in distress"" role. Jonathan Kent is less noble than in previous stories--he tells Clark it might be okay to let people die rather than reveal his secret (right after Clark saves a bus full of his fellow school students!). You can see how this Clark winds up drifting without a true sense of purpose or identity. General Zod is less colorful and over-the-top than Superman II's Terence Stamp, though that degradation seems driven by the ""Krypton as Plato's Republic"" theme running through the film, which no one comments on.

Several characters talk about Krypton's fall. One component of it is the genetically-engineered population. Zod explains how he was made to be a soldier and that's what he's done all his life, so Superman can't possibly beat him in a fight. Superman's Kryptonian parents decide to have a child naturally so that he will be free to do what he wants rather than be put in a distinct class all his life. Plato's Republic has a similar scheme--children are taken from their parents and raised in one of three classes to serve the state. The movie criticizes this on the grounds of personal freedom, which is interesting if not fully satisfactory.

Another component is the exploitation of resources, including Krypton's planetary core, which provided power but becomes unstable and soon explodes. The Kryptonians had tried to colonize other planets by terraforming them but were unsuccessful. Terraforming the Earth is Zod's plan to continue the Kryptonian race, even if that means killing all the humans. Superman decides to stop it since ""Krypton had its chance.""

The movie does end with a big fight between Zod and Superman which goes on long enough for viewers to get the idea that they will never really hurt each other no matter how many buildings they plow through. And then it goes on longer. The very end of the fight is a bit contrived but at least it ends things in a sensible way. It's a common problem with superhero movies that they end with a big battle that is more numbing than exciting.

The ending of the movie also injects some much needed humor. This movie could have used a little more levity sprinkled throughout. Even so, Man of Steel surprised me with how good it was. Though it gives a more somber Superman (the bad side of the modern revision), it vastly exceeds Superman III and IV and the failed reboot Superman Returns in writing quality.",1391472000,,3433,4.7038269550748755

If you like lots of action and special effects, you should like this movie; however, we found the action scenes to be ""over the top""; we thought they were overdone and lasted too long, but overall we would still recommend this movie due to the good storyline, cast, acting, and 3D production quality.",1391299200,2,708,4.515625

The special effects were amazing, Henry Cavil, was completely believable as Clark Kent, and Kevin Costner was actually pretty good as his dad. that being said, whoever wrote this plot should have been fired before they were even hired. It started out well, with Russel Crowe on Kypton, with some fantastic action scenes and effects, and unfortunately never evolved into anything. There were so many opportunities, especially after all of the other Superman movies made , for this to have been a brilliant re creation for the franchise. Pity, truly so. There have been episodes of Smallville that were written better than The Man of Steel.",1391299200,,685,5.017543859649122
5781539,3,B00D91GRA4,"So apparently there is some controversy over the Man of Steel and Superman killing General ZodBut what a minute!  Didnt Superman kill Zod way back in 1980s Superman II?  Superman uses the molecule chamber to take Zods powers away, essentially turning him human.  He crushes his hand into mush, picks him up then tosses him into a seemingly bottomless pit of ice and snow. (and don't give me any crap about the Donner Cut). Did anyone think Zod survived that? Ok so having your neck snapped like a twig might be a bit more in your face than being tossed into a ravine but dead is dead.

Seems to me Man of Steel pits long time Superman purists against modern day fans who grew up in the post mid-1980s era of The Dark Knight Returns, anti-heroes like The Punisher and Lobo, and The Death of Superman storyline.  Man of Steel is very much a Superman film for the modern age, delving far more into socially conscious subjects like bullying and individuality than the Christopher Reeve films of 1970s and 1980s which were pure comic book cheesebut good cheese.

Zack Snyder and screenwriter David S. Goyer give a new take on the planet Krypton and its destruction.  They design Supermans home world as one that is a mix of the high-tech and the primitive.  This isn't the stark, emotionless world of the Reeve films but rather one of great passion and angst.  The Kryptonians have sealed their planets fate by stripping their worlds resources and destabilizing their core.  The ruling council is overthrown by General Zod (Shannon) and the military but not before Jor-El (Crowe) can blast his newborn son off the dying planet, infusing him with the genetic codex of the entire Kryptonian race.  Zod kills Jor-El but he and his followers and captured and banished to the Phantom Zone.  However when Krypton explodes, Zod and his soldiers are freed and track Kal-El to Earth where he has now grown into an adult.

Henry Cavills Clark Kent/Superman is one who is very unsure of his place in the world.  He lives as a loner, travelling from place to place working odd jobs and saving people quietly and under the radar. He infiltrates a military operation in the artic that is investigating an ancient Kryptonian ship found in the ice.  The ships activation sends out a distress call leading Zod to Earth where he demands that Superman surrender to him.

People may still be unfamiliar with Michael Shannon but he is an incredible actor.  His portrayal of Zod is many layered.  Zod is a tragic and sympathetic figure.  Hes not motivated by a lust for power but rather the desire to see his race survive and who can argue with him for that?  Man of Steel is laden with performances that work on many levels and depth which the Reeve films often lacked.  Thats not a criticism against the Reeve films.  Those films accomplished what they set out to do in making pure comic book magic come to life.  Its just we see these familiar characters doing things we haven't seen before.  From Diane Lanes caring and vulnerable turn as Ma Kent to Lawrence Fishburnes caring portrayal of Daily Planet Editor Perry White.

The battle in Metropolis between Superman and Zod results in the kind of wholesale destruction that youd expect to see.  Snyder doesnt candy coat the resulting devastation.  Entire city blocks lie in ruin and while we don't see it, no doubt thousands had to have perished in the battle.  Its a grim picture to be sure.  But here is where Man of Steel falls somewhat short.  It doesnt feel heroic.  It lacks those rousing moments that made you cheer such as when Superman catches Lois Lane freefalling from a building or challenging Zod to step outside.  Those moments accompanied by the unforgettable score by John Williams have become the stuff of cinematic legend.  This is one time when a big hunk of comic book cheese was sorely needed.

5781552,3,B00D91GRA4,"First, I think this is the best Superman movie out there, and I've watched all of them.  I'm not a purist.  I didn't read comic books when I was a kid, and I don't have the silly notion that a remake of a movie needs to be true to ANYTHING.  Because of that I get to judge each movie on its own merit.

The one thing I never liked about other superman movies, and ESPECIALLY the old superman tv show series is the feel good aspect to it.  Now I know that the comics made Superman out to be some morally perfect being, but I never really liked that because it seemed too strange to me.  There has to be good and bad in everything for me to find something enjoyable and realistic since I've never seen anything different, because that's the way life is.  So I like the fact that this movie takes you through his journey as a boy and teenage years while he's struggling with life's challenges, the ones that every thing that speaks a language on this planet and looks like a human.  Some of the people most critical of the movie are critical for this reason, because it's too different.  OK, that's exactly why I like it so much since the other superman movies never really stirred my interest much.

The other big criticism was that it doesn't flow evenly, difficult to follow, disjointed and various other criticisms where it seems like the reviewer is studying to be a film critic and needs to pic the thing apart.  I followed the movie just fine, I didn't have a problem with it focusing on the present moment more than anything else, which means there was a lot of constant action for a while (Superman is an action movie, right?)  After all the style was flashbacks to the past, so at some point the movie has to stop flashbacks and focus on the current moment, otherwise you have a drama or some other type of movie other than an action movie.  My wife is the gauge for me on a successful movie.  She falls asleep pretty easily, and she didn't watching this movie even though it's a little long.

So as far as the content of the movie, I enjoyed this movie WAY more than any other superman movie.  Also, this is probably close to a record with how fast Amazon has over 2000 reviews on a movie, an overwhelming amount of which is 5 star.

The thing I don't like is that the production wasn't very well done as far as image quality, and overall the movie looks a little bit grainy, which is my opinion is totally unacceptable in 2013 for such a big budget movie made by a big budget production company.  Other reviewers like to use the term CGI. I don't care if it's CGI or a real image of a cow.  In 2013 the capability to make a movie with fantastic picture quality is no longer new, and even the picture quality of the people, who are not CGI, looks grainy.

If Warner Bros. does this again I won't buy anymore of their movies.  I dislike the quality that much.  It's not like War of the Worlds (2000s version with Tom Cruise which I can't even watch because the picture is so bad) bad, but even when I watched it in the theatre it seemed grainy.  I guess that should have been my clue to NOT buy it.",1391212800,,3105,4.261092150170649

One thing to beware of--if you're buying this for someone who is a major Superman fan, be careful.  My boyfriend loves all things Superman.  Which is why he hates how this movie was done.  It has a lot of inaccuracies that do not match up with the comics and graphic novels.  It's not just little discrepancies either, there are noticeable differences in the story line.  That being said, he does appreciate it as action film.  It was a good movie, just not particularly accurate.

The goofy planet Krypton bits - the bad acting - the thin plot - none of it gels and you spend the last half hour of the movie watching a big CGI fight.  I'm not saying CGI is bad.  I'm saying making a fight between 2 humanoids all CGI is tough to do while still making it believeable.  I hate this movie so much.",1391126400,5,463,3.8210526315789473

The director and writers do so many things right - Krypton, casting Henry Cavill - that it is a bit of a downer to see the elements I refer to drag the proceedings down. Still, it is entertaining and if you are judicious with the fast-forward button, there is plenty of eye candy here to thrill your young son who LOVES Superman.",1391040000,,496,4.344086021505376

It also covered the villain Zod and his motives for wanting to destroy Kal-el. The relationship between kal-el and ma and Pa Kent could have gone deeper, and the death of Pa Kent was pretty dramatic. The special effects in this movie were awesome! Also, his relationship with Lois Lane had a new twist, as he knew her before he became Clark Kent. The story was very well done and the action sequences were superb.

There is no mythology of Superman mix-up, or nit pick detail that could possibly take away from how awesome this movie was. Hands down some of the best, if not the best action sequences I've ever seen in a movie. The battles are gorgeous and stunningly epic in scope, I'll watch it again soon and I virtually never watch a movie again right away. Don't let the haters talk you out of watching this movie, watch it for yourself, you'll have a blast! It's definitely one of my favorite comic adaptations ever, but I think it stands wonderfully on its own as an origin movie. I'll give you that its heavy on the action, but I really don't mind when the action is done this well. Loved it!

5781602,3,B00D91GRA4,"Man of Steel is an okay film, but I definitely would not let younger children watch it.  Once you get past the beginning scenes which set the stage, the plot is initially a little hard to follow.  And although the flashback idea was well done, the violence is unending and relentless, especially as the film progresses.  It becomes tiresome to watch.  How many buildings can Superman get knocked through anyway? The type of violence is repetitive and unrealistic.  There are no surprises, no strategies, no Kryptonite, no plotting, just angry take over the world violence that seems more like an unending bar fight full of punches, kicks, and hair pulling, which ends very unrealistically and anticlimactically.  If I got beat up by take over the world villains the way Superman does, I would not hesitate or have any kind of 'moral dilemma' the way Clark does at the end in killing the enemy in order to save the world or the people in it.  Lois Lane's character, although well done, seems a little over the top in the bravery category.  She's too manly for my tastes.  They don't need to turn her into a wimp, but she still needs to show some feminine qualities, which she lacks.  Superman is a little too under confident throughout most of the film, relying solely on what his earthly father says and showing virtually no interaction between him and his mother in the beginning.  The power struggle between Lois and Superman is dominated by Lois throughout most of the film, which is very unattractive for her.  On the other hand, Superman's mother(s), both of them, are portrayed as strong yet feminine.  They are tough, brave women without having to be man-like, how Lois is portrayed.  There are some good 'life lesson' analogies you can take from this movie, but overall, I would not see it again.",1390867200,,1804,4.740384615384615

I hope you enjoy the action as much as I did and this is great for most teens up, serious amount of action violence, not disgusting like most movies so use your own judgement and as always watch it first before letting little children see this film, though should be fine for most kids of today.

That 's because after fifteen minutes of watching great stupid rubbery creatures flap around and the worst acting this side of a San Francisco porno studio. I felt my brain melting inside my cranium and my eyeballs ready to burst and knew I was approaching a state of mind in which I might do a Hunter Thompson on my own TV set. I'm trying to imagine what the target audience is for such a film, now that we in the US have seen this film made at least four hundred times - villages of media-starved Vietnamese sitting in large auditoriums spooning in rice? Masses of North Koreans herded into halls in their prison camps for evening entertainment? Specially selected groups requiring extra incentive at Guantanemo? I admit to a brief flare of hope when Michael Shannon (Boardwalk Empire, the Iceman) appeared in the first few minutes, but the man appeared to be on Neurontin or Thorazine and his acting was so poorly delivered and uninspired that he appeared to be in a fugue state. When Russell ""Let me slam this phone over your head for starters"" Crow appeared I groaned, knowing the thousands of close ups of beard and sideburns that were coming. At least Brando, who was probably stoned out of his mind while playing Superman's father, was amusing to watch, but this is a ponderous mess that makes John Carter of Mars high art by comparison.

5781617,4,B00D91GRA4,I've seen the original Christopher Reeves Superman movies as a kid and this is so much more powerful. Cavill fills Reeves boots well and Kevin is surprising in such a powerful role as his Earth father and Michael Shannon in the General Zod role is nothing short of epic. If one complaint can be made its the use of CGI in the big fight scene but that is to be expected in today's summer blockbusters. I loved it and will watch again and again.,1390608000,,443,4.285714285714286

5781620,5,B00D91GRA4,"This is not your father's ""Superman the Movie"" that came out in 1979. That is what I really liked about this film. This is more rough and ruthless. The story really is minimal. It starts on Krypton and ends up on Earth. The villan is Zod like but he is here really to force Superman to do his bidding. The film is a slamfest of buildings crashing to the ground as supermen and women fight it out. It is the film that show what they can do with the Iconic character's powers and the effects are impressive.
I know alot of people complain about the destuction and how the new Superman was less approachable than Chris Reeves. They are right. The charm of the Reeve, Donner film is not here and that is fine. Chris Nolan and company were never going to go that route. What you get is Zack Snyder a director who makes darker and more gritty films. If you saw and enjoyed Watchmen you will get in to this film.

The story is good but the emphasis on special effects and the OVERLY LONG fight sequences were just too much.. Although this movie had the look and feel of Nolan's effort in the Batman movies, it just was too darn long, I mean how many times do I have to see guys getting punched and then getting up like it was nothing..?? The fight sequences in this movie just go on and on and on FOREVER and the CGI/special effects are just way too much.. I liked that it was a unique story but even my kids ages 14 and 16 got bored with it.. I really felt that I could have done a much better job editing and tightening up the story line on this one..It's like a visual feast where the host just overindulged on special effects..

Different relationship between Superman & Lois.  There are other differences, but I don't want to give the plot away.  There are also a few items that believability is stretched.  For example it took Clark a few years to get used to earths yellow sun.  However, the bad guys arrive and it takes them no time at all.  Here's my one complaint.  Too much action, from beginning to end; with most of it being fight scenes.  Should have taken a bit more time on characters, interaction and dialogue.

The movie was too long and a bit on the darker side. The movie had lots of action, but it was too much computer generated. Even my kids were not entertained and they are ages 7,9, and 11.

5781630,5,B00D91GRA4,"After years and years of disappointment. Zack Snyder a man in my eyes who can do no wrong in the world of comic book films, finally achieved what has been attempted for years...a GOOD Superman movie!

Christopher Nolan has surely set the bar thanks to his Dark Knight Trilogy and with the Marvel Universe films raking in the big bucks DC has finally gotten the film needed to catch up. Man of Steel is everything I wanted in a Superman film. An origin story with a very human twist. This film was not just about a young boy with powers growing up, it was about about a hero learning to discover his own heroism. The cast was well rounded Michael Shannon did a tremendous job as Zod and Henry Cavil was exactly how I expected Superman to be. I could tell that Snyder definitely dabbled in Bruce Timm's world just a little bit while he is a man with powers beyond humans, he showed a weakness and vulnerability. Finally, what I loved the most was we finally got a Superman film in which Superman actually fights! The action sequences were fast and furious exactly what a battle between Kryptonians should be.

Of course people do have their gripes one of which is the fact that there was no real love story between Superman and Lois Lane, I didn't find that a problem. I feel there was no place for it in this movie because once again it was about Superman becoming Superman. What I really was happy about was that unlike Bryan Singers' Superman Returns, this film didn't try to go back to find the glory days. No John Williams theme, no classic Superman taglines, just an in your face raw and fresh adaption of The Man of Steel.

Thank goodness this film did well because the flood gates are finally about to open with a sequel on the horizon which will feature two more DC comic book heroes, including the first film adaption of Wonder Woman. I am very excited to see the next film and so happy that the DC franchise is finally ready to hit the big screen thanks to Earth's Greatest Son.",1390521600,,1987,4.423497267759563

He played a prominent role in The Tudors if you may recall. It was a origin story of sorts it just followed its own formula for delivering that story. where as previous movies do it in stages, this one blends pieces together to make a wonderfully enjoyable movie.

They are basically made by people who aren't creative enough to write their own original movies and just attempting to cash in on previously successful movies by changing it enough not to infringe on copyrights.  Nevertheless we were curious, so we bought it.  We shouldn't have wasted our money.  The plot was so disjointed it was irritating.  They kept bouncing back and forth between past and present.  It looked like they watched Star Wars, Never Ending Story, Close Encounters, etc. way too many times and just stole things from movies they liked or that grossed a lot of money and threw them in wherever they could (as much as they could).  All of the character interactions were either hostile, aggressive, disfunctional, melodramatic, boring, or psychotic (or several of the above).  Rather felt as though you were watching events in an extremely violent mental institution.  Lastly, although we like good action movies with plenty of violence, this was just off the scale for violence, even for us.  We definitely would NOT recommend this movie.  I doubt we'll ever watch it again.  Why 2 stars?  Well, my husband didn't like it, I hated it, so I just went with the nicer of the two opinions.",1390435200,3,1255,4.835680751173709

5781641,5,B00D91GRA4,"From the opening scenes on Krypton to the credits, this movie had me on the edge of my seat. Unlike many other hero movies these days, the man of steel is a man who is REALLY a hero. What I mean by this is that he stands for what is right. He has morals. And this is the first thing that makes him a hero to me and adds depth to him.
The acting was spot-on, and the special effects were mind-blowing. Cavill is a great superman, and Shannon makes a very convincing villain.
The one thing that really bothered me about this was a line that a woman says about Superman. ""I just think he's kinda hot."" I think that that line is corny, and wish I could just cut it out from the movie.
However, other than that, I loved this movie.
The superman that Cavill portrayed is someone I want to be like. Just watch it and you'll see why...

5781668,3,B00D91GRA4,"I thought that ""Man of Steel"" was merely an average superhero flick.  The opening scene on Krypton was magnificent (as was Russel Crowe as Jor-El).  But I felt that the writers tried to cram too much into this film and took a couple of liberties (in my mind) with the origin story.  I would have liked to have seen more of Kevin Costner as Clark's adoptive father, Jonathan Kent, so that the audience can see the profound impact that he had on Clark as a moral guide (since Clark never actually knew his biological parents).

The special effects and soundtrack were very good.  But the story itself just seemed to be a mashup of many different characters from the comics without any true feeling or deep connection to Clark Kent/Superman.  I never felt that Superman was really in any peril, even though he was just learning the extent of his powers.  And while mortal humans were very much in danger, once again, I did not sense a strong connection between Clark and anyone, except maybe his mother.  Granted, this is a reboot/origins story to set up sequels in which presumably we will see more of the relationships which define Clark, but I just didn't sense much real emotion between characters.  Lois Lane, for example, while no doubt is an intelligent, hard-nosed reporter, well she just seemed too infatuated with the mystery of aliens.  And this is not a knock on the actors/actresses, I thought the cast was solid.  I just think that the movie was attempting to do too much in a limited amount of time (cramming some 30 Earth-years into 2 hours) and should have focused on fewer characters (primarily his adoptive parents and the story's antagonist after the first act) with strong ties to Clark in his early years on Earth.  The movies attempts to do this to an extent, but it was rushed, seemed hollow, lacking character development and devoid of raw, emotional connections which truly pull on the heart strings.

I also would have liked to see Zod's character be not only ruthless, but more cunning.  Michael Shannon did a fine job given what he had to work with, but I felt the writers could have come up with something better to showcase why Zod was a general and Krytpon's greatest warrior.  He should be Superman's (near) equal physically, but given his experiences and being hardened by war, it would have been more interesting to see him like a chess player, strategizing many moves ahead of his opponents, rather than fighting with brute force (and technological advantages) alone.  I felt an opportunity was really wasted here to show why Zod should be so feared.  Yes, the Kryptonians have advanced technology and are nearly gods, but Zod merely comes across as an interstellar thug/hostage taker bent upon implementing a terra-forming and eugenics program to rebuild Krypton, while exacting some form of vengeance upon the house of El is more of an after-thought.  A grandiose plan in overall scale, yes, but too generic and simple for a villain like Zod.  The scariest antagonists are the ones that possess and utilize a remarkable intelligence to match their brawn while executing their evil plans.

If you're a big fan of superhero flicks, don't let my review dissuade you from purchasing or renting this film.  It is by no means a bad movie, but I do feel that it could have been so much better.",1390262400,2,3321,4.7508710801393725

The entire film is in dark settings just like the last one.
The Zod character was poorly done.  Even his ""scar"" wasn't done properly.  It looked more like two large warts on his face rather than a severe scar.
There are several issues with the editing including water hitting the camera lens and making the picture foggy (when it shouldn't have been).
The story line is poorly redone while still trying to hold on to some of the original tale.
They have outrageous technology in many aspects but can't seem to find anyting better to ride on than a flying dinosaur.
Superman himself causes more destruction and death than all of the villans combined.
Problem- stop trying to recreate what does not need to be recreated.

5781675,2,B00D91GRA4,"Being a Superman fan, I expected a lot from this movie, and maybe that was my problem. I expected too much, perhaps more than it could deliver. To me, the film had more of a ""Third chapter"" feel to the movie, instead of the first chapter of a film franchise. I mean, it goes head first into a plot where the fate of the world hangs in the balance, and Superman is forced to make choices that test his moral compass(Despite the fact, that the film franchise has YET to show us what supermans morals ARE).

It just seems like, the franchise has nowhere to go, but either down(Which seems to be the case, since fighting batman doesn't SEEM to be as important as saving the planet  and humanity in general from extinction), or at the very least continue along the lines of ""Save the planet""..

As a matter of fact, the plot would have served better as the plot for the Justice League movie. Because, what's going to be so important that all the super heroes have to unite for? Superman has already overcome impossible odds, all by his lonesome!

Difficult to take seriously the ""Squid Shaped Spacecraft,"" didn't make sense, don't think any super race would really design such awkward and non-functional appendages. As usual, half the movie was dark in order to eliminate any discernable details and to keep the CGI expenditure to a minimum. The main character fit the part, as did Lois Lane. Interesting flashbacks to the star's childhood,with  positive interplay between his 'adopted' parents and schoolmates. Frankly, I thought the special effects were a little overdone and forced. The ending consisting of the interminable duel between protagonists was too long, on the verge of boring. Finally, it was a nice twist to see Clark Kent's first day on the job.

The middle of the film starts to continue that story, but Zod and his cohort (the villains) were bland (despite their rage), and the destruction that follows (violent, fast-moving, with lots of CGI) lost my attention.

Honestly I write this review as I watch the movie it has already lost me. It's like someone (Bruce, Peter, one of the X-men, etc.) stole superman's cape and powers and tried to live his life. This movie is dark, grey, and morbid. This superman would be banned from the boyscouts and never allowed remotely near a child. Never mind the whole bending of reality, a tornado just pops up on a bright, sunny day in Kansas?! Sorry I live in tornado alley and that just does not happen. Much like feed silos do not blow up in flames. If you want to see a dark movie filled with fireworks, violence, hate, and destruction this is the movie for you.

5781702,3,B00D91GRA4,"i was not positive whether i would like ""Man of Steel""? I did find Krypton far more interesting and real then the version from the  :""Superman the Movie"" which was kind pf simplistic and a bit. This movie showed a real Krypton vinrant and the character of Jor El an Lara as well as Zod were all well formed for their brief exposure at the start. I liekd that Clark Kent aka Superman was not the whining wuss that the TV series ""Smallville"" had him portrayed.
Amy Adams was good as Lois Lane and how she discovered his true identity was what one would have expected from her character.
Calks character was well developed and when he fought Zod as Superman one could see the intensity and anguish when he was forced to kill Zod. One complaint I have was the fight scenes, in Smallville and in Metropolis. I know this an action movie and so there has to be action. My complaint is the big fight scene in a major city has been done repeatedly that it is no longer exciting.
I would have like to have seen a different confrontational outcome with Zod. But I am not the director or producer or writer and they all concluded that the standard final battle in the City was it.
For me a final battle in the Grand Canyon between Zod and Kal El would have been for this fan exciting.

While the movie was exciting,I had a problem with the Blu-Ray Copy. After my first time watching the Blu-ray copy of Man of Steel, each subsequent viewing o the Blu-ray version some two third into  the movie my Blu-ray became choppy and the frames would freeze for a moment making watching the latter part of the movie frustrating.

What  I really enjoyed was a top notch cast who when allowed to act made for a compelling and thought provoking reexamination of the Superman story.  It's compelling how the negative aspects are examined without being revisionist.  The actions scenes are compelling and the torn natures of the ""bad"" guys are also engaging and make for a great story.  The great flaw here is that the special effects are so over blown and at times ridiculous that they detract from the over all story.  The destruction of Metropolis and its miraculous rebirth only a short time later is just so silly.  In fact the bloodless nature of it is distributing and detracts from the story as a whole.

5781709,3,B00D91GRA4,"We live in a culture of movie remakes that require abundant violence and action, as if to say that anything less would be a failure at the box office. With this fear in mind, movie (re)makers don't mind altering a character's true attributes or an established franchise's tone and pace, as long as massive profits materialize. Man of Steel is all of the above: a brawned-up barrage of CGI with shaky camerawork thrown in for good measure. At times, I enjoyed watching this film, but other times I rolled my eyes. Hence, the mediocre review here. This movie reminds me of a Star Trek reboot (though much worse), a Star Wars prequel, Batman reboots, Spider-Man, and Dune, though none of these are bad in their own right. They're in fact very good. It's unfortunate that I conclude that this movie felt more like the aforementioned movies and miniseries' than Superman. I strongly feel that this movie is a sellout from a creative standpoint. It's not a disaster, but is annoying enough to categorize it with the saturated market of over the top action movies out there, instead of a genuine superhero tale. Furthermore, the acting is mediocre at best, which adds to the overall shaky experience. I can't recommend or not recommend this movie. 5/10",1390003200,3,1245,4.7953488372093025

5781711,5,B00D91GRA4,"This movie was surprisingly pretty good.  The story that they set out to tell could have easily been 2 movies, and it pretty much was in the original movies (C.Reeve), but they pulled it off in my opinion.  The storylines that they packed into the single movie was very ambitious, and they did cover alot of ground.  It made for a bit of a long movie, I'll concede that.  In my opinion, the fight scenes could have been shortened, which could have made the film come in closer to the 2 hour mark rather than the 2:20 mark.  But in the end, it doesn't change the fact that it is a good movie.

If you really look at this movie with a fair lens, the casting was great, the storytelling was good, the visual effects were great, the music and score were great, and they even managed to create some uniqueness in a storyline that most people have a pretty good sense of.  Henry Cavill did a really good job pulling off the nuances of a character that was still learning things about himself and his role in the world(s) he was in.  He also managed the emotions of the character well.  It was a good balance of the timidity of a young man, the use of his strength and powers, even to the point of Superman showing he had to work at some things, and not all things are easily within his power.  In the end, his character is likely the most believable and ""normal"" portrayal of Superman to date.  Well done man.  I actually hope they make another one with this same cast.

Bottom line, I'm glad I didn't allow the mixed feelings and reviews of some people deter me from finally watching the film.  This was pretty well done.",1390003200,,1616,4.30794701986755

I bet that lots of innovative writers would love their film  adapted from their ideas, and it only cost thousand times less than the brain dead super heroes film like this, it is a waste of money and time, it also is unethical, since other good films with innovative idea that deserve better box office would be affected because of this movies, it costs 225 million dollars to make,sucks 291 millions from audiences' wallet, they all came to the film not because of its quality, but because it is superman sequel, then when they discover that super man is no longer as good as it should be, the new super man movie sequel come next years will suffered even more, if the producer doesn't come with new idea, it is certain that the next year superman won't be profitable . the below box office expectation I hope would be a wake up slap in the face to the producer to stop wasting money on a project that is cliche.",1390003200,2,1460,4.488721804511278

Mainly, I can't believe that those producers and directors of this movie have ever read a Superman comic.  I had them all as a child.  Moreover, I was totally mesmerized by Superman, The Movie.  One could easily follow each and every scene, sequence, and, whatever.  I left the theater feeling total satisfaction and wanting to immediately return very soon (like that evening!).  This awful waste of two and a half hours left me disgusted.  Although it started relatively nice:  A background of Superman as a newborn and then as a boy and, of course, as a young man wondering why he was different.  After that, the whole thing was a continual demolition derby.  The current five star reviewers are not unbiased, in that I find their motivation very questionable.

Sorry, special effects don't always make a movie.  Often, they make confusion, lack of continuity, and just plain unjustifiable chaos.  I won't see this again, or a sequence of it.  Incidentally, I have never reviewed a movie before.  But, those five star reviews have me livid and feel that people will buy based on them and, folks, that's a genuine rip-off being generated by (?)",1389830400,20,1588,4.716363636363637

5781745,5,B00D91GRA4,"I absolutely do not understand what the complaining reviews are all about for this film.  For this upgrade, the filmmakers tried to portray what is might be like to grow up as an alien on a planet that is both the only home you have ever known, but at the same time, a planet where you look like the other inhabitants but are clearly not one of them.  And I think they did a damn good job overall.  I am a HUGE superman fan, and I, for one, LIKE this upgrade.  Some reviewers have noted that the film could have devoted a bit more film time to characters and less time to the action sequences, but frankly if titans from another planet are fighting and have the strength and powers that these characters have, you would expect to have a lot of destruction.  However, it only happened at the last part of the film, and the computer graphics and action was top notch.  In addition, while the comic series and previous film versions would want to have everyone perpetually believe that Lois Lane, and everyone else for that matter, are all just too stupid to know that Clark Kent is superman with glasses, I could never swallow that aspect of the series.  Fortunately this new take fixes that quite nicely as well.  It also leaves us panting for the sequel.  The only disappointment is that apparently the sequel makers are going to make the sequel a Superman vs Batman film and frankly that is the most stupid idea they could ever come up with and something I will never purchase.  But this film I could watch over and over and never get bored.  In the end humanity and Superman both team up to save each other.  Superman may have super powers but he is not a super God, and, in this film, to save the planet, he needed humanity's help as much as humanity needed his.  Wonderfully done overall!",1389830400,,1792,4.410334346504559

But, BOY, on viewing at home, without the distraction of 3D this movie just gets more and more annoying. I particularly hate how the character of Steve is treated in this film. He seems likeable enough, yet, for some reason, we're supposed to hate him. The guy risks his life to save Jenny Olson (yeah, Jimmy's had a sex change), and later on she rejects his invitation to court side basketball tickets (never mind HOW Metropolis got back on its feet soon enough to HAVE basketball games. Remember 9/11? Two building were blown up and Broadway was closed for weeks. Half the city is destroyed and its like nothing at all happened). This is quite possibly the worst version of Superman I've seen so far, and I'm including Superman IV: The Quest of Peace! God, this movie is serious. There's not one bit of joy in it.

The only extra thing is the added figures, which are really cheap pieces of plastic with no articulation and shoddy work on the facial likeness. Somehow adding two figures barely worth $5 combined allows them to justify marking up the price by $20 and calling it a limited edition gift set.

5781783,4,B00D91GRA4,"Helmed by Zack Snyder (300, Watchmen) and written by Christopher Nolan, (Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception) this reboot is a refreshing take on a Superman we have waited to see for quite some time. Substituting campy costuming, acting, and effects, for a more gritty, thoughtful, (albeit incredibly destructive) tone, Man of Steel gives us some fantastic sequences.

If you were disappointed by the fizzled attempt that was ""Superman Returns,"" you should be pleasantly surprised by this film. Strong performances from most of the cast, although I particularly liked Michael Shannon as Zod. Amy Adams was just sort of ""there"" as Lois Lane. Another con would be the films overly catastrophic nature during the third act, that seems to channel the ""Bayhem"" many have viewed as tedious in films like ""Transformers.""

Plot did a fantastic job at mixing in the sci fi component of Superman's birth place and working with it throughout the story. Wasn't a fan of Henry Cavill and Lois Lane's acting but, I usualy don't watch superhero movies for the acting. Besides, there was an abundance a great actors in the movie that made up for any deficiency Superman himself couldn't deliver.
Action scenes were all about smashing up cities which seems to be the popular thing to do now in fantasy/sci fi movies; that is toppling complete buildings in a highly populated area. But none has done it better than the movie ""Pacific Rim"" in my opinion.

5781793,1,B00D91GRA4,"That's all that really has to be said about this movie, honestly. It sucks. It's even worse than Superman Returns, which yes, is possible. At least that film had something going for it and the actor who played the character actually seemed like Superman.

First, the pacing of this movie is horrible. It keeps jumping back and forth, back and forth. Seriously, let's get on with it already.
It really has no originality and pretty much nothing going on for it plot wise at all. I like Henry Cavill, but I think he was a very poor choice for Superman. He doesn't play him well at all. In fact, through out most of the movie he doesn't even seem like the ""Man of Steel,"" he just seems like a sissy. Lois Lane in this movie was also really poorly cast in this movie and isn't believable in any way possible. Another bad thing about this movie is a lot of the fight scenes in it are just ridiculous and too long and drawn out. There's way too much emphasis on them. This movie really feels like nothing more than a Superman movie with a Dark Knight vibe to it, and not in a good way.

Don't get me wrong, though. There are a few things I did like about this movie. The beginning with all the scenes on Krypton, along with Jor-El and General Zod are pretty cool. In fact, those two characters and the actors portrayals of them are the only good things about this movie at all. The rest is complete garbage.",1389657600,5,1401,4.303030303030303

Pros
*The packaging is very attractive and came without any damage.
*It was well protected when it was shipped.
*It's Superman.

Cons
*The figurines are the real reason to buy the set and they leave a lot to be desired. The look and accuracy of the figurines is less then impressive. They look cheaply made and not well painted.

Summary
Happily the price was reduced a couple days after I purchased this item so Amazon refunded some of my money. In total it cost about $35 USD, which is about all it's worth.

5781833,3,B00D91GRA4,"Contains Minor Spoilers... I guess.

Ahh yes, ""Superman"", that movie that brought such joy to my childhood. I still remember those vivid memories of ""Superman"" airing on TV and the next morning, it is all we talked about in school and during recess. ""My favorite scene was when Louis fell from the helicopter and Superman caught her""... ""yeah, mine too""... ""and when he makes time go backwards"" .. ""yeah, that was so cool"". The memories. It was an event. Unfortunately those are moments now frozen in time and I can now forgive the incredibly bad sequels (minus Superman II which despite some obnoxious humor, was a good, solid entry).

Now the newer generation has ""Man of Steel"" (and to a lesser degree ""Superman Returns"" - 2006 but it seems to be forgotten now). I dunno. There is something missing in this film. I am not sure what it is exactly. It is bigger, louder, over-blown, sometimes numbing but this should be expected from an action film that boasts a $225 million budget, and it does have a heart .. buried somewhere underneath all of the chaos but this was not the Superman I enjoyed as a youngster. The characters are different and this includes our hero. The movie is a lot darker, it possesses no sense of humor or light weight moments that made the original so charming (the sequels would over-do it to a ridiculous degree) and our hero's flaming red trunks are a thing of the past (this may be the one good thing about this re-visioning).

After several scenes in the prologue showing us the origins of Kal-El, the imprisonment of Zod and the destruction of Krypton, the story deals with Kal-El/Clark Kent/Superman (played as an adult by Henry Cavill), ""finding himself' on earth. The villains, the megalomaniacal General Zod (Michael Shannon) and his obedient army, who were previously trapped in the Phantom Zone and managed to escape, travel to earth in search of Kal-El. Wanting to turn earth, at the expense of all its citizens, into Krypton, it all turns catastrophic when Superman refuses to co-operate and much havoc and destruction ensues. Our protagonist, Clark Kent is emotional, constantly struggling with himself and his extraordinary abilities throughout his life, but at times, it got a little silly where I started yelling at the scream ""oh boo-hoo, you have super powers, deal with it and move on already"". Clark's father, Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner) is even worse. He is fearful that his special son will be rejected by society since they will be unable to understand his origins, his powers and prefers that Kent keeps this side of himself hidden until, I guess, the right time comes along *rollseyes*. The issues I have with several of these scenes lie with the writers and I do not fault the actors since they did a great job with the material given, for instance Cavill and Costner are both good in their roles, but there are moments I simply did not like. Due to spoilers, I will not discuss in more details.

Others in the cast include the always compelling Russell Crowe who is great as Kal-El's original father Jor-El. Diane Lane plays Martha Kent, Clark's earth mother. You know you are getting old when you are you watching an actress whom you had greatly admired in ""Streets of Fire"" back in 1984, and she now appears before you complete with some added wrinkles and grey hairs, yikes ... but Lane is still gorgeous and she brings some much needed heart and soul to the movie. Lois Lane is played by Amy Adams. At first I was a bit hesitant since Adams is as far away from Margot Kidder as you can possibly get, however as the film moves along, her character grows on you. She is one of the stronger characters here and her Lois is no weakling. She possesses no humor, I guess the film's tone leaves no room for it, and she is more of a help to Superman (and to mankind) than a hindrance, and I have to admit, the old school Lois Lane was a bit loopy but the charm that made the original cinematic character enduring is sadly missing.

Part of me liked that the film deviates from the source material and the original 1978 film. I guess this film serves as the introduction to Superman, dealing mostly with his life in his home-town, his relationship with his earth parents, his odd jobs etc. His powers are also discovered by many, so despite his many aliases, his true identity is not really a secret. Where I found this film lost it was during the far too many prolonged fight sequences showing these all too powerful aliens constantly throwing each other through structures and buildings with far too many explosions and crumbling skyscrapers. Yes, I understand I live in a time where audiences expect more from our super-heroes than simply saving a frightened kitty cat from a tree and throwing a villain who resembles Maurice Gibb from the Bee Gees into a giant, illuminated ""Coca-Cola"" sign, especially when that super hero is the titular character in a $225 million dollar production but the destruction in this film was a bit far-fetched and reminiscent of ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Independence Day"" with probably millions dead. I also would have preferred a shorter running time as the CGI fight scenes went on far too long. I am fully aware that you cannot make a super-hero movie without the use, or over-use of CGI, but let's be honest with ourselves, there was not one fight sequence that looked remotely realistic and for several seconds, or minutes of screen time, it looked like I was watching a video game.

I have mixed emotions about ""Man of Steel"". Despite too much CGI, the film looks good on a technical level and it is an interesting re-visioning of the Superman tale. I thought Cavill did a good job in the role, definitely an improvement over Brandon Routh. I also liked Adams' Lois Lane and Shannon was fantastic as General Zod but it is over-done and without much character development and none of the original films charm, it drags in parts. Special effects alone do not a great movie make and the numbing effects here over shadow the actors. There are far too many fight scenes, far too much CGI, far too many explosions and it all left me with one big, terrible headache and very little else. Didn't anyone learn from ""Transformers 2""? I don't think I cared enough about these characters to re-watch this a second time which is a shame, since, despite its flaws and period stamp, I've managed to re-watch the original ""Superman"" and ""Superman II"" countless times throughout 3 decades.

Still, it's action packed and there are worst ways to kill 142 minutes.",1389571200,,6538,4.69485614646905
5781834,2,B00D91GRA4,"First let me say I am a huge fan of super heroes and the movies portraying them.  [SOME SPOILERS HERE]  THE GOOD: Superman fans have been crying for the perfect Superman Movie, the perfect actor, the perfect special effects, the perfect story set & plot. We got the right actor, Henry Cavill in my opinion, does a marvelous job portraying the man of steel. Lets face it no one will truly replace Christopher Reeve, but I think Henry C makes his own mark. He has the look & the body. Spot on with that. Kevin Costner does very well as Johnathon Kent although his scenes were very brief.  Michael Shannon did very well on Zod. Special effects were good. The ground shaking blast off when he flies was enough for me to like that sort of buildup. The destruction of the city buildings & fights scenes were all done well. The atmosphere for the movie was definitely on the dramatic serious side, this is good and something I was hoping for. For atmosphere, special effects, actors the respect was there and done great. Now for the flip side, unfortunately the bad outweighs the good in my opinion.
THE BAD: [SOME SPOILERS] Just to warn those who loved this movie, this will be a bit harsh.  As much as I want to really like & love this movie I just cant. It feels as if no effort went into developing Clark Kents story. Although what I mentioned above are all good points, special effects and good actors don't complete a movie. In this case the movie lacks character development & story development and as I said no respect to the original story line. Oh we all know they cant recreate the comic book exactly, thats been tried, they cant just do a Christopher Reeve remake either, that would be boring. What we got was Clark Kent youth in a series of flashbacks mixed with choppy scene changes during the main story, it did not flow well. On a side note to that, they did not do a great job making 30 yr old Henry C look like he was 18-19 in these flashbacks.  The movie just jumps right in to his struggle to transform to the red cape from the start, giving us no chance what so ever to relate to his character in this way. The movie has a feel as if we missed the whole first half.
LOIS LANE: [SPOILERS] This important detail of the Superman story has been totally bastardized in this movie. It seems they spent so much time on special effects they actually forgot to include any original retelling of Lois Lane & Clark Kent. Lois goes to the house where Superman grew up and meets his Mom??!! And he doesnt even work at the Daily Planet yet??!! Also although I like Henry Cavil, he certainly didn't convince anyone in the last 5 mins of the movie that he could be a bumbling boring UN-attractive reporter, anyway what would be the point at this stage Lois already knows all about him. & who he is.  As I said, way too much emphasis on ending fight scenes & special effects, little emphasis on character development and main story line.
As others have already stated, this is an over the top action super hero movie with just a shell or the appearance of substance. Superman story deserves more than Zack Snyder & Christopher Nolan gave it. Although the Christopher Reeve movies are dated, and at times a bit cheesy to watch, I will continue to pull Superman 1 & 2 off the shelf every now and then to watch. This movie will likely collect plenty of dust, I doubt I will ever  watch it again.",1389571200,9,3389,4.395534290271132
5781835,5,B00D91GRA4,"This is a GREAT movie.  I wish all movies were generated with the same format.  There were no questions that were not answered in this story.

5781837,5,B00D91GRA4,"NOTE: This review is for the box set only. Not any disc contents.
I am a huge Zack Snyder fan. So when I heard he would be doing the next superman, I knew I'd be getting myself a copy. Little did I know the movie would get a limited box set release; and it was a big metal Superman 'S' on a stand so it was oriented right, and everything! ""I am sooo getting this!"" I thought.
Now that I have it, here's my review of the Man of Steel Limited Edition Box Set.
At first glance, it looks Awesome! Nice shiny tin, good paint app. It gives a great 3D look in the right light. It opens like an old lunch box and inside is a folded sleeve in the shape of the 'S' with Jor-El's armor as a motif. It unfolds to reveal a pic of Kal-El and then Zod and houses the blu-ray, 3D blu-ray, DVD, and Special Features disc. Under the sleeve is a foam bottom with cut-outs to hold the two piece acrylic stand.
A couple minor gripes:
The number for the limited release is on the outer ""throw-away"" packaging instead of on the actual set, so I carefully cut out the number and taped it to the inside top of the tin-lid.
And, the stand has three small magnets to hold the tin in place, but you must adjust it side to side until its standing evenly. I guess its good if you are standing it on an uneven surface so you can keep it even...
And, the pieces of the stand fit together a little loosely, so I glued them together for added support.
All in all, this is a must have for any movie/box set aficionado. Or comic movie fan. Or Superman fan.
It looks awesome sitting on any shelf.",1389571200,2,1559,4.064935064935065
5781838,4,B00D91GRA4,The lack of bad language and overt sex was refreshing.  We like the characterizations which fit with our  concepts.  My wife thought there was too much destruction.  It is amazing what can be done with computers.,1389484800,2,212,4.805555555555555
5781839,2,B00D91GRA4,"If you like mind-numbing violence that makes the Avengers look like Hare Krishna love-ins, you'll love Man of Steel. What started off as a somewhat promising flick turned into a CGI on steroids descent into apathy for me. I swear Zod and Kal-El had to have fought for 3 hours smashing each other through buildings and refineries and throwing cars and UPS trucks at each other. It got downright annoying. It wasn't the kind of awesome CGI fighting like in the Return of the King battles, this is just plain annoying.

Henry Cavill is a good guy, but frankly he lacks the spark, the twinkle in his eye, the fun, and the overall ""esse"" of Superman. Yeah, I grew up with Chris Reeves as Superman, but I was 100% ready to give Cavill a chance. Afterall, I like Christian Bale's Batman a whole lot better than the previous actors who portrayed the Dark Knight when I was younger, but Cavill is just lackluster. I blame Chris Nolan for that a bit.

I think when it comes to dark characters like Batman, Chris Nolan is the ONLY guy who should be directing or producing! However, when it comes to Superman, it doesn't work. Nolan and company make Superman dark and brooding, quiet and complicated, melancholy and odd.

Amy Adams is so-so.

Michael Shannon is a TERRIBLE General Zod. And I hate how Nolan tries to make him somewhat sympathetic. Shannon overacts like crazy and really got under my skin. If only Michael Fassbender weren't already playing Magneto! Guys like Fassbender fit the role much better. Zod is sinister in the comics (as if anyone reads the comics anymore and knows these characters anyway!) and a terror. This Zod is a whiny baby and, as stated, overacted.

There wasn't the cool banter or interesting stuff at the Daily Planet, the story about Krypton was a change from the original material but rather went along with the 1980's re-imagined story, etc.

What do I hope (even though I KNOW this won't happen!), just re-boot this movie. Re-cast Cavill but this time give him some room to smile and be an interesting character. Put Michael Emerson in as Lex Luther, DROP Hans Zimmer from the soundtrack (I LOVE Zimmer! His Last Samurai and Batman scores were awesome!, but Superman needs to be more upbeat and hopeful, exciting and fun, less brooding and dark), change things up. This movie was a bummer",1389484800,7,2316,4.678132678132678
5781840,5,B00D91GRA4,"This is a tough item to review. Do I review the movie itself? Or this special release of it on BD/DVD? I finally decided to give it five stars because Amazon's rating system has five stars equaling ""I love it.""

First, the packaging....
If you want something that can be put on display in your man-cave, and you're a Superman fan, this is great to have. The Blu-Ray discs and DVDs are in a fold-out sleeve in the shape of Superman's ""S"" shield. As you unfold the sleeve, you're treated to the main actors in the movie. The box is metal and in the shape of Superman's ""S"" shield. It holds the DVDs and an acrylic stand. The stand is two-part clear acrylic with magnets along the back to hold the display case in place. The base is in the shape of the ""S"" shield, and when the display is resting on the stand, only the box and base are visible. The only complaint I have is that the two pieces fit together VERY tightly. Do not try to force them! I sent it back once because while trying to get the two pieces together, the base cracked. The new pieces are likewise a very tight fit, so be careful. When assembled though, it sits nicely on a shelf and holds your movie. It's more of a display piece than anything, and is a very nice bonus to owning the movie.

Now for the movie and its rendition on BD/DVD....
The picture quality of the 3D movie I watched was fine, and the sound was good. I'm not a discriminating audiophile, so I can't comment on details of the audio other than the sound was immersive on my 5.1 surround-system. Picture clarity was great, and it appears the transition from screen to disc was done nicely. I watched the 3D version, and it was fine on my passive 3D TV. You get the 3D movie on BD, the regular HD release on BD, the same movie on DVD (which is handy if you have TV or portable unit somewhere with only DVD capability), and a disc of extras. You also get an Ultraviolet code that allows you to register a digital copy of the movie. I use the Flixter service, and it seemed to work fine. Using the Ultraviolet service is not self-explanatory. You need to create an account for yourself at Ultraviolet (they keep a record of which movies you are licensed to view) and create an account at a service that actually streams the movie (I chose Flixter), then link the two services together. You then enter the code at the secondary service (Flixter, in my case), and the movie is added to your library in Ultraviolet. From the service (again, in my case, Flixter), you can stream the movie to any device that has the app (tablets, smart TV, etc.) or computer. I tried it and it works fine. I'm now registered for this movie and can stream it to my laptop, tablet, etc.

I enjoyed the movie itself, but it's not without flaws. From a pure action-movie perspective, it's very good. The plot gets a bit convoluted, and the action scenes towards the end are overwhelming after a while. But there's also some very good scenes that are a bit quieter, and the overall acting is very good. Henry Cavill plays a very good Clark Kent/Superman and Amy Adams is refreshing as Lois Lane, choosing to portray her more subtly than is normal. The rest of the cast is good, and there's many heartfelt moments throughout the movie. That said, it's debatable whether it actually is a ""good"" rendition of Superman. During key battles, there's a lot of destruction that many feel a ""true"" Superman would have tried to steer away from civilians. Some people like this shift towards realism, some don't. It's a purely personal and subjective opinion, so I won't dwell on it longer.

In the end, I'll rate this particular product five stars. I'd honestly give it about four and a half because the acrylic stand is difficult to assemble and can break if you're not careful, but you can't give half stars, so I'll round up to five. It makes for an attractive display when its in its stand, and the packaging makes the product a very good collector's edition for the Superman fan.",1389484800,,3980,4.433060109289618

It was almost as if he were a pacifist, which is okay.  But this caused you to feel that he held himself back too much to be hero material.  The view into his childhood was nice, but the man should have been able to overcome his unwillingness to stick up for himself and thus others seemed to suffer more than you would expect they should with him around.

5781863,2,B00D91GRA4,"Unless I give a movie three stars or more, I wouldn't recommend owning it. The MAN OF STEEL is just more of the same. A man with the powers of a god is cast as a modern savior of the world, being in the world but not of the world. In some versions, Superman can be seen floating unconscious, as if on a cross. In this movie, he seeks out a priest when a window showing Christ praying in the Garden.

MAN OF STEEL is convoluted and despite the fact that everyone knows the story, writers continue to insist on retelling it. Krypton, invariably a cold, distant planet, is doomed. There are no mountains or beautiful valleys or rivers, just a sterile world of varying shades of gray. Superman's father, Jor-el, sends his only son, Krypton's Only Begotten Son, to Earth, where its sun will give the child near limitless powers.

This movie lacks warmth, humor or ingenuity (unlike Marvel's outstanding films). Faced with three super-powerful villains from his home world, Kal-el relies only on his power, leveling much of New York. Just rebuilt after the Avengers' famous battle, these new villains destroy much of the city in the ensuing battle with Kal-el. In scenes disturbingly reminiscent of 911, buildings topple and thousands are killed. Superman wins the day with his fists, but it would have been a better story if he'd used his brains to outwit his opponents, setting decisive and humorous traps. I also think it would have been better if the Man of Steel had lured them out West, where people would have been spared.

In an ending which is incredible for its irony, Superman is scolded for destroying a satellite that, as a military officer informs the audience, ""cost us twelve and a half million dollars!"" Really? After billions of dollars and an incalculable loss of human life, this officer is concerned about a $12-million satellite. Doesn't anyone read the scripts? Even in THE AVENGERS, the loss of life and destruction was major news. And Iron Man comes away from it with emotional scars which nearly destroy his alter ego, Tony Stark. But Superman is only happy to have found his niche on Earth.

The computer generated effects were astounding, but this isn't a movie you'll want to dig out and watch repeatedly. Why would one want to? Kent's odd jobs such as working on an oil rig to hide his abilities and identity remind me of Marvel's Wolverine, living as a lumberjack. In fact, the similarities are more than just a bit creepy. As I watched Kent walking around in the wilderness trying to fit it, I continually thought I was seeing Logan.

Superman will continue to suffer from what he always has, which is that he's too powerful. In movies, writers have to seriously weaken him somehow or boost the power of his adversaries. I'd rather watch some kid outsmarting bad guys in HOME ALONE movies! That at least takes creativity.",1389398400,2,2847,4.720321931589537
5781864,1,B00D91GRA4,"This movie is WAY too long.  It has destroyed the concept of Superman helping the weak.  Everybody, especially Lois, is willing, even eager to give up his/her life.  The film has to do with the power of women and minorities.  Lois is the hero of the movie.  She powers over Superman himself, the generals, everyone at the Daily Planet, the bad guys.  And Clark's father chooses to tell HER the secret to destroying the bad guys, when the father had many opportunities to do so to his son.  This Lois, far from weak and vulnerable, knows more about nuclear physics than a scientist, knows more about the newspaper business than anybody else, knows more about war tactics than the generals, who all manage to defer to HER authority.  There is not a trace of humility or innocence or fear or humor in any of the characters.  So, we have a movie with no base in reality.  This film wants teenaged girls as its audience.

5781873,5,B00D91GRA4,"Growing up, I was the Marvel Comic fan and my brother was into DC. We always challenged each others favorite superhero against each others. Eventually, we just agreed to disagree. To my appeal, in the past decade or so, there were many more Marvel movie adaptations created than DC. Sure, I loved the Dark Knight trilogy, but The Avengers and all the separate related movies for each superhero kept my Blu-Ray player busy.

Until Man of Steel came out! Initially, I knew this picture would be something special and quite unique under Zack Snyder's direction. I have enjoyed his visionary work for years. Along with Christopher Nolan, Man of Steel was a relished break from my Marveldom. Having watched all previous Superman movies and re-runs of the George Reeve TV series, I couldn't resist. How happy I was!

As I try to avoid the usual trash talk on the internet, my son was telling me these terrible things that people were saying about Man of Steel. To put his (and my own) reservations to rest, we saw this fabulous movie on opening day. 3D I-Max. Got my $17 ticket worth! While he saw it from a 12 year olds eyes, I saw so much more! Unlike Val Kilmer's Batman or George Clooney as the more goofy version, I will venture to say that EVERY cast member in Man of Steel was fully fleshed out. 3 dimensional characters who made you feel what they felt.

From the beginning scenes on Krypton, WE were on Krypton like never before. How the Kryptonian's lived for as long as they lived it. A fully immersive environment that was more biological than ecological. Hence their impending destruction. Before now, we only had glimpses or notions of Krypton in prior movies, comics or cartoons. Each member of Krypton society has (or had) a specific function, and lived to that end. Of those we do meet, no matter how diabolical, one gets their full depth of meaning to said function. There are no ""cardboard"" actors here! General Zod/Michael Shannon truly believes that killing Jor-El/Russell Crowe was out of fury. We can feel this out of the passion of pain. As he watched the only future he had rocket away. The 2 were friends and this death on Zod's hands scars him to the end.

On Earth, Kevin Costner/Jonathan Kent takes in baby Kal-El/Clark Kent. Along with Martha/Diane Lane, as adopted parents, I believe they do the best any parent would. Unconditional love, teach wrong from right and seek spiritual guidance. As seen several times, the ""human condition"" prevails. As Clark grows from a young boy, he naturally questions these powers he finds he has. Yet Jonathan continues to allow Clark to make the choice. At one point, Clark even asks Jonathan, ""Why did God do this to me?"" Purely in a hypothetical way as he knows there is no answer. THIS is the spirituality essence of this film. At another critical juncture, and more likely the most important, Clark walks into a church to further seek spiritual guidance as to how and what to do when he knows the fate of all life on Earth depends on his ""coming out"" as Kal-El. Ultimately, a Man of the Cloth gives him the support needed.  While Superman may be seen as ""god-like"", he too needs a ""Higher Power"" to look to for the unknown. I thought this was not only relevant but highly un-noticed by all the nay-sayers!

These vignettes that occur throughout Clark's life is, inevitably, what makes him the man he becomes. Well before he is the Man of Steel. In his life, in life itself, we must learn morals, values and principals. This goes for anybody. To know the difference from right and wrong and WHY? Jonathan continually tells Clark that ""the world isn't ready to find out about him."" He makes the ultimate sacrifice to keep the ""secret."" As that tornado is about to suck him away, he waves Clark off. Had Clark ran or flew to save Jonathan, those under the underpass would surely have found out! Spread the word about the ""guy who can fly!"" But the time wasn't right because CLARK wasn't ready.

In turn, now fully Kal-El, Superman makes his own ultimate sacrifice. Just before Zod was able to depress the fire button and blow up the plane ahead, as it was preparing to destroy the Dark Zero, Kal crashes through Zod's ship. Kal's eyes are lit wit  his heat vision and ready to take out Zod, Zod yells out and stops him. ""Wait, if you destroy this ship, you destroy Krypton!"" Kal thinks for a second and retorts, ""Krypton had its chance!"" Then relights his eyes and proceeds to take out Zod's ship. THAT was Clark's/Kal-El's/Superman's ultimate sacrifice.

Was Man of Steel too violent as some (many) have claimed? Actually, no? When the fighting scenes happen, the special effects are some of the best I have seen in many years! But they are NOT RAMPANT throughout the movie. The destruction of Krypton was no more graphic than ""Vulcan's"" destruction in ""Star Trek."" The fight scenes are limited to either Smallville or Metropolis. I mean, there are aliens fighting that are god-like status. This is Superman! Who doesn't know the Superman mythos? The city of Metropolis being crushed, well, let's see... Godzilla has done worse. Clover in ""Cloverfield or ""The Avengers"" battling the ""Tretarri"" took out a bigger chunk of Manhattan. There are many others...

Look, this is a Superman for THIS generation. I had no problem having my 12 year old son watch this with me. And Blu-Ray too now. Man of Steel is by NO MEANS OVER THE TOP. I fear more from what both of my kids can view on the internet. And as far as what the ""internet talking heads"" say, well, I have a few choice words I shan't post here for them!
I absolutely suggest, highly recommend getting Man of Steel on Blu-Ray! DVD doesn't do this justice. The special effects are outstanding! If you do get this package, this comes with a bonus 3rd disc full of extras. I was floored when I saw just how much was special effects! You will not be disappointed!

Final thought here... to those who wrote the 1 or 2 Star reviews... I think that there are just some people out here who will not be happy with anything. Maybe they secretly watched Man of Steel and loved it, but were bummed out because their ""date"" stood them up & popcorn was cold!",1389398400,5,6160,4.616438356164384

There are changes from the Superman ""canon"" that we are used to... If that kind of thing bugs you. Example:
**mini spoiler, Like Lois knowing who Clark/Superman is** End of spoiler

Then you will be really annoyed by this movie and you shouldn't put yourself through the trouble. I LOVE superman, I have seen all the movies, some of the old tv shows and read lots of the comics... But I can see this as a new movie, almost as a different person (that isn't exactly what I mean).

5781893,4,B00D91GRA4,"I got this movie because I'm a Superman fan in general.  I have liked Superman since I was a kid and watched the George Reeves syndicated serials in the 70's and 80's.  I bought comic books and watched the Christopher Reeve movies, and Superman Returns with Brandon Routh a few years back.  I never really watched Lois and Clark or Smallville though, but still enjoyed them from time to time, but let's just say, I am comfortable with Superman.

However there are some things about this movie that bugged me.  While it was pretty good in regards to fight scenes, special effects, etc....it jumped around in flashback mode too much.  I would be watching the movie and getting into it then suddenly you'd see Clark as a boy again.  The movie would have been better off staying linear instead of flashing back as it made the story confusing in so doing.  We see him being jettisoned off to earth then suddenly he's a grown man of 33, rescuing guys on an oil rig, with no explanation of how he got there.  We see his dad's grave before we see how his dad died.

Also, if you are expecting this film to be somewhat canonical  here are a few spoilers for you.

Lois Lane knows Clark Kent is an ""alien"" from the get go, and his identity isn't really a secret to many other people either.  By the time he goes to work as that ""mild mannered reporter"" only Lois knows.

Any other versions I have seen, Jonathan Kent died from a heart attack but in this film, he's sucked up by a tornado.

I think in the originals, if I am not mistaken, Kryptonians are good guys.  But it would seem in this movie, Kal El (Superman) is in this good vs. evil battle with his own people and with the human beings he was sent to live among.  He also doesn't like the idea that he's an alien in the first place.

A lot of the scenes where Zod is creating destruction looks too close to the destruction on 9-11 for comfort as well.

For visual effects and a twist on the storyline, this is an OK movie.  But for the origins of Superman, there are better ones out there.  It's basically an alien invasion movie with a bit of Superman thrown in.

It's not a bad movie, but it does take a while to get to the point and get moving.",1389312000,2,2196,4.266343825665859
5781894,5,B00D91GRA4,The Man of Steel Collector's Edition got marvellous in my collection!! The quality of the material is great!! Congratulations Warner!!,1389312000,,134,5.75
5781895,5,B00D91GRA4,"I'll admit that I'm tempted to give this film 5 stars for no other reason than for eliminating the red underwear trend, but even ignoring that, this film earned its rating.

What we see in the Man of Steel, without giving away too much, is a vulnerable, accessible, and yet still amazing Superman. Be warned, this is not Super Saiyan Man who takes a nuke to the face without flinching. This Superman is mortal and can take damage, but don't be fooled - he isn't weak by ANY stretch of the imagination. What we see in the Man of Steel is a believable and justified explanation for what he can do, how he thinks, and interestingly enough even what he wears!

This film distinguishes itself from other iterations of Superman by spending a remarkable amount of time on Krypton, showing us the society and how it died, and making Superman himself especially unique even among his own people. The plot is compelling, the villain believable and dangerous, and the hero - oh the hero - is a moral juggernaut. Man of Steel makes Superman deal with the very real moral questions that his existence raises, and puts him in positions where he has to make difficult decisions with very real consequences - something I've been missing as of late.",1389312000,,1232,4.621004566210046

After the last Superman, which many viewers hated, it took some guts to trot the Man of Steel out for another go around.  I liked the beginning of the movie showing us more of Krypton and establishing a relationship with General Zod and Jor-el and the special effects were awesome.  I also liked that the young Clark Kent had trouble adjusting to his abilities.  One part I wasn't so keen on was a few plot holes with how Zod and his cronies adjusted to their powers maybe a little too quickly and in one part of the movie part of Superman's power was supposedly to come from his absorbing the rays of our yellow sun for a lifetime which would not have helped Zod.  Or maybe I misunderstood but it kind of didn't ring true to me.  Overall a very good movie with lots of action and a new look at an old franchise.",1389225600,3,886,4.244047619047619

The 3D is good for today's 3D movies but like other 3D DVDs things do not really come out of the screen at you. The story takes a lot of liberties from the other movies but is more realistic. I liked it more than I though I would because it takes a different approach showing you more history into Superman's background.

Unfortunately, what I received was so bad that I gave up after about 5-10 minutes. While adequate, the sound quality was not ""HD"", and the picture was far worse than a VHS videotape- so pixilated as to be a joke.

The perspective of how Krypton ended, and Superman's childhood, made this a fun movie. It was refreshing to watch a superhero movie that was not a re-telling of the same story.

Of course, the special effects are far and above what they were in the 80's. But this movie also has the benefit of some strong acting. The movie begins at the planet Krypton, immediately establishing a villian who tries to overthrow the government of Kyrpton in the name of saving his society. The movie then flashes back and forth between Superman as a grown man, and his childhood. One of the neat parts of the story is how Superman starts learning he has powers as a boy, and how scared he is of them at times. Then the storyline shows the phases a teenager and young adult might go through knowing the powers he has, but can't use them.

Superman's real father is played by Russell Crowe, and his Earth father is played by Kevin Costner.

Overall, a good movie with great action.",1389052800,3,1108,4.448275862068965

Superman and his alien enemies have proven what 'trash town destruction' really means, just like the city destruction in Transformers: Dark of The Moon - or is it Dark Side of The Moon? never mind. If the director focused on more zoom 'at your face' close-up 3D camera shots then it will definitely my day a happy one. One brilliant example is someone's milkshake in the restaurant that becomes airborne as Superman is bashed, flipping the table with the milkshake. The milkshake comes towards you in slow motion spilling the milk like a ribbon-like white snake, but just as it reaches near eye-sight view, Superman eye-lasers it into evaporation, only because it would have wet-splattered his face from his viewpoint ::",1389052800,,1234,4.995145631067961

5782021,5,B00D91GRA4,Great movie to own.  For once a movie was made from the comic that did not have to spend over half the movie with the character background.  Loved all the action and less dialogue.  Glad I bought it.,1389052800,,199,4.184210526315789
5782022,4,B00D91GRA4,It takes you back to the origins of Superman in the story. Special effects were good. Story was interesting without usual sexual or excessive violence with gore.

I thought this movie was EXCELLENT!  The best Superman movie I've seen to date.  I appreciated the deeper look into the difficulties, pro's, and con's, moral and spiritual dilemmas, and responsibilities of having power vs when to use it, how to use it.

I also enjoyed the effects, how extremely powerful these beings are - so completely outclassing humankind.  This is how I imagine Godlike power - worthy of awe and humbling respect.  Despite this superiority, they are flawed, imperfect, and susceptible to the same strengths and weaknesses of character and emotion that humans are.

I liked their selection for Superman and Lois Lane. At the end of the day it reminded me of a Transformers franchise not superman. Maybe it was too much time spent fighting Zog.

No wonder they are adding Batman, and Wonder Women to the next film, if u want to see a great Man of Steel movie the 1970s late 1980s Superman 1, with Christoffer Reeves is by far the best and captures the reel spirit of Superman 100times better then this new big budget CGI dump",1388966400,,530,4.145631067961165

The special affects and the acting were uniformly good; particularly good was Crowe, he had to undo Brando's work and does so admirably, and Caville, who made me a believer. The time line was nicely manipulated with Superman tracing his past by remembering his childhood through flashbacks. The parents were portrayed superbly; Costner and Lane have always been favorites.

 I have been a follower of the Superman story since B.C. and I like the new take on the further development on Krypton. The story line was interesting: finally getting to learn the details of the interrelationships of all the adversaries. Superman uses some of the affects from the Matrix, the metal attackers, and also has Superman finding himself similarly to how Batman did in his wanderings: the obviousness of copying is jarring. I gave it four stars for a great try. Too bad that they gave it all up with the simplistic last half. The desire to be Super and also a Man drives the multi layered symbolism and the interest for the viewer to wonder what will it take to unearth the correct formula to undo the path to self destruction that the mechanical Zod so well portrayed.",1388880000,3,1230,4.742990654205608

The origins of Superman was also altered a bit, so I had to watch this version with an open mind.

It didn't matter whether there were stars in the movie or not, this had no flow, confusing and over dramatic with gadgets and scientific jargon.  I think it tried to be like Star Trek with the visuals but it didn't help.

I think the original Superman (SM) origins story was changed to much and almost no time was allowed to show us his childhood and teenage years.  The last fight (SM vs the bad guy) seemed to have no end. After 5 minutes of fighting with no end in sight I started checking my cellphones's messages to pass the time. I knew SM will win at the end so what was the use of watching punches and kicks for so long. The only interesting thing was that the bad guy was a better fighter than SM. If I were a referee in that fight I would have given the victory to the bad guy. Superman won because of sheer luck, not because of fighting skills. Not worth the $$ I paid for it.

Perry gets very little to work with but could have been better used to build the news worthiness of Superman.  The changes to the traditional story in Kansas are interesting and welcome as Superman is not one of us - never was - and is seen as a possible enemy.

Unfortunately, the movie turns into a bloated violent and destructive battle that threatens the entire planet.  This likely excites plenty of viewers, but destroys an otherwise fascinating story about the internal conflict faced by a young man who possesses remarkable powers.

The only real battle scene in this movie was with the aliens and in a manner of speaking, they were the same kind of aliens that Superman is. The original movie had passion, feelings, emotions, love and many other facets, whereas this one was merely a compilation of alien life on earth.  Glenn Ford was a much better Kent than Costner could ever hope to be.  The only truly bright spot in this new film was Amy Adams whose acting abilities are once again exemplary.

5782117,3,B00D91GRA4,"Some people (rightly) claim Superman is boring because he is borderline omnipotent. But thats only true because the people writing his stories don't have any room to mess with anything that would upset the easily dismayed diehard fans. Superman is the epitome of virtuousness. He is a beacon of integrity, morality and justice. He is an extraterrestrial who has immeasurable strength, ludicrous speed, the ability to fly, freaking lasers coming out of his freaking head, and he only uses those powers for good, no matter what. But he is also a man, and men are not infallible. Producer Christopher Nolan, writer David S. Goyer, and director Zack Snyder understand his alienation and humanity on some fundamental level, but they neglected that noble part of him that makes him so iconic.

Fortunately, Man of Steel isn't boring at all. In fact, the fight scenes towards the end are particularly spectacular. But, truth be told, I wanted to like Man of Steel more than I did.

The film stumbles right out of the gate in the laborious telling of his birth. I honestly was falling asleep during the anemic dialogue and pointless killing of Jor-El by General Mumbles McMarbleMouth. There are some wonderful moments of emotion from mother Lara, but they are just glanced over quickly in favor of more pointless fighting and dragon riding. I wrongly assumed that the drab colors and dreary atmosphere were confined to the planet of Krypton, which would subtly hint at the planets impending destruction and alien ecosystems. Maybe the foreboding ambiance would have some juxtaposition once the Last Son of Krypton arrived on Earth. Nope. The whole movie is bleak and melancholy. Very un-Superman like.

It is painfully apparent that they are trying to recreate the success they had with Batman in this retelling of Supermans origins. Grounding Bruce Wayne in reality was the best thing for the Dark Knight, and giving him a dark, broody atmosphere works for his character. In many ways, Man of Steel works best when its bringing Clark down to Earth and showing how human he really is. As a boy he struggles with the onset of his powers while his peers constantly provoke him towards violence. You get the sense that he knows he can hurt these people and almost does several times, but there is always someone to remind him of what is right. But, the pale, ominous tone poisoning every part of the movie doesnt work for Superman.

*Spoilers* The climax of the movie is what most people seem to take issue with. Its a bold decision to be sure. But, weirdly, Im not even upset that Superman kills Zod. I think its absolutely wonderful that it happened and that its possibly the best part of the entire movie. After he snaps his neck, you can see that he immediately regretted it, even though he felt he had no other choice. But, they needed to take it even further.

The movie is about a man becoming Superman. The film plays with the idea of Superman having to decide who lives and dies when his father is taken from him, but it doesnt flesh it out. In his journey, Superman must come to terms with the fact that having superpowers doesnt give him the moral authority to decide who lives and who dies. In fact, it gives him less authority, since he has so much more power to abuse. It could have even served as a tie in with how the nation is feeling right now, as our government spies on its own civilians.

The ending of the Man of Steel could have saved the entire film by adding gravity to Supermans actions. He needed to make a conscious decision to never take another life, no matter what. Instead, it levels Metropolis and shrugs it off like nothing has happened. In Man of Steel, Superman isn't the paradigm of a hero, hes just an alien who can punch stuff really hard.",1388707200,,3767,4.67420814479638

5782122,3,B00D91GRA4,"The film is quite good. Just entertaining but not inspirational as a Superman film must be. Too much CGI instead of character development. It had potential though, in a sequel, which is already compromised by WB wish to compete with Avengers 2, prematurely turning Man of Steel 2 in Justice League movie... we'll see.

But since this is a ""product review"", I won't waste your time by acting like a movie critic wannabe.

If you're reading this, you have probably seen the film, enjoyed it and is thinking about buying it. So let's talk about the extra content:

The special features are very interesting. Even though the final product was somewhat disappointing, it makes you appreciate all the effort and talent dedicated to the film. At the same time, makes you frustrated knowing that this could have been the best Superman film ever if the same effort and talent were properly used. (Film critic moment, sorry!)

Extras disc: The 2nd disc is basically the whole movie again, this time with cast and crew comments. Lots of insightful and amusing information about the making of the film. Descriptions of every scene as you watch it. Personally, I'd prefer it separated in categories (casting, special effects, music, etc). But it's also entertaining as is.

3D disc: I've seen it in 3D in theaters only. The CGI gains much more impact in 3D, looking dull in 2D. Since I don't care much about 3D, I haven't really tried watching it on TV.

DVD disc: with 2 blu-ray discs available in this combo pack (2D and 3D), who needs a DVD?

5782147,4,B00D91GRA4,"Honestly, I've never been that big of a Superman fan. I liked him in the Justice League show, and I liked the Christopher Reeve version, but my opinion never reached much farther than ""liked."" Man of Steel, however, looks to change that.

The origin story is very similar to what we've previously seen. Krypton is dying, so Jor-El sends his newborn son into space to live among the humans. This son gets raised by two Kansans: Jonathan and Martha Kent. He later discovers that earth's sun gives him superpowers. Long story short, he becomes Superman. These aspects are the same as any other Superman origin story. However, several little details are changed. To avoid spoilers, I'm not going to go into them. These changes that I'm going to avoid mentioning really advance and dramatize the classic story, as did Batman Begins and The Amazing Spider-Man.

One of the things I particularly liked was the characters. Superman is very similar to what we normally see, although I sympathize with him easier. I really like Henry Cavill's performance, and I would say that this is by far my favorite version of Superman. With him as Superman,Christian Bale as Batman, and Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man, I'm starting to believe that British actors playing the lead is like good luck when it comes to superhero movies. Other characters such as Perry White who didn't stick out to me before are really good characters in this one. Jor-El, being played by Russell Crowe, much cooler than any other version of him. Speaking of which, the fact that this movie could get acting legends Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner is quite surprising. Another notable character change is Lois Lane. In pretty much every version previously, I've never liked her. She was generally very screamy. This one is actually not annoying, and at least tolerable. Amy Adams' performace surprised me, because she usually plays very lighthearted characters.

Like the Dark Knight trilogy, Hans Zimmer does the music to this film and, as expected, makes an epic soundtrack. Though it consists of sounds that sound like the same instruments of the Dark Knight soundtrack, the sound is very much different, with a more lively, exciting sound to it.

What surprised me the most about this movie was the action scenes. Superman, at least to my knowledge, isn't generally known for his action scenes. That being said, I didn't think Superman could ever have a cool action sequence. Man of Steel not only proved me wrong, but proved that Superman could have some of the coolest action scenes in the history of ever! The final battle scene in particular rivals action scenes from any of the Transformers movies and The Avengers.

Spoilers follow in the next paragraph

I would also like to highlight the dilemma at the end of the final battle, where Superman either kills Zod or lets the innocent family die. For some reason, this dilemma is often negatively received by die-hard Superman fans. However, as IGN pointed out, the resolve isn't new to Superman. Superman has killed quite a few people in the comics, particularly Zod. Even the Christopher Reeve version of Superman kills Zod in the Director's Cut version of Superman II. Using common sense, it should also be noted that if Superman didn't kill Zod, than an innocent family would have died. The movie shows that there really wasn't any other way. This was a perfect dilemma for Superman, especially once you see his reaction after he decides.

Spoiler end

Man of Steel is pretty much the best thing to happen to Superman in a long time. The characters and story are great, the soundtrack is very cool, and the action and special effect are phenomenal. This movie turned Superman into one of my favorite superheroes. I would highly recommend this to any fans of Superman, fans of The Dark Knight series, or just superheroes in general.

5782148,1,B00D91GRA4,No character development and just one action scene after another. Don't waste your money on this weak movie. Nothing like the prior movies.,1388620800,3,139,5.086956521739131
5782149,4,B00D91GRA4,"If you purchase this dvd, it goes to show that you like the movie. So this isn't a movie review, its a review of the dvd; which is pretty lackluster compared to its blu-ray counterpart. There is no audio options for switching between stereo 5.1, 7.1, or higher. The special features, which amount to about 20 minutes, are nice; but if you buy the blu ray you get more then 4 hours of bonus features.

Overall it looks like very little care went into the DVD version of Man Of Steel. If you have a blu-ray player, I recommend you buy it and not this as it is far more worth the money.",1388620800,,583,4.15929203539823

5782152,5,B00D91GRA4,"One of the best superhero movies I've seen in the past decade.  People complain about the massive destruction that takes place as weak point in the film, but I herald it as an example of what happens when god-like beings fight amongst mortal earthlings.  Carnage ensues.  The destruction had depth and felt like it was causing a lot of pain and suffering, which is what it's meant to do. Compare this end battle to the battle in THE AVENGERS.  The stakes feel higher in MAN OF STEEL.

Cavill is great as Superman, and the supporting cast is excellent. Props to Diane Lane and Kevin Costner as Ma and Pa Kent!",1388620800,4,608,4.490909090909091

It's very well done though, with some amazing effects, an interesting story and it's great to see Supes back on-screen. Also, I partially agree with the comments about destruction, the end was a bit CGI heavy and something of a smashathon.

5782171,4,B00D91GRA4,"I thought the film was pretty good but a few misnotes.  Zack Snyder is heavy on visuals and action/violence in this film like his other films.  He obviously still misses his 300 days and puts all of Zod's people in armor.  (slight spoiler alert) Any reason for Krypton's flying creatures along with alien flying craft?  The film was relatively long in part because of gratituous action scenes from past sequences.  Jor-El (superman's biologic father) is made to be a pretty good fighter also.
Fighting between superpowered beings like superman?  Yes wide real estate damage is expected.  But too much effort is put trying to shock and awe the audience.  Instead, I'm sure some people are wondering why superman doesn't try to divert the damage elsewhere.  But the director is having too much fun filming mass destruction scenes.  Cavill, Adams, and whole cast do a good job.  So pretty good but needs a lighter directing touch.  (Maybe they were trying to differentiate from Bryan Singer's superman effort.

I thought Cavill was good, if somewhat limited in his usage, not unlike Arnold back in the day - fits the role well, but not an impressive acting performance.

MIchael Shannon is one of my favorites and was perfect for this role, but I still think the original Zod was a more fun bad guy.

Amy Adams never seems to fail to impress, great performance, a pleasure to watch.

The direction they took Superman was as if he was almost Batman, it's all black and gray with at times that lazy shaky cam effect.  Humorless, uninspired are what I think about. They even decided to not use Williams original score that is so attached to what Superman is, at least for me. Other than 300, not sure Zack Synder is the right guy to continue Superman.

Maybe because I grew up watching Superman that I always expect something different from Batman, like he is the polar opposite of him. With this film, it's like he saw Batman and said ""I'm going to be just like him""

At first I wasn't sure whether or not to get it; am glad I did.  Top-shelf stars and an engaging, fast-paced story make this remake of the origin story well worth watching; I'll watch it many times in the years to come. Bravo!

5782201,3,B00D91GRA4,"I've never seen a movie about Superman be so devisive as this one.  Yes, I'm partial to the Christopher Reeve films, but I also understand that times change.  Superman has been attempted to be rebooted in the comics multiple times and they always end up going back to the basics.  This is the first reboot attempt on film and it does some things right, but many things wrong.

What worked?
- Krypton.  The beginning of this film is gold.  The worst parts of the Reeve film was the silly Krypton parts.  This movie does that right and it is perfectly cast and executed.  I want to see more of this Krypton and Crowe as Jor-El.
- Henry Cavill.  At times I saw Reeve and Tom Welling from Smallville in Cavill.  He has the look and build and I had no problems with his portrayal.
- Zod.  Michael Shannon did a great job as Zod.  He felt more like the Zod from the past several years in the comics.  A soldier that loves Krypton and wants to protect it at all costs.

What didn't work?
Amy Adams.  I just didn't like her as Lois.  My opinion softened a little after watching it a second time, but Lois needs more bite than I think Adams can deliver.
Secret identity. He did nothing to protect it in this movie.  Lois figured it out in no time and it wouldn't be hard for anyone else to either.
Jonathan Kent.  Costner did fine in the role, but he just doesn't act like any Jonathan we've seen before.  He protects his son, that much is true, but the way he teaches him is all wrong.
The ending.  I can't discuss without spoiling, but I hated the ending.  Many defend Superman's decision as being necessary, but that choice goes against 75 years of history about the character.  Yes, the same decision has been made in comics, but it has always been retconned.  Superman does what he does to protect a single family.  This is true to the character, but that same character does nothing to avoid the destruction of building after building in the city.  Buildings that fall on top of people and that could be full of people.  Why would he care so much about one family, but not seem to care about the potential deaths of hundreds of other people?

It's a first step in a revamp.  I'm hoping that the events in this movie shape the character into more of what Superman traditionally has been.  If that is the case, then I will see this movie in a different light.  Unfortunately, I'm not sure if the Superman/Batman/Wonder Woman filled sequel will allow the character to develop.  Time will tell.",1388448000,,2487,4.4
5782202,1,B00D91GRA4,"15 minutes into this movie, I felt tired. The editing/pacing is weird and confusing. The second half of the movie is
so CGI heavy it feels like a video game that you're not in control of. The director definitely doesn't understand the concept
of 'less is more'.

The original Superman starring Christopher Reeve unfolded and developed, and when action occurred, it was fresh and exciting. It had atmosphere. This movie hardly ever lets up and gives you time to think, and when it does it feels forced. All the quick-zooming and lens flares and particle effects just make your head spin. But for the gamer generations, I guess anything else feels too slow.

If you have an explosion happen every 15 seconds in a movie, after about 2 minutes the explosions have absolutely no impact or effect whatsoever. I was bored. Glossy, choppy, overwhelming, soulless.

PS: The original Superman was FUN. It's supposed to be. This is so dark and serious it just comes across as silly. I mean, it's a guy flying around in his underwear. Lighten up.",1388448000,54,1034,4.76536312849162

Definitely recommend this set to Superman fans like myself.

5782227,2,B00D91GRA4,"If Man of Steel were just another sci-fi movie, I would be happy that I watched it on a plane where I had to find something to pass the time and didn't have to pay for the experience.  As a fan of the original Donner movies, the 2000s animated series, and having a passing interest in the comics, it was even less enjoyable.

Half the time the special effects and action scenes made me feel like I was watching the third Matrix movie - where everyone is already invincible and just fly around hitting each other so we can see how much damage they can do.  So much of the movie was taken up by this action, that there was no emotional depth or reaction to characters.

The fact that Superman appears perfectly content to fight Zod while rampaging through Metropolis undoubtedly killing or at least injuring 100s makes the attempts at Superman's moral turmoil around killing or letting die seem silly.

The utter absence of a difference between Superman and Clark is even worse than Dean Cain's portrayal; serving to make Christopher Reeve's awesome dichotomy all the better, if that can be seen as a bright spot.

The fact that Warner has to insert half the other Justice League members into the next Superman movie serves to show how lacking this iteration is.  How WB can get animated series like Batman and Superman so right, yet totally blow Superman as movie is a mystery.",1388361600,,1376,4.591836734693878

5782236,1,B00D91GRA4,"It's true, our entire culture suffers from men who choose to reflect Peter Pan rather than Indiana Jones, and this movie and its success is the perfect example.

It doesn't suffer from properly developed characters that allow you to relate with, nor is it weighed down by its traditional moving score composed by John Williams, and its shaky camera footage, jittery zooms, and disjointed theatrical rhythm removes the need for a qualified director -> which explains why they chose Zack Snyder.

Additionally, it offers gratuitous CGI, and numbing explosive action that effectually replaces plot twists and any intellectual processing for the film -> perfect for those who shy away from movies that emotionally impact you and make you think.

But, the biggest reason the Peter Pan generation loves this film is because the Superman we love and cherish forgot to show up. Yes, it's the perfect movie for those who were offended by his moralism, his patriotism, his humanity, his sacrificial nature, and his love for protecting the masses at any cost to himself. After all, Peter Pan only cares about fun and himself.

The new theme music was totally different from the John Williams score (which I think is still the best Superman musical score), but the more I watched it (5-times) the more I liked it and it was nice to really see Superman be Super.

He had the look, but they should have considered dubbing his voice over with someone else's that might have better fit the character.  The new take on Krypton was pretty interesting.  One question that stood out in my mind was - at the end when they unleash the ""world engines"" how is it broad daylight at opposite ends of the earth at the same time?  A lot of time is spent watching nearly-invincible beings beat the crap out of each other and watching things blow up, buldings crumble, etc, so if you are into Michael Bay inspired pyrotechnics then you will love this movie.

And somehow she shows up in every scene no matter how far away she is or how much trauma she's been through. They made Lois Lane look like a superwoman. Yeah! Feminists screenwriters! Too many flashbacks and broken unrealistic storylines. Clark's father gets killed by a rogue tornado as he stands there calmly on an interstate highway and waves goodbye while Clark just stands there and watches!...REALLY???Hollyweird???So stupid! Also no character ever sheds a tear with all the tragedy going on and people dying?Way too much over-the-top flying around and fighting in the air. They didn't take time to develop the characters so you could like them and sympathize with them. Most of the movie is spent with fighting and special effects. I guess Hollywood Liberals figure young people are so shallow these days that they don't have to actually care. The idiots who made this version must have been smoking crack. This is a second rate sci-fi action movie at best. Iron Man,Batman,and X-men were much better films. Star Trek and Serenity and Avatar were even much better. Superman is too violent and complicated for children and too stupid and dumbed down for adults....It was made for shallow teenagers only.",1388275200,,1383,5.017391304347826

Certainly because of Christopher Nolan's influence this reboot had a more ""real"" component to the story, rather than the campy versions before, although I think the reboot with Brandon Routh was too harshly criticized.  My criticism of the movie is that I thought the early development of the character and his back story was disjointed and not fully explored or explained before the invasion by General Zod.  The truth is that I wish General Zod had come in the SECOND Superman movie, after a ""Superman Begins"" movie, just like there was a ""Batman Begins"" before there was The Joker.  I'm worried too now for the franchise because Superman 2 will not jump right to a Justice League movie with Batman and Wonder Woman.  There is so much more to explore with Superman before we jump into a team movie, but that doesn't seem as if it will happen.  So, the director and producers have their work cut out for them.

That was way over to top. I like the Zod in Christoper Reeves movie.

Getting the characters right, getting the story right, getting the action right..everything. It poses the question in a real world setting, ""What would it be like if the World woke up one day and suddenly found that an alien (Superman) had been living amongst them for decades"" The story has familiar themes but director Zack Snyder takes them to logical places that you would never think of, but welcome. From the way General Zod's character was written about his endless pursuits to save Krypton one way or another, to Johnathan and Martha Kent brilliantly portrayed by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane. Trust me, this film is an amazing story and is brilliantly told. Oh by the way, the fight scenes are now legendary. This is how Super beings from other planets fight, dirty. Much has been written about the films destruction, but if you've seen Avengers, this is no different, just better executed. Enjoy",1388188800,,1040,4.71978021978022

The action in the end is too long & is like the movie Transformers with pure city destruction BUT with a seriously high death toll.

Buildings being knocked down in Metropolis brought back bad memories of 9/11. Maybe I'm just over sensitive but I'm sure a few of you will agree. I still like the Christopher Reeve Superman movies best (especially the first two) and George Reeves tv depiction brings back fond memories of the 50's.  Superman's costume needs to keep with tradition with it's bright blue, red, and yellow.  After all...The Man of Steel was once just comic book character...",1388102400,2,617,4.747663551401869

5782359,5,B00D91GRA4,I like this movie more than any reason because it humanizes the man of steel more so than ever before. The story bounces around a little in the beginning but if you know superman lore you pretty much can keep up. It explores the man of steel making allegiances and if this is the jumping off point to a Justice League movie then I can't wait for that.,1388102400,,351,4.176470588235294

5782363,1,B00D91GRA4,"In this re-boot of the Superman franchise, the powers that be took a perfectly good Superman story and turned it into a tedious, generic sci-fi flick filled with brainless violence and mindless sci-fi drivel. There aren't enough adjectives in the English language for me to adequately describe how utterly horrible this movie is. If I could give it negative five stars, I would do it. The story is one dimensional at best. There is virtually no character development. Some of the dialogue is so ridiculous, it's as if the writers assumed most of the audience would be made up of people with a single digit IQ. Like when Zod tells Superdude during their 'climactic' (HA!) battle scene ""this is going to end one way, with my death or yours."" Duh, no kidding Sherlock. Where did you park your squad car?

If you like mindless violence and tedious special effects devoid of any real story, then this is your kind of movie. However, if you like good story telling and character development that allows you to actually care about what happens to the characters, then move along. There is nothing to see here.",1388102400,10,1102,4.739583333333333

5782366,3,B00D91GRA4,Rented this through Amazon. Great picture. I thought the movie itself had a little too much destruction and Superman was vulnerable too much. As compared to older movies. Superman was always indestructible but in this movie there are parts where he is weak. So I give it an OK rating.,1388102400,,284,4.7
5782367,5,B00D91GRA4,Love the way they portrait Superman in this movie. I will say that the battle in the city made me think of the buildings crashing down during 9/11. Comic books don't give you the idea that people are dying as the buildings fall but more of everyone is home safe except those unlucky few running away in the streets.

5782371,4,B00D91GRA4,"My back ground goes back some 57 years as a super fan of Superman. I grew up with DC comics and Superman was my super star. I remember George Reeves and Noel Neill, Christopher Reeves and Margo Kidder, Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher, Tom Welling and Erica Durance. These I consider the best of all the characters. Each had their own interpretation of the characters and their own story line. The Man of Steel is no different. Although much darker and a lot of emphasis was put on visual effects, The Man of Steel was entertaining. I thought Henry Cavill made a good Superman. Amy Adams is a good actress but her character wasn't developed very well. Also, being a red head, I thought she would have ben better suited for Lana Lang (I am a bit of a traditionalist when it comes to Superman). I did miss the boyish charm of Clark and the medaling Lois that the characters are best known. I think the success of the Man of Steel shows that there is a loyal following of Superman and there is room for as many good Superman movies as they would like to make.  I hope that Tom Welling, Erica Durance and Michael Rosenbaum get their chance to revive their rolls in a major movie. These three captured the characters better than any other since Christopher Reeves and Margo Kidder. The point is, that there are so many successful Superman interpretations that there will always be room for more.",1388102400,,1384,4.492063492063492
5782372,3,B00D91GRA4,"I absolutely loved the first 66% of this movie.  Excellent Superman... A compelling story line that differentiated enough from previous Superman moveis so as not to compare them directly, yet still follows the true Superman narrative.  I was totally hooked on this movie and 2/3rds through it, I couldn't figure out why the ratings were so low.  But then...
The end of the movie was insane... too insane.  The level of distruction and mayhem thrown in were just soooo over the top that so much of the personal story that was built up in the beginning was completely overwhelmed.  The CG was actually really good... but it was just the sheer level of destruction that became mind numbing.  I mean... there's only so many times you can show up close buildings collapsing.  They try to capture a personal bit with some gal (I think from the planet's office) pinned in rubble and they're trying to save her, but it's hard to feel compassion for someone you just met when the entire city is being ravaged and likely millions are dying.
Anyway, if you're into total distruction, than just fastforward to the end.  If you're looking for a good movie, than just watch the first 2/3rds, than switch to something else.  I actually love disaster/apocolypse movies, but this one was too much for me.  But, I must say... this is my favorite Superman (character) of all.",1388102400,,1356,4.731914893617021

I also received it when I ordered it, which was two day service so I could receive it on the day it was released.  I would use this company again for future orders.

As I put in almost all my reviews, I will not disclose much detail about the movie itself.  My reasoning for that is I don't want to take a chance of ruining it for other viewers.  With that said:

This movie was awesome! Henry Caville plays an excellent Superman.  You have your Lois Lane, Clark Kent and that type of scenario in this movie, however, there are a quite few differences. But these are really good differences. For example, like you see in the reviews, you watch a young Clark Kent saving a bus load of children that ends up leaving witnesses.  Those witnesses cause him a little bit of trouble.  There's not that much more I can tell you without giving it away, except for:  There is awesome action, (a LOT of action), a much better storyline than the old one, and a fantastic ending.

I've watched this movie about four times already and I can't wait to see what they come up with next with this Superman.  Or should I say Man of Steel.  As for it being in 3-D, there really isn't that much that comes out at you, but it was still better to watch in 3-D than it was in 2-D.  If you only get 3-D because you want to see the in your face type of stuff, then this would not be the one to get in 3-D.  Overall I would definitely recommend this movie.

5782390,5,B00D91GRA4,"As a kid, my favorite movie was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-The-Movie-1978/dp/B0012QVJXS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman: The Movie (1978)</a>.  Naturally, that is the flick that MAN OF STEEL is going to be compared to ~ 35yrs later!  Wow, has it really been that long?

As such, let's take a look at the actors.  Unlike SUPERMAN 1978, MAN OF STEEL is a star-studded venture.  Outside of Marlon Brando & Gene Hackman, most of the cast of SUPERMAN were relative unknowns.  MAN OF STEEL, on the other hand, features Russel Crowe as Jor-el, Kevin Costner & the lovely Diane Lane as the Kents and Lawrence Fishburne as Perry White.

The current superhero reboot departs from the old Krypton mythology, where the red giant sun of Krypton causes the planet to explode.  Instead of its sun, it's the Kryptonians' messing with the planet's ecology that is screwing everything up (an obvious allusion to the threat of global warming here on earth).  As intelligent & sophisticated as the Kryptonians are, they have something in common with we earthlings:  a high council that bears an uncanny resemblence to our very own do-nothing congress!  Jor-el struggles to get them to ""see the light"" but his oratorical reasoning is all in vain.  Crowe does a great job of relaying a sense of frustration in a dignified manner.

Costner & Lane are a perfect fit as a midwestern couple that accidentally become a part of the greatest adoption story ever told.  Also in a departure from the typical Superman mythology, they are not elderly but middle aged;  young enough to be Clark's parents rather than his grandparents.

Fishburne's Perry White has more depth than the usual depiction of White as the archetypal ornery & demanding boss.  This Perry White has a paternal interest in his employees and genuinely cares about their well being.  That's new territory in a character that's mostly known more for yelling & screaming than anything else.

And then, of course, we have Amy Adams as Lois Lane.  My, oh my, oh my ~ Amy Adams!!  Listen:  I actually liked Margot Kidder as Lois way-back-when, but Amy Adams is a HUGE upgrade!!  She is beautiful yet feisty, feminine yet proactive and no-nonsense.  I dare say that they could make a movie about Lois Lane & subtract Superman out of the equation altogether.  So long as Amy Adams portrayed Lois, it would fly!!  {pun intended}

Finally, Henry Cavill nailed the part of Kal-el / Clark Kent.  He has a very impressive physique ~ much more buffed up than the late Christopher Reeve was in the original.  This is a very introspective story of the superhero;  a superhero who struggles & is actually pained by his attempts to gain control of his powers.  Cavill plays the shy / strong-silent type who is condemned to being a loner very well.

If you're looking for a re-imagined telling of the story of Superman, then this movie is for you!  If you don't think you'll like another reboot of the Superman mythology, then I would admonish you to give this 1 a try anyway.  It's worth getting on Blu Ray for the tremendous sound quality & eye candy special effects.  That said, it's the acting & the ""different direction"" that this Superman movie takes that separates it from its predecessors.",1388016000,,3278,4.963235294117647

5782392,5,B00D91GRA4,"Henry Caville makes a great new Superman.  And this is a great new vehicle for Superman, concentrating on his origins, more about Krypton and his family and culture.  Flash backs inform the audience of his younger life on Earth and the choices he must make to keep his alien origins a secret.  In this version, Superman exposes himself to the world when Zod comes to Earth to find him.  Through the help of Lois Lane (Amy Adams),  he is able to convince the government/military that he is on humanity's side.  Lois has found out his secret and knows his alter ego and human family.  Zod is very well played by Michael Shannon.  Russell Crowe plays Jor El.  The 3D special effects are superb.  The soundtrack is marvelous.  The special features include a look at Krypton and the culture that shaped Superman.

Cardboard characters in comic books had NO DEPTH, so all the angst manufactured for these retread remakes is horsepucky. This particular movie was TERRIBLE and only an excuse for the makers to just put SFX explosions and destruction on screen. The extended battle scenes are ludicrous.

The lead actor is silly and has no screen magnetism, but maybe he must have slept with someone to get cast in the lead. His body looks great, but so does everyone in Hollywood, where people spend days working out to be on screen, so that is NO excuse to cast them in a movie, unless they occupy the casting couch. His screams of effort in the movie are pathetic (I blame the Director for that stupidity).

The man playing General Zod is silly, too, and sounds like Kenneth McMillan, a character actor with a very distinguished past in Hollywood, but again, Zach Snyder, as he did in WATCHMEN, miscasts an entire movie, with bland actors who don't scare or inspire ANYONE...

The music score in the film, by Hans Zimmer, is musical leprosy, and completely tuneless.

5782409,1,B00D91GRA4,"IN SHORT
MAN OF STEEL begins with a well-done 20-minute setup on Krypton, relying heavily on fairly-well-designed stunningly-executed computer graphics, and would probably rate 4 out of 5 on its own.  The remainder of the movie is almost entirely action in excellent, seamless CG, but repetitive and excessive, and utterly lacking in any other essential components of a story, such as plotting and character development, and with problems of internal inconsistency and implausibility.  The resolution is implausible and incomplete.

PERSONAL COMMENT
Like THE HOBBIT movies, MAN OF STEEL could have been greatly improved by cutting a half-hour of unnecessary, repetitive, gratuitous violence.  I'm a guy, I like action---but it simply went on and on so long, and so repetitively, that it got boring.  It really burns my butt that a superb series like STARGATE UNIVERSE was canceled because the very-limited computer graphics were ""too expensive"".  Five minutes of the CG wasted on MAN OF STEEL (or the HOBBIT movies) could have paid for a whole season of SG-U, the whole budget of SG-U, not just the CG.

CRITIQUE---from a storyteller's perspective
> MAN OF STEEL is unconstrained even by the ""laws"" of physics.  The aliens are utterly invincible and omnipotent.  So the audience is reduced to passive observers of the inexplicable.  That is very poor storytelling.
> The best stories are about successes which are achieved with great difficulty by struggling within constraints, of law, of human nature, of expectations, of morality, etc..  Many stories are precisely about stretching or testing those limits.  This is what stories are made of---because these are precisely the challenges we all experience in our ordinary lives.

RULES OF THE GAME
> In fantasy (or any game or any sport, which are very simplified fantasy worlds), the ""rules"" are essential.  Not merely important, but rather essential.
> If the audience knows the rules-of-the-game or constraints-of-the-fantasy-world, they can become involved by anticipating potential problems and they can figure out solutions to the problems.
EXAMPLE: When watching football---the main viewer activity is yelling at the quarterback, telling him what play to call, and how to execute it.  Would watching a football game be any fun if three were no rules at all, no ""plays"", if any ""player"" could do anything at any time?
EXAMPLE: in ERAGON (the book, not the mediocre movie), doing magic was a great strain on the user, so his/her physical strength had to be conserved and wisely used.  Readers could anticipate when a character might be be tempted to over-extend himself.  Readers could anticipate strategies which could be used do conserve strength.  And as it happened, the character usually did what the reader expected (or feared). That made the reader a participant in the story, and made the novels very satisfying.  Same for Rowling and Tolkien novels and movies.

DEUS MACHINA
> Even the ancient Greeks had a derisive term (""deus machina"") for poorly crafted stories which ended by a god just showing up and resolving all conflicts and problems by decree (essentially by unconstrained unspecified ""magic"").
> The ""resolution"" of the movie (when the Big S smashed head-first through the terraforming machine and ""black hole"" reactor and then snapped the even thicker neck of his equally invincible fellow alien) were pure (and self-contradictory) ""deus machina"" moments.

HEROISM?
I refuse to call the main character in this movie SUPERMAN---because he isn't the Superman I grew up with.  The Big S is supposed to be a heroic figure--Right?  Heroism is about overcoming ordinary limits (especially of fear and pain) and scraping hard against absolute limits (such as risking death).  If there are no limits, no effort, no challenge, no risk, there is no heroism.  There is nothing heroic about the Big S.

AN AMERICAN EMBLEM?
Are we suppose to get all mushy over a guy (the big S) who selectively ""saves"" a few random individuals, ignores dozens falling from buildings, and indirectly murders tens of thousands by carelessly destroying occupied vehicles and buildings?  The Big S is just a big dumb brainless thug---""a bull in a china shop"".  The best you can say about him is that he is a thug on our side.  Tragically, that is how most of the world thinks about America.  The SUPERMAN of my childhood was an admirable moral man, a strong man, but a man, who tried his best---an appropriate symbol for the America which was once respected.

OVERDONE ACTION
Violence is pointless if all the characters are utterly invincible.  A contest of strength is only interesting if there is the possibility and likelihood that one will win and the other will loose.  The Big S and his fellow aliens can be thrown through a dozen buildings without mussing their hair.  Once you are satiated by the shear visual impact of the CG, MAN OF STEEL is about as exciting as watching two babies throw marshmallows at each other.

IMPLAUSIBILITIES
Suspension of disbelief can go only so far, and MAN OF STEEL was way over-the-top for any intelligence-unimpaired individual.
> Why do invincible aliens pay the slightest attention to soldiers with mere guns, when missiles have no effect on them?
> Why punch a helpless pathetic human when you can toss him (or her) a mile away with a flick of your wrist?
> And, these super-aliens happen to carry knifes in case a knife fight with a human is in order?  Really?
> What happened to the aliens which were not on the terraforming machine when it was destroyed?  Perhaps they just surrendered, formed a little farming community in Iowa, and applied for green cards ??
> While it was reasonable that the original SUPERMAN worked as a shy, self-effacing, mild-mannered newspaper reporter, it is utterly implausible that the bulky negligent egocentric Big S could do so.
> Is destroying multi-million dollar aircraft really the best way a guy with god-like powers and technology can conceal his liar from human eyes?  And just what lair is that? Wasn't his spaceship destroyed?  Is the writer/director confusing the Big S with Batman?
> A complete list of implausibilities and inconsistencies could go on for pages.  The above are just the ones that particularly triggered my barf reaction.  MAN OF STEEL is a two-rolls-of-duct-tape movie (you wind it around your head to keep it from exploding).

GRAPHIC DESIGN
The design of much of the other worldly technology was imaginative---but largely derivative.  That is, most has been done before, much has been done better, and most of the original stuff simply makes no sense.  Are these aliens color blind? or just plain blind??---all their graphic displays are circular very-low-resolution monochrome (apparently in flowing textured metal).  Could you work with such a crappy computer display?  They might be great touch (feel) displays for the visually impaired (blind), but not so great for folks with normal vision; ridiculous for aliens with super-vision.

ACTING
Many reviewers complain about the acting.  In my opinion the acting in the few pauses between the endless CG action scenes was mostly maudlin and cliched, but adequate.  The failure of the underlying story to engage the audience was the fault of the directors/editors, not the actors.

STARGATE UNIVERSE---recommendation
If you haven't watched SG-U since the series, I very strongly recommend that you try it.  It is MUCH better the second time, and MUCH better as  binges.  The first time you watch SG-U, you don't know the characters, and don't care what happens to them, and so the story kinda drags, but the second time you watch it is an entirely different experience--you become emotionally involved, because you know the characters.  The individual episodes, aired a week apart, were often depressing, because the resolution didn't happen until next week---but in binges of 4 or 5 episodes in an evening you get the crises and the resolutions together.  I'm not an SG fan in the normal since.  (I know no SG trivia, I've never been to an SG website, I know nothing of the actors, and you couldn't drag me to an SG convention).  Yet I've watched the whole series 4 times (in binges 6--9 months apart)---and every time, I have enjoyed it more.  The two complete seasons are about $10 each used, or $15 each new on DVD.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SGU-Stargate-Universe-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B00402FGE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SGU: Stargate Universe - The Complete First Season</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SGU-Stargate-Universe-The-Complete-Final-Season/dp/B004TJ1H3C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SGU: Stargate Universe - The Complete Final Season</a>",1387929600,27,8755,5.26657060518732

5782435,4,B00D91GRA4,"I thought this was a nice angle on a story we already know.  The difference here, aside from the flashbacks to Superman's childhood, is the more in-depth character development of General Zod.  Sure he is evil, however, from the standpoint of wanting to preserve his race, you could at least see where he is coming from.  He is not just evil for evil's sake - he thinks he is right - even if it means obliterating another race (ours) to save his own.
Of course, lots of action and Henry Cavill makes a superb Superman!

5782436,5,B00D91GRA4,"This is the first Superman movie I have seen where the abilities of the character (as defined in the comics and lore) are accurately depicted, and for that reason I rate it five stars. I truly felt like Superman was a demigod-like alien, as opposed to being somebody who was slapped around by Lex Luthor's humble human bodyguards (as was the case in ""Superman Returns""). The speed, power, and energy of the last son of Krypton is truly a sight to behold in this film, and it was a stroke of genius to finally set Superman across from some enemies who could truly test his abilities. Furthermore, I feel that the actor who plays Clark Kent does a wonderful job of conveying the humility, humbleness, and strong values of the character.

Christopher Nolan's cinematography style is thoroughly imprinted on this movie (and I think that's a good thing), though the tone is strikingly different from the Batman movies. This is as it should be, I feel, because the two characters play on completely different ball fields. There is no sense in pitting Superman against human sociopaths like the Joker or Scarecrow, instead it makes far more sense to have him do battle with supremely powerful alien beings and their advanced technology. Nolan and Snyder take advantage of the power at their disposal in the Superman character (finally, somebody does!), and they put on a sci-fi extravaganza that is nothing short of astounding. However, they also maintain the character's most interesting flaws, as well- his sense of uncertainty and vulnerability as he tries to find his place in a world that was never supposed to be his, but that he has come to adopt as his own.

The Blu-ray transfer is top notch, with incredibly sharp visuals and great audio. Highly recommended!",1387843200,,1761,4.847176079734219

5782446,2,B00D91GRA4,"While the directing and editing seemed to shine at times (though perhaps steeling too much from other films), this film, overall, suffers from a rotten story.  Not to say that the whole story was bad  see Jor-El played wonderfully by Russell Crowe  but, overall the story lacked too much depth and character to be worthy of the Christopher Reeve Superman franchise.

For example, while taking some scenic photographs ostensibly for the Daily Planet, Lois Lane sees a stranger walking along a mountainside and inexplicably decides to follow him.  From her vantage point, she had to traverse a quite a distance along a seemingly steep mountainside just to follow some random guy that she saw simply walking from a distance.  The fact that she managed to stay just steps behind Superman, despite being so far away initially was not as annoying as to why she decided to follow some random guy for no reason in the first place.  Unfortunately, this was just one example of too many in the film.

Furthermore, there was absolutely no chemistry between Lois Lane and Superman  everything in their relationship seemed forced and unreasonable.  To put it bluntly, the casting was awful for the pair.  Also, the original romantic suspense between Lois Lane and Clark Kent/Superman was simply tossed aside  Lois Lane here meets Superman first and they are miraculously bonded from the start for no apparent reason.

Finally, Jonathan Kent (played by Kevin Costner) was a huge disappointment to say the least.  Instead of learning valuable lessons from his father on Earth  his father repeatedly kept trying to ingrain super selfishness in Superman.  His main and repeated stance in this film was better to let innocents  even children  die, than to let people know that he could do things others could not.  Always think of yourself before you think of others.  When Clark struggled with this philosophy, he was chastised by his father.  This would seem to represent the opposite of middle-American values.  Maybe the film should have had Superman land in Los Angeles or Hollywood.

Overall, the film simply lacked too much to stand alongside the original Christopher Reeve adaptation of Superman.",1387756800,6,2186,5.044692737430168

5782462,5,B00D91GRA4,"Upon watching ""Superman Returns"", I was surprised that, after all the years that has passed since the 1st Chris Reeves film, it was simply a rehash of that older (and better) film, though Brandon Ruth did a passable imitation of Reeves, and Kevin Spacey did a good impression of Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor. Therefore, I was expecting ""Man of Steel"", following hard on ""Returns""' trail, to be an apology and take it to the next level, and I'm glad to say that I was definitely not disappointed.

The first thing I noticed was the photography, done in a grittily realistic way, with harsh shadows and realistic lighting.  I wouldn't have thought that a fantasy like ""Superman"" would lend itself to that sort of filming, and it was a daring choice on the part of the director, but it works great in this instance.  Perhaps that's just the kind of detail it takes to bring the viewer intimately into the action and suspending disbelief while watching a story that is based on a premise utterly devoid of any reality.

I understand that in the last 2 decades, the Superman comics have taken a turn for the darker, as most superhero titles have in emulation of Frank Miller's ""the Dark Knight"", so I was rather concerned as to how they would portray him here.  No worries, this is still the same Superman we all know;  he's just in the real world now.  Henry Cavill's portrayal is also spot on, reflecting Reeve's optimism tempered with a slight reserve that might be instilled in him by the harsh choices the real world forces him to make.  And in spite of some very minor ""re-imagining"", I'm pleasantly surprised at how political correctness never reared its ugly head.

I've noticed a recurring theme in fantasy/sci-fi blockbusters recently.  ""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" and the ""Dark Knight"" films explored pretty much the same theme: the hero trying to defeat evil while struggling to keep himself above it.  MOS actually turned that theme on its head as only Superman can do.  Here, our hero has to struggle to find enough negativity in himself to do what needs to be done, then live with his actions.

I'd also like to address some criticisms of this movie.
  1) All CGI and no content - Bull, this movie had a lot of heart, a great cast, and a great story.  Yes, there is a lot of destruction
  action at the end, but everything happens to further the plot, and this is SUPERMAN!  What do you want, a lot of talky
  philosophical debates??  Also, though I, too, prefer rubber monsters over computer cartoons in my grade-B movies, the
  FX here are truly exceptional.  CGI has finally arrived, and the film makers themselves are no longer using it like some
  punk kid who just learned something new, but actually using some restraint in the camera angles and zooming close-ups.

  2) Superman should have lured the villains away from the city - this is an utterly stupid comment.  How many villains do you
  know who are so cooperative?  That's why they are villains.  Reality isn't always so convenient.  That might have worked
  in the comics of the '50s, but anyone who watches the film will see that Supes never really had the chance, things hap-
  pened so fast.  Superman has been toned down in the last 2 decades to not be QUITE so ""super"".

  3) Superman should have saved his father - I agree, but what happens does lend itself to a recurring theme in this movie.
  At any rate, it came nowhere near to spoiling the rest of the movie for me.

  4)Krypton's atmosphere...Earth's Sun...blah,blah... - I'm reviewing this movie based on the skill and imagination it took to
  make it, not judging it by how closely it sticks to the comics.  Yes, it should be faithful to its source material, and I'd say
  that it is in the most important aspects.  As for details of how kryptonians achieve super powers, is anybody really brain-
  dead enough to think that there can be any plausible theory put forth to explain what they do in this movie?  It's a ""what
  if"" fantasy;  accept that they do it and move on, otherwise, the whole thing will be made impossible, no matter how much
  techno-babble you inject.

After years of shaking my head at Hollywood's inability to come up with anything truly original, I'm finding that it is coming up with films that are really, really entertaining, at least. Yes, I enjoy Cohen Brother's and David Lynch films, as well as Sergio Leone, or
old classics like ""Frankenstein"" and ""Johnny Guitar"", but I'm not so narrow-minded as to turn my nose up at popular fare like this
movie, or ""the Avengers"".  This was a great viewing experience, if you give it a chance, and (shame for a die-hard Batman fan to admit), perhaps the most enjoyable superhero flick ever.  If you fanboys don't like it, then go pull your comic book collection out from under your bed.  I will be looking forward to the next installment.

As far as origin stories and reboots go, the writers did some nifty, creative twists, from what the S really stands for, as well as the reason for Cal-els existence. Henry Cavill is  duh  gorgeous to look at and embodies the Superman ideal in aesthetics as well as his moral goodness. Costners performance as his dad is subtle yet conveys so much  probably the best performance in the entire movie. The flashbacks to Clark Kent s angsty childhood were also the scenes that worked the most for me. What did not work was the overt, frankly preposterous, allusions to Superman as Christ. Nothing too subtle about framing Clark in a church with the stained glass icon of Jesus in the background and stating that hes 33 years old, etc. It was a turnoff. Plus, the movie was way too long.

5782479,1,B00D91GRA4,"After the disappointment that was Superman Returns, many fans put their hopes and dreams into Zack Snyder's reboot Man of Steel. The highly anticipated movie ended up splitting more viewers down the middle than the former but in the end now people can choose which Superman incarnation they prefer that best fits their tastes and needs.

The reboot retreads old ground despite trying very hard to go out of its way to shake things up by adding sci-fi Zack Snyder flourishes. This interpretation of Superman is no closer to the comics than any previous film was but just to be different Jor-El slips a codex containing all of the potential DNA of Kryptonians into his son Kal-El before mailing him off to Earth and Jonathan Kent dedicates himself to teaching his adopted son a valuable lesson that Clark doesn't even listen to anyway. The film also manages to slip in quotes from different stories of the titular character written in more recent years but without the same context of its original source.

Man of Steel and its trailers hammer on the fact that the 'S' is a symbol of hope and that Clark must make choices that will determine what kind of man he is. It's revealed that Kal-El is special since he is the only Kryptonian that doesn't have a designed and set destiny like the rest of his people on Krypton however throughout the movie the viewer may find it hard to determine if the main character has an opinion on the events that are unfolding or even a personality. Decisions are made for him by Jonathan, Jor-El, and even Zod to which the hero follows blindly without stopping to think, express an opinion, be defiant, or even come up with an alternative that would showcase some intellect. The film doesn't quite deliver on why Superman is so awesome that he would inspire people or would make them want to follow him 'into the sun' as Jor-El claims.

5782481,1,B00D91GRA4,"I was very happy to hear that a new Superman was on its way and couldn't wait to see it. I pre-ordered the movie so that it would ship as soon as it was available.

That, unfortunately, was the only excitement I experienced regarding Man of Steel. Spoiler alert, if you love the Christopher Reeves style of Superman, I sincerely think you, like so many others, will be disappointed with this movie. The basic essence of that Superman is nowhere to be found in Man of Steel. For example, in what Universe does Lois Lane know that Clark Kent is Superman? In fact, his identity wasn't really hidden much at all throughout the movie. There was also absolutely zero humor in this movie that you find in the classic Superman movies (picture the cab running in to Clark Kent as he first arrived at Metropolis or Clark catching a bullet with his hand saving Lois from a mugger, then fainting.. So many other examples I could use, but you get the point.

This version does spend a bit more time with some of the background of where Kalil comes from which was ok, but there was so little of what you come to expect, like various scenes of Superman getting the upper hand on criminals. In fact, I think it was a good 45 minutes in to this movie that we even got to see Superman in action.

It was very disappointing for me and really wish they would have simply created a version of the classics with today's technology in special effects. Why change what so many have come to love?",1387584000,7,1471,4.400735294117647

5782483,5,B00D91GRA4,"Man of Steel is most likely the greatest interpretation of Superman. It doesn't just apply incredibly realistic, awe-striking visual effects and scientific reason (like how Kal-El can jump far distances because of Earth's weaker gravity relative to Krypton), but also for the first time on the big screen gives Superman philosophy. Superman is THE Superhero in all of pop culture because he has weird alien qualities that make him learn about himself as a hero and his reason to exist with those odd qualities. His most story-arc fitting antagonist Zod tries to continue the kryptonian race by using destructive force on Earth to make it inhabitable by clones whom never question and behave like mindless and lifeless ants. Kal-El (Superman) as the protagonist fights this force by accepting his freakish nature and by being a person that doesn't downgrade himself to whatever society tells him to do. In addition to that, he also pushes his most predominant talents to the limits.

The moral of this film as expressed by Superman might be the greatest if not one of the greatest morals a human organism could conceive:

By being yourself and by pushing your most predominant qualities, you are not just a unique man, you are a Superman.

Zack Snyder: You have done Superman justice!

As someone with Aspergers syndrome, I always think to myself how much of a loner I am with my intellect and artistic creativity. I am grateful for those qualities and this Superman story gave me hope to push myself to achieve wonders.

Superman is one of my greatest icons!

Watch this film if you are human (aka not ""perfect"")!",1387584000,,1613,4.8901098901098905
5782484,2,B00D91GRA4,"I was excited to see this movie, even though I knew they changed several things in it (which is a bad sign when you take an iconic thing and start making changes). How disappointed I was. The first 10 min was good, and the last 10 min was good. Everything inbetween was poorly thought out and boring. Originally I was going to give 3 stars, then remembered my own ratings that is one I will watch again...

The direction was terrible, the story didn't develop until near the end of the movie. And I'm not impressed with most of the acting (but it's hard to say with a poor story, they weren't given much to work with. Zod was pretty good). Lines were cheesy and cliche in several spots that were supposed to be grand moments (""you're my father, I have so many questions""). They tried to cover too much and it seemed to randomly move quickly from one thing to the next without giving a reason for what was happening.
After the intro it was very slow moving. Just clark moving from one job to the next, helping a few people along the way. Then of course once the action finally started it didn't stop. Just CGI fights of supermen throwing each other through buildings, ect.

It seems like they changed things just to change them, to try and be different, without having any idea how to make a real movie. A movie should be like a roller coaster, it needs ups and downs. (which can be going from action, to story telling, to emotion, character building, to action, or any mix thereof). This started high with action, flat-lined for a good hour or so, then rose to the top with action and stayed there for a good 45 minutes. After so much action you get bored with that too. Hence roller coaster.

They also couldn't decide which time to be in, and in order to provide a soft back story for superman kept flashing back to the past, interrupting the whole movie. (either do a few key small flashbacks or start at the beginning in the first place). The characters weren't developed much at all (flashbacks were about the only thing for superman, but that was passive since it was in the past).

DC really needs to get it together and get some good directors/writers. (and not let ones go like joss whedon).

Not a Zack Snyder (director) fan, - and contrary to other's passionate complaints - I really enjoyed this movie.
What I believe is truly of note here is the casting in general, and Henry Cavill/Superman in particular.
I think he hits 'all the right notes' as the impossibly self-less supreme being without tipping into hoakie or campy.

The action is pretty intense, but is ""justified"" by the fact that it is probably commensurate with what action would be between a Superman and other Kryptonian combatants (!?)

That said, I would say this is NOT a kids-movie, & it will be some time before we watch this with our younger children.

I think they have a winner in Henry Cavill and find myself looking forward to sequel(s) [...Afleck notwithstanding...].

Could it be that DC is ""on a roll"" at last?...",1387411200,2,932,4.722222222222222

5782513,5,B00D91GRA4,"What I mean in my title is that, rather than go with the past wimpy, seemingly frail versions of Superman where his upbringing is idyllic and he is just a super nice pushover, they actually went for a grittier version of Supes, one where he grew up being ostracized for being different and really had to decide to use his powers for good. They also found an actor that really suits the role well....not only is he pretty much a prefect male specimen (completely ripped and manly), but he also is unhappy and seeking answers rather than letting people lead him in whatever direction. I really thought this was a perfect casting actually. In fact, I'd say they cast every role in this movie perfectly. I think the director/writers really paid attention to the small details and crafted the world I always pictured Superman growing up and coming of age in.
By far the best Superman movie I've ever seen and a really great superhero movie in general. I'm sure some people will disagree as, these things always come down to personal preference, but ,y wife and I really enjoyed the movie and will likely watch it again.",1387411200,,1114,4.6313131313131315

5782520,3,B00D91GRA4,"Man of Steel is a reboot of the Superman franchise with a very different sensibility than the original film series that starred Christopher Reeve and the more recent semi-sequel Superman Returns (2006). This film is quite a bit darker in its imagery and general sense of doom, and its a science fiction film of the alien invasion variety. On the planet Krypton, whose core is about to collapse, scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) tries to convince its leaders to abandon the planet and find a different home and values, while General Zod (Michael Shannon) attempts a coup to impose his own solution. Caught between politics and explosions, Jor-El and his wife Lara (Alyelet Zurer) launch their infant son into space along with a codex containing the genetic future of their species. The boy lands on Earth, where he is raised on a farm in Kansas by human parents who name him Clark.

Im sure we all knew that much, but Man of Steel spends 20 minutes on Kryptons destruction, so we get a lot more exposition than in previous films. I like Kryptons art nouveau-inspired technology and architecture. I like that the film shows Clarks struggles to get on with other children while concealing his abilities, as well as his struggle to adapt his otherworldly sensory perception to a world that overwhelms it. Superman is typically an optimistic individual, in contrast to many superheroes. Hes a Good Samaritan, not an angst-ridden vigilante. But Man of Steel shows his inevitable isolation and the hardship that it brings, in spite of the fact that Clark (Henry Cavill) is a gentle and moral person. Then one day General Zod, formerly of Krypton, parks his spacecraft in Earths orbit and demands that his kinsman living on Earth be surrendered to himor else.

This is a terrific cast. Russell Crowe and Alylet Zurer are Supermans biological parents. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner are his adoptive parents. Michael Shannon is the villain. Amy Adams is Lois Lane, the intrepid journalist heroine/damsel in distress. I especially liked Antje Traue as Faora, one of General Zods lieutenants. She is more compelling than the General. I would love to see her play a primary villain. I could do without the grey palette for the entire film, which makes it looks like the color was sucked out of Earth long before hostile aliens arrived. Some worthless scenes of the Daily Planet newspaper staff should have been cut. But most problematic are the fights between Superman and Zod, which simply aren't interesting. The film lost my attention there. Otherwise, though it is not great or thought-provoking, Man of Steel was entertaining.",1387411200,,2617,4.958997722095672

The rest of the movie is good.  I like the movie because the best superhero movies ever made....the Dark Knight trilogy where Nolan took the Bataman character seriously and with respect.....this movie ALSO has a deep respect for Kal El and his fans.

My problem is the CGI and special effects - too overdone and takes away from the good acting and story.  At the end - that final battle with Zod - that could have been done in like 4 minutes- that fight seems like it goes on for hours - and you can only watch things getting smashed, especially in CGI, so long - too long of a fight scene that broke the rhythm of the movie - and it looked like a cartoon - not a movie - HATE that fight scene - ruined an otherwise good movie.

That said - I liked it - I like the darker tone of the movie, I have no problem with that and actually prefer it - I like when people make superhero movies and take the subject seriously, because a lot of people love the characters - Batman is my favorite superhero ever, but Superman is second.

Yeah hes got issues, but this is before he becomes the do-gooding boyscout. He has to decide if he wants fight for humans.  And to everyone complaining that he kills a bunch of humans at the end, rewatch it. He doesnt, Zod does.

it.  Lois Lane's character is also 'humanized' more that earlier films portrayed her.  The film's villain is a bit of a madman, but his motives are made clear early in the film.  Over all, it's a good story worth a little of your time.",1387324800,,639,4.763636363636364

A refreshing take on the old story of the beginning, and I anticipated the second half. However, the second half turned into a typical, CG destruction that made little sense to take so long. Nothing new happened during the too long ending, that shouldn't have taken more than 15 or so minutes. Consequently, it was a really short movie with a stretched out fight scene. (Spoiler) Another deviation on Superman's history, is that he'd never personally killed a human with his strength.

Comic book purists may well balk at 'Man of Steel,"" writer David S. Goyer and director Zack Snyders's radically re-imagined take on the Superman story (with a hefty assist from Christopher Nolan). However, those who think that even a universally recognized slice of Americana could use a little updating every now and again will find much of interest in this new film.

This one starts off fairly traditionally, as we are once again shown the origin story of the baby wrapped in swaddling clothes who would later grow up to be the super hero famous for being faster than a speeding bullet and being able to leap tall buildings in a single bound. We see again how, with their planet Krypton on the verge of being blown to smithereens, the baby's parents (Russell Crowe and Ayulet Zurer) launch him into outer space in a ship programmed to land on a planet called Earth, where he will go on to be found by a loving Kansas couple (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) and raised as their very own. And how this baby, dubbed Clark Kent, will grow up to be a man with super powers that he first will not understand but over time will come to accept and to use for good by rescuing the innocent and vanquishing the evil.

But after following the conventional path for a time - and just as you're settling in for a rehash of the famous 1978 movie version of the same material - ""Man of Steel"" suddenly verges off onto radically untrod territory. First of all, this Clark Kent is a much more psychologically conflicted creature than we are used to finding in depictions of Superman, who hitherto has been one of the sunnier, less brooding and more well-adjusted figures in the superhero canon. This Clark is genuinely struggling with his place in the universe, wondering why it is that he is ""different"" from all the other kids and why his parents keep telling him not to let anyone else know of all the marvelous feats of strength and heightened perception he is capable of doing. Even more radically, the Lois Lane (Amy Adams) in this version, while still a reporter for the Daily Planet, is onto Clark right from the start and, in fact, pursues him to find out what it is that makes him tick. No double identities, no coy disguises for this couple (if one could ever call a pair of black-rimmed glasses and a fedora a disguise).

""Man of Steel,"" in many ways, plays less like a superhero movie and more like an alien-invasion thriller, as Clark is reluctantly forced to reveal his identity and special powers to the world when one of the survivors from Krypton, the evil General Zod (Michael Shannon), comes to Earth, all guns a-blazing, intent on making it his own.

At first, Henry Cavill seems a bit stiff as the man of steel (pardon the pun), but, as that moniker suggests, that might not actually be a bad thing, for it underlines the earnestness and innate goodness of the character in a way that a more emotive performance likely would not.

I must also add that among recent blockbusters, ""Man of Steel"" easily has the most spectacular special effects and the most exciting action scenes, bar none. Yet, Snyder clearly has his sights set higher than a mere comic book fantasy. The flashback scenes, recalling Clark's childhood spent on the farm, have an almost Terrance Malick, impressionistic feel to them, as they evoke the poetic richness of nature. This enhances the mythic quality of the storytelling and neutralizes the cheesiness that is regularly so much a part of the genre.

To those who complain that this is not the Superman story they've known and grown up with, I'd respond by asking what the point would be of remaking an already overly familiar film if you're just going to do the same old thing anyway. This is the only movie in a long time that actually managed to surprise me, and I think that in an entertainment industry in which safe and boring imitation is the sincerest form of flattery - and often the surest route to box office success - I admire artists who are not afraid to shake things up a bit, even if it winds up upsetting a few people in the process. So sit back and enjoy this new take on a famous story - just know ahead of time that this is NOT your father's Superman. And I say ""Amen"" to that.",1387152000,4,4236,4.543905635648755
5782578,4,B00D91GRA4,"I think you either get Snyder or you don't.  There's no one who takes comic books more seriously making movies today.

SPOILERS:
His Superman dumps the cartoony Zod of Richard Lester's Superman II for a multi-layered Zod here, which makes him much more interesting IMHO.  You even feel really sorry for him at the end, even though he's a raving lunatic by that point.

The casting is impressive throughout.  The visual effects are glorious, and not used gratuitously, either; this is Superman, after all, and anything can happen.  The only thing that kind of bothered me was the scenes on Krypton, which are, unfortunately, what he starts with.  It's a little difficult to figure out why their communication robots would make weird lo-res avatars of the people speaking, or why Zor-el flies on a flying horse-insect instead of the flying cars everyone else uses.  or why the ""Phantom Zone"" is actually a huge machine.

5782586,5,B00D91GRA4,"While I still think Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan should've done jumped in line behind Michael Bay at the unemployment office already, one thing I'll give Nolan credit for, is that he can do a tragic villain better than anybody.  Furthermore, if the filmakers were trying to cook up some impossibly fantastic story for us all to eat up, they passed the test with flying colors.  Superman flying is exhilerating, and many of the flashback scenes, as Clark has to deal with adversity growing up, seem to speak to our inner nerd.  Lois, try as she might to be some big shot New York reporter, is equally as charming and charasmatic.  Most of the humans have character, and act with courage and determination.  The American military sentiment is very strong here as well, and even the villains, in the end, seem to possess some kind of honor, or code, that they follow with unwaivering conviction.

With all the Kryptonian mythology thrown in, and a clearer picture of what could be with Lois & Clark (I hate how the original movies really ""beat around the bush"" as far as their relationship), this one successfully takes the first 2 Superman movies, combines them together, and puts together an action flick that really looks like a champ, when it's all said and done.

If there's one sour spot, it's the final fight, which was a bit over the top.  Correction:  they REALLY overdid it here!  I mean, they could have scaled it back quite a bit, and it would have been just fine.  Still, even with the oddball ""Superfights,"" this one edges out it's competition in Iron Man and Wolverine to deliver the Superman movie we've been waiting for for so, so long!

The verdict? I don't know who you give credit to, but this movie smashed my expectations.  If I'm not gifted it for the holidays, I'll be buying it myself soon enough.  For those into action-romances, comic book adaptations, or for Superfans the world over, this is a must-buy.  Period.",1387152000,,1943,4.6902654867256635

Other than that, what a train wreck.  Amy Adams may be a nice person but she is awful as Lois Lane.  She also all of a sudden becomes a killer that can handle krypton weapons inexplicably almost immediately as she saves Superman.  The actor playing Superman has some good moments but is also very wooden and not given all that much to really work with in regards to the script.  The character of Zod and the interplay between him and Superman could have been so much more interesting.  Character development in general is thrown out the window in favor of ridiculous fight scenes when Zod comes for Superman on earth.  The military actors are also all bad as well the other villians from Zod's crew.  Don't waste your time.",1387152000,13,1062,4.823204419889502

For those who are not completely convinced that the latest Superman reboot, 'Man of Steel', is nothing more than a bloated, overwrought mess, please consult the CinemaSins series on Youtube entitled, 'Everything Wrong With Man Of Steel In 8 Minutes Or Less'. This hilarious video summarizes all the absurdities of the 'Man of Steel' narrative as promised (In 8 Minutes Or less!). Perhaps the most absurd scene highlighted is when Superman saves Lois Lane while she's falling toward earth while everything else is being sucked into a vortex in the other direction.

Superman begins with an incredibly long twenty minute or so sequence chronicling the destruction of the planet Krypton which could have been done in a much more compact five minutes. When General Zod (played by Michael Shannon of Boardwalk Empire fame, sporting a bowl cut haircut) attempts to stop Superman's father Jor-EL from sending his newborn son, the future Superman, in a spaceship to earth, he fails to stop the launch after getting into an absurd fistfight with Jor-EL without the assistance of any of his minions (who could have easily accompanied him to the launch site and destroyed the launch console).

If all signs pointed to the fact that Krypton was doomed, why does the council of Elders sentence Zod and his crew to the Phantom Zone? The destruction of the planet means that the device that controls the Phantom Zone will be destroyed, thus releasing Zod from his eternal prison. They would have known this. Instead, Zod and company could have been put into stasis and launched in a spaceship, where it would have been much more likely they would have never been found in the vastness of outer space.

If you're expecting to see Superman disguised as ""mild mannered reporter"" Clark Kent, working for the Daily Planet, you will be disappointed. Clark Kent the reporter only appears at the end of the film and now you will have to wait for the sequel to see him. Instead, Clark pursues a nomadic lifestyle working in such places as a fishing trawler and using his superpowers to save lives (for example) during the collapse of an oil rig.

During these sequences, we're also treated to flashbacks detailing Clark's ostracism amongst his peers while he's growing up and how he redeems himself (again for example) by saving his schoolmates after a bus plunges into a river. Kevin Costner and Diana Lane do an excellent, understated job as Ma and Pa Kent but the scene in which Jonathan Kent chooses to sacrifice himself, to save the family dog, doesn't ring true. Why doesn't Clark try to save his father as the tornado bears down? After depositing his mother at the underpass, using his super speed, no one would have seen him, as he could have flown into the tornado and shifted its direction, so that his father wouldn't have been swept away.

Somehow Clark then manages to get a job working at a secret military site investigating what turns out to be a Kryptonian ship buried in the Artic ice. There he learns about his origins from a hologram of Jor-EL. The hologram is so prescient that he later even recognizes Lois Lane. In the sci-fi universe, I was always under the impression that the ability of holograms to communicate with humans was quite limited (perhaps answering yes and no questions, as in the film, 'I, Robot'). But here Russell Crowe's ability to communicate appears unlimited.

And another thing while Clark is down there in the ice, snooping around. Why doesn't Superman, utilizing his super hearing, hear Lois enter the cave and prevent her from being injured? Instead, he ends up using his X-ray vision to repair Lois' wound, and she's in agony while undergoing the procedure.

Even if you're willing to suspend your disbelief concerning all these contrivances, the rest of 'Man of Steel' is a big bore. The problem is that the human characters here are an afterthought. Compared to the superpowers of Superman and Zod, humans are absolutely helpless as the good guy and bad guys from Krypton, battle it out. Perry White (played by a solid Lawrence Fishburne) has little to do except save one of his employees after she's trapped when a piece of concrete falls on her. Lois Lane is given the small task of using a special key to jump start the craft that Superman came to earth in, which is used by the US military to send Zod's minions, back to the phantom zone.

Before battling Zod in Metropolis, Superman must dispose of the Krypton bad girl, Faora and another Kryptonian. Those sequences are no different than the final battle with Zod, where trucks are thrown into buildings and each principal punch one another, where they themselves end up being thrown great distances into such recognizable structures as the International House of Pancakes (IHOP).

As so cogently pointed out in 'CinemaSins' on Youtube, after the ridiculously long battle between Zod and Superman, the Man of Steel ends the whole thing by merely snapping Zod's neck. Before that, even with Zod being thrown into a building which collapses on him, that isn't enough, to do the trick. Presumably, Zod is so spent that Superman is then able to kill him by such a sleight of hand. But after all the grand CGI effects, the snapping of the neck, is a big let down (and not very believable, to boot).

If your thing is special effects, then 'Man of Steel' is for you. But if you require that Superman be all about the human interactions between the characters, then go elsewhere. May I suggest purchasing the complete collection of the original 1950s Superman TV Series? The special effects back then were nothing to jump up and down about, but the 50s incarnations of the iconic characters of Clark Kent, Lois Lane, Perry White and Jimmy Olsen, were all so endearing.",1387152000,13,5787,4.811871227364185

In fact, while I appreciate the absolute ridiculousness of the audio mix on this disc, I have to say that more often than not, it goes from nice respectable levels (usually during the quieter dialogue driven scenes) to REALLY crazy levels during the action oriented stuff. It's almost like Hans Zimmer and his orchestra are there in your living room with you in these scenes because the music just swells to a high volume. Point being made here, if you need a demo disc to show off your sound system, go with this. Your neighbors will never forgive you.

Extras are nice and well put together although I have no idea why there's a Peter Jackson New Zealand featurette in there. If I have to recommend one to watch, watch the one where they show you the physical prep that was needed for the actors to get ready for filming. They trained for SIX months to get ready for this film. Insane!

I highly recommend this disc but I'm knocking off a star only because the film wasn't as great as it could've been.

While some purists will argue that they like the first two Christopher Reeve films the best, 'Man of Steel' will stand the test of time.  The Superman movies of the 70's - 80's are superficial and look so dated and after Superman 2, got really campy and childish.  'Man of Steel' digs deeper into the psyche of Superman and connects with viewers on an emotional level that surpasses any Superman film to date.  Arguably, no superhero is more powerful than Superman.  It's what he chooses to and not do with that power that makes him ""super. """,1387152000,,735,4.572519083969466

5782614,5,B00D91GRA4,"I watched MOS in a crowded movie theater the first time. While I enjoyed it the first time there's something to be said for watching it in the privacy of your own home, without someone noisily munching popcorn in the seat next to you and some other jerk sticking his or her knee in the middle of my seat. This time around I was able to fully appreciate the movie as a whole without the added audience noise. If that sounds anti-social, so be it.

Henry Cavill was perfect as Clark/Kal-El. The rest of the cast (Amy Adams, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Russell Crow, Michael Shannon and Lawrence Fishburne) were all top notch.  I had no problem with the costume change or the redesign of Krypton.

Let me be clear, right from the start: I've seen George Reeves, Christopher Reeve, the much maligned Brandon Routh and Tom Welling. I've enjoyed them all, and in poor Brandon Routh's case I know that he wasn't the problem, it was the script. Bryan Singer meant well, but we'd seen that Lex Luthor land grab before. Routh's Superman needed something fresh.

I've also watched (and enjoyed) Dean Cain and most of the other incarnations of the man of steel. The main complaint against MOS seems to be that this isn't Christopher Reeve's Superman.

Thank goodness.

Compared to Cavill's Supes, Reeve's Superman looks dated to me right now. Zack Snyder did an excellent job of updating the character and rebooting the franchise. I have but one complaint against the movie, and I'll address that later on. This is Superman just starting out. He's not smooth or polished, the first time he flies he crashes. His X-ray vision seems to bother him, if not cause outright pain, and Kal-El flinches when someone shoots him. The scenes of him as a child having problems with his senses was spot on.

(SPOILER ALERT:) As far as his code against killing, I have to believe that his killing Zod is the reason he came up with that in the first place. I appreciated Snyder's attempts at realism, which is weird considering that this is a superhero movie. I can believe that Pa Kent was worried for his son, that he instilled in him the overwhelming urge to hide what he was and what he could do, because Pa felt the world wasn't ready. As the movie showed, Pa was right.

Now, as far as the destruction in Metropolis goes, that makes sense too. I have no doubt that Superman is going to pay a price for that in the sequel. And really, who's gonna believe that aliens show up and there's absolutely no damage to property, and no human deaths? Seems to me you guys who are bitterly complaining about that are hypocrites. You knew this movie had those elements going in.

In the quiet of my living room I was able to hear the dialogue properly. For those of you who nitpicked about  the action of the end, if you'd stayed quiet you would have heard that even if Zod's ship was destroyed the world engine would continue to terraform, so they had to be hit the same exact time. And how you missed the fact that the only other Phantom Zone engine on earth took out Zod's ship is beyond me. This new Superman didn't have a spare laying around. That's why Kal-El couldn't imprison Zod again. Zod was on a killing rampage, and death was the only way he could be stopped. He made that perfectly clear.

This isn't the first time Superman's killed Zod. In the second movie Superman killed a de-powered Zod, and Lois killed Zod's female lieutenant by throwing them down into a bottomless ravine. The scene was so bloodless when I first saw it I didn't know what the heck I was seeing. And to those who claim that by tossing Zod and his compatriots into the abyss Big Blue really put them back into the Phantom Zone, well, that was a scene I must have missed. Now I've heard that there was a deleted scene showing the villains alive and taken into custody, but that wasn't what I saw at the movies. That scene didn't make the final cut, but it was in the DVD version.

Bottom line: Kal-El chose humanity. That's amazing to me, because the way that kid was bullied I wouldn't have blamed him if he'd looked at Zod and said, ""Okay, I'm in. Earth's gotta go.""

And this brings me to the only problem I have with MOS: If Lois Lane could find him, don't tell me that the military couldn't either. Remember, Clark saved the kids in that school bus. He was seen doing other heroic things. And I admit at the end I cringed when he told the General he grew up in Kansas. I actually yelled out ""Dude, shut up! Don't tell him that!""

MOS is not perfect, but then again neither is Joss Whedon's ""The Avengers"". I enjoyed that one too.

If you're expecting Christopher Reeve's Superman you're probably going to hate Man of Steel. To each his/her own. I enjoyed it and I'm looking forward to the sequel.",1387065600,,4752,4.471131639722864

Man of Steel is a prime example of Hollywoods penchant for CGI over storytelling. We don't need characters, just eye-popping explosions with booming sound effects. Im a fan of Amy Adams, but in this film she came across flat. And Perry White? What was that about? His role contributed nothing to the storyline. This darker Superman moves in the direction of an anti-hero, so perhaps that explains his complete lack of humor. The bad guys and gal were unmemorable, which is crucial to storytelling.

When director Zack Snyder met with his CGI geeks, Ill bet the conversation went like this:

We got some really terrific stuff, the head-honcho geek says. We put together thirty sequences of Superman and Zod crashing through buildings so you can pick the ones you like.

After watching the special effects, Snyder slaps the honcho guy on the back and says, Nice work. Well use em all.
Okay, what about the fanciful creatures on Krypton? Were over budget.

Just slap something together. Maybe adjust some of that flying dragon stuff you used before. Just get something quick and cheap.

The CGI was intended to appeal to the younger, hearing-impaired market, but some hacks also tried to wrench the plot around to appeal to women. One of the major themes of the saga is Lois Lane trying to discover the identity of Superman. But some Hollywood genius said women want romance, and they're unwilling to wait for a sequel. Simple. Well discard that useless bit of tinsel and rewrite Lane as the strong champion and savior of Superman, and that way they can flirt from the gitgo.

I could be wrong, of course. Man of Steel may be a classic. A smart retooling of the saga for a modern worldwide audience. The movie did gross nearly $300 million in the United States alone. However, it cost somewhere around a quarter billion dollars. Even with foreign box office and home rentals, that does not qualify as a blockbuster.

I might be a curmudgeon, but I liked the original Superman better. I preferred the humor and light tone and creativity. The domestic gross was three times the budget, so they must have got something right.",1387065600,6,2356,4.7153284671532845

The first part of the movie are very brief flashbacks which have no depth and very little purpose. Seems like where theres trouble, our hero just happens to be in the neighborhood to deal with it but the disbelief and wonder of it just isn't expounded upon. We don't get to see him growing up, how he deals with everyday human issues with the powers he has and if you're looking for any of that feel good humor from the Supermans of the 80s, forget about it here. There is none, and I do mean........NONE.  Its mostly anguish and indecision and then more anguish. The second half of the movie is just another Transformers redone...............again. Blowie uppie stuff, lotsa loud noises and fires, a long fight,utter destruction and once again, Superman uses no wits, only brawn to beat the baddies.

Almost everything you loved about past Superman works whether it be the comics, the movies, or the various tv shows is stripped away in this movie. Old school Superman fans will find this movie a bit hard to swallow but watch it a second time and you will appreciate the changes.

The production made this look like the run of the mill avenger movie. They also relied too heavily on flashbacks and more flashbacks.

Antje Traue as Faora-Ul had a nice evil look.

Those here who mention a GLUT of CGI effects in Man Of Steel are dead on.  And the action went by in a blur.  Your eyes couldn't follow it.
For much of the time I thought I was watching an ""Alien"" film not a superhero movie. I realise it was made for the new generation of fans who want action in lieu of story. But there are many of us older Superman fans who DEMAND a good story.

And I always thought Krypton was an advanced peace loving society.

Having been a Superman fan since I was a  6 yr old girl I have accepted many of the various incarnations of Superman. This version left me flat. Superman deserves better on his 75th anniversary.  (And 2013 marks the 35th anniversary of Superman The Movie.)",1386979200,15,935,4.369942196531792

I liked the guy playing Superman, he did a fairly good job. I also really liked Russell Crowe's performance - and I don't like Russell Crowe. Seriously, he helped make the movie almost bearable.
Now the bad.
You never feel for any of the characters (except maybe Russell Crowe's character Jor-El). The movie is so chopped up you never get a sense of flow or continuity. The story is so divergent from DC lore that Fan Boy's surely get indigestion just thinking about it. It was written poorly and has several flat out stupid events. The worst one is when Clark's Dad is in the tornado - that was just plain super moronic. The special effects were not so special either. The effects people I guess were trying to borrow from an Alien movie or something - which can only be described as a pathetic attempt. Seriously, it was terrible. The action scenes where so boring. There were no ""highs and lows"" to the sequencing to to draw you along within the story. It was just one homogenous string of events that leaves you waiting on something more exciting to occur. Why Zack Snyder allowed this to happen I have no idea. I wondered aloud if he even showed up to direct. I considered it a total waste of time watching this travesty. No kidding, I would like to have my time back. I strongly advise against purchasing this steaming pile of you-know-what.",1386979200,17,1514,4.489130434782608

5782675,5,B00D91GRA4,"As a woman who cares nothing for comics, DC and Marvel alike, it should be noted that this review is not intended for those making a careful comparison between this movie and the comics it's inspired by. If you are, take off a couple of stars. That aside, I was very impressed with this movie.

  First, the visuals were as good as you can get for this day and age, those which are rapidly changing from day to day anyhow. It provided fresh perspectives, ranging from planet Krypton to General Zod and his evil henchmen (if you're a man, you'll be more than satisfied with Faora alone, even if you hate the rest of the movie). I couldn't have imagined a better choice for Zod than Michael Shannon who provided a more than stellar performance. In this movie, he wasn't just an evil villain, he was an evil villain with a cause - a cause though cruel, not without understanding.

  Oh how refreshing it was to finally get a Lois Lane that was both beautiful AND intelligent without the bad attitude and/or the appearance of an obvious chain smoker. For instance, in Superman movies past, Lois had a relationship with Superman yet couldn't make the distinction between him and the Clark Kent she worked with at the Daily Planet. What was the distinction? The glasses, that's it. Really Lois? Thankfully, this movie takes that into consideration. Also, there's no kid. Thank you again.

  Running time is a bit long, and there's probably two or three times when you think it's going to end and it doesn't. Is there a problem with that? Not necessarily. Extended time on a roller coaster can be fun, but not if you have a sensitive stomach. As far as Clarks's flashbacks are concerned, are they good or bad? That will vary by person. Some people don't mind it, others do. It didn't bother me. So, thumbs up to the plot, the special effects, the actors, and the whole Metropolis. Granted, it is a spin off of the traditional Superman, but it's a good spin and deprives us of all the major annoyances of the last kryptonite-ridden rendition.

You degenerates in hollyweird have it all wrong.

In contrast the 'Superman' movies of the seventies were better developed, more measured, and not so predictable.  Here the fight scenes are too much and too long.  A comparison to 'Skyfall,' the recent 007 masterpiece, nails home the point that it isn't so much quantity than quality that make for a well-honed action adventure picture.  Still, while the story is often a hodge-podge mish-mash, I love watching the talent they too often squander, especially Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, Russell Crowe, Laurence Fishburne, Christopher Meloni, Diane Lane, and another welcome screen performance by Kevin Costner.

I don't understand.  I feel that this movie was DESTROYED by this big mistake.  If they would have put the theme song in one of the special scenes where superman comes out, this movie would have been THE best superman movie ever til now, but is not.

5782701,5,B00D91GRA4,"MOVIE OF THE YEAR!
I'm a huge Superman fan and loved this movie. Some people reading this review might ask ""why?"". I liked this movie because of the action and casting, but more importantly it stayed true to the comics. It shows life as it was on Krypton before it blew up and General Zod is the way he is. It's a good story of a man trying to find his identity and fit into a world not made for him. It's a very realistic approach to the hero we all know and love. Henry Cavill is perfect for Clark Kent/Kal-El/Superman, along with Amy Adams as Lois Lane who actually is a good reporter in this movie as well as Michael Shannon as General Zod, who strikes fear and anger into the audience.

To Sum Up:
This film is the comic book approach to the film and if you like Superman, action and a good story, then you will love this movie.",1386892800,,833,4.1419753086419755

I mean the boy pushes a bus out of a river but can't fight through some wind like a normal human in an attempt to save his father?  Maybe if the glasses were on the ruse could have fooled the handful of bystanders.  Long story short, good action...no story or character development = big money, no whammies.

- The blu ray includes some great features that include a Discovery Channel style documentary on Krypton that describes it's civilization, which includes its alphabet, and descriptions of their outfits. It takes place after Man of Steel ends which is reason enough to watch it since it shows footage from the film from a different perspective. It adds another layer to the already strong Krypton component of the film.

- Another feature is a viewing/making of feature that is made more intimate by Snyder, the actors, and the film crew, as they talk about their experiences making the film. This added a level of appreciation to the attention to detail and to the film's ambition.

- Minor complaints are the blu ray lacking any of the epic trailers for the film, pacing during fight scenes, and Daily Planet staff characters as generally annoying characters but these did not hinder my overall experience.",1386806400,,1164,4.928571428571429
5782722,4,B00D91GRA4,"""Man of Steel"" is the best Superman movie done to date.  Many will howl at me, complaining about this or that, but this is the first Superman movie that took the subject matter seriously, and didn't go for the cheese or the camp at any time.  Everything that happened in the movie has happened in the source material at one point or another, and the vision of Krypton at the beginning was the most exciting and interesting (even if the ""cold society"" with clone babies story has been done before) ever shown on film.

Now, some people complained there was too much destruction in the movie (especially opposed to ""The Avengers""), and that is true, but think about it; This was an attempt to take the attack of super-powerful beings to a city on Earth.  We're talking about people that (any one of them) could have grabbed all of the Avengers and compressed them into a tiny ball without raising much of a sweat.  What do you think would happen in real life?  In addition, do you really think that those gigantic ""dragon"" ships in the Avengers, as massive as they were, didn't cause any damage when they fell against buildings, or did they just ignore the possible consequences?  Did the fact that they have three non-powered Avengers helping people while the others took care of the fleet make any difference against the fact that Superman was fighting against beings with all of his powers by himself?  Can we blame him for not stopping and saving a cat from a tree?

Now, I am not saying ""The Avengers"" is a bad movie, or even that ""Man of Steel"" is better, since I believe ""The Avengers"" is an incredibly entertaining movie that accomplished everything it set out to do.  But having a Superman movie that is taken COMPLETELY seriously (no flying around the world to turn back time, no converting the ""S"" symbol into a giant plastic baggie, no memory erasing ""magical"" kiss, no campy villains) was a real joy to behold, and I for one can not wait to see what they do next.",1386806400,2,1974,4.5508474576271185

5782728,5,B00D91GRA4,"Having seen many seasons of Superman, Superman/Batman, Justice League, Justice League Unlimited, I definitely think that Henry Cavill plays the best Superman.  Michael Shannon is great as Zod, very intimidating and manacing. However, Amy Adams is a miscast in my opinion. Amy is talented and beautiful, but she looks nothing like Lois Lane. Though I don't expect the actress who plays Lois to look exactly like the animated Lois, I do expect her to look at least similar to the Lois from the series, and to possess the ""signature"" physical characteristics that define Lois.

Script: OK.. except for the ""I think he's kinda hot.."" part. Was that an add-on during shoot?

The movie is stunning visually, from production design to costume design and VFX. For those who complained that this movie is ""drenched in CG"", please go find your VHS and watch the Christopher Reeves version instead!

However there was no insert inside the case other than the one for The Noble Collection to sell souvenirs. The package insert advertises UltraViolet but has no information of instructions on how to do it. There were no URL's and no code that I am able to locate to get the digital copy.

As technology is how I make my living I was not worried, I would just look up how to do it.  The UltraViolet site was worthless.  I do websites and that one I would be ashamed of.  I did find some answers on the Flixster site, although kinda bugged me that I had to join both sites to get what little information i got.

On the Flixster site was a way to add DVD's.  I follow its instructions with another movie I had and it worked as expected.

During all this I was emailing back and forth with UltraViolet Customer Care Team <support@ultraviolet.zendesk.com>, most automated.  They sent my ticket with them to UVsupport@wb.com.
They responded

5782742,4,B00D91GRA4,"I have to say, the reviews weren't very kind, and word of mouth was even worse.  True comic book fans were furious, offended even, and the comic universe, while months earlier were brimming with pure excitement and anticipation, were pretty much ticked off that all that hype and all that buzz was for something they deemed unworthy.  Sure, it had its nice points and found validation in the slew of comments about those special effects, but outside of that many found themselves disconnected from Zack Snyders direction and found the films epic conclusion to be more controversial than desired.

Despite all of this going on, I really wanted to see this in the theaters but wound up missing it entirely, even when it hit the local dollar theater.

So, I settled in last night and geeked out while I apparently appreciated this far more than the rest of the world.  I guess the fact that I was never really a Superman fan in general probably helped a lot, since I had no expectations and no nostalgic attachments to who or what Superman was supposed to represent.  At the end of the day, I just wanted to be entertainedand I was!

Like many new action films today, there was a detractor for me in that elongated ending that really should have been cut in half.  Iron Man 3 suffered from it, as did Star Trek Into Darkness.  Its weird to me the sudden shift in action films being rather lengthy, when for the longest time they were notoriously brisk and easy to sit through.  Gravity was a brisk 90 minutes, but the bulk of these summer Blockbusters are pushing 2  hours and I just don't get it.  I understand you have a story to tell, but do we really need you to unload all your special effects glory in a full on thirty minute fight scene where you basically just destroy building after building to the point where it becomes a redundant blur of special effects?  I mean, I enjoy a good fight scene/action scene/explosion sequence or whatever, but lets try and show a little restraint.

But lets move onto more positive feedback.

Seriously, if we exclude that final act, Man of Steel is kind of perfect.  It feels more serious in tone, but not quite as dark as Nolans universe (which is appropriate considering the hero in question).  The use of flashbacks are great at filling in the gaps without taking away from the crux of the story.  We don't need to watch Clark grow up, but the selected moments from his childhood are great (that closet schoolroom scene is perfection).  The cinematography is gorgeous, and calls to mind more artistic fare (I remember all the Malick comparisons when the trailer hit), and the pacing for the first two thirds of the film is fantastic.  The way that the story is built, it just feels so organic and the acting from all (especially Costner, Crowe and Lane) are so natural and free flowing that you cant help but become completely sucked in.

Speaking of Crowe, I could have watched an entire feature length film revolving around Jor-El and the destruction of Krypton.  Seriously, that world was gorgeous and that dragon soaring was marvelous(eat your heart out Avatar) and Crowe was easily the best thing about this film (I was so happy he kept popping up).

And then there is that finale.  So many things have been written and debated about the ending and I just have this to say (without spoiling anything)while I take issue with the fact that it last SO LONG (seriously, that fight scene between Superman and Zods henchmen was ridiculous), the actual final moment that has all the Superman fans riled up was, in my eyes, PERFECT.  YES, this is what we need with these superhero reboots.  Give him a moral dilemma!  Confliction!  He may be super, but lets attack him where it counts!  His final cry, his emotional and moral defeatit was everything this movie needed to be.

Yes, I understand that fans have their issues with this, but it really MADE ME a fan.

Snyder tries something really good here, and while he doesnt completely pull it off (his true limitations as a director came in the editing and the over ambitiousness of the finale) he creates something worthy of praise and really creates a nice stepping stone for himself here.  I hope he can follow it up with something equally inspired and continue to build on the character development he initiated here.",1386720000,2,4312,4.640316205533597

A little goes a long way, but after awhile there's just too much CG lens flare, CG explosions, and the overused CG ""rag doll body goes flying""-thing, over and over again.  The fights are just a blur of CG smoke, explosion and debris, to the point that you can't tell what's going on or who's fighting who.  I actually got to the point in watching this where I was tired and just wanted it to end as the frenzy of computer animation just overpowered every other feature of the film.  The music is vapid, and a far cry from the spectacular John Williams power, and Henry Cavill, although a fair Superman, looks like a bulky weight-lifter in his non-Supes sequences (especially in the sequence where he steals the clothing after the rig fire... he looks like he just came back from the gym all bulked up.)

5782785,5,B00D91GRA4,"Okay, so, here it goes:
I adamantly *REFUSED* to watch this movie in the theater.  After hearing about how certain plot twists happened (I won't spoil it for you) I was just so against watching this movie that, even though I'm a big DC fan, I just could not do it.  People told me it was worth watching and I just. . . just could not do it.  You get the point, totally against watching the movie.

Well, the movie came and went, figures were sold, special books were printed, blah blah blah . . .then the movie came out on DVD and available for download on Amazon.com.  It was a slow night, did not feel motivated to go out, so, I decided to chance it and rent the movie for $4.99.

SURPRISE!  The movie was A W E S O M E!!!

This version I think heavily relates to the way he acts in the New 52! and not the classic Christopher Reeve (RIP) Gold and Silver Age comics, or even the pre-52! Superman.  This Superman feel more like an outcast and loaner than his predecessor and it shows in his behavior, the way he interacts with other kids, and really fits with the New 52! version of him before he officially becomes SUPERMAN and just wears a T-shirt with his cape.  I also was fond of how film showed more scenes from Krypton than before and how Krypton society worked.  That was a refreshing pace.  Lastly, the biggest change I thought was interesting was the choice of Superman's weakness in the movie.  Not going to spoil it for you but it's interesting.

So, yeah, pleasantly surprised and definitely feel like this movie is worth the watch for all those, like me, who were against even trying to watch it from the get to.",1386547200,2,1627,4.2918032786885245
5782786,2,B00D91GRA4,"Normally, I'm not one who likes super hero movies. To me, they fizzled out with the repeated Batman movies of the 1990s, which got cheesier and cheesier with each launch. Chris Nolan's revival of Batman 10 years ago broke through a lot of barriers of the previous decade. What I disliked about the 1990s super heroes with all their irreverent gadgetry, silly attempts at comic relief, sloppy storytelling, and corny villains, etc. etc. - all this took a back seat to story-telling when Nolan gave us ""Batman Begins."" We got deep inside the psyche of Bruce Wayne and could follow and understand his struggles as he became the Batman. Once the Batman was established, we followed him along through another film where he wrestled with numerous moral dilemmas, and even picked up some socio-political commentary along the way, particularly when Lucius Fox refused to engage in Patriot Act style domestic espionage. While I felt Dark Knight Rises missed the mark, simultaneously I felt that Nolan's first two Batman films stood out as a resurgence of the super hero genre in the form of gripping stories where hero and villain had clear motives, good plot lines, captivating dialogue, plot twists, great backstories, exciting climaxes, and all of these things enhanced by great stage-fighting choreography, minimalistic use of CGI, and a very believable backdrop for Gotham City, primarily the city of Chicago. He showed us that he can powerfully tell the ""genesis"" story behind a super hero.

So I anxiously awaited the release of ""Man of Steel,"" excited to see what Nolan was going to do with Superman, who became a national treasure in the 20th century with countless comic book storylines to choose from (so diverse are the storylines to choose from, that at one point in the comic series during the early 1990s, Superman was even killed). I think Nolan had many different avenues to explore with Superman. We had the endearing love story as portrayed by Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder in the 1970s and 1980s, which also simultaneously carefully balanced the psychological dichotomy of Clark Kent's struggle both to assist humanity and at the same time try to explore it. For ""Batman Begins,"" Nolan knew what he wanted from the start, and drew upon Bladerunner, Batman as comic book hero, modern day warfare and struggle, and even drew upon (ironically) the Superman movies from the 70s/80s. What most excited me was how Nolan was going to help me relate to Clark first, and then relate to Superman, just like he did with Bruce Wayne/Batman. I suspected we would get down to the basics like he did with Batman. I expected a great story. Instead what I got was a headache in the form of a 2 hour, 20 minute toy commercial.

Right from the start, I had a lot of questions. I'm vexed how the Kryptonian race was unable to reproduce naturally, aside from Jor-El and his wife. I'm confused how the Kryptonians managed to destroy their own planet by siphoning off energy from its core. Why would Jor-el choose to lampoon his son to Earth and simultaneously send Zod and his companions along the same trajectory in space if he knew Zod was out to get his only son (and any hope of restoring Krypton)? The explanation is confusing regarding why Kal-El's parents didn't exile from Krypton with him when in just moments prior to jettisoning his son into space he managed to exile Zod and many of his companions into space safely. Also, how is it the ice surrounding Zod's ship is over 18,000 years old but Clark has only been on earth maybe 25 years? Does that mean Zod was here first? What took Zod and his companions so long to wake up? And why leave earth to orbit the moon to make a grand entrance when you're already on Earth? How come one of Zod's companions decomposed during exile, but Zod didn't? How did Lois piece all of the stories together to find the Kent household? Aside from a few fleeting scenes depicting Clark's superhuman strength, what was childhood like? Adolescence? When Clark's earthly father died in the original Superman movie, we felt Clark's pain, his inability to use his power to save life, and we wept along with him. The real genius behind John Kent's death in the original 1978 Superman movie was that even if Clark WANTED to save his earth-father's life, he COULDN'T. It was a heart attack that killed John. In Nolan's version, Clark COULD HAVE saved his earth-father, but John stayed Clark's willingness, which I think weakens the story, because it showed that Clark's power is virtually limitless. In the original version, there was NOTHING Clark could do to save his earth-father. Even the ""almighty"" Superman had limits. But Nolan's version fell flat, because ultimately it showed us that Clark could have stopped this tragedy from happening but didn't. All we got from Nolan's Superman was a scream of rage, and all for what - to save the family dog from a tornado? So Superman's Mothership (a veritable flying version of the Fortress of Solitude, naturally) has a key which magnetically flies out of your fingertips just before insertion, but the ship can't straighten its own nose cone properly so that all its electrical circuits line up so it can fly? And what would prompt some Air Force shlub to twist the nose cone in the first place? Once Superman turned himself over to Zod, then what? How would Zod extract all the DNA from Superman's body, and what would he do with those genetic codes? If he could clone all that DNA, wouldn't Kal-el be interested in seeing his parents, clones or not? And if he cloned Jor-el, could he merge Jor-el's cloned body with Jor-el's consciousness which is floating around somewhere inside the Flying Fortress of Solitude?

I have a myriad of additional questions like this. And even if some of them are answered in the film, they're not answered adequately or in a plausible way. The problem for me is that Nolan and the other writers raise more questions than they can answer. And that's the trick with filmmaking. I think what peeves me most is that we've seen Nolan succeed at reincarnating a super hero before. Lastly, when it comes to telling the story of a super hero, there has to be common ground established with the audience. We have to relate to Kal-el, or the story isn't going to work.

My final gripe I do not see among other reviewers too often, but to me, it was the WORST idea to interject into a Superman movie: Superman killing Zod. Do these filmmakers not know what Superman is all about? SUPERMAN. DOES. NOT. KILL. It's not in his nature. It never has been. And in this film, his killing of Zod flew in the face of everything Superman (supposedly) stood for up to that point. The movie completely ""broke"" at that point, violating the character of Superman- and for what purpose? I understand they wanted to reboot the Superman franchise, but if this is how Superman is depicted - NOT practicing what he preaches - then I'll go back to the Superman of the 1970s. At least the previous Superman had ethics and a moral code. Nolan's Superman has no control over himself.

Lastly, the special effects. After 20 years in practice, I think CGI has finally arrived. This is the first film I've seen where the green/blue screening wasn't immediately apparent (Peter Jackson's ""The Hobbit"" also finally got it right). I had a tough time distinguishing real images vs. CG images, which in the past gave themselves away with overly smooth motion, poor shadowing, or fuzzy details. I was impressed with the care given to Superman's flight. Daniel Tosh would be excited to know that we actually do see Superman speeding up in mid-air by giving it more ""umph."" We also see contrails from Superman's feet and hands. We see the cone of water vapor that forms around Superman's body while he is transonic. We hear a small sonic boom ""pop"" through the air as he breaks the sound barrier. We see him punch things and they break in realistic ways. We see x-ray vision in all its splendor - bone, tissue, organs, and beating hearts. The only problem with all of this is the level of noise that comes along with it. This is the noisiest film since Michael Bay's ""Transformers"" series. Everything is unbelievably loud. The noise is so ubiquitous I felt fatigued by the end of the movie. The noise is not warranted or even necessary. In my mind, special effects are not supposed to carry the story, and in ""Man of Steel,"" it felt like the producers attempted this. In fact, the final 20 minutes or so is one long fight scene. Yes, we have longed for the day when we could see Superman in a fight like this, and it is cool to watch, but when conjoined with poor storytelling, it felt gratuitous. We could have had the exact same fight sequences on the tail end of a great story and it would have felt justified. If these filmmakers would put a great story first, it actually makes fight scenes and special effects that much more ""special."" Case in point: remember in Star Wars how we felt when we saw spaceships dogfighting like WW2 aces for 15 minutes, climaxing in the explosion of the Death Star way back in 1977? The effects enhanced the story we were told for the two hours before it. Had the story buildup failed, the ending and all its technical accomplishments would have failed with it. I could say the same thing about ""Jaws"" as well, or a myriad of other well-written stories that required cutting edge special effects to tell. So yes, while ""Man of Steel"" is a technological accomplishment, the poor storytelling made it feel cheap.

So an in all, I think the film is a failure from the standpoint of drawing the audience into the psyche of Superman, telling his story in a modern age (akin to ""Batman Begins"" and even the recent James Bond reboots). I think it also made the mistake of raising more questions than it answers. For this the movie garners one star from me. I'm awarding an additional star for the special effects, but in my mind, special effects should be the icing on the cake, not the cake itself.",1386547200,8,9997,4.696693272519955

I won't get into too much of the plot, or lack of, but I thought the overall story was interesting and was able to flesh out the Superman mythos without re-telling everything exactly the way we've heard it before.  It's always a risky proposal when you decide to make major changes to the story, but I thought they worked in this film.

As for the product itself, I purchased the Blu-ray+DVD+UV Combo Pack.  Like many others have said, I was disappointed that the packaging had the BD movie and Special Features discs stacked on top of each other, with the DVD movie on a separate tray.  It just seemed really ""cheap"" to stack the discs like that...it's what my kids do when they're too lazy to find the right case to a movie or album, and they just stack two in one case.  Really bothers me then, and it bothered me with this packaging.

I liked the Special Features, but it feels like they left out a bunch of stuff to include in a more expensive set.  I know that's par for the course, and not totally unexpected, but I'm just tired of having to choose between sets to get the best Special Features.  Or worse, having to wait a year for the Super Duper Ultimate Expanded Edition to be released with even more never-before-seen footage.  Oh, well.",1386547200,,1305,4.468354430379747

5782805,3,B00D91GRA4,"There are just so many explosions and seemingly endless fighting sequences that a person can take in one evening before it starts wearing extremely thin. It started feeling as if the entire last half of The Man of Steel was one very long extended fight scene with essentially the same tricks done over and over, most particularly where Superman and Mr. Bad Man throw each through building after building. This was among one of the several factors that nearly levels the entirety of dear old Gotham City, yet, by the end, everything is just perfectly back to normal. The offices of the Daily Planet are in pristine condition. No one has aged a day and, of course, no one even recognizes ol' Clark Kent in spite of the fact that every major player in all of the mayhem was deeply involved with the goings on involving Superman. It has always been a gripe of mine that the denizens of the Daily Planet were so unbelievably dense that they could not recognize Clark Kent as Superman in spite of all of their many observations of Superman. The only apt explanation it would seem is that, in addition to his X-Ray vision and super hearing and super strength and ability to fly and all of that, that Superman is somehow capable of manipulating the human mind to such a degree that he is able to selectively destroy all observational memory of this person. Perhaps he uses his super-ray eyes to fry that portion of the brain responsible for selective memory recall. That is just my theory.

While The Man of Steel has a certain degree of entertainment value, it is also a story already told on film so many times that it seems completely redundant to visit it just one more time. The props and scripts change slightly each time, but it is essentially the same story. In addition, this version has more cuss words in it presumably to make it more ""real""; at least in the beginning, developmental stages coming primarily out of the mouth of a childhood bully. Just be warned in the event you have issues about letting your kids watch it and find certain language objectionable.

The end really baffles me. Here Superman has just saved THE ENTIRE HUMAN RACE from total destruction and now they have to depict this anal retentive army dude who is STILL suspicious that Superman just might turn against the good ol' USA. Now how stupid is that? No one would be alive, fer cryin' out loud. How logical is it then to have this stereotypical army dude STILL distrusting Superman? That just makes zero sense except as an excuse to have a sequel using this particular Superman. Oh well. One cannot expect to attempt to scratch the surface of any of these superhero action movies without the entire facade crumbling to dust. So be it.

So would I recommend The Man of Steel? I suppose it's worth seeing it. It has some very impressive CG and special effects work in it, although it is often repetitive to the point of tedium. The acting is okay, although no one really truly stands out. All-in-all it's a oft-told tale with a lot of noise and explosions.

Gone are the rich character interactions one expects from the Superman legend.

A little gorilla glue, and problem solved, however the stand could have been better. Also, no,  there is no digital copy you can use to download on iTunes. It sucks, I know, but you can't get everything. Overall, I am happy with my Collectors Edition.

***Minor Spoilers to Follow****

This is the Batman Begins for Superman. It is a modern and more mature take on the character. Gone are the ridiculous ideas that Lois would not find out who Clark is. That no one in Smallville knows of the incredible gift/curse Clark has. That everyone would just accept him. This is a movie where it places you in todays world and all of a sudden this Godlike being that is an Alien, is revealed to have been living among us. Proving that there is intelligent life beyond our solar system. What kind of reaction would the world have? They would obviously be terrified, as the movie states and shows repeatedly. As Clarks father tells him in one touching scene, ""People are afraid of what they don't understand"". Superman is living in a xenophobic world. And yet, as much as humans have treated him badly, he still has faith that the human race is good, and those are the people he fights for. There is no cockiness and lame one liners/jokes here like you see in Iron Man, and Thor. Superman stays humble and good natured as presented exceptionally well by Henry Cavill's subtle performance.

No movie is without it's flaws however. Yes it's true, there's LOTS of CGI, and lots of action/destruction. It can be overwhelming at times with so much going on. I would say this movie does over do it a little bit, but compared to the snooze-fest that's Superman Returns, it's an improvement. Another negative is that some things are not fully explained. I suppose the writer/director wanted the viewer to make the connections. They are not fully explainable unless you've seen the movie a couple of times. I liked having to figure some of those questions out on my own, but some people probably would prefer it'd be more straight forward. An example being how the main villain was able to master his newfound powers in such a short timespan. Another thing that may distract the viewer is the non-linear story structure. There are repeated flashbacks that take place throughout the movie. It didn't bother me, but it may cause problems for some people. There are also a few religious undertones some viewers may not like for whatever reason, such as a moment where Clark goes to his local church to ask for advice from a priest. That didn't bother me but it did to quite a few people.

All in all, behind that lies a really good origin story for a character many have written off as outdated. This movie will change your mind. Just give it a chance and go in with a clear conscious.

Hints from the TV series Smallville here. Russell Crowe was amazing as always. I liked that Clark Kent is seen openly using his super powers as a child and an adult. The depiction of Krypton as a used up dark planet with it's citizens having no place to go was a little ironic since they had terra farmed other planets but had left them to die also. Except maybe, Earth? The landscapes and architecture were in sharp contrast to previous films. Superman's costume is dark in keeping with the colors of the planet he came from... no primary red and blue here. Well done. The final battle was a rip off of The Avengers film. This time it was Superman ripping through building after building after building, etc, etc, The final battle was boring and too long. In the end all it took to kill Zod was for Superman to break his neck with a classic head hold and twist of the neck? Really?

The acting in this movie is fun and fine. The tone tends to be a touch solemn, but they have a subtle and fun humor, especially hitting on Superman's more grandiose abilities.

The scenes are exquisite. The cinematography and the special effects take you places and show you things that are from the imagination, as they should. Excellent in nearly every way.

Russel Crowe (Not singing)

An origins story that gives us excellent need for catharsis in the future. It leaves the world open and ready for a story more cunning than ""These guys are tough.""

Interesting ideas that writers will be able to (hopefully) capitalize on soon.

In this movie he's very 'human' in his way of thinking and while not weak by any means, he's vulnerable. It makes for a believable 'just getting started' Superman.

A couple disappointments: 1) There is a lot said about how the human race will handle Superman when he finally reveals himself, but there is no pay-off. 2) Somewhat related, Superman seems to have little regard for his surroundings while fighting. Given the moral compass we see set earlier in the film some effort on his part to take the fighting away from occupied areas would have felt more true to the Superman character.  In saying that I can only imagine how the humans felt at the end of the movie regarding Superman.  Perhaps that's to be addressed in a future movie.",1386374400,2,880,4.664516129032258
5782832,5,B00D91GRA4,"Man of Steel is the quintessential Superman Movie. This movie is for people who love the Superman character. This movie is not for people who loved the now out-dated 1978 Richard Donner/Christopher Reeves classic. It is an up-to-date retelling of the modern-age superman presented in the current comic books. This IS a comic book movie and as such it should and does relate perfectly to the source material. Those looking to rekindle their Christopher Reeves love affair need not apply.

From the cinematography to the music (Quite possibly Hans Zimmer's greatest score) to the cast selection, to the acting; Man of Steel never fails to disappoint. Gone are the bumbling antics of 1978's Clark Kent and it it's place is a character that is not so much trying to ""fool"" everyone but trying to find out where he fits in. Aside from some minor pacing issues, Man of Steel is solid fun. 2.5 hours of escapism is exactly what the summer ordered and Man of Steel delivers.",1386374400,,966,4.7844311377245505

5782835,2,B00D91GRA4,"I'm a total sucker for DC and Marvel movies. This was not good.

It felt like they took random elements from the recent reboots of Star Trek, Thor, and Clash of the Titans. And those elements were thrown together and executed very poorly. What you get is a sloppy story line with characters I absolutely did not care about. Henry Cavill looks the part, but his dialogue is awful. When he's in the suit they put entirely too much makeup on his face. This makes it feel like a daytime soap actor thrown into a major motion picture. I was not feeling Amy Adams as Lois Lane at all. Michael Shannon (Zod) has way more potential as an actor than what the writers gave to him.

There is not nearly enough action sequences to save it. Some of the reviews here rave about the action and scenery. I feel like I watched a completely different movie. There's nothing new here that we haven't seen from the other franchises in recent years.

I can not recommend this movie. My advice to a Superman fan would be to go rewatch Superman II. It has some 80's cheesiness but a lot more charm with a fantastic musical score.

5782839,3,B00D91GRA4,"I would honestly have to say I found this latest reboot of the iconic character to be just a bit disturbing. Certainly the visual and special effects were stunning, and there is plenty of action. The acting is fine, considering the story being told, and I even admired the attempt to make the entire saga more realistic.

And perhaps that is the problem. Because Superman isn't supposed to be 'real'. Superman is a modern myth, like that of Zeus or Hercules or Mars, all rolled into one. It is only possible in a fantasy world because it is basically a morality tale. And the thing about morality tales is they can't have moral shades of grey. They are intended to clearly show what is right and what is wrong, and display the rewards and punishments of choosing either.

But here the story is trying very hard to be 'real', and that makes it somewhat disturbing. For example, considering the amount of carnage and destruction wrought in high population areas throughout the film, it is impossible to escape the looming sense that quite a number of innocent bystanders are being slaughtered. We may not see bodies flying through the air in pieces, but when a skyscraper explodes in a ball of fire, it's difficult to accept that there was no one inside at the time.

What makes that realization unsettling is the fact that Superman more or less chooses that as the battleground. As he was the focus of the aggression, being persued by Zod, he could just as easily have lured the enemies to the Gobi desert and had it out there. Instead he blows up his home town and half of Metropolis. Not what you would consider Superman behavior.

And it's also difficult to reconcile the Superpowers which clearly toss all physics out the window, with a world with unbreakable physical limitations. And exactly what can and can't hurt these aliens? You can literally hit them with an entire building... repeatedly... and they don't sustain so much as a scratch. But you can snap their necks easily enough. Huh?

The other thing that just felt awkward and wrong was the not so subtle attempt to equate Superman to Jesus Christ. Granted, that is implied in the overall mythos of the character, as it is in all myths, but here they kind of poke you in the face with it. Superman is 33 years old. Hmmm. He's going to change the world. Hmmm. He has a heavenly (albeit computer stored) father. Big hmmm. And when that father sends him to Earth (from the spaceship Lois Lane has just been ejected from in an escape pod), he reminds his son he can save them all. Is it necessary for Superman to float out into space in a perfect crucifiction pose?

So I suppose that in attempting to make this culturally iconic character more 'real', they simply exposed parts of him that are a little disturbing to consider. This is a film where it would not have been out of place to show Superman coming out of the bathroom with a newspaper in his hand to the sound of a flushing toilet.

That's a bit too much reality for my taste.",1386288000,6,2997,4.549165120593692

All the actors are good but those two shone for me and should have had more scenes. In fact it was the supporting actors who are the more well known stars...

5782850,2,B00D91GRA4,"Man of Steel is, technically, the first movie reboot of the Superman mythos since 1978's Superman: The Movie. Produced by the Christopher Nolan, written by David Goyer and directed by Zack Snyder (300, Watchmen), it's an attempt to bring the moral ambiguity and 'grittiness' of Nolan and Goyer's Dark Knight trilogy of Batman films to the Superman franchise, and set up a new shared universe of films based on DC comics characters.

Things start promisingly with a visit to Krypton, depicted as something between Avatar (the Cameron movie) and Dune, with a mixture of ultra-advanced technology and feuding nobles. Russell Crowe plays Jor-El, here depicted as a scientist trying to save his world from imminent destruction but, in typical Russell Crowe style, is also capable of laying waste to entire platoons of soldiers single-handedly. Crow runs afoul of Michael Shannon's General Zod during a coup but still manages to blast his infant son (eventually a capable and reasonably good Henry Cavill) into space before the planet explodes. Zod and his cohorts are sentenced to eternal imprisonment in the Phantom Zone, which works out about as well as it ever does.

The infant Kal-El arrives on Earth and is found and raised by Kent family near Smallville, Kansas. Kal-El aka Clark's crazy powers and abilities soon manifest and his human parents (ably played by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) are soon spending their time running around quashing rumours that their son is a space alien and instilling him with noble human values. Clark attempts to lie low in a number of fairly innocuous jobs but his tendency to rush into dangerous situations to rescue people soon attracts the attention of a reporter, Lois Lane (Amy Adams). Clark discovers a Kryptonian ship which he can use with technology from his own crashed vessel to create an interactive AI based on his father's personality. This allows him to learn about his heritage, but also sends out an automated SOS which lures Zod and his crazy crew to the planet. Cue a lot of carnage as showdown follows showdown until the film climaxes.

The storyline is, in principle, a good idea. The film avoids any mention of Lex Luthor or Kryptonite, and the use of Krypton, Zod and Jor-El as an AI are all good notions that give the story a personal investment for Superman whilst allowing the origin story part of the narrative to flow into the actual present-day storyline. Unfortunately, this doesn't work out in practise. The film's first hour, just under half the total running time, is overwhelmed by backstory and exposition. The Krypton sequences with Russell Crowe are pretty good, with a strong visual identity and Crowe - easily the best performer in the movie - doing some excellent work, grounding the fantastical landscapes and events in more relatable issues of family. Michael Shannon is a bit thuggish and lacking in nuance as Zod (especially as the film goes on and he gets more shouty), but he has credible motivations and presence. The Krypton sequence is imaginative and involving, but also overlong.

Once on Earth, the film becomes a confused morass of flashbacks (many of them pretty pointless) and present-day story. Kevin Costner is very good as Superman's human father, right up until he gets what is, by a considerable distance, the stupidest, most pointless and most unconvincing death scene in the history of cinema. The overwhelming stupidity of this sequence, not to mention that it was completely unnecessary, may be the film's lowest point. Some individual sequences such as Superman saving the crew of an oil rig or learning to fly by first jumping really high (a nod to early versions of the character who couldn't fly at all, only jump miles at a time) are much more successful. Amy Adams's Lois Lane, who soon enters the story, is also really good. She plays Lois as a smart, intelligent reporter in her thirties who is more plausible than other takes on the character. Crucially, she is also aware of who Superman is from the off. This is an obviously different take on the character relationship, avoiding the whole 'wears glasses as a disguse' cliche, even if it makes no sense whatsoever (Perry meets Superman but later falls for the old 'glasses' trick hook, line and sinker). But still, points for trying on that score. More disappointing is that Adams and Cavill don't really have much chemistry, and their eventual romance is utterly unconvincing.

The film continues to try hard to succeed: Zod's plans for Earth are actually somewhat logical and make sense. They also give hope to Clark that one day Krypton can live again, which should lead to greater moral confusion over what is the right thing to do. But this never happens: Clark decides early on to defend Earth no matter the cost and never budges from that, making these attempts to complicate things fail outright.

This leads into the film's climactic action sequences which are, on the whole, highly disappointing. The action sequences are over-indulgent and seem to go on forever. They also frequently lack context or conviction: seeing two invulnerable beings fight one another knowing they can't hurt one another makes for zero tension. The CGI is also flat-out terrible in these battles, rather bafflingly since Krypton is so impressive at the start of the film. The character-replacement CGI is unconvincing, the placing of the actors' faces on CGI bodies is amateurish and some of the flight and movement CGI is worse than the twelve-year-old original Spider-Man movie. Usually in 2013 the very least you can say about an otherwise terrible movie is that the effects are good, but Man of Steel can't even manage that right. The final battle also indulges in some dubiously lingering shots of collapsing skyscrapers with hundreds of people in them (or about to be squashed by them) which makes for uneasy viewing in a Superman feature.

Man of Steel (**) shows hints of a fertile imagination and originality (mostly in the opening act set on Krypton) whilst showcasing a few good performances, but these are soon buried by inane dialogue, terrible action sequences, poor CGI and a total collapse in logic at several key points in the film. Man of Steel is not only not very good, but even manages to make Superman Returns look like a capable and competent film in comparison. Overall, not recommended.",1386288000,2,6358,4.953139643861293

I overall I enjoyed the film up to a point. It was a great reimagining that kept me entertained and had pretty good acting. Until we got to the end and it went completely off kilter. Superman doesn't kill, that is a defining trait about him that has remained in no matter how many incarnations there are, but he did in this movie and it felt like a huge change... and not for the better. That tiny little moment alone changed my overall enjoyment of the movie to the point that what would have been 5 stars became a very generous 2 stars. If that doesn't bother you, well you'll probably like the movie... but for me as a lifelong Superman/Clark Kent fan, it was a big no-no and therefore I didn't like the movie.",1386115200,,752,4.442028985507246

This sounded like the Dark Knight theme.  The plot was rushed, so there wasn't any suspense or anticipation.  I fell asleep in the action.  Zod was forgettable.

5782892,4,B00D91GRA4,"This is a better-than-average film.  You can tell fairly easily that the production crew was trying to create something a bit different, a bit original while displaying state-of-the-art craftsmanship.  Not everything works perfectly.  There are holes in the story and incongruities, but one has a tendency to let them pass because of the scenes that do work, work tremendously well.  I was VERY skeptical going into this movie, having learned that it was an attempt to become Nolan-like serious -- and I've never considered the idea of creating a serious Superman movie as anything but an instant failure.  Is this the Superman movie we wanted or needed?  I cannot say.  But, overall, it hangs together pretty well, and the serious stuff is not overloaded (as in the Nolan Batman flicks).  In my humble opinion, a superhero movie should first and foremost be fun to watch.  I cannot recommend this to very young kids because there is a considerable amount of violence.  If your kid can handle watching NY City basically leveled then go ahead.  Now, all we can do is cross our fingers that a Superman/Batman crossover (coming up next) won't be a gigantic bomb.",1386028800,5,1159,4.892307692307693

My own personal rating is based on the simple premise...if this was a current cartoon version of Superman would I watch it.  Does Superman have to be Christopher Reeves?  This movie felt like it took the Smallville tv show to the big screen and then up'd it a notch.

Henry Cavill is not Reeves.  Reeves deserves his place in Superman lore and history.  Cavill is more like the cartoon visualization but has the ability to bring it to human form.  He reminds me of something between Reeves and Injustice waiting to come out, good or bad.

Everything that happened seemed like the action, drama, writing from a Superman cartoon like All Star Superman or Doomsday.  The action was (spoiler if you haven't seen it by now) what I would expect from quasi god figures who can topple buildings, destroy people, and otherwise create mayhem.  There was the love interest which even this story line surprised me despite a similar approach of Smallville television show.

5782901,1,B00D91GRA4,"I am not usually critical of movies or TV shows. Some people don't understand what a movie is meant to be, and that is why they rate it badly. While I might not like a specific movie or genre, I understand that all movies have an emotional reaction that they try to elicit from the audience. Sometimes a movie is a parody, an action/drama, comedic in nature with some action, and my favorite of  all epic. That being said Superman is the worst movie I have viewed so far this year, (2013). There was no clear emotion that it elicited in me. The movie was hyped up so much that I figured it would have to be a little bit of a let down. Little did I know that it would be so much more then that.

I enjoyed the beginning of the movie, but then after that it all went downhill. There was far to much CGI. This wouldn't be such a big deal if it looked good, but it didn't. Blockiness destroyed all the fast scenes and didn't even allow me to enjoy the classic imagery of superman flying. I don't mind the plot not being lock step with the previously published comics and movies, but don't change just for the sake of change. If your going to change make it better.

The casting of the movie was generally good, except for Louis Lane. I don't know if it was Amy Adams or just the character she played, because she was the weakest link. I don't understand why the Kryptonians took her on to their vessel. They were going to use her to get Clark, but he turned himself in. So why did they need her? They obviously didn't, but someone needed to let Jor-El's program loose on the alien ship so it was forced like so many other parts of the script. Also some how and some way Louis always seemed to find Clark no matter where he was. Even after that huge battle between Clark and Zod that leveled the entire city, 10 seconds later she magically ran up out of nowhere. The emotional scenes all seemed forced and contrived from Clark letting his father die, to the corny kiss between Clark and Louis right before the fight with Zod which I saw coming from a mile away.

The corniest part of the movie was when the army general said what the F when superman destroyed the drone. I know the movie is PG-13, but come on. Just don't use it then. I left the theater at that point even though the movie was already almost over. I am embarrassed for Christopher Nolan. To have his name associated with this typical Zack Snyder garbage movie has tainted his film making prowess. Hopefully he will take over directorial duties for the sequel.",1386028800,4,2521,4.301052631578948
5782902,5,B00D91GRA4,"I really liked this movie. The pacing was good, the visual effects were fantastic, and the storyline had a more visceral feel to it. In this version of Superman we see what it might actually have been like for an alien to grow up on earth, forced to hide his godlike powers. In the end we see what happens when gods do battle amongst mortals (collateral damage was spectacular). I was so impressed with the SF/X (way to go animation-f/x artists) I had to watch the movie twice. There are so many layers to this movie that I could probably write several more paragraphs, most of which are about the design and theory behind Kryptonian technology and eugenics.",1386028800,2,658,4.584745762711864

5782910,4,B00D91GRA4,"For this review I'm sticking to the technical aspects of the Blu-Ray. Due the the polarizing nature of this film my opinion on the story or acting of this film is pointless. First I'd like to comment on the picture quality,  which is quite good. I noticed a lot of smaller details I missed in the theatre, especially in the Krypton scenes. The sound mix is good also. The score is really fantastic, all the other noises like spaceships and explosions don't drown out the dialogue. My gripe with this set is the special features. I thought there would be more. The big one is like a video commentary. I didn't care for it. It's sort of half way between a commentary and a documentary. I like how I can still sort of watch a film with the commentary going, you can't really do that here because the screen is some times split in two or three smaller screens with the film, documentary footage and interview all going at the same time... It was distracting. There are a few other features that were interesting. There is a DVD and ultraviolet copy also.",1385942400,2,1050,4.46875

The back story of Krypton was interesting, and helped explain much of theconfusion surrounding what went on there as a prequel to Supermann on Earth. The effects were great, but did not overwhelm the story or the acting. MOST parts were played well. Hats off to the General Zod performance!",1385942400,2,372,4.567164179104478
5782914,3,B00D91GRA4,"The main issue with the latest version of Superman via Christopher Nolan is whether audiences will buy into looking at Superman through a new lens; a lens which takes the Superman mythos and warps into something quite new. Is it better? That's the fundamental question. Many of the elements from the 1979 version are here: the planet Krypton, Jor-El, General Zod, Jonathan Kent, Lois Lane, Perry White and of course the Man of Steel. However, in this version, the many ingredients are switched around and the order of the recipe turns out quite different. It's still the recognizable Superman, or is it? Several elements are changed, including Lois meeting with Superman, and later the arrival of Zod on a mission so different than any previous offering whether it be comic book, film, or television.

Probably the strongest aspect of the film is its imagery rather than the dialog or the acting. The story begins on Krypton like the older film. Alternatively, the imagery of Krypton and the inhabitants ring of 1930's and 1940's SF rather than the 1979 film or the comic books from the 1940's through 1960's. The ships and devices have their roots more in the original Alien film, with dark gray's and brown's instead of the bright crystals of the 1979 version. The story is updated to reflect 21st century United States rather than Superman of the 1940's or the 1970's. Lois Lane has a cell phone and even posts a story online. When General Zod and the baddies arrive, albeit before Superman is really known, the imagery and feel is much more like a current science fiction film than Superman battling domestic bad guys. This could frustrate some purists who wanted the story to reflect the Superman of tradition.

Although the look of the film is tremendous, the acting and writing department is not equal to the first two offerings starring Christopher Reeve. While Russel Crowe is not a bad choice as Jor-El, the script and his subsequent performance are not as compelling as Marlon Brando's Jor-El several decades earlier. When Brando's Jor-El appeared in a black cloak with the ""S"" insignia, proclaiming an indictment against the traitors of Krypton, Zod and company, with the words ""This is no fantasy"", we are pulled into a story about justice, right and wrong. The myth of Superman embodies the ideas of justice and morality. Although Superman itself is a fantasy, the issues of right and work, good vs evil, are every-present. Unfortunately, the present script didn't quite find a rhetorical theme from which to build a story. I had trouble really understanding what this film was about.

The one character which was the most disappointing was General Zod. I realized what a tremendous performance Terence Stamp offered as Zod in the earlier films and yet here the present casting and his script were far less compelling. Somehow, the current Zod seems less intelligent and more prone to fits of rage. When Zod and his cohorts are on trial in the original film, you never sense that Zod is a victim but an individual who has acted out of malice by pure choice. In fact at the beginning of the 1978 version, we know that the failed coup, although we never saw it play out. We recognize because of the seriousness of the criminal proceedings, the overthrow came dangerously close to succeeding. The current Zod seems over his head, and not in fully in control. The coup is shown but somehow seems less believable, maybe even slightly contrived. Zod will essentially continue what he began on Krypton on Earth.

What may save the film is the two leads played by Henry Cavill and Amy Adams. Cavill is a decent Superman and Adams holds her own as Lane. They definitely had more chemistry than the 2006 Superman Returns but not quite the magnetism as Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder. The film then lapses into long action sequences which seem never to end, with the rather complex and convoluted plot not fully explained to satisfaction. While I understand the need not to repeat earlier Superman's, this film just misses the mark. A noble but rather disappointing entry into the Superman canon.",1385942400,,4104,4.8585714285714285

I love the hell out of it.  It was amazing and moving to watch in the theater and I was just as moved at home.  One of the most inspiring and epic versions of the Superman story told.  Diving into the age old question:  why am I here and what is my purpose?  Man of Steel is much deeper than ""Superman smashes sh&$"".  It covers the clash between two cultures, one based on predetermined order and purpose and another that embraces free will and the being trapped in the middle with the power to move the needle in either direction.

Ignore any of the negative remarks on about this, they are from inconsolable nerds and the feeble minded who have no emotional depth beyond being hungry, horny,  And this is an emotional movie, sophisticated enough that your average child and emotionally stunted adult will have completely missed the nuances as well as the on the nose tells.  Pa Kent's gentle smile as he realizes that he's going to die, that he's choosing to sacrifice himself for a young man who just yelled at him and reminded him that he's not his father.  Ma Kent's broken heart masked with a smile and false excitement when Clark tells her that he's found his parents.

There's a lot going on in this movie, and it's sad that so many people and critics were blind to it all and just complained about things that were simply stupid.  As I've said from opening day until now, ""how much more do you want in a film??""

5782944,2,B00D91GRA4,"Once again we have another reboot of the story of Superman and to tell you the truth, it misses by a mile. What happened here was they tried to skip the whole beginning and jump into movie two of the series with General Zod. Sadly, by the end of the movie, no one knows who Superman is. Seriously! The only thing the public knows is two super guys with powers (aliens) have destroyed half of metropolis and surely killed tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people and at the end of the movie I'm supposed to believe that they will now accept the ""good"" superhero? Huh?

Who was the genius who thought this up? The story has many flashbacks that try to explain the backstory but they do little justice to the original premise of the series. The fighting scenes are repetitious and are just a collection of me throwing you into a building and you throwing me into a building over and over again breaking stuff. This is the part of the movie where lots of people die but we never see the bodies. Hard to imagine all that building breaking without people being in the way and ending up squashed.

Since the story of superman has been done over and over again I don't think I'm spoiling anything by saying that at the end of this movie, the real first movie begins. Clark Kent appears looking for work. Talk about a PR nightmare. There is no way in hell Superman will be able to rehabilitate his image now. Trust me, I'm the good guy.

5782951,3,B00D91GRA4,"Being a big fan of Superman, I was looking forward to this new movie, especially after seeing the great job that was done with the Batman movies in the last few years. When this film started my hopes were being met, since I encountered a very nice setup to the story, and I was appreciating the nice blend of original story with a some new elements and a very imaginative depiction of Krypton.

The beginnings of the story in Earth was also good, with Clark discovering his powers and learning about where he came from, the relationship with his parents in Earth, and the fear of being discovered, while at the same time having the need to help others. But sadly, this is when thing start to go awry.

The confrontations with General Zod and his group are a big part of this film, and here I felt that they decided to put the story in second place and focus on special effects. It may be cool when you see the first building collapse, or huge explosions take place, but after seeing this over and over, things get old pretty fast. I'd rather see a fight between Superman and Zod, than see one hit the other, five building collapse one after the other, going back to the fight for the next hit, etc.

Overall this was an OK film, but it definitely did not meet the high expectations I had. A clear test for me is when I think about which movie I'd rather see, this one or the one from 1978, and in my case the answer is that I prefer the old one. Therefore, it is clear something went wrong in the way they decided to create this new film.",1385856000,,1538,4.260273972602739

The script of Man of Steel seems to have been written by a roomful of romance novelists with maybe one guy shouting ""blow something up!"" in the background. It was pointless and silly. What is Amy Adams doing in this movie? She didn't seem to know either. And Diane Lane? Kevin Costner? And Russell Crowe for goodness sake!!! The plots meanders around crazily until you have no idea what day it is. Or what is going on. Superman is supposed to be devastated by the part he plays in destroying Krypton forever, but honestly, I can't even say the word ""Krypton"" without giggling, so who really cares?

5782965,4,B00D91GRA4,"""Man of Steel"" leaps on to Blu-ray and DVD and the question on everyone's mind is, ""How does it hold up in a home entertainment setting?"" I'm happy to say it fares well and doesn't lose any of its charm or excitement. I've watched it both on a 32-inch and 45-inch TV and it held up as an emotional and action-packed rollercoaster ride filled with enough well-crafted eye-candy to stun even the most cynical CGI naysayer.

Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) has known since his early childhood that he's endowed with super powers and an orphan from another planet. As he grows into manhood, he begins to drift from one job to another on his journey to discover who he is and why he's here. When the Earth is threatened by an extraterrestrial invader, Clark must embrace his destiny to save mankind from certain doom.

Director Zack Snyder and writers David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan successfully update the mythology of Superman while hanging on to the classic aspects of the character that have kept him in our hearts and minds for 75 years. We might see the ""New 52"" version of the super hero visually, but he's still the same old great American Man of Steel creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster brought to the printed page in 1936. Sure, the enemies are equipped with more technology and deadlier weapons than the two-bit gangsters he went up against in the days of World War II, but he still stands for truth and justice.

As a personal note, I would like to comment on the way Superman identifies himself to the military as being as American as he can be in ""Man of Steel."" After all, he did grow up in Kansas he states. I can't help but feel this line in the film was added by Goyer to make amends for his ridiculously PC contribution to Action Comics #900. He had the hero renounce his citizenship as an American and state he was now a citizen of the world in it.

The high-definition audio and video transfer for ""Man of Steel"" is pristine. The 7.1 surround sound drops the viewer right into the center of all the action and successfully transports you to the faraway world of Krypton. The picture is vivid and clear, showing off the incredible mind-blowing special effects. It's amazing how real everything looks in the CGI-heavy battle scenes.

Besides some bad language and violence, ""Man of Steel"" is perfect for the whole family. It is a darker take on Superman than we've seen in the past. The moral messages of standing up for what is right and striving to be good in the face of great evil is still found.

There are many references to Christianity made as well. Our hero begins his life of crime-fighting in the public eye at 33 years old, which is the time Jesus is said to have embarked on his ministry. Another example is how he spreads out his arms like Christ on the cross just as he sweeps down to save Lois Lane and the entire world from Zod and his forces.

The Blu-ray version of ""Man of Steel"" includes a few special features. ""Journey of Discovery: Creating 'Man of Steel'"" is over two and a half hours of supplemental material, behind-the-scenes featurettes, and interviews you can take in while watching the film. It also includes four other featurettes that explore the making of the film and delve into the characters and Krypton. There's also a six minute featurette entitled ""New Zealand: Home to Middle Earth."" Apparently, Warner Bros. feels it's necessary to constantly remind us that ""The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug"" is coming out soon.

""Man of Steel"" is a pleasing addition to any comic book movie enthusiast's home entertainment library. Consumers will find it to be a worthy purchase because of a great feature film and plenty of bonus material to be excited about. While not as epic as ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy, it will definitely stand as a fine example of super hero movies for years to come.",1385856000,4,3838,4.609077598828697
5782966,3,B00D91GRA4,"I am going to blame the writer on this one.  This man clearly likes sex on the first date and then probably spends a lot of money on gifts trying to find romance.  The Superman story is a classic mythology that has been told many times better than this.  Of course he has a ton of video games to his credit, so that explains the jerky back and forth story line that relies on too much flash back, because he wanted to get to the action right away.

What this does is steal from the audience, that wonder of self-discovery and conflict of the youthful Clark Kent.  Also lost is the Clack and Lois dance of discovery.  What we are left with is lots of top notch special effects, some clever game puzzle moments and a story that in the end is not satisfying.

It would be as if Harry Potter started at the last half of book seven than inserted parts of the previous six books to try to get you to care about the characters you never had a change to grow with.  My wife who enjoys the super hero genre went to bed, annoyed with the whole mess.

Particularly bad is the self-indulgent, hot aired pretentious Jonathan Kent, played and I suspect partially written by Kevin Costner at his worst.  Even John Schneider of TV's Smallville was a more down to earth and real father.  {small spoiler}  When we reach the moment of Papa Kent's required death, it is over the top, pretentious and pathetic.  Our reaction was, ""I hope that's the last flash back with him in it, glad he's gone. "" This moment should bring pain to the audience.. It won't because the relationship is disjointed.

When I look at the cast on paper.. this should be a winner.  but in the end.. The writer gave the director very little to salvage out of this weak video game construction.  I gets three stars because I like who this Superman is trying to be you could do something with this cast as long as you never ever let the writer of this film near the franchise.  And I shudder to think he is on track to do Justice League ... I grew up a DC Comics kid.. but now the only decent story telling is happening on the Marvel side.

It is a bit different from the Superman I grew up with but still has good values, but I also enjoyed the GLADIATOR effect, I'll call it. In fact, I think the backstory was the most powerful part, but I am a bit of a sucker for a good story. I would give it to anyone with a son, or a girl needing a good role model because Lois Lane was a bit of a bruiser, but a good mortal match for Superman. I do hope they can figure out how to make Wonder Woman again because girls, and women, still need a good hero, but I am not as into comics as I could be. Perhaps Wonder Woman is too hard for the big screen, but a small screen series seems a better place for a reboot. Loved Henry Cavill, but he will need a bit more acting lessons if there is a sequel because the special effects will need to be a bit less to keep humanizing Clark Kent, but also the relationship with Lois Lane. Hope Hollywood can keep perspective on the other superheroes because the world needs a hero, still, since Jesus Christ has long been dead but a Superman can keep hope alive to mere mortals. Boy, I am going on, aren't I, but I did like and and wonder who in this world wouldn't since it seemed a bit well rounded.

It isn't the best movie, it doesn't compare to Batman in the Nolan films, but it's beautiful to look at and entertaining. Hands down better than Singer's Superman Returns. The action is pretty exciting, Snyder definitely knows how to make an action film, but it does get a little over the top at times. Some reviews have mentioned destruction porn, and I do have to admit that the 3rd act is filled with buildings collapsing and Superman going through buildings. The scope of the action and destruction helps make a big film, but it might be the same things that make it a bit of a turn off for some people. It's funny, but now that I think about it, Man of Steel has more destruction than Pacific Rim and that movie is about 20 story tall robots fighting giant monsters in cities.",1385683200,2,874,4.368098159509202

I've never been  big fan of Superman, I've seen a few movies and didn't like them, so when I went to see this I was skeptical, and I was pleasantly surprised. For one I liked that they went for a bit of a darker tone with this movie, especially when the villain was defeated, it showed that  no matter how much power you may have, not everyone can be saved, I can understand why some people don't like the movie, it did have some problems, but what movie doesn't these days. I feel the hate it's gotten is ridiculous. The actors were great, I loved the villain choice, and it was nice to see them go with a bit of a darker movie. This is by far the best Superman movie I've seen. I highly recommend it",1385683200,2,745,4.095890410958904
5782997,3,B00D91GRA4,"Before watching this movie, I had very modest expectations. I'm not a fan of Superman (I'm not a fan of comic books in general). I did watch the first Superman movies that starred the late Christopher Reeve, though I can't really remember since I watched them as a little kid. When Man of Steel came along, I discovered that Christopher Nolan had produced it. Seeing as how I did enjoy his Batman films, I thought I would enjoy this one. When the movie ended, I had mixed feelings.

First off, I will say that the special effects are quite spectacular. The music score from Hans Zimmer was a nice touch (even if it was a little unoriginal). Director Zack Snyder and the SFX crew did a real good job with the visuals. The set and costume designs looked quite impressive, and the dialogue didn't sound too cheesy at all. The action sequences didn't tend to drag: I quite liked it. I didn't mind the inconsistent flashbacks in this movie, since I actually did follow the film very well. Henry Cavill, Kevin Costner, Russell Crowe, Diane Lane, and Lawrence Fishburne gave good performances, but nothing groundbreaking.

So there's that. Then, there were the things that bothered me about the film.

For some reason, I didn't like Amy Adams as Lois Lane. Not only did she not look the part, but her acting seemed very wooden. I'm sure Adams is a wonderful actress; I just didn't see the evidence in this specific movie role.

And speaking of Lois, the romance between Clark Kent/Superman and Ms. Lane didn't prove to be effective in this movie. I couldn't feel the chemistry between the two. I'm not sure if it's because of the way these characters were handled by the writers or the director.

And oh boy, General Zod was one heck of a DULL villain. He didn't seem very threatening when onscreen, and he didn't have that authoritative appearance. Although Michael Shannon did his best with this character, I don't think I'll find Zod to be a favorite of mine anytime soon.

The climax...well, it didn't have that spark that could be found in many other action films. It felt too abrupt and it lacked that epic scope that you would normally find in Batman and Avengers.

Man of Steel is not really groundbreaking material. The visuals are terrific, but everything else is either average or below. It's more of a ""style-over-substance"" approach that didn't really work for this type of film. I will recommend this film to those who love Superman (and comic book franchises in general). Everyone else will probably find this one mediocre. I know I do.

It was way to serious for me.  I miss the Margot Kidder's Lois Lane Nobel seeking antics, the comic one liners and comebacks.

( the deleted scene doesn't count.  It was deleted). Another example is the haters complaining that Superman let Metropolis get destroyed because he was on the other side of the world......saving the entire world!!!  But then the haters ignore the fact the Superman was a selfish jerk in Superman 2 and let Zod destroy and take over the entire world so he could spend some ""quality time"" with is lady friend as a human.

5783012,5,B00D91GRA4,"I got the Man of Steel Collector's Edition combo pack, number 17,444 out of 50,000. Obviously I didn't buy it here. Got it directly from Warner Brothers online shop. Anyways it comes with what you see in the pictures. It's great to have on display(comes with a stand). UltraViolet makes it convenient to watch the movie online rather than using the physical discs. Still the discs are convenient for when you don't have internet. Then there's the special features disc, where you can see the making of the film and how much work they have put into making this movie such as the CGI that they use to create Krypton entirely or how they put together the Superman versus Zod fight, or how the actors were so great at what they do in certain scenes, such as the part of where that one trucker was being a bully to Clark Kent or how young Clark was sensing everything and ran to the Janitors closet. I am very satisfied with this. As for the movie itself, I will do sections of what I think of it.

The Story -
Lots of action, it never gets boring. Unlike Superman Returns where it was slow and dull. Man Of Steel gets right into action where you see Jor-El fight off Zod's forces sometime after Superman's birth, that's how fast the action starts. There's some flash backs to Superman's childhood, I was able to relate to him because of those flash backs, due to him getting bullied and feeling like an outcast, I went through the same thing in my childhood. The action is exactly like the comics, because there is a lot of destruction of Metropolis. Just go read Action Comics #700 for proof of that. Anyways the fight scene between Superman and Zod was excellent, it was like a live action Dragonball Z fight. The part were Superman snaps Zod's neck got a lot of criticism, but did they not read any of the comics? Did they missed out on what Superman did to Zod in Superman 2? Superman kills Zod. There is no other way to stop him. Hell he even kills Nuclear Man in Superman 4. Anyways over all the story was great and epic.

The Music -
Hans Zimmer does a fantastic job of scoring this film. It's one of the main reasons I love this film, it was a very epic and poetic score. What else is there to be said?  It's the same guy that scored The Dark Knight trilogy.

Content -
When you get the Man Of Steel Collector's Edition, it comes with four discs and a code for the digital copy. The special features gives you many details about what happens behind the scenes when creating this movie. It also gives you a closer look at Planet Krypton and how much work they put into every last detail, including the language. I have yet to see the 3D version of the film, but since I don't have a 3D HDTV, it will have to wait. I have not used the Blu-Ray version of the film since I got my digital copy that I can view instead. I did however use the DVD version when I went to my brothers house, since they don't have internet, however one of them took the PS3 controller with him, making it impossible to see this movie on Blu-Ray without it. So I had to use the DVD version on the Xbox 360. Which solves everything as we eat pizza and enjoyed the movie. The casing that houses the discs folds out. The steel case looks nice when it's on the stand when being displayed. The magnets on the stand keeps that S-shield in place.

Overall -
There is less than 50,000 of these available. So buy it when you have a chance, because once it's gone, the value of this will go up just like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles collectors edition party wagon of the 1987 cartoon series. Should have paid $99.99 for it when I had the chance, now it sells for $400 on ebay ridiculously.

5783013,3,B00D91GRA4,"The special effects and features were very good.  I like the point of view of the movie but the story made feel sorry for Superman.  He had to kill the last of his own people for almost the same reason why Krypton failed as society.  Zod was a product of Kryptonian breeding nothing could change his goal set or programing.  It was inbred in Zod to save  and or rebuild Krypton from everything including itself and death no matter what. This version of Krypton exploited and ruined it's environment, abandoned the freedom of natural childbirth, and became too complacent in it's folly of control until it was too late.  Clark had to conceal his powers while watching his father die.  It's bad enough when you really can't do anything but it hurt more to watch when we knew Clark could save his father.  It also made me wonder how many more Kryptonian criminals were freed from prison with the destruction of Krypton to find their way to earth and repeat this process again for Cal.  I really hope he can find some comfort and peace on earth.",1385683200,,1041,4.524064171122995

I also love the characterization of Lois Lane, and I hope others appreciate this version, who's very convincing as someone who would be a successful investigative journalist.

The effects are right up there with contemporary blockbuster movies, though I'm almost feeling urban/skyscraper destruction is getting cliche after this and other recent movies, like Transformers: Dark of the Moon, and Avengers.

5783035,5,B00D91GRA4,"It's amazing to separate the reasons why many people have tried to criticize this movie. First there are the comic marvel fans somewhat brainless praising the nonsense in the Iron man, Thor, & Captain America films ( not to almost mention everything but the first 2 X-men & Spiderman 2 ) and hating the Nolan Batman films. Green Lantern sure. But the question is, what would happen if aliens very superior in all ways to us landed on Earth.  We're not talking the weak ones in the Avengers who it seems anyone could beat if you watch the Widow, Hawkeye & Cap to a degree in action. We're talking very powerful beings who in reality only one could destroy the planet. If you accept that then you have one of the most thrilling movies in which one decent powerful man from space battles 3 ( more if the rest had joined in ) crazed equally give or take powerful beings. This isn't the playtime in Superman 2. It turns into everyone on earth needs to die unless they are stopped.  Superman doesn't have the ability to keep destruction or death from happening while in battle with foes who have the same power. Green lantern might be able to place a blanket force field over a area for a while, while getting his brains kicked in.  Without a doubt the best movie based on a comic book character to this point. The only other to debate are the Batman's.  The movie has emotion, in fact it has everything. Points to remember are that the movie explains why everything that happens, happens. Compare the amount of destruction in the Avengers ending to Superman ( could have been a few minutes shorter but extender version early ). You would be glad that you lived in the Superman movie then the Avengers because Superman would have beaten those aliens in not even half the time, while the Avengers would be down to how long will Hulk last after Thor is finished.

Zod acted like an American upset in a traffic tie-up. Jor drew upon Greek/Roman myth movie for a god like countenance. All misplaced and stereotypic. Fishburne must have been the ethnic diversity quota because he just didn't have credibility as a news dept. head.
2. Cheap, unimaginative graphics borrowed (stolen) from lots of older fantasy movies especially those with floating cities and other floaties. The space craft looked more appropriate for cartoon fantasy with zero basis in reality.
3. Old storyline of bad guys chase good guy; a couple battles ensue; good guy ekes it out in the end. Ho hum.

That makes no scientifically, even middle school level, sense. There is no connection between the two. Or this tripe ""Eventually our military leader, General Zod, attempted a coup.""

Then I happened upon a New York Times article; ""70 Reasons to Dislike the New Superman Movie."" This was my first indication that it might be worth watching. And indeed, it was. Of course, with Superman there are numerous parallels to the spiritual life; a father sending his son to save the world, to be the bridge between their world and ours. Sounds familiar indeed. And in fact, the director (Snyder) intentionally played up these parallels between Superman and Jesus Christ, even explicitly stating such in the ""Special Features"" of the DVD. This approach, I think, produced a well crafted movie.

It is always beautiful to see great strength joined to great humility in one person. The greatest figures in history share this trait, and Snyder was able to transfer this onscreen into the main character; a man of gentle and disciplined strength--far from today's emasculated male figure.",1385596800,3,997,4.970059880239521

There were elements and nuances that were added that, to me, undermine the majesty of Superman's American identity and midwest origins.

For those of us over 40 our understanding of Superman comes from the 50's and for the rest of us it comes from cheesie Debra Winger movies but in this outstanding retelling we are introduced to him as he actually is - a baby sent from Krypton who lands in Kansas and is raised to be the man of steel, faster than a speeding bullet, etc.  This is a sci-fi movie not a fantasy film.

This portrayal must have come about after a pitch meeting in which someone had the brains to say, ""We can't just redo Superman.  We need to tell his story.""  HIS story.  And he's an alien.  So this is a story about an alien who is raised by humans and while Earth is being attacked by similar aliens it is Superman who proves not just that he's a good alien but an American one at that.  Superman is all you could want out of both a sci fi movie and a superhero movie.  Gone are the stupid scenes where we all know Clark is Superman and wonder why in the hell Lois can't figure that out.  This movie is logical.

Much like the newer Batman movies, it strived to provide a real feel to the movie.  You throw a tractor-trailer at your enemy and you miss, it's going to hit a building.

5783058,1,B00D91GRA4,"The Man Of Steel is not a Superman movie nor should it ever be seen as one. I could have overlooked the directors complete lack of vision and originality, Zack Snider has to this day not made an original film worth seeing as far as i am concerned. All his movies have the ghost of his influences floating within each and every frame. I don't fault this movie for being a dumb pop corn flick, i like those movies when they are good, even if this one feels especially dumb. No the fact that this movie is suppose to be a Superman film is the thing that makes me hate this joyless drag of a movie the most. A Superman who has no real reason to want to save any one thanks to his earth fathers fear mongering, a Superman who lacks any real basis for even liking humanity who destroys more property and lives than he actually saves. By the middle of this movie i found my self asking if this was suppose to be the origin story of a Villain version of Superman who was going to hide wile the world burned. I found the inability by the writers to see what road they had sent their main character on that i asked if it was possible for any one to write a movie script in Hollywood. this was a clumsy attempt to make superman more human instead succeeding in making the character seem callus and down right stupid. This is the perfect superman movie for people who hate superman. If all that old fashion goodness and dignity turned you off this movie is for you, if you hate the fact that superman never gives up hope and always finds a way to resolve a problem with out taking a life hey this movie is for you. This is a waste of time and money and a waste of a good guy like Henry Cavil as the lead. Snider shouldn't be allowed to take a video of a duck pond on a borrowed cell phone, let alone direct or write another movie again. Especially one with ""The Man Of Steel"" in a staring role.",1385510400,8,1882,4.144808743169399
5783059,3,B00D91GRA4,"I don't think Ive seen a movie divide audiences like Man Of Steel in a loooooong time. Where should a review about this movie begin? I don't know. I don't really feel like typing a novel.

As you can see, I gave this movie three stars. I really wanted to give it two, but after watching it again, my mind was forced slightly in its favor. This movie is LOADED with problems. Im not even going to attempt to go after every problem I had with this movie so I just made a VERY short list. Too many small details to trash.

My main complaints:

Lois Lane should not be such a huge part of a Superman movie. I know, I know, its Lois Lane, right? Of COURSE shes going to be a huge part of a Superman movie!!! Okay, but she shouldnt be in nearly every scene, in every plot point, in nearly every way moving the whole story along. Shes on screen WAY too much and made me stop enjoying the movie and say Hey, thats a little too convenient and coincidental more than once.

The word maybe should never be uttered in a Superman movie when discussing whether or not Superman should let a bus full of children die. This should especially be the case when the one uttering the word is his father. (And I don't care if he was just Clark or just a kid at that point in the movie! Its still Superman, and it shouldnt even be an issue! Of COURSE Superman / Clark Kent / Kal El would never let a bus load of children drown! What is wrong with you people that think this is okay????)

Lois Lane should not be such a huge part of a Superman mov - Oh wait I already went over that. Well lets go over it again...Having Lois Lane romantically linked to Clark / Superman by the first half of the first movie in a new series removes most of the mystery and romanticism involved in their story. Besides, Lois Lane shouldve been reporting, because shes a reporter, not Supermans sidekick. Especially not in the first part of Supermans story.

The story was packed too full. It didn't give itself time to breathe, much less the audience time to breathe. It seemed like it was convoluted just to be thick. Most of the stuff crammed into the movie served no purpose to the story. It was a rehash of the old Superman 2 with a bunch of extra technical mumbo-jumbo stuffed in to make it all seem bigger and bolder and more exciting. World engines, Codex, Hyperdrives. Rubbish.

Most of the CGI looked just like other CGI. It wasn't this great innovation like Ive heard other viewers describe it (for whatever weird reasons).

What I liked:

Unlike a lot of people, I didn't mind the destruction or Superman killing Zod. I did like the Krypton scenes (Although I thought the flying dragon thing was stupid because, as others have pointed out, it looked just like stuff weve seen before in other movies) and I liked the launching of baby Superman and the story of Kryptons destruction.

I liked the flashbacks.

I liked the action of the movie.

I liked when Clark became Superman.

I liked the music, although it seemed like the Superman theme was repeated every 30 seconds or so.

At the end of the day, this movie was just okay. Nothing new, nothing great. An action movie with Superman in it.",1385510400,3,3160,4.3520408163265305
5783060,5,B00D91GRA4,"This is the best Superman EVER.  The plot is plausible; the characters are not two-dimensional defuses; and the special effects are terrific.  The fights are like actual fights.  Well, they're what you imagine an actual fight of that nature would be like.  I'd watch this again already, and I saw it just days ago.",1385510400,2,314,4.7592592592592595
5783061,5,B00D91GRA4,"THIS MOVIE IS EPIC. I watched it when it was out in theaters - loved it. When I saw it was available for pre-order- I pulled the purchase trigger without hesitation. I waited many long weeks for the blu-ray disc set to arrive but every day waiting was well worth it.

As per the quality of the discs- exceptional video and audio. If you're watching this on a TV without a decent 5.1 home theater set-up then you might as well return it- you don't deserve to watch it. ( I watched it on my Sony 55 HX750 with klipsch XF-48s package and the klipsch xw-300 sub)

Granted the movie is over two hours of running time, I find it hard pressed as to what scenes could be cut out as the overall transition cut scenes were vital to relaying the story/character development.

Henry Cavill- Awesome.
Michael Shannon- Awesome.
Russel Crowe (no big personal fan)- Awesome.

People who complain that its not the same Superman as in the 70s/80s are right. That's stating the obvious. Different generation. I saw those Christopher Reeves editions and liked them- when I was a child. People need to grow up. They need to get over their nostalgia. That was a middle-aged version of a worn out character. This is a rebirth-  a much needed revitalization. People don't live in cartoon shells- war is war- resources are limited- difficult scenarios with limited options- Man up or go home.

I also think its rather small minded of people to complain that the movie was nothing but CGI. A great movie consists of believable characters and deep character development, strong/plausible plot, with an appropriate resolution. For a one part installment- this movie does it all. And yes, the movie does rely heavily on CGI- we are talking about showcasing intergalactic species, intergalactic ships, cosmic battles and epic fight sequences. You cant express the strength of superman/kryptonians with mere blows to the face, a few broken ribs and shattered brick walls- the damage done must be done on a grand scale to give the viewers a glimpse of the shear magnitude of power and strength these characters possess. To have done it any other way would have been folly.
What set this movie apart from all the other superman movies- Superman killed. All the usual nonsensical thoughts of a super-hero with such marvelous powers of not having to kill anyone to save the greater good of mankind/species-kind are thrown out the window as they should be. Zod was an anathema. Superman recognized this- knew there was no other way- Zod would be relentless in his pursuit to destroy anything in his way in repopulating a new krypton. So superman did what he must- and I applaud Snyder on this.

The ensemble of characters is virtually flawless. The musical score- a Hans Zimmer masterpiece.
This may not be an oscar winner- its not geared to that audience- but its still one hell of a movie that commands respect.

5783065,4,B00D91GRA4,"The one thing I want to say is this is not a troll e-mail.  I remember watching the Christopher Reeves version on TV and LOVING IT!  But I went back when I got my blu-ray player and watched it again.  As a grown up looking at it, that version aged horribly.  But more than that; the villains were simply too comical (no pun intended).  I never felt threatened.  Plus I've ALWAYS had a problem with the ""disguise""; I mean he's what? 6'2"" and built like a wall?!?!??!  And no one would notice him?!

With Superman Returns, the studios tried to pay homage to that version and people complained.  Too slow, too sappy, too...whatever.  Superman is an incredibly difficult hero to get right.  I think they did a pretty good job on this one.  They tried to make the movie more relevant to this day and age, and a little less predictable.  The director stated in an interview that there were two things he was concerned about:  1) The red panties on the outside of his costume.  2) Kryptonite.  They tried to make the underwear work, but it just didn't, so the director got rid of them.  And a lot of people felt that to give someone such amazing powers and then have them fall over from what is essentially an allergic reaction to kryptonite was even sillier.  To do a movie without both shows plenty of balls, IMO.

Finally an all out war between Supes and General Zod and Faora + the other aliens sporting alien weapons, should result in PLENTY of destruction with millions being killed.  Sure, he should have taken Zod out to a deserted area, but I have a feeling that Zod would not have given up this advantage so easily.

All in all, given the ridiculousness of this character, I think they did a good job of balancing the mythos while giving him some REAL problems.",1385510400,6,1764,4.45

5783068,4,B00D91GRA4,"This was the best installment of Superman.  It's nice to see an old stale movie series to be completely reimagined.  Comic books usually make stupid plots for a movie.  Out of all the super heros, Superman has the least amount of personality.  It's hard to even relate to nerdy Clark Kent because we know it's all an act anyway.  Sooner or later, he's going to change into boring Superman and save the day...again.

It was really nice to see Superman taking on a more human character.  He's a bit of a social outcast who spends his time drifting from job to job until he finds a piece of his heritage buried deep in the arctic.  He meets his father's consciousness, who tells him what happened to Krypton and why he was sent to Earth.  I like the how Zod comes to earth before people know who Superman is. This gives a sense of suspense of whether people are really going to accept Superman as the real hero.  We're getting sick of the flying dork in a red cape running around doing good deeds for all people.  It's nice and viruous, but it's BORING!  On a side note, Superman's outfit is ridiculous enough without the red speedos over his tights.  Someone FINALLY got rid of 'em!",1385510400,3,1180,4.432558139534883

I liked the relationships, especially with Clark's adopted father (Kevin Costner, who just keeps getting better).  I was gratified that Lois wasn't just a ditzy dame.

5783086,5,B00D91GRA4,"This movie blows Superman Returns away and is the first worthy Superman movie since the original with Christopher Reeve. I know a lot of people were on the fence about the amount of action and violence in this movie but this film has a HIGHLY realistic tone. If you want a campy, fun loving, almost cartoonish take on what an alien invasion in a major city would be like then The Avengers is for you. The climax of this film is basically what would happen if a large alien force invaded a city and there was only ONE super powered being present to fight off the attack in a realistic way. There are real consequences to the battles in this film. The action is over the top and looks amazing.
The music in this film is amazing as well. I honestly didn't think the John Williams score could ever be topped but that music was for Christopher Reeve and the music in this film is PERFECT. When the main score kicks in at the end of the film if you're a true Superman fan you'll get Goosebumps and it will make you anticipate the sequel even more.
All of the performances in this movie are amazing. Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe are amazing as Superman's Earth and Krypton father respectively. Henry Cavill IS Superman. This guy isn't just doing his best Christopher Reeve impersonation. He takes the role and makes it his own. He is jacked beyond belief and just looks like he could tear a city apart with his bare hands. There are times where he's standing there in the Superman costume not even speaking and you just KNOW that this guy IS Superman.
The special features are very, very good and loaded with entertaining and interesting stuff. If you're a fan of Superman or just superhero films in general then this is a must have. If you love action and want a more realistic approach to superhero films then this is right up your alley and will not disappoint.",1385424000,2,1860,4.457478005865102

5783089,2,B00D91GRA4,"It isn't often you see a movie oozing with massive potential that fails to deliver in such a drastic manner. I give the movie credit for the special effects and the perfectly buffed actor that plays the starring role (I am a heterosexual male so giving this guy credit for being so fit says a lot). The movie explodes into action soon after the credits are finished rolling. Russell Crowe and the opening cast grabbed and held my attention. After that the movie slows to a dead stop for far too long.

- SPOILER ALERT BEYOND THIS POINT -

I assume this was supposed to be the ""character development"" phase of the movie which was an epic fail in my view. They spent too much time on ensuring we saw the turmoil within Superman's soul due to unanswered questions. They did it via completely disjointed ""flash backs"" and ""flash forwards"". At any given moment you were either seeing his flashbacked turmoil as a child or as a flashback young adult. I just wanted to say ""I get it already! He has daddy issues!"". Yet the flash-back and flash-forward continued throughout the lion's share of the film. I did not see the need to spend an hour watching Superman search his soul via flash-backs and flash-forwards that seem too disconnected to waste energy keeping up with.

He also was extremely moody and seemed ""super"" depressed. I wasn't sure if during one of the flash-back/forward segments if he was going to punch a hole through his adopted father as a child or run off into the woods crying as a young adult because the world was so mean. One bizarre seen is when he was a grown man working in some dive. A customer picked on a lady that also worked at the dive. Clark Kent approaches the guy and says something like ""I'm going to have to ask you to leave"". The guy stands there with attitude so I'm thinking he is going to throw a punch and hurt his hand or something. As I sat there an waited with bated breath thinking ""finally"", Clark Kent stands there for a few seconds, turns around, pouts, and runs out of the dive. Yet another good build up to absolutely nothing!!! It takes a loooooong time before he finally decides to stop pouting/brooding and takes action. You may as well go get some popcorn and stand in the lobby and text for an hour before anything noteworthy happens (after Krypton explodes). Walk out to the car and play some tunes for a while and then come back. You won't feel like you missed a thing because he will still be awash in disjointed segments of rage and self pity.

The last fight scene went on far too long and it appears that Superman didn't give a crap about injury to civilians as he punches the villain through several skyscrapers filled with people. I'm also not sure why Zod was so hell bent on building a new Krypton on Earth??? He could have taken his planet scrubbing machine anywhere in the galaxy to do it. There was no incentive to kill all life on Earth when the terraforming machine could have done the same thing on an uninhabited planet. They even took the machine from a former colonized planet. Why not just rebuild Krypton there? Also, why did such an advanced race blow up their own planet via using too much energy? In the original version the sun explodes or some natural calamity kills Krypton. In this version the political leaders tapped into the core for energy knowing the planet would be destroyed in the end. They had colonized other worlds previous to that so why did they a) kill their own planet and b) stay there to die with it when they clearly had options??? I could see if their sun was exploding which would narrow the options quite a bit.

Why was a Kryptonian ship buried in the ice on Earth for tens of thousands of years suggesting (at least to me) that humans are the descendants of Kryptonians? Did I miss something? I didn't see them explain why that ship was there waiting for Clark Kent to activate it 50 thousand years later or what have you. The writers only cared about fight scenes and Clark Kent's disjointed, never ending, deep seated flash-back/forward depression. I will say this was the best special effects effort for a superman movie that has ever been made. That does not undue the rest of the issues with this poorly written movie.

The title should be changed from ""Man of Steel"" to ""Man Who Broods"". It is a shame because with the powers he has and his popular strength of character this Superman movie could have been so much more.

It may have been a bit long, and the final battle with General Zod was a bit of overkill, but I prefer this finish to the original Christopher Reeve Superman 2 ending, which was very anticlimactic, in my opinion.  As to how the battle ends between Superman and Zod, I won't spoil it if you haven't seen it,  but I don't have a problem with how it was done, unlike many people on the internet.  The problems I have with this movie are minor.  I like Henry Cavill as Superman, despite the occasional strange facial expressions he exhibits.  There's implausible things that happen, such as Jor-El's consciousness being able to teach Lois how to change Kal-El's original ship into a singularity (which conveniently happens off-screen), but again, as in all comic-based movies, you have to check your reality at the door.  The score is excellently handled by Hans Zimmer, and it definitely stirs the emotions in spots throughout the movie.  To make a long story short, the movie's not perfect, by any stretch of the imagination,  but it's definitely worth the purchase, having already viewed it twice on my Kindle Fire HD, with many more to come, I'm sure.",1385424000,2,1239,4.8619047619047615

I liked how it started with a more in depth look at how krypton met its fate, how superman grew up, that Lois lane already knows his identity and superman didn't start his secret identity until the very end.

Hello all
I have never been a true fan of superman i have warm memories of the cartoon that came on in the 90's and some exposure to him in the justice league and young justice tv shows but beyond that i have very limited knowledge of superman, but being a comic fan you know a little more than a non comic fan. With that said let me say that i am very pleased with this movie in this movie you could really tell that zack snyder and the rest of the crew really tried to do justice to the superman mythos and cared how things were done. While this is a good attempt and a very well done movie it is no avengers and it is not a great movie.

First off what i like

  the story is well done, all the characters from Johnathan, to martha, to clark, and lois are done and the modern spin on the daily planet is a good shot in the arm the series needed after the fall of superman returns.
  the effects are great they really tried to give you the feel of superman flying fighting and all the super heroics he does.
  general zod is a truly evil villain, from the beginning to the end he is single minded in his belief of what he does and his army follows blindly behind him.

  for dc fans there are a couple of easter eggs you will notice if you look like certain names and what not but beyond that nothing for the dc fans out there.
  The special features are good the examination of krypton is really good as well as the other features and the 75th anniversary short is also very welcome for the fans.
  they also made him more relate able in the movie which is a major plus

Now for what i did not like

  first off zack could have done more to connect this to the larger dc universe now i don't know if this was a decision he made or one made for him but i believe it was a mistake.
  if there ever was a movie that deserved a post credits scene it was superman, this i believe was a major mistake, they could have linked it to the Dark knight saga or they could have set the ground for the now announced superman batman movie they did neither and i think this was an opportunity wasted.
  Marvel movies are known for the little shout outs to the larger marvel universe, little names, events or even characters not known to the non comic fans but little things that are known to the fans this could have been done so many times and while there is one or two there could have been more.
  the movie takes a little bit to get started, and while i believe there was no way around this many movies have this problem they still make the first part enjoyable, in this case it is good but the back half of the movie is so much better.
  some of the changes that have been made to the character many true fans may not like.

This is a good movie and i truly believe that zack snyder and his crew were and did do justice to the character there was so much more that could have been done, this is a good movie with lots of missed opportunities that could have been better.",1385424000,,3017,4.05922165820643

Superman Batman and Wonder Woman....the three big guns. DC has successfully sunk sups and bats...I just wish they could keep their heads afloat with WW, but i don't have much hope.

Once again this could have been knocked out of the park...but there was too much effort to hug trees, make lois a more independent woman without jimmy and most of all push the edgy envelope with a kill in the superman collum.

5783125,4,B00D91GRA4,"I rather enjoyed this film.  I really don't understand all the negative chest thumping about this movie.  Yes, it definitely has it's faults, but overall I don't think it's getting the credit that it is due.  So, let's talk about the pluses for a moment.

Great cast.  Russel Crowe is terrific.  Henry Cavill is great as Superman.  He's got the looks, the features, the mannerisms and he's a decent actor.  Lawrence Fishburne, Amy Adams, Diane Lane, etc.  All great actors.  Micheal Shannon nearly steals the show with a fantastic version of General Zod.  Finally we get a Lois Lane that is a knockout.

Loved Krypton and the Kryptonians.  Great interpretation of the world of Krypton.  Instead of a shining beacon of civilization, it is a society in decline and mired in civil war.  Interesting concept.  The Kryptonians themselves were very well done.  You just can't beat the Gothic look with ancient suits of armor.  The entire opening act could almost be a movie in itself.  I should also point out the the costumes were great, especially the one's worn by Zod and his rebels.

Great action.  Some really good no holds barred fighting scenes.  I liked that the movie didn't hold back in this area.  I grew up reading comic books, and fighting was always the payoff.  I'm glad the producers went away from Kryptonite.  That gets so old after while.  No, this movie relies on antagonists that are the equal of Superman.

Special effects.  I know most movies have great effects, so I won't use this as a major selling point.  However, it's obvious that no expense was spared in this area.

Characters.  Zod and Faora were a great surprise for me.  Terrence Stamp put the bar pretty high, and Shannon answered the call.  This time though, Zod isn't a maniac hell bent on ruling everyone at all cost.  No, this version of Zod is obsessed with restoring Krypton to its former ""glory"".  That's a big difference and I liked the change.

Like I said, there is plenty to like about this film.  That being said, I must also point out some of the minuses.

Plot.  I've watched several times and the plot still confuses me.  I still don't get what the Codex is all about.  That definitely could have been improved.

Overkill collateral damage.  You could definitely make a case that a war between super powered beings could lay waste to a lot of the planet, but it was a bit much.  It kind of mentally wore me out in the theater.  Reminded me of the chaos of the Transformers........which is definitely a bad thing.

Jonathan Kent.  Oh, my.  This was the every worst interpretation of Jonathan Kent that I could ever imagine.  Ugh.  Terrible!

Script.  Well, there were a few lines that made me wince a little.  Not the best script at times.

To each his own, but I'm giving this movie a solid thumbs up.  The Blu Ray itself is great.  Amazing picture quality and sound.  You might want to go a little easy on the volume on your home theater for the final act.  It can get real loud.  I consider this a must see for any fan of super hero movies.",1385337600,,3037,4.5474860335195535

5783127,4,B00D91GRA4,"Movie Review: (Blu Ray Review below.)

Man of Steel isn't a movie. It's a cinematic experience quite unlike anything you've ever seen in your life. And you're just not prepared for how fun, entertaining and just amazing an experience it is.

Boasting a stellar supporting cast that's uniformly excellent, a brilliant and moving soundtrack, the film is also technically amazing, with visuals that even in a post Avatar and Avengers world, somehow still manage to assault the senses with their outright audacity and the grandness of their scope. So entertaining is the experience that, despite a running time of some 2 & 1/2 hours, the film feels brisk - and almost too short.

With a strong script from Goyer, the film takes a few surprising and perhaps controversial turns. But despite whatever nitpicking some may have, it's hard to argue that all events serve the story organically and make sense in the context of the filmmakers' vision. It also can't be argued that a large part of the film's success belongs to the strong script from Goyer.

As purely a film, Man of Steel isn't perfect. Goyer's dialog occasionally vacillates between sublime and lofty to downright adolescent. The filmmakers miss a key dramatic opportunity between two of the best actresses working today in Diane Lane and Amy Adams. The meeting between biological father and adult son for the first time is underplayed and lacks dramatic punch. Some moments of exposition seem heavy handed, even here. And the early sequence involving the meeting between the two main love interests feels a little rushed and slightly forced. Plus, there are early sequences where Synder's MTV influenced attention deficit disorder gets the better of him and the editing clips moments too early. An early sequence in which the title character saves people from a burning oil rig, suffers in particular from this tendency. So business-like is the editing, the Director never even pauses to let the audience share in the awe the rescued characters must certainly feel, being saved by a man who's literally on fire.

In large part however, this is Zack Snyder's most accomplished and mature film, both visually and thematically. And despite one or two spots where he doesn't give enough time to let the movie breathe, the vast majority of sequences get just the right space and just the right edge and are executed with flawless bravado and style. Some are so jaw droppingly cool they will leave you slack jawed even in the cinema - where you may well turn to the person next to you and ask, ""did you just see that?"" even though you know you're watching a movie. Ironically, the movie challenges your suspension of disbelief because it's so immersive.

In a world where Avengers raised the bar so high, the idea that a movie about a single superhero could be even MORE epic seems ludicrous. And yet Man of Steel so utterly and effortlessly raises the bar on superhero film action that Avengers seems like a Saturday morning cartoon from the 1970s.

And yet against all the spectacle, Synder is smart enough to craft several heart-wrenching scenes involving young Clark Kent discovering the true extent of his difference from other people, only then to be saved in many ways by the counseling of his adoptive parents. In those moments, Snyder is at his most restrained, and the scenes, beautifully written by Goyer, are played with masterful warmth and nobility by both Diane Lane and Kevin Costner, who despite brief screen time, make indelible impressions. These few sequences, which feel perfectly in place and of which there are almost a perfect number, ground the superhero spectacle in human terms, and elevates the film with a warmth and meaning that many summer tent-poles lack.  Nearly every one of them, if approached un-cynically, moves the viewer.

Unfortunately, the film will be divisive for certain audiences and contains one specially controversial element that will distract from its many accomplishments. First, the final act too closely evokes images of certain important tragedies, so that some fans in particular, will find it hard to watch in places. It might also explain the irrational nonsense that passed for ""criticism"" from certain critics, who all unsurprisingly savaged the flick. This is unfortunate and unfair but possibly understandable. More problematic is that the film may give audiences (and critics) too much credit. For the less discerning, some audience members may misunderstand this Superman. A perennially compassionate character, concerned about the protection of human life above all things, the wanton violence in places and the unquestionably large death toll may lead some to the false conclusion that this Superman just doesn't care as much as previous versions before him. But it's fairly obvious from a story point of view that the stakes are desperate enough that he's given little choice. This is implied rather than explicitly addressed and perhaps the filmmakers should have indulged the audiences to avoid the distraction. Despite the fact that it may have been creatively the right choice, it is an odd decision by a set of very smart filmmakers, who would normally have been expected to avoid that trap.

But even with those observations, the film is spectacle on a scale we've never seen, with characters that are all immediately engaging, and with a smart, strong script that's hard to dismiss. There will be unfortunate and unfair comparisons to Batman Begins - a far more imperfect film with a third act that feels tacked on, but which also diminishes somewhat the accomplishments of the first hour. But Man of Steel is only distantly related to that effort. Whereas Batman Begins is a very good movie with a somewhat shaky third act, Man of Steel is an EPIC and whole cinematic extravaganza that is beyond film, beyond movie, beyond mere entertainment, and more still - it's a sublime imaginative immersion in a world so completely realized with a ferocity and appeal so inexorable, only the deaf and blind could truly deny it.

A few final observations. First, as Superman, Cavill is indeed convincing. But as Clark Kent, I'm not yet quite convinced. Despite a raw physicality and a look that is highly evocative of the character on the comic page, Cavill's acting is also, ironically for me, among some of the weakest of all who've played the character on the big screen so far. To be Superman doesn't take much, once the costume works and the actor looks the part. It's when Cavill has to do some of the talking that I'm a little skeptical. Thankfully, the scenes in which he seems a little shaky are few and far between. And it could well be that some of his nervous smiles and occasional odd choices are less his fault and more a problem of Snyder's decision-making. There are certainly several scenes in which Cavill actually emotes, so it's clear he has potential. So we'll see.

Finally? Despite everything I've written, it's amazing how moving an experience, Man of Steel really is. With tender, delicate performances by Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Russel Crowe, Amy Adams and others, the film also explores realistically the burden of what it must be like to be a boy with the abilities of a God, here on Earth. It does it with aplomb, and not without loads of heart. Movie - 5 stars!

Blu Ray Review:

This Blu Ray unfortunately lacks a real commentary, or any deleted scenes, which I thought was truly unfortunate. There is however a mini, faux documentary about Krypton which is slightly annoying due to the fact that the structure is limiting. We might have learned more about the filmmakers' decision making if they simply discussed their approach to Krypton directly. There's an extended sequence about the physical preparation for the movie which gives a sense of the training for most of the cast. And there is a fun type of commentary involving video with most of the cast members discussing their approach to certain scenes or memories of filming, which takes place simultaneously with the film itself, and nearly all of the major cast participate in this, as well as several members of the production team. As special features go, they're ok, but slightly underwhelming considering how important this movie is. Finally, the Blu Ray includes a DVD copy and Ultraviolet version which are ok if you're interested in those. I've removed one star for the lack of a true director's commentary and the lack of any deleted scenes. If you're a collector of these types of editions, I would suggest waiting for a later release.",1385337600,8,8553,4.951219512195122

5783139,1,B00D91GRA4,"Keeping up with the tradition of pathetic Superman movies, Man of Steel does not disappoint. Im guessing the idea was to reboot the classic comic book hero for a younger, more descerning audience. The result ends up being a story-limp, CGI-heavy feature that simply falls flat on its face while pretty much ignoring decades of media cannon. I hate the Superman charactor but even I can see how far off the hinges this one went... For instance, here are three GLARRING problems with this movie from a comic-book lovers standpoint: 1) Does anyone in the movie NOT know Clark is Superman? I mean really? And lets say you lived in this world - how brain-dead stupid do you have to be not to realize Zod takes you right to his childhood home? One of the greatest story points at the beginning was Lois not knowing who Superman was, but that too went right out the window on this one. 2) Why did no one seem to care that thousands, upon thousands of bystanders were dying in those fight scenes? Not only that, but where were the bodies? If you're going to go through the effort to create the violence, at least have the balls to show its consequences. 3) And not lastly - How does a super-advanced race just die out when thier home world explodes, yet a group of convicts, in a broken ship, have everything they need to simply go terraform a planet?

Poor New York gets it again, with buildings collapsing, exploding, imploding, shattering, falling, etc. The scene where Superman discovers flying was really well done. Henry Cavill looks ah-ma-zing in that suit, let me tell you, mmm-mmm. Now for the bad. This is a very serious Superman. It lacked the charm and humor of the Christopher Reeves Superman, and that's okay, I guess, but it got to be kind of boring after a while. Poor little Clark, picked on by bullies and his ever-so-serious dad being ever so serious about the whole thing. I thought the external plot was good - I liked that Gen. Zod was motivated to save his entire race -- too bad he wasn't so temperamental and looked to another habitable planet - surely there was another one nearby (Mars?). Seemed like they could have worked something out... Anyhow, the thing that bugged me the most, beyond the boring bits and the weird sepia cast to most of the movie, was the religious, Jesus-y overtones. Oh, Clark is 33! What a co-inky-dink! He leaves the ship and assumes the crucifix position. Not too subtle there. And he keeps getting lectured on how he's going to save everyone, and we're reminded that ""he saved us all!""

I have always been an avid fan of the Superman movies except for this one. There was too much change when compared to the original story and I might have considered it more worthy if they just created a totally new superhero. Maybe Alien man since Krypton and their ships reminded you of something you'd see on the movie ""Alien.""

Also it was entirely TOO LONG.  The fight scenes were one big blur and you rarely knew where they were actually fighting. The ""Finding Myself"" time of Superman was also TOO LONG. There was all of this focus on the inner Superman and all it did was make one feel like you knew him less and there was this vibe of his depression etc.
Superman is suppose to be about action, love and heart. Not Superman's inner state. Especially since the character hasn't been fully developed yet. People cared about Christopher Reeves rendition bc it was a slow build like a peeling effect. First starts off awkward, wants to show off, angry for not doing more, exploratory and traveler, back to geek, funny and comical at times, to hero savior, to man in love, to man being depressed bc he can't be w Lois. It took awhile bf the depressed state came and all of his insecurities were brought to the forefront.

And that's what's missing from most of the new Superman movies.

Also Krypton originally was an ice planet. Not a desert land. It also had no dinosaurs on the planet.

Hated that he allowed his dad to die in tornado. He cud have blurred his way through the debris and saved him like on Smallville.

Didn't understand why they didn't just have Jonathan to die of a heart attack like before. That's more realistic that he Wudnt be able to save him. Not the tornado part.

The major major big turn off of the film is that nearly everyone knows or could easily find out who he is since his classmates and the town saw him save them from drowning in a river.

Lois was even able to track him down to the Kent farm to find out about his spaceship. This isn't how they first met. And plus it takes away from the build up effect.

Also at the end of the movie he decides to go incognito wearing his eyeglasses and supposedly Lois doesn't know who he is even though he has the same last name as Superman which is Kent. She tracked him down. And he didn't kiss her to make her forget.
Overall this was a bizarre film.

The only parts I liked was the explaining Zod's side or reason for him becoming a moron. Also liked the film telling what happened after Clark left his mother and went traveling along the way to meet his shadow father who should have taught him for 12 years if you go by Christopher Reeves rendition.

5783157,3,B00D91GRA4,"This is probably the most difficult movie for me to rate in a while. I love Superman, Batman, Spiderman, Thor and pretty much the whole comic-to-movie scene. It's great to see characters brought to life but sometimes the stories are bad or the movie fails to entertain. This movie suffers from neither of those but I was just as frustrated as I was entertained because this storyline strays so far from how the Superman story was originally told that it was unsettling. Top that off with typical production oversights and it affects the quality of the movie

For example, one ""roll your eyes"" moment is when Superman and Zod (who only moments ago learned to fly) clinch together and punch each other into space, they ""land"" on a satellite (what are the chances of that?), then re-clinch as they plummet back to Earth--by coincidence, right back to the middle of Metropolis. They crash through the roof of what looks like Grand Central Station and continue fighting. Ten seconds later Lois Lane who was watching them fight (ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN) as they blasted off into space, comes running through the front door to continue watching. How did she get across town in ten seconds? Great taxis I suppose. The movie is filled with moments like that. A shame.

Also Jonathan Kent dies of a heart attack everywhere else. Here, he has a son who is invulnerable and has super speed, nevertheless he dies horribly trying to save a dog while his son--Superman!--stands idly by and watches. I rolled my eyes so hard they almost popped out of their sockets.

The rest I will leave to you to discover but I will say this. First, the movie is entertaining. If you've never seen a Superman movie before or know the basic story you may like it more than I did. Since the comic-to-movie genre is so successful, I don't see why Marvel and DC sell the rights to companies that want to change the story so much. This made sense 30 years ago, but now?  If they stuck to their guns, they'd still sell the rights...to someone.",1385251200,2,2009,4.603351955307263
5783158,1,B00D91GRA4,"This Superman is dark and brooding. The young Clark (whoever the Brit actor is) broods and pouts and at times yells disrespectfully to his father. That was NEVER in the real Superman concept.  This character brooded and brooded through most of the movie and finally got up enough gumption to wake up and start protecting the world from a sociopathic soldier from Krypton planning on destroying Earth.

The actor was not attractive and balding. Lois was frumpy and bloated in her face. She swore and joked about men's private parts. She dressed terribly and had no manners. She was in scenes where she did not belong in. Like flying around in a military cargo plane attempting to attack the bad guys. Superman's uniform looked like dark blue waffle long johns. His cape was just a big piece of dark velvet cloth. Of course the colors HAD to be dark.

Clark's mom and dad (both in Krypton and Earth) were redeeming actors--Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe added class whenever they were in the movie. The rest of the cast was just set dressing.

Towards the end there was so much smashing and destroying, it got to sound like a bad video game. Superman against the bad guys. Smashing up entire cities and sky scrapers. Lois always nearby panting with fear that her heartthrob might get hurt. Yawn. Pleeze, someone kill the other already..... the fight scenes lasted so long I started looking for knitting needles to poke my eyes out..

This movie was a very poor representation of the character and the morals behind the Superman concept. I'm sure there will be a sequel. I can't imagine how it will be any worse.

I saw the Chris Reeve movies at the theaters and was a big fan of them.  I loved the first and second ones and when the Richard Donner cut was released on Blu Ray for Superman 2 I purchased it and thought it was the better version.  (Movies 3 and 4  are better forgotten. Maybe they took place in a parallel dimension.)

I thought Superman Returns was OK but like so many others have stated it seemed to lack something.  Superman never seemed to get emotional or punch anything but spent too much time stalking Lois Lane.

In the C. R. versions Brando was Jorel, hard to top that.  But I have to say that Superman's Kryptonian and adoptive earth parents were well played in this feature.

Much have been said about the over-the-top destruction in Metropolis and (spoiler alert) Superman's breaking his code against killing.  There have been some tweaking of the traditional Superman story points.  But the basics of the mythology is still there.

Superman has become a story that has been recreated time and again for new generations, as such the story evolves to become more relevant.

I don't care about Lois, I don't care about Perry, I don't care about Zod or Clark or ANY of the characters in this film.  The performances are leaden and emotionless.  The plot isn't really undeveloped: as a reboot of the franchise, it's still a great concept.  However, the writing seems only to serve the special effects; it's as if the CGI people said ""Hey, here are a bunch of sweet shots!  Put some dialog in between 'em, willya?""  Nope.  Splashy effects and Dolby surround sound are great, but not even THEY can completely drive a comic-book movie.  Gotta have real dialog and character development.

I grew up watching the TV show. That was far superior to this movie in terms of character development.

Independence Day is copied in parts and Sears has a very prominent placement.

It is about 15 minutes too long and Lois Lane needed to be played by someone else. Perry White never wore an ear ring.

The CGI aspects of the film are spectacular but they are also the reason I gave the film a four star review instead of a five star rating. I actually enjoyed the storyline and the acting a lot. A top notch cast helps make this film really good.

There are tremendous CGI graphics in the movie that really make the film an action packed adventure. Unfortunately we may have arrived at a time where directors are trying to overwhelm the audience with CGI at the expense of enhancing the script and interaction of the characters. This movie could have been reduced by 20 minutes and been just as good but the continuing fight scenes just took over the film.

As a child I read the DC comics and truly was a fan of all of the super heroes. Superman was my favorite. The story line follows the comics to some extent and yet it also develops its own new Superman genre. I can accept that and see how they were trying to create an interesting and fast action movie. I liked the film a lot but directors have to learn that every film just doesn't have to have so much action that it detracts from the real story.

5783176,1,B00D91GRA4,"Man Of Steel-Producer and Writers Had No Idea of What Comprised The Superman Canon!!

When I started watching this movie it quickly became apparent to me that this movie was going to morph into a CGI extravaganza of explosion and destruction and having very little to do with the legend of Superman.  First off in no previous Superman incarnations was Jor-El killed by General Zod.  The destruction of Krypton has always been just the jumping off point to explain how Superman came to Earth and gained his powers.  This movie was very hard to follow because it seemed to be nothing but CGI explosions and destruction  occasionally broken up by vignettes of dialogue.  The first time we view The Man of ""Hope"", we see that the producer/writers have violated one of the most basic canons of Superman.  His beard and nails do not grow under a yellow sun.  I got the feeling that prior to beginning this movie the producer/writers maybe looked at a few Superman comic books, maybe a Christopher Reeve Superman movie and maybe one or two episodes of Smallville and Lois and Clark.  They had just enough information to make the audience think that they(the producer/writers) knew what Superman was about.  In the movie, Clark Kent revealed his powers to Pete Ross and Lana <ang as well as any other kids on the bus who were paying attention.  In the canon, Pete Ross discovered Clark was Superboy during a camping trip and Lana, while she had her suspicions never really did.  Skip to the present.  Superman reveals himself right away to Lois Lane.  In the canon, never happened that way.  Superman loses his powers when he goes on board a Kryptonian vessel!  C'mon, they state in the movie that Superman gets his powers from our sun.  So how could he lose them on a Kryptonian ship that is on Earth.  This movie just SUCKS!!  The producer and writers owe a big apology to the families of Superman creators, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.

If you thought X-Men Origins: Wolverine was awful, then feel free to rent this movie, as it is nowhere near that bad.

As for more details about his youth and his lineage I think their are places to explore that. We all know that superman's weakness was kryptonian but the question in my mind was always why. And no one ever tried to explain that/ But this film made some sense as to how and why it was affecting him.

5783201,5,B00D91GRA4,"Zack Snyder's ""Man of Steel"" is a divisive movie among fans. Much like Christopher Nolan's swan song for ""The Dark Knight Trilogy,"" it has caused quite a stir either being loved or hated, there are few who are in the middle. I am personally of the mind that it was a great modernization of the character and his mythos much the way both ""Batman Begins,"" and ""Amazing Spiderman"" took the stories we know and added some reality and humanization to them. Say what you want about the film though, it was a complete success for WB/DC/Legendary and has set a fire under DC's that has them scrambling to capture some of that shared universal goodness that Marvel has been riding for almost a decade now.  What I am giving here is my personal opinion on what was well done, and the much debated destruction of Metropolis and killing of Zod.

Let's start with the stuff that most people will agree with:
Krypton: The opening of the film was absolutely fantastic. This was a real world and it showed in every detail. From the landscape to the science and politics, Krypton felt more real than any other iteration I'd seen on screen. Also the little time we spent with the characters while still on planet really helped sell the relationships later on, and set up the drama as well. I wish there had been more, and I would love to see some flashbacks when we get the next solo sequel, and they could easily set up Supergirl in that flashback as well.

The Cast: The cast of the movie truly elevated it to great heights to me. Starting with Henry Cavil who you believe as the outsider that just wants to help, he embodied a version of Clark Kent we hadn't seen before on the big screen. On that same note, Amy Adams played a no-nonsense Lois Lane, who would never be fooled by a pair of glasses. Her investigative skills bring her right to the doorstep of the man of steel, showing she's more than a damsel in distress. Michael Shannon could've chewed scenery all film after seeing his performance in ""Premium Rush,"" but instead we got a nuanced, thinking man's performance. His reasoning was completely understandable and though he was vicious you feel for his plight. Laurence Fishburn was a great and inspired choice for Perry White, and I only wish they had given him more to do, and Antje Traue was a great right hand for Shannon, beautiful and ruthless. But it was Russell Crowe's Jor-El and Kevin Costner's Johnathan Kent that really stood out for me, as they exemplified the duality of the lessons they were teaching Clark/Kal. Diane Lane should not be forgotten as she was still Clark's anchor and she definitely played a great Martha Kent.

Modern Superman: This is definitely a new take on Superman. Closer to many of the recent modern takes seen in comics and on ""Smallville,"" here we have a Clark who is unsure of himself, and his place in the world, he wanders the country and the world simply trying to get by and figure himself out, but can't fight his nature to help people in need. This Clark was a real person that we see, not a caricature of a person so goofy people won't look twice at him.  Clark is Superman and they established that by having him not be the Clark we all know until the end, and even then he's just a normal guy, not a bumbling fool. And once he does figure out his place he embraces it wholeheartedly. And that's the beginning of the Superman we all love.
The Suit: The movie rested on how Cavil looked in the suit and he fit it perfectly. Starting by building an impressive physique to go under the suit, Cavil and Snyder wanted real muscle not padded musculature for this new Superman to feel like he really could lift a car above his head. The design of the suit itself is a testament to the dedication to detail. The suit looks alien, and yet it still looks classic. Sure it's missing the underoos but it still says Superman when you see it. The use of the CGI cape was awesome as it allowed for some truly iconic poses.
Flight and Fight: So for the longest time, and I mean as long as I can remember fans have wanted to see Superman truly let loose onscreen. We finally got that here, and though the reactions to it will be discussed later in the debated section I wanted to mention it here as well. THIS is what a Superman fight should look like! I mean the man can toss cars around like  we do balls, so the action NEEDS to be on an insane level. Not just relegated to lifting heavy stuff, and throwing it the fights were kinetic, and destructive as a fight of that magnitude would be. I remember watching ""Superman: Doomsday"" and saying ""Now that's what I'm talking about!!"" this was truly what I as a fan had been waiting for. Then there was the flying, and yes I know it comes first in the film but we had seen flying before. Christopher Reeve made us truly believe a man could fly! And Neo did a damned fine job in the last two Matrix films, and Iron Man has made flying just look cool and fun. But here we get the true feeling of speed that Superman has as well. It's not that he's soaring through the sky or weaving in and out of mountains it's the visceral feeling of speed as things blur around him, and the unbridled joy Clark is experiencing when he flies. I think it was actually a great move to have him learn how to fly so late in life, it allows the audience to experience it with him as well as show that even though he is used to having abilities he can still take pleasure in things like flight.

Military Involvement: Much like Michael Bay's ""Transformers"" franchise MoS chose to highlight the alien aspect of Superman's origin, and in doing so to touch on the phobias that humanity has towards things they don't understand. This film is very much a first contact story in that the world reacts to aliens with fear more than awe and curiosity. Granted had Superman come out to the world before Zod appeared threatening Earth, things may have gone different, but not much. The military involvement is proof of that. From the moment there was a possibility of a threat to national security the Military was involved, and this is shown from the fact that it's not until AFTER the battle of Smallville that they consider Superman and ally. The whole battle they are firing indiscriminately at the Kryptonians, including Superman. Xenophobia is a major part of this film, and the military is pretty much the embodiment of that in the film.

Easter Eggs: From a Wayne Enterprises satellite, to several LexCorp objects, to even lesser known references, Man of Steel was chalk full of goodies for long time fans to find. Hell you can Google them at this point they've been pointed out so much. I won't list them here but there are quite a few, some of which are pretty fun, like the ""Keep Calm and Call Batman"" sign in the bank during the Smallville battle.

THE DEBATED!!!!!
Herein lies the topics that are still being debated to this day about the film. Mind you these are my opinions. I state none of this as fact and am writing simply to start discussions. Please no hate messages or telling me how stupid I am. I'm a sensitive individual!!

Pa Kent: First of all I want to start with the fact that everyone is complaining about the part from the trailer where Pa Kent's response to a young Clark's question of ""What was I supposed to do? Let everyone die?"" was ""Maybe."" It took a second viewing of the film to get the whole idea of what I think they were trying to do with Pa Kent. That scene, or any of the scenes with Pa Kent can't be taken as stand alone, and they really work best as part of the entire film. Taken as a whole, the lesson that was attempting to be taught to Clark isn't one of shame, or hiding, or cowardice or anything like that. He was simply a father trying to protect his son. He wasn't saying not to help, but to do it as secretly as possible, until he is ready to stand before the world. At first I thought he was trying to tell him to wait until the world was ready for him, but that would never happen. Perry White reiterates this when Lois tries to drop the story basically echoing what Jonathan Kent believed; that the world would react out of fear towards him. Jonathan knows his son and knows that it's not in him to not help people. Lois sees this too. It's anonymity that Jonathan wants for Clark, until he is ready for what will come. He wants him to understand that human nature is to fear what they don't understand and that for every grateful person there will be more that want to exploit or hurt him because they fear him, and that puts everyone else at risk, and he has to think about the bigger picture. I know a lot of people feel it's not a good lesson, but it's the one that makes sense for the world today. Besides the fact that the lesson from the original Superman film, that there are just some things you can't change was COMPLETELY lost on Superman in that film, as he reverses time to save Lois. So he didn't learn a damned thing from Pa Kent's death in that. As a matter of fact Superman 2 had another instance of him making a decision and not having to live with it when he gave up his powers, easily rectified by a glowing green crystal, and this actually leads into the next issue of debate.

Superman Kills Zod: In 1988 Superman was forced to execute not one but three Kryptonian criminals from a parallel dimension, in Superman #22, which took place after the ""Crisis on Infinite Earths"" event that rebooted the DCU for the 80's. But this wasn't Zod's first death. No, Superman killed Zod for the first time in the classic Superman 2 film. YUP! Sure he didn't snap Zod's neck, but letting him drop to a bottomless pit isn't much better. And again three died that day. No one thinks about it because it was a non violent end, but they weren't in a floating piece of mirror anymore. Plus even if the pit isn't bottomless, they were powerless so they either froze to death in pain or jus broke their necks or something. Real humanitarian that is. In Man of Steel we get a serious internal struggle over what to do as you see it on Clark's face. And that death at his hands, the last of his kind, a former friend to his father and the cause of so many deaths in the city will haunt him forever. And THAT bring us to the Superman with the no kill rule. Also it brings us to the final debated topic.

Destruction of Metropolis: So people wanted a great Superman fight but they were unhappy with the level of destruction caused by said fights. Well um, sorry it's called collateral damage. Am I a cold callous individual? No! I'm a realist. Plus this is entertainment. That kind aof level of fight does not happen without some buildings and part of the city damaged. I mean watch any comic cartoon with large scale battles. ""Superman:Doomsday"" is an example, ""Justice League and JL: Unlimited"" are other good examples. The only difference is that there were actually people shown running for cover and such during the battle on MoS. This to me just gave a sense of realism. The city didn't just get magically evacuated when trouble started. Also many people have said ""Why didn't Superman just take the fight out of the city?"" And how do you suppose he did that? Ask Zod politely to take it to an abandoned desert or something? Run away and hope Zod followed? Yeah not with the Black Zero above Metropolis, and not while he had to take out the World Engine over the INDIAN OCEAN!!!  Yes he flew round the world in a few minutes to get back to Metropolis. And my personal favorite ""Why didn't he try and save people in Metropolis?"" When? While he was fighting Zod? Or While he was trying to destroy the World Engine? My point is he did everything he could to minimize damage by stopping the threat. Simple as that.

I love to plays Devil's Advocate and try and defend bad movies. But this isn't a bad movie at all. I loved it. It was a modern retelling of a classic and modern myth. I really though all the changes made sense and were made organically.

Henry Cavill has great potential, but he spends far too much time crashing through buildings and not enough time interacting with the other characters. The best parts are Cavill's scenes with his parents (Diane Lane and Kevin Kostner). The rest of the film is weighed down by SFX overkill. The screenwriters' vision of Superman isn't the mysterious, slightly sinister figure of the early years (1938-48) or the squeaky-clean hero of the middle period (1949-86), but rather a conflicted outcast in the mold of Wolverine or Spiderman. That's a sad fate for the costumed superhero archetype. The story is bland but functional and a talented cast do their best with weak material, especially Russell Crowe who tries hard to make a dull origin story interesting. Overall, this is an admirable film that fails because its serious pretensions are undermined by laughable scenes like Lois Lane (Amy Adams) exploring an arctic cave at night in high heels and Jonathan Kent's suicide by tornado.",1385078400,3,1108,5.093406593406593

5783218,2,B00D91GRA4,"Superman was one of the very early comic books I enjoyed as a young kid, and I've read those comics for decades. I haven't always liked the changes they've put the character through, but nothing I had reservations about in his comic book portrayals disappointed me in the manner this movie did.

First, very little about this movie and virtually nothing about the character spoke out to me as being Superman. Henry Cavill's portrayal of our single favorite super strong, super fast, invulnerable hero was almost devoid of emotion. Even his brief and infrequent outbursts of anguish seemed forced, and that was virtually the only emotion the writers or director allowed him to show. I just didn't get ""I'm Superman"" out of this performance in any way. Yes, he was brave. Big deal.

Amy Adams as Lois Lane was OK, but brought little life and only a dab of the spunk to the role that we've watched over and over again from Margo Kidder's performance. It's as if the direction was afraid to ""go big"" with the acting in a genre that demands its characters be very, very big.

Laurence Fishburne was wasted, as Perry White's scenes in the film were throw away moments that really added nothing to the story or the atmosphere of the film. If they had been completely cut you'd never have noticed them missing.

And that's just the acting ... when I start discussing the story decisions thing go downhill in a hurry:

1. As a Superman ""traditionalist"" I didn't get having Lois Lane track the mysterious super-alien back to his roots with an over-simplistic and hardly detailed investigation that took her directly to the Kent farm. This is not a spoiler, as this happens early in the film and you can see it coming a mile away.

2. The entire sub-plot about her desire to have an expose on an alien presence in the form of a super being on Earth had some interesting potential but in the end was just a throw away story element. More on that later.

3. These writers decided to follow the course of many on having Jonathan Kent die. The manner of his death, especially vis a vis Kal-El as his adopted son, was a complete disconnect for me from the possibility of this character being Superman. It was supposed to provide some deeper psychological underpinning for this Superman story, but it was merely ill thought and useless.

4. Having Superman's relationship with ""Earth"" transition from moving from a suspected alien threat to a friend and savior was horribly bungled. It was an idea. It just wasn't an idea these writers could competently plot.

5. Turning the end of the movie into an extended battle pretty much resulting in the destruction of Metropolis (sorry if that's a spoiler) was a decision made for the purpose of having a special effects spectacular with what the writers/director hoped would be shock value. Sorry, that's been done. And in this context it made little sense and by logic hampers the story. At the time this happens, ""Superman"" is completely unknown to the public Even with General Zod's public announcement, this is not a character known, trusted, or beloved by the public. The virtual destruction of Metropolis, in which he participated even as he tried to stop it, would leave pretty much everyone resentful and suspicious of this being. From either the standpoint of logic OR emotion, it just doesn't work.

6. As I promised, back to Lois' expose: That could have been a really interesting element of a Superman introduction if handled with any subtlety or intelligence at all. If it had been the main theme of the movie and been well written, it could (and probably should) have carried the film. Yet the moment Zod shows up with his announcement, ALL of the effort put into that sub-plot became completely wasted. It is obvious that the creators of this story had many ideas, didn't have the skill or talent to boil them down to a few that would work well together, and just jumbled everything they thought might be ""cool"" into one extended, illogical mess that had little to do with a satisfying ""Superman Origin"" story.

7. Then at the end, we have Clark Kent merrily showing up for work as a reporter at the Daily Planet (where of course Lois already knows his secret!). But how? When? With the damage and evident loss of at least tens of thousands of lives, Metropolis would have had to be essentially abandoned as a toxic environmental nightmare, not to mention graveyard ... and that included extensive damage to the Daily Planet Building itself that likely would have taken years of repair, if it was even deemed structurally to be salvageable!

It's like this film was written by clueless 20-somethings with no idea of even the most simple practical results of the events they were so proud of. These writers seem like the kind of people you'd see Jay Leno quizzing on the street and finding incapable of locating Canada on a map of North America. LOL

There is more but this review is long enough.

Suffice it to say that if this movie is at some point in the future playing on one channel, and Christopher Reeve's Superman of 1978 happens to be playing on another at the same time, I'll be watching the 1978 version. This film simply has none of the charm, humor or life of the first series. In fact, the much lambasted ""Superman Returns"" had a far more convincing and embraceable story than this film.

I've always been a DC fan over Marvel, but Marvel and who they choose to work with in films is flat-out putting the DC portrayals to shame. Comparing this film to ""The Avengers"" leaves ""Man of Steel"" looking as flat as a pancake. It's very sad, as I was really looking forward to the prospect of an excellent new Superman movie.

To finish with a technical note, the special effects are well executed. In my opinion 3D is wasted, just get the regular Blu ray if you must see this. Nothing about the 3D stood out to me at all in the frequent jumble of wreckage presented in this film.

I was often annoyed by the decisions to go with a ""pushed"" look for most of the film (especially the flashbacks) that often left scenes looking grainy and washed out. It was a stylistic choice that didn't work for me as a viewer.

Whether you enjoy the CGI effects and scenes or not, nothing about the excellent technical presentation can make up for the ineptitude of the plotting or writing.

I was looking forward to this film a lot. In the end I cannot recommend it whatsoever. I will try out the sequel and see if they do better, and hope that I can completely forget this one and pretend that the next one is first in the reboot sequence. If they can't get the next one right, that will be the last of this series I watch, if it even survives the next installment.",1385078400,21,6700,4.605704697986577

5783232,5,B00D91GRA4,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie for a long time. I read a few horrible critical reviews of the film before I saw it. Still, I promised myself that I was going to see it so that it was I did. When I saw the movie I was totally lost as to why it has received such harsh criticism. Not only did the movie exceed my expectations after reading the critical reviews - it exceeded the expectations that I had before I read those reviews.

This is a great film. It is second only to The Dark Knight as my all time favorite super hero film.

The criticisms of the movie are vast. I do not share any of them. I liked the extended focus on the back story in Krypton. I liked that Clark Kent's rearing on Earth was told in several flashbacks. His character was developed in a novel, compelling and entertaining way. I am glad that the filmmakers FINALLY decided to show a super hero flexing their super powers with no restraint. All of the complaints about CGI effects are ridiculous to me. This is a Superman movie. He is fighting super villains this time. How did all of these critics expect for the fights to be depicted without the aid of CGI effects?

The complaints about all of the destruction are off base to me. The villains were trying to take over the planet. Additionally, this movie is about Kal-El/Clark Kent becoming a hero. He does not have his super hero tactics perfected yet. Zack Snyder addressed this criticism and stated that there would be repercussions for the destruction that come to light in the sequel. I thought that it was blatantly obvious that that was the message that the filmmakers were trying to convey in the movie.

The movie was exceptionally well cast. Henry Cavill was great in the role of Kal-El/Clark Kent (he has not yet taken on the Superman moniker at this point in the story - although it is alluded to in the movie). Amy Adams is a great Lois Lane. Lois Lane is depicted as being intelligent, competent and aggressive in this film. The character is shown much more respect.  Michael Shannon was terrific as General Zod.  He was really great.

The music score was fantastic (yes, even the music score was criticized). The score was masterful in the way it drove the tone of the scenes in the film.

I can't wait for the continuation of this story. Hopefully, Henry Cavill will have much more dialogue in the upcoming film. He is a good actor and now that he has been successful in the lead role of a blockbuster film the filmmakers should trust him to craft more of the narrative through his acting ability.

In the movie theater where I saw the film the movie got an ovation. Most people were standing.

Man of Steel deserves far more respect than it is getting. It is one of my favorite films.",1384992000,2,2741,4.431411530815109
5783233,2,B00D91GRA4,"With a price tag of 225 M, this movie only made around 290 M domestically. Clearly not that big a hit. WB has decided to save a few pennies by releasing this skimpy set.

1. This set contains 3 discs but has only 2 holders/slots. Two discs share the same slot and are placed one on top of the other.

2. The 2 blu-ray discs are the most ""see-through"" discs I've seen. I compared them to other blu-rays in my collection. There are many that are not totally opaque but this set is practically transparent compared to them. The discs played fine but I'm worried that they maybe of inferior quality.

3. As someone who loves special features and ""making-of"" videos, I am terribly disappointed by the special features disc. The movie is presented all over again with what is essentially a video commentary. The trouble is it moves from pre-production, to some trivia, to production, to behind-the-scenes in a haphazard manner depending on the scene in the film. If works fine if you look at a scene in isolation and the commentary focus on what was relevant to it, but I was not a fan of watching the whole movie this way. Plus, there is no option to selective play a particular featurette. Again, is WB skimping on on production budget for this set? I'd like to think so. I'm sure its easier to slap some behind the scenes video on top the movie, than create a proper set of menu based featurettes.

Even ""Superman Returns"" is better than this. The 1978 movie with C. Reeve was much better and more in keeping with the comics at the time. Since I haven't purchased a Superman comic in the past 25 years, maybe this IS the Superman of today. The Superman I grew up with would NEVER, EVER kill!

Somehow, my reading of the product was that I would get this really nice shield and stand, but it's just junk.  And the odd shape of the movie package inside the tin means you can't keep it with the rest of your movies.

Since I've opened it and it isn't a lot of money, I'll keep it, but if I could do it over again, I would NOT have bought this package, but instead would have gotten the regular packaging, about $10 less, for just the disks.

Amy Adams as Lois Lane was an interesting choice, but she is a good actor, and pulled it off. Antje Trauein as Faoro, part of Zodd's team, was fantastic. I really enjoyed her scenes. The film looked great, and I think it was a good start in what is obviously supposed to (they hope) be a successful reboot of an eternally popular franchise. I'm sure they are hoping to make at least 3 or 4 of these new ones.

I am definitely interested in the sequel, Batman vs. Superman. I think Ben Affleck will do just fine as Batman. I don't mind when movies stray from cannon and I don't compare this to the classic ones or comics. Obviously, no one can ultimately compare to Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder, but I think Henry Cavill does just fine, and he is definitely easy on the eyes. ;) I have no issues with his portrayal, the writing, or the directing.

He fills Christopher Reeve's boots and Cavill is definitely the new Superman for the ages.  I look forward to seeing him with Ben Afflect in the new Batman Superman movie, and in the coming Justice Leage.

5783247,3,B00D91GRA4,"Didn't hate but didn't like it either...it was okay.  SPOILER.  I really didn't like many things about this movie, as many have said Jonathan Kent being a bit of a jerk not caring if Clark left his friends to drown in order to protect his secret, that was bad, also the ways Clark lets his father Jonathan go get the dog knowing full well that his dad most likely will die, really bad, he saved his little school friends but is okay with letting dear ole dad die for the dog, good job Supes.  The absolutely worse thing (at least to me) was Lois Lane, she knows his secret with ridiculous investigations and she spoke like a trucker, like ""are we finished measuring out d's""  what the heck and so on, nothing ladylike about her as the real Lois Lane would be, tough but a lady, this was just not right, I loved that whole Lois doesn't know and Superman puts on his glasses and nobody knows, that's classic.  Now I did like some of the movie and didn't have a problem with the destruction of the property, I did have a problem with Superman not really giving a second thought to the lives that were being taken, Superman is suppose to be the ""boy scout"" superhero/moral compass of the league.  Hope they do a better story in the second movie.  I gave it 3 stars because as a stand alone movie it was just okay not a real Superman movie I'd recommend.",1384905600,,1349,4.308300395256917
5783248,1,B00D91GRA4,"movie and Superman 2 you would think that it wouldn't be that hard to do yet they fail at it time after time. The Man of Steel isn't as bad as Superman 3, 4 or Returns however it is also no where as good as the first two movies. There are some parts of the movie I did like though

The good
I like the new suit that was used for the film it is different from the other films and I think it looks cool.  I like the fact that they explained the S on his costume is a symbol form Krypton and I also like the fact they didn't use thr Superman theme from the other movies it has suffered enough.

The bad

There is a lot of bad in this movie for example after multiple movies,  animated films, and with the series Smallville we didn't need to see another origin story it was a waste of time and unproductive. Krypton is changed for the film it looks more like Pandora than krypton.  The characters are not developed you never feel for any of them from Clark to Zod you really never care for the character im fact they bore you.  Zod which is an interesting character in the original movies and animated films is just a gnereic super villain nothing special which is a shame since his character has so much more to offer than that.  Instead of showing the impact his Earth parents had on Clark they show little hits of it in flashback I think they should of done that with Krypton instead.  The plot which is weak as it is already disappears half way through the movie for some unknown reason at which point the movie becomes a boring mess that just steals your time don't listen to anyone who says they like the plot it doesn't exist.  The critics where right about the movie so much potential that is wasted.

After my 14 year old son and I watched Man of Steel we watched  Superman 2 which even he agreed the Man of Steel was just awful.  If you are looking for a good Superman movie the Man of Steel isn't it Superman and Superman 2 are far superior movies.",1384905600,7,1955,4.153846153846154

The story jumps around a lot and well Superman has no balls, except the desire to save people, He could have fought back and maybe would go too far once and then get branded a freak, but he never does. Not once, her takes abuse and still loves humans? Maybe they should have showed his parents talking to him more.

This could have been done way better. Just no flow and well a lot of just yelling by Superman.  How he becomes a reporter with Lois knowing the deal was weak at best. Let put it this way, they rebooted Hulk because they knew it sucked. Maybe this one will get the same treatment?",1384905600,5,739,4.125

After watching the film however I have to say that this is my favorite Superman and I hope they make some more with this cast. The man of steel was awesome from his incredible physique to his soft spoken manner. The special effects were great and the overall feel to the film was nice. If I had one complaint it would be that the final fight scene seemed to drag on a bit.",1384905600,4,509,4.1
5783253,5,B00D91GRA4,"My sincere thanks to the casting director for finding such a handsome man to play Superman.

I love Cristopher Reeve as superman, but Henry Cavill is also excellent. While Reeve has boyish charm and boyish looks, it seems that Cavill isn't as charming... a little more brooding. That being said he's great - Sigh - and great to look at!

A bigger upset for me is that Lois Lane has become a bit wimpier. I much prefer the 1980's Lois played by Margot Kidder. She was abrasive and exciting character in her own right. This is not the case for Adams who is just ... there. Very conveniently, always there, in fact, for superman to scoop up. I also think that Lois Lane is better with darker hair. But that's another bone to pick.

Zod is a badass, as is his crew. Good job Zod!

An excellent hero film, I am anxiously awaiting a sequel :)",1384905600,4,836,4.339743589743589

5783258,4,B00D91GRA4,"Though too much emphasis was placed on special effects, I liked the quicker way Superman was shown to fly. The way he killed General Zor though was questionable: if both men are invulnerable on planet Earth how can Superman break his neck and kill him? The overall story was compelling. The happy ending with Superman as Clark Kent joining The Daily Planet was fitting.",1384905600,6,369,4.78125
5783259,5,B00D91GRA4,"Some People didn't like this because of the ending, not to spoil it for anyone, but lets be realistic here if Superman would fight a small army of Kryptonians, they would cause the amount of damge and deaths that happened.  The old Superman Movies Superman would take time out of the fight to make sure everyone was alright or people would get out of a bus that was thrown down the street like in Superman 2, when we all know it would probably have killed everyone on the bus.  This is A Superman set in the real world with real world deavestation.  Superman is trying to save the entire Earth and he doesn't have time to stop in the middle of fighting an army to save each person that's in harms way.  I think this is the Best Superman Movie to come along in a long time and I can't wait for the sequel; Superman vs. Batman, and I don't care what anyone thinks Ben Affleck as Batman is a good fit.  Watch the movie, ""The Town"" and think about the Batman Described in the next Movie and older more grizzeled Batman that is thinking about getting out of it.

5783268,5,B00D91GRA4,"I really had low expectations about another superman movie. All the Marvel movies and the latest in updated Batman's set the bar not to mention the Star Trek set.

I think they did a nice job of giving more back story and the bonus features really help. I was a big time comic book fan back in the late 60's and through to the mid 70's. Much more of a Marvel Super hero fan.

After 26+ years as an Analytical Chemist (needless to say), if there is anything in a SciFi that seems unsound scientifically, I spend the whole rest of the movie calculating out how that could be possible. Too many of those in a move and I'm done.

Yea, I know all SciFi nuts do the same thing.

I really don't want to give anything away in this review, so all I'm going to say is, I bought the movie and watched it twice back to back then again the next day with the kids.

I think the ""movie going experience"" just bumped up the bar again. Marvel's going to have to work on there story line more and not just put more and more flying Iron Man suits on the screen.

Iron Man was my Super hero as a kid, but Iron III tried it's best to kill it for me. It lost out big time to Star Trek II. I think ""Man of Steel"" jumped a full pace out front to me.

The stand base is shaped like the superman shield pentagon, and has a slot for the support arm. However the slot is a little too small for the rectangular peg on the arm, and as such when I inserted it in it created stress marks on the base. Small ones mind you, but they were there.

Aside from the base you get the 4 discs in a opening S shield cardboard case. It flowers out to reveal all four discs. 3D, Blu Ray, DVD/Ultra Violet, and the Special Features disc.

All in all its a nice set, but unfortunately not as great as it could be.  Compared to ""The Dark Knight Rises: Limited Edition Bat Cowl"" set with the broken cowl stand its just not quite there. And even less so if you compare it with the superb Dark Knight Trilogy: Ultimate Collector's Edition.

Now, for $39.99 its a good deal.  (Price I paid for my pre-order) anything over $46, and you aren't getting your money's worth in terms of physical extras. The tin is nice, but its just not as good as it could be. And there's really nothing else in the box.

All in all, just o.k.  Look for deep discounts.",1384819200,,1324,4.337398373983739
5783307,3,B00D91GRA4,"Terrific effects if you're into loads of CGI stuff and the Superman suit looks really great.  In fact, the whole look of the movie is good and the main reason I give it three stars.  The story, on the other hand.....yuck.  Good performances from all the name actors but they aren't given much to work with.  The dialogue is forced and serves only to pass some time between CGI action sequences.  And the climatic action sequence (while visually cool to watch) basically has an entire city destroyed as our hero and the bad guy throw each other all around destroying everything in their path.  Taken to its logical conclusion, hundreds of thousands of people would have died during this battle which made it much less fun for me to watch.  Yes, I know its a movie.

The first movie I have watched on this was Man Of Steel and I was blown away by the subtleties of the lighting and atmospheres the visual effects provided. I also liked Amy Adams as a hot Lois Lane.  Zack Snyder never makes a bad movie!  Of course neither does Christopher Nolan who worked on this too. Mix in their wives working on this and you got a 5 star AAA flick! I liked this movie so much that I purchased the Blu-ray the next day after watching it on Amazon instant video.  My only regret is having not seen it in theaters.,1384819200,,679,4.322834645669292

5783311,2,B00D91GRA4,"I'm still deciding if I should give this 1 star. The acting was trite. The plot was thin. The characters were 1-dimensional and under-developed. The romance was forced. There's nothing you couldn't have guessed about the ending from the Title sequence.
A general complaint about many of these movies is that these creatures never have a clear limitation of power. They get hit with a missile and they're fine. 1 ""super punch"" and they're down for the count (though NEVER visibly injured). This movie had NO governing physics at all. Only the director decides when and how someone gets hurt.
There were a FEW things which strayed from the original script which showed ingenuity! Atmospheric and gravitational forces similar to planet Krypton humanized Kal El. This is a departure from a radioactive crystal which physically harms him. The environment making him human adds depths to character, helping us understand how he behaves, not when injured but when human. BUT THEY DIDN'T EVEN PLAY WITH THIS IDEA! He was humanized and then trapped for 5 minutes until he got his super powers back! UGH!
They even screwed up the cool stuff.
If you just HAVE to see this movie because of it's ""blockbuster"" status, OK fine. But if you're looking for something other than a movie which tries to make Special Effects the entire story, you might want to pass.",1384819200,4,1346,4.882096069868996

5783315,1,B00D91GRA4,"I've seen this movie twice now, once in the theater and once - after I'd convinced myself that it couldn't have possibly been *that* bad it must've just been me, and bought it - at home. I was right, it wasn't as bad as I'd remembered. It was so much worse.

From the moment the film opens you just know you're in for a long and far too overblown ride for the subject matter at hand, and that's saying a lot since it's about...in case the film title fooled you...you know, ""Superman"". Not only are we subjected to the whole origin story again, we have to see the live cave-birth of young Kal-El, and the attempted hostile takeover by the forces of Zod (wherein Zod laser blasts an old lady to death in Hollywood's sad attempt to up the ante; ""We've all seen bad guys shoot grown men, but you know what we really haven't seen yet...?""), and every other sad armor-clad Krypotinian moment. Interesting fact, when there's an actual ""natural birth"" on Krypton, a Kandorian Two-Horned Swamp Bison lifts its gaze from its cud and bellows mournfully at the ugly yellow-grey sky.

Ok, the movie looks nice, that earns it a star. It's quite lovely really, and dark and gritty (just like Superman has always almost never called for), and the sound design is pretty amazing as well, but the stand out performance is by Weta Digital (you thought I was going to say Michael Shannon, didn't you?) and their ""liquid geometry"" or in average viewer parlance, little metal balls. The scenes where this CGI effect is used for flashback are Constructivistly astounding.

Other than that, Man of Steel is confusing, ridiculous, and just really unusual in its style and storytelling. I honestly can't figure out what it was trying to do. It would be funny if it wasn't so sad. Sad, in that it I think it was successful by Hollywood standards so Zack Snyder will probably get to do another one or two, or worse, this weirdo style of storytelling will take root in the industry and ruin all future films forever.

Lastly, I just have one question. What makes Super-Hopeman so good? Why is he so wonderful to humans, why does he want to save us all? Personally, I can't see it. Every single person, with the exception of his too-famous-for-this-movie parents, is a total dick to him. The rural dummies bully him want him severely dealt with for saving them. People call him greenhorn, pour beer on him, and are just general douchebags (say nothing of how Zod the Bod treats him) and yet he turns out sweet and innocent and good, I don't get it. I would so be the opposite of Superman. I'd wreck this planet so hard just on general principle and make them all pay. Guess its nature and not nurture after all. Maybe for ""Man of Steel II: The Inevitable Lex Luther Because Really Who Else Is There?"" we'll get to see something better but I doubt it, Man of Steel crushed that hope.",1384819200,23,2852,4.542801556420233

Russell Crowe & Kevin Costner are outstanding as the Man of Steels fathers Jor-El and John Kent. Micheal Shannon as Gen. Zod was more that just a shallow one dementional bad guy who you actually find yourself having some degree of sympathy for.
And Henry Cavill does an excellent job of showing how an almost invincible being can still have moments of doubt and emotional turmoil. The flash backs to the young Clark Kent added to the development in a way I don't think any former Super Man movie has and the death of John Kent brought my family to tears.

When anything is possible, (as it is with CGI) there is no wow factor left -- That leaves only acting and writing to depend on, which leaves this film needing work -- perhaps a complete re-write and re-filming by a better team?

If nothing else, 'Man of Steel' is a huge improvement over the ""boy of fluff""  that 'Superman Returns' gave us in 2006 -- But, this one  lacks the warmth, heart, soul and  humor of earlier portrayals. It never really figures out where it's at, where it comes from or even where it's going. The opening sequence sure looks like a direct rip from the 1989 batman movie --  After that, interesting as it may be, I couldn't help but think how right at home Batman would feel on Krypton  - it doesn't look all that different from an over-sized ""Vulcan Batcave"", ( the Krypton Elders outfits look like something out of Star Trek ).

5783354,5,B00D91GRA4,"I really, really wanted to see this at the theaters, but missed it (due to some...  logistical concerns?) so I only got to see the film, for the very first time, this last weekend.  I was hopeful, but cautious...  who would know if it would be any good?

I avoided the reviews, until after I'd seen it, and then read the ""rotten tomatoes"" reviews on the film.  I find myself wondering what film some of these people were watching, and whether or not the reviewers have any idea what they're talking about.  It seems that most of them refer to the 1979 movie as ""the source material"" and have no idea that the character of Superman has been around a LOT longer than that, and that the character has been played by many, many different actors, not just the late Christopher Reeve.

I knew, the moment I first saw the actor in-character, though, that they'd finally gotten the casting RIGHT.  I've liked various actors at various times to various degrees, but I'd never seen any of them who looked like the character in the books, until now.  Henry Cavill is, in my personal opinion, the single best casting choice for this character yet, and I find it hard to believe that there will be a better one to follow.

So...  the film starts, and we get Krypton.  Not the Krypton from the 1979 movie, but an amalgam of different Kryptons from the history of the character.  We see the ""organic, grown technology aspect,"" we get the floating drones (taken almost without alteration from the 1980s comic book reboot, by the same title as this film, ""The Man of Steel""), but we also get the ""pulp sci-fi"" elements of the older versions of Krypton as well...  including the once-ever-present ""flying beasts"" and so forth.

Many, many reviewers recoiled with horror from this sequence... not because it's not faithful to the source material, and not because it's not ""good storytelling,"" but simply because it's ""not big white crystal spires with Marlon Brando in white"" just redressed.  So, let's be clear... THE KRYPTON IN THE MOVIE IS CLOSER TO THE SOURCE MATERIAL VERSION THAN THE VERSION SEEN IN THE 1979 FILM!  Got it, folks?

The film, wisely, skips over the ""chronological origin story"" since we all, pretty much, know that the Kents found Kal-L, named him ""Clark,"" and raised him as their son.  We're not pounded over the head with a repeat of the full ""Clark growing up backstory"" but we are shown enough to tell the (rare) newcomer pretty much what's going on, without just rehashing old territory.

We are shown General Zod...  but, unlike the (forgive the term) ""Cartoon villain"" Zod we've seen previously, we get a character who actually is not (at least in his own eyes) the ""bad guy.""  There is no doubt, in this film... Zod sees himself as the hero.. the savior of his race.

What a refreshing thing to see in a film...  a ""bad guy"" who actually has a real motivation, real emotions which we, as the audience, can relate to.  Isn't it almost shocking to see a ""villain"" who becomes the villain because, in some twisted way, he's trying to ""do good?""  I LOVED this.  It was so, so much more satisfying than another ""mustachio-twirling guy"" (through granted, I still love the cartoonish villains from the 1979 film in their own way)

We didn't get a full backstory for Clark... instead, we ""discover"" key moments in his past through flashbacks.  It works very well, because it's in no way ""contrived.""  We see scenes we KNOW are important, not because the producers are showing them to us, but because the CHARACTER is showing them to us...  it makes a difference in terms of the impact of each scene.

There are stumbles, of course.  I found the ""death of Jonathan Kent"" to be really, really badly handled.  I get what they were trying to do...  show us that Jonathan Kent was more concerned with hiding Clark's nature than with anything else.  But...  I'm sorry, it was just SILLY.  Why not have Jonathan carry the child, and have Clark run back to get the dog?  (I mean, Clark would be faster...  and a LOT stronger...  and would have a far better chance of success.  And even if he had to use ""super power"" in some way, with the tornado behind him most people would not really notice, or would attribute it to their imagination!)

I also didn't like how obvious it is, now, where Superman hails from.  Surely SOMEONE would stop to ask ""why did the Kryptonians attack Smallville, Kansas?""  Especially now that it's known that Superman ""grew up in Kansas.""  Martha, expect to see some visitors in black helicopters coming your way soon!

I liked the ""wandering to find my way"" bit...  which, by the way, IS canonical, depending on which version of Superman you're talking about (Clark didn't necessarily go straight from Smallville High to the Daily Planet).  I realize some people will find this derivative of the scenes at the beginning of ""Batman Begins"" but the ""derivation"" of this far, far predates that...  read some Joseph Campbell, for his discussion of the ""hero's journey"" which always involves some period of self-exploration and even self-denial.

I will admit that I was surprised to see Lois learning about Clark's identity before he worked at the Planet, but I'm OK with that.  And I liked the portrayal of Lois Lane, though I must admit, the actress playing her was... to my mind...  fairly ""generic,"" and easily replaceable.  (I actually think that the best Lois to date is Erica Durance, from the series ""Smallville."")

The final conflict-stage of the film showed a LOT of violence and devastation...  and the action was non-stop.  This could have been toned down, a bit, I think...  the CGI effects went over the top...  but this was more consistent with what we see in the comic books than you might think.  (I just hope that Superman takes an active hand in the reconstruction, or it'll take many decades... after all, we've still yet to see a completed replacement for the World Trade Center!)

The biggest compliant from ""serious"" Superman fans is the end of the final battle sequence...  where Superman kills.  But I find that to be a truly sad complaint, showing a lack of grasp of reality (an odd statement to make in relation to a ""comic book movie"" I suppose).  IN REAL LIFE, there are situations when there's simply no option.  You can try to ""make peace"" but sometimes, if the other guy is unwilling to make peace with YOU, you have no choice but to knock him down, and make sure he can't get back up again.  In this case, Zod was trying to continue to murder people...  personally, no less (the tens of thousands of dead from his ""technological attacks"" previously would, to his mind, be collateral damage, not ""murder"" per-se) and there was NO WAY that you could restrain him, imprison him, or otherwise make him stop... other than simply stopping him, permanently.

By killing Zod, Superman saved hundreds of millions, if not six billion, human lives.  A heavy price to pay, but one that a TRUE HERO would have to pay (side note - this is an ongoing discussion in ""Batman"" circles...  is Batman actually responsible for all the deaths caused by The Joker, since had Batman simply killed the Joker early on, none of those people would have died?)

The end of the film... apparently after a major reconstruction effort in Metropolis (and maybe it was the ongoing help in reconstruction which results in Superman becoming, nominally, headquartered in Metropolis rather than, say, New York or Los Angeles or Chicago)...  we find ourselves with the ""status quo"" we all expect to see...  Clark Kent as reporter at the Daily Planet, working with Lois Lane.  Any future films in this ""cycle"" will feel much more... familiar?...  to the casual fan.

There is NO LEX LUTHOR in this film...  but there are signs aplenty of the presence of ""LexCorp,"" as well as several small references to ""Wayne Enterprises"" and ""Ferris Aircraft,"" among others... showing that this film takes place in a larger DC Comics universe.

And it's being talked about now that the sequel to this film will likely involve some other characters...  Batman and Wonder Woman, very likely (who MAY have even been seen in this film, in a much-debated point), along with Green Lantern.  Maybe we'll even see Green Arrow or some of the other characters come along, in ""realistic"" forms.

You see, DC has taken note of the success of ""The Avengers"" and the ""whole Marvel Universe"" approach...  and they're unlikely to let this go.

What you see in this film is the origin story of Superman...  in a way you've never seen before.

It's not a ""darker"" story...  but it's not CAMP.  It's perhaps the first fully SERIOUS take on the Superman concept (Smallville, the series, was pretty serious at times, but was a bit too ""soap opera-ish"" to really count, in my opinion... and all the other versions were light-hearted, non-serious approaches).

This is a Superman who exists in a world which we can recognize, with rules we can recognize...  and people who act like real people, not like ""cartoon characters.""

I, for one, have been waiting to see this for a very long time.  And this film, a few minor flaws aside, delivers what I was looking for!

EDIT:  As a side note, I strongly recommend the following (I have it as an audiobook) to give you a better vision of Krypton.  The Krypton as seen in this film is really very consistent with this book...

5783355,1,B00D91GRA4,"The worst Superman movie since 1987's Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, Man of Steel follows Henry Cavill's Clark Kent as he struggles to find his place in a world that's not his own - with the character's existential musings interrupted by the arrival of a vicious Kryptonian warlord (Michael Shannon's Zod) bent on world domination. There's little doubt that Man of Steel gets off to a less-than-promising start, as filmmaker Zack Snyder, working from David S. Goyer's screenplay, opens the movie with a tedious stretch set on Superman's dying home planet of Krypton - with the overuse of computer-generated effects lending such scenes a derivative and surprisingly campy feel (ie if Avatar had been incompetent and terrible, it might've resembled this). The movie does, however, improve considerably once the action shifts to Earth, with the time-shifting script ensuring that the emphasis on the central character's early days rarely fares as poorly as one might've feared (ie Snyder and Goyer wisely skip over some of the more familiar aspects of Clark/Superman's origin story). Man of Steel's completely watchable atmosphere is heightened by its proliferation of impressive performances, with Cavill's strong work as the title figure matched by a supporting cast that includes, among others, Amy Adams, Laurence Fishburne, and Kevin Costner. (The latter's engrossing turn as Clark's adoptive father stands as an obvious highlight within the proceedings.) It's only as Zod (re)enters the picture that one's interest begins to slowly-but-surely dip, as the film's final hour is devoted entirely to the epic battle between Zod and Superman - with the ineffectiveness of this stretch (ie it's like watching someone else play a poorly-rendered video game) compounded by Snyder's inept directorial choices (ie the shaky camerawork renders the majority of this stuff incoherent). The endless third act ultimately transforms Man of Steel into a disappointing (and surprisingly second-rate) piece of work, with the movie's lack of magic or wonder standing in sharp contrast to the previous portrayals of this iconic character (ie Bryan Singer's Superman Returns is looking positively masterful by comparison).",1384732800,5,2206,5.472140762463343
5783356,3,B00D91GRA4,"I was sorely disappointed with this sequel, but I gave it 3 stars instead of 2 because my husband liked it more than I did. I don't feel the story was interesting or compelling. It was confusing because it repeatedly flipped between the present time & his youth.

While I love movies with lots of action, I found some of the fight scenes boring. Give me fight scenes like I see in Iron Man, Thor or the Bourne series. Now, THAT'S entertainment! I hope this movie doesn't kill off the new Superman franchise. Seems that the DC Comics superheroes don't have the same high-quality scripts and directors as those of Marvel Comics. Kind of a shame that they've wasted all that potential.",1384732800,2,682,4.590163934426229
5783357,3,B00D91GRA4,"SPOILERS AHEAD!

Perhaps I'm showing my age. First, the new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-Into-Darkness-Blu-ray-DVD-Digital-Copy/dp/B00AZMFK3K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek Into Darkness (Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy)</a>&nbsp;movie largely left me cold. Now, the new Superman movie, Man of Steel, has been released to great fanfare. I dutifully saw it on opening weekend and was largely unimpressed.

What I liked: Henry Cavill does an excellent job portraying Kal-El, giving a slightly more brooding turn than usual. Some purists will object to a Briton portraying America's superhero, but as Superman is not even human, I'm fine with it. As for Clark Kent, we see very little of him - the famous glasses are not even worn until the last few frames of the movie. Amy Adams brings a knowing glint to Lois Lane, sadly missing from Kate Bosworth's limp portrayal in Superman Returns. The rest of the supporting cast is excellent in every respect, particularly Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent.  The non-linear plot construction was a nice touch, and a creative way to tell Superman's back story - which everyone should know by now.

What I disliked: I didn't like the reimagined Krypton - give me the Donner icy galactic version any day. Nor did I care for the dumbed down plot and solution. In previous incarnations, from the comic books, to the serials, the classic 50s TV show and Christopher Reeve movies, Superman was always victorious in the end because he used his most important superpower: his brain. Here, we just have a series of endless action sequences ending in a snapped neck. The tuneless, percussive score droned monotonously. There's quite a bit of product placement in Man of Steel - but there was in the 1978 Superman movie as well. Cheerios and Timex watches have been replaced with IHOP and Sears.

Best for a rental, this will not hold up to repeat viewing.",1384732800,,1939,5.282467532467533
5783358,4,B00D91GRA4,It was a ok movie was entertaining but that's about it. The ending when he puts on a pair of glasses and gets a job at he newspaper is really kills the immersion. They should have cut the ending. LOL those are the stupidest reporters this side of the planet. LOL I mean come on you were just throat deep in the mans mouth but do not know what he looks like.,1384732800,2,357,3.9722222222222223
5783359,2,B00D91GRA4,"This movie was bad.
I could end this review right here but why would I?
This movie is a mess, it attempts to deliver an origin story for Superman but the problem is that we never connect to Clark as a character. The first chunk of the movie takes place on Krypton, a location that in all honesty doesn't matter because it explodes, the only reason Krypton is shown is because A) Avatar was popular, let's show an Avatar-esque world and B) Thor was popular and that took place in part in an alien world so let's show another world's culture. The problem was this is a Superman movie and at the 30 minute mark we still know nothing about Clark.
In fact even by the big moment in the movie when Clark flies for the first time we have a problem in that we still don't know who Clark is as a person. We saw him as a child, and we see him get punched and then destroy a trucker's livlihood in retaliation, so we know two things: Clark wants to save some people and Clark is petty. The next problem is that his father sent him from Krypton so he'll have a choice, but as soon as he meets his father's ghost he says something to the effect of ""this is what you should do."" So Clark then has no choice.
Ok got it.
So at no point in the movie do we get to see Clark as a person, he's an emotionless beast who does nothing and even when he does show himself he's simply too cocky to have any personality other than that of a jerk. Who then is the main character? Is it Amy Adams? Well I mean she is the one we learn the most about but even she is barely deveolped as a character, instead she somehow is brought into any and every situation for no reason.
So here's the next problem. Superman gets his power from earth's atmosphere right? The Kryptonians get their power from Earth's atmosphere. Why then can these characters jump far and run fast even when they have their suits on? It's the atmosphere but that only gives them xray vision and laser eyes... Why then do they want to terraform earth? Wouldn't they want to be superhuman? Leave earth alone and kill the people then live as GODS.
Ok, logic problems aside let's look at the ""story"" any origin story should follow the basis of the heroes journey, this is just how it works. Superman has an awful heroes journey because we don't know who he is. I have never been so bored by a superhero movie, I even liked Batman and Robin more than this because at least I could laugh at that.  This movie takes itself too seriously and falls in a place between boredom and not being able to be laughed at.",1384732800,6,2541,4.217659137577002
5783360,4,B00D91GRA4,"I am not a huge Superman fan, but it was done really well.  And told the beginning of superman, which probably helped in why I liked this movie.  Even if not a Superman fan, I would recommend this movie.",1384732800,4,203,4.17948717948718
5783361,5,B00D91GRA4,This looks awesome up on my Media Shelf. The movie was amazing and the extra features are very interesting! It is really cool to see how different scenes were shot and the depth that the Production team went into to create this take on an American Classic Superhero film,1384732800,5,270,4.530612244897959

Nor will I figure it's so much better, just because it was created later and has much better graphics.  This movie was just an all around enjoyable movie.  I enjoyed the casting selections and thought the movie had a perfect pace to it.  It's one of the few movies I own that I can't wait to watch again.",1384732800,5,478,4.314606741573034
5783363,5,B00D91GRA4,"This was a Great Buy - made even better when the price dropped lower than the pre-order price I purchased under (Amazon credited the difference).

5 stars for the movie, plot, updated special effects, and acting! Kudos to the great cast. This is a Great, Serious ""Adult"" telling of the Superman tale, with NO Campiness! (Although, I will always have nostalgically fond feelings towards Christopher Reeves' and George Reeve's Superman that I grew up with.)  Special effects and beautiful visuals developed throughout were top notch - I especially liked the ""fly along's"" with Superman (Really makes Chris Reeve's wired fight scenes with Terence Stamp - Superman vs. Zod's team - Dated and awkward).

5 stars for the Blu-Ray 3D transfer - enjoyed movie on my Optoma GT750E 720p Active HD3D Gaming / Movie projector and my DTS home theater setup.  Scaled up on a big screen, it was lots of fun and quite depth and scale immersive - But I would have loved some pop-out moments (there didn't seem to be many).

4 stars for the fight scenes -- seemed to drag a little long sometimes.

3 stars for Chris Nolan's choice of a muted color pallet!!  Compared to the photo on the case cover, colors were muted to ~80%.  I would have preferred James Cameron's crisp, bluish color pallet in Terminator 2 - Judgement Day.",1384732800,,1306,4.747787610619469
5783364,5,B00D91GRA4,"Finally, a fresh look at Superman and his origins that is human, intelligent, and thought-provoking.  While Man of Steel is most definitely an action movie, and is in fact packed with action and special effects, the insightful look into Superman's origins and childhood give this movie even greater value.  Growing up as one who doesn't fit in, one who is different and all of the pressures that accompany that, gives this movie depth unlike any other version of the Superman legacy.

Using a series of flashbacks, this movie delves into the origins of Superman and the destruction of Krypton, and the challenges that a boy of his background would face in modern society.  The script also speaks to how the world will react to learning that aliens exist; something taken for granted in past movies.  With all of this exposition, one would think that the storyline might be missing in the action department, but that's all wrong.  From an action perspective, this movie contains a LOT of activity and destruction, and with excellent special effects but without the unnecessary gore.

In essence, this version of Superman finally considers emotion.  The relationship between Superman and Lois Lane is modernized, giving Lois a key role throughout the course of the script.  Henry Cavill's superman is thoughtful, intelligent, and emotive while lacking none of the characteristics that appeal to the action audience.

I'm anxiously awaiting the next chapter in this series... I found no flaws in the film and would recommend it without reservation.  My hat's off to the cast and crew, well done!",1384732800,4,1592,5.061302681992337

5783366,3,B00D91GRA4,Alot of hype for this movie. Superman character seemed too emotionally charged. Not so much a man of steel in this particular movie.  If the director makes a sequel he had better do more research as to how superman should be. Granted the movie was a darker mood but man of steel should be have called  man of aluminum foil as the character spent most of his time on his back.,1384732800,2,375,4.267605633802817
5783367,3,B00D91GRA4,"First, I want to make it clear that I am not a comic book fan - this review is coming from the perspective of a person who has never read a Superman comic and likely never will. So, my review is based on a very basic knowledge of the mythology of Superman. I loved all the Christopher Reeves films and I didn't completely hate Superman Returns.
I thought the movie, overall, was good, but it could have been better. Here's why:
The first thing I hated was that the actress playing Kal-El's mother was emotionless and cardboard. I don't know if she'd just had a botox treatment or what, but she conveyed all the emotion of a brick wall.  But I can forgive that because she's gone from the movie fairly early on in the destruction of Krypton.
The next thing that struck me was how everything was just crammed into this movie until it resembled an overstuffed bag of potatoes. People have said that the plot line advanced too slowly. I think the plot moved way too fast and, consequently, only touched some major plot points that should have been developed further. Minor spoiler here - nothing major, but still, if you haven't seen it, you may not want to read this. I really didn't like the way Lois Lane tracked down Superman's true identity so quickly and easily.  There was no tension between them like in the earlier movies. I loved Amy Adams and she did a great job with what she was given, but I would have loved to see a relationship develop more slowly between them and with a lot more friction. Yes, I'm being girly.  Sue me. I would have liked to see more of Superman developing and discovering his powers and him spending more time getting to know Jor-El and learning from him. I would have loved to see more of Superman swooping in and saving the day as part of his normal routine.  Instead, it seems that a lot of time is spent with Superman swooping in and destroying the surroundings. Yeah, I said it.  I know other reviewers have defended the destruction, but I just don't see Superman leveling an entire city just to beat Zod's ...er...rear.  Some have claimed the destruction took place in a part of the city that was clearly evacuated, however, there were plenty of scenes in which that was questionable. It left me wondering how many people died as a result of that fight. And, even if they didn't die, they were left homeless and/or without jobs after their apartments and workplaces were utterly destroyed. I thought the destruction was way over the top and the Superman I grew up with would definitely have tried very hard to take the fight somewhere else. Yes, he was getting beaten pretty badly, but he still would have tried to avoid the destruction.
I thought Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe were wonderful. That's saying a lot because I absolutely detest Kevin Costner in most movies I've seen him in. However, I loved Costner as Clark's dad and how he tried to instill wisdom in his son. I really thought that his advice after the school bus incident was going to be to save them but find a way to make it look like you weren't involved. Not ""maybe"" you should have let them die. I was disappointed with that.
I also loved Henry Cavill's take on Superman. His absolute joy when he first tries to fly is priceless. Cavill's Superman isn't condescending the way Reeves' could sometimes be. Reeves seemed to always wear an expression of patronizing amusement, especially when dealing with Lois Lane. Cavill comes across as humble and just a bit naive, but you can see some anger boiling just under the surface. You can see he really wants to ""unleash the fury"" (As Yngwie Malmsteen would say) sometimes, but manages to keep it under control.
Zod was alright - his female sidekick was downright laughable. How did they adjust to their ""super powers"" so quickly and easily while Superman took years? Some reviewers have complained about the ""set in realism"" concept. I liked that, actually, but there were plot holes a mile wide and, yes, at times the movie did seem to take itself way too seriously. I thought it could have been better if it were maybe two movies. But, what do I know?  That's why  Nolan is making the big bucks and I'm not.
So, all in all, it was a good film. I'll watch it again. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to just watch a good movie. But if you're a comic fan, this probably won't be for you...as evidenced by the many many negative comments from that sector.",1384732800,,4417,4.526315789473684
5783368,5,B00D91GRA4,"It's actually more a 4.5 review, since it's not perfect, but I almost did love the movie.  Mostly because it was a more realistic version of how Superman would really be.  Don't get me wrong, I loved Christopher Reeve's version, but I never really liked how the bad guys were portrayed.  They went more comical than anything, and the real bad guys going after Superman shouldn't be funny.  This Zod was a true bad guy, even though he had his own best intentions, and they are understandable.  It was a bit confusing how they went from the baby being sent off Krypton as it was destroyed and immediately show Clark as a man on his own, but they do show many flashbacks filling us in on how hard his childhood was.  It was jarring at first but I quickly got used to it.  One review I read months ago said that humanity would never trust Superman due to all the deaths caused because of him, but that's not how I saw it at all.  He does his best to keep any of that from happening, but Zod never intended to leave any of them alive, so the loss of a few hundred thousand wasn't as bad as it could have been.  True, Superman could have led Zod to an unpopulated area, and it's not clear why he didn't, but even that can be forgiven.  It was a nicely put together movie, and Cavill did a much better job with the role than I thought he would.  He WAS Superman, and I can't wait to watch it again.",1384732800,4,1391,4.1722846441947565
5783369,2,B00D91GRA4,"The man of steel is an average movie at best. The CGI is more impressive than the dialog, acting  and direction . It will make a ton of money, but I won't buy the dvd myself nor will I watch future installments if made by the same people. I wanted it to be a good film, but I frankly became bored before it ended. One thing that film makers just cannot get today, is that there are some of us out there that pay attention to details and plausibility. Is it plausible for a being with super strength to indirectly kill thousands of people in order to defeat the bad guys and the lone bad girl. Of course not. But it makes for more explosions and destruction, and that seems to sell movie tickets nowadays. I rarely go to the theatre to watch a movie anymore. I come from a generation that used to enjoy the experience of seeing a movie on the big screen and not having my senses being bombarded with profanity, cell phones, over the top special effects, implausible dialog, and popcorn that costs more that an average meal. I'm not saying they didn't make bad movies  way back when, but at least you knew going in that they were bad, case in point Plan 9 From Outer Space.

I loved the Christian allegory in this movie. It TOTALLY works in this version. The backstory was so philosophical, and was a constant theme throughout. I love that the filmmakers showed his youth through meaningful flashbacks rather than making it part of the plot. And, last but not least, I have never really enjoyed the Lois Lane character...always in trouble, oblivious or rude to Clark...I love this Lois.

5783373,5,B00D91GRA4,"I don't know where all the hate and negativity about this movie is coming from, but let me tell you, this movie was the best Superman movie that I have seen. People need to quit comparing Man Of Steel to the old Superman movies. Those movies to me were too cheesy and did not care for them. As for this new Superman movie, I agree, it should have received better reviews from the critics and respect that it has gotten. I have seen MOS six times at the movie theatre and i enjoyed every minute of it. There was noting flawless about it. I just received my dvd and watched it again this past weekend with my mother,and we both stil enjoyed it.

Zach Snyder and his team took this reboot to a whole new different feel. I love that it had good acting, lots of action and it showed a more human side to Superman with feelings, along with emotions this time around. You cannot expect and have every Superman movie to be the same. This is 2013 and it's time there is an upgrade to Superman this time around. In this film, he is just beginning to understand who he is and learning of his powers.

Second, please stop comparing Henry Cavill to Christopher Reeves. Both are totally different and did their own thing. Each actor portraying this Superhero is going to have their town take on how to do their Superman. Like some haters keep saying Henry Cavill is not that great as Christoper Reeves was. Well, with all do respect, Henry Cavill did an excellent job with his persona. He truly is Superman himself. This man truly earned it and work hard to transform himself for a perfect fit for the role. To me that is dedication, by looking at the workouts he had to go through. He nailed it and definately showed a bad-ass side to Superman during his fight scenes with Zod. I like Henry Cavill and i hope in the next MOS sequel, he brings his best performance to the characters Clark/Superman,given that the script will give him more to work with to show you he can do this role more justice. As for Amy Adams, I for one am glad she was chosen to play Lois Lane. Her character was tough and not this damsel in distress annoying reporter having to be rescued every moment by Superman that we have always saw in past movies and television. Even after she found out who he was, she showed a lot of support to clark by helping him to deal with his situation and his kryptonian people.

This movie is well worth it and can't wait for the sequel .I am not to keen on seeing Ben Affleck as Batman (not a fan). I will not be supporting Afflect, but the original cast. This could really be the one that will ruin it.",1384732800,2,2598,4.30879345603272

In a way, it was like watching Christopher Reeve do it all over again. In another way, it was fresh, new, and intriguing to watch. Plus - I won't lie - Henry Cavill's ass, though hard to pinpoint behind all that cape action, was a much superior ass in the Superman universe, and I thank him for working so ridiculously hard to meet the physical requirements of this epic role. Henry, if you ever decide to take a quality dip in the man pond, I'm your guy. Just hit me up, dude. Utmost respect and discretion upheld.

5783386,2,B00D91GRA4,"I know I'm late to the table, but I've finally seen the film and, though my opinion means little to mostly no one but myself, I'll share it here. The very premise of a ""Superman"" is in itself absurd, as it should be, because it comes from a 1939 comic book: an infant from a dying world rocketted to Earth where, due to its atmosphere and his alien physiology, he becomes a superior being in every way--mind, body, and apparently soul. Fantastical, and its being fantastical is Man of Steel's most unforgivable flaw: it takes itself too seriously. Add to that its being visually, intellectually, and emotionally underwhelming, and what you have is--at least for me--a cinematic disappointment on the level of The Dark Knight Rises. Another issue I had with Snyder's effort is its lackluster depiction of what is crucial to the Superman mythos: Flight. In the best movies about him, and the best comics, directors, writers and artists have spent much energy focused on Superman's flight--Ross's illustrations often show him as hovering majestically above it all, above the mortals, above the humans, who are beneath him. Other examples are Donner's Superman and Singer's Superman Returns; Singer made a point of making certain his Superman was a master of the skies; and who can forget Donner's vision of Kal-El gliding effortlessly through space, fulfilling the promise, ""You will believe a man can fly""? Such focus, such attention to detail is hardly found in Snyder's Man of Steel; aesthetically speaking, it's as if Superman's flight were a mere afterthought. Only in a few scenes is it handled with any care (floating above the Army before surrendering to the general); otherwise his flying is a slapdash glimpse quickly forgotten. The film also has quite a few lapses in logic, which is a problem when its creators want us to take the story more seriously than if it were presented in a comic book. [Spoiler alert! If you haven't seen the film, you may want to stop reading this--you're still here? still reading? then you mustn't care or have already seen the movie.] Lapses in logic: It took Kal-El--or Clark--thirty-three years to master his powers, and even then he hadn't fully mastered them, but Zod and his army come close to mastering theirs in a couple hours? Also: Why would Kal-El reveal the secret to controlling his powers to Zod? Why would he give away his tactical advantage? Near the end of the film, Zod uses his heat vision to attack civilians; the dual beams come close to reaching them but are stopped by Superman, which is ridiculous: The heat radiating from those beams should've obliterated the civilians before anything could've been done to stop them. In thirty-three years, Clark never knew he could fly? never even tried to fly? never had reason to? Nonsense. And lastly, a Superman is revealed to have been living on Earth, in the United States, for decades; once he reveals himself, and has contact with the military, at no point does the President of the United States communicate with him? Only a field general? Really?",1384646400,,3055,4.8882466281310215

In retrospect; I thoroughly enjoyed Bryan Singer's Superman Returns, and didn't anticipate liking this movie. Zack Snyder hit a home run.
Now for the bad news Zack Snyder; do not let Ben Affleck play Batman(The Liberal Crusader), and for that matter; why the hell would I want Batman in the movie to begin with. That trilogy is done, and you should let Superman fly solo on his own cape. Do you not have faith in Man of Steel? Did Batman have Superman in it before MOS?

Man of Steel is another step in Snyder's codex of films that meld spectacle with great drama in as seamless a fashion as this viewer can imagine. I loved this film. ""Man of Steel"" is told as much through the lens of the camera as through the dialogue, and it brings the epic power of this epic tale to a visceral level that no one else who has tackled directing a Superman film has accomplished. Snyder has a singular style that lends itself beautifully to the limitless horizon that sci-fi tales portray, if one allows a bit of imagination to flood through one's own mind. Visually stunning, dramatically wrenching, and emotionally moving, ""Man of Steel,"" by necessity, takes the final battle between Zod and Kal-el to extremes because that's believably how the dynamic between these two would play out. And, really, if two foes had such powers, wouldn't the collateral damage logically be as devastating as Snyder depicts it? I think so.

In fact, of all the reboots I think this was least deserving, primarily due to its overuse and abuse of ample amounts of CGI.  I was hoping they would attempt to explain how Superman manages to take flight.  How does he achieve propulsion?  I don't know, and obviously the filmmaker doesn't either.  The worst of the movie was the last thirty minutes that was replete with an abundance of CGI stunts that undermined any and all notions that any of the Kryptonians could die from anything other than old age.

I think this movie would have been MUCH better served if it chose to reduce the reliance on CGI and water-down the stunts to be a little more realistic.  If not, how can one ever sympathize with Superman?  He obviously can't be scratched.  I know he's superhuman, but come on, there needs to be some vulnerability.",1384646400,2,875,4.5576923076923075

5783402,4,B00D91GRA4,"For a description of the plot, etc., read some of the other 660+ reviews.  I just want to give a drive-thru evaluation of this movie...

Man Of Steel (2013) is another reboot of the Superman franchise.  We had the Christopher Reeve movies, then Superman Returns in 2006.  I like the first two Reeve movies and I also like Superman Returns.  When it comes to Superman in general, I have a mild interest at best.  I'm a way bigger fan of Batman than I am of Superman.  Batman is mortal, so that's what's appealing right off the bat, not to mention the villains Batman faces are very interesting.  In contrast, Superman is immortal, so that changes the whole ballgame.  Anyway, about Man Of Steel...

This movie's title is an indication that there have been an excessive number of Superman movies made over the years, so change was in order.  This movie has a ton of action in it.  Special effects of the CGI variety are used to the maximum.  Even with all the advances in computer generated images, it still looks too cartoonish and computerized, and this movie has a tremendous amount of it.  Way too much.  I think the action sequences are good, but I was distracted by the fact that there was too much action all while looking cartoonish.  When action sequences are used more sparingly, I can accept the cartoonish CGI much more easily, but the fact that there was way too much was a distraction.  A lot of the fighting that took place between Superman and his enemy was way over the top and some of it looked ridiculous.  I also think the story and plot suffered quite a bit due to the ""let's wow the audience with our special effects"" mentality of the makers of this film.  I did feel that the story was a little thin in favor of a special effects extravaganza.  Another thing I noticed is that this movie is darker in tone than other Superman movies, almost taking itself too seriously.  However, all of this aside, I did find the movie entertaining.  This Superman had a cool costume, maybe the best one ever.  The acting was pretty good.  Lois Lane was good.  Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe did well.  I found the movie entertaining because that's all I expect from a Superman movie (the good ones, anyway).  I expect to see, especially in this day and age, over the top action sequences and tons of special effects in Superman movies.  So while I was being critical of these very things earlier in this review, I'm saying now that I expect this kind of stuff in Superman movies, especially the modern ones.  Superman has super powers, just like how computers nowadays have super powers.  When you have a character who has super powers and you want to make a movie about him, you need to have super powered computers to generate the special effects that are needed to portray Superman's super powers to maximum effect.  In this aspect, the makers of this movie succeeded. though I do think it was OVERDONE.  I guess what I'm saying here is that when I'm watching a Superman movie - any modern Superman movie within the last decade - I'm enjoying it, but in the back of my mind I'm thinking about how I want to watch a Batman movie right after so I can get back to seeing a mortal super hero.  In other words, get back down to earth.

So, with that said, I do recommend seeing Man Of Steel.",1384646400,,3296,4.484033613445378

Super Bro needs to ease off on the teeth whitening; the glare from his Hollywood teeth was very distracting throughout. The plot reminds me of feeling nauseated - I felt vaguely disturbed by the feelings passing over me while watching MoS, and was constantly preparing to jump up from the catch and run out of the room. Yeah. That bad. I'll say it right here. Henry Cavill gives me the creeps. I can't shake the bizarre impression the young man is a replicant of some sort. If Darth Hayden beats out Henry in pure emotive capacity. I have at least a vague sense that some degree of Force resides in that HC, however not so much in this one. Remarkably, Director Zack Snyder manages to draw stolidly wooden performances from Hollywood illuminati as well. Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Richard Schiff and Laurence Fishburne all seem to be under the influence of kryptonite. Russell Crowe and Michael Shannon try hard to chew the CGI scenery, but they were clearly dissatisfied with the meal. Testosterone injections could elicit similar raging cube-steak performances from the average computer nerd in a dim bedroom. Yeah, there are some vague Jesus allegories in here as well, for those Christians looking for a cinematic super-hero subtext for their faith. Ahem. Anyway, MoS doesn't even rank in the Hot Mess category because there is not heat. Themes are compromised of vainglorious murk held together with possibly the most ridiculous string of lame film homages ever assembled in one film. This may in fact be the highlight of the chilly MoS experience, but it comes across less as a directorial inside joke and more as some variety of creative palsy. As for visuals, I can say I have never seen a Kryptonite as creepy as the Zackster's, even in the darkest DC comics of yore. It seems like the product of a poor night's sleep after a greasy dinner. The American Midwest doesn't look much better, except somehow there appears to be king crab fishing in Nebraska. Sheesh. You Hollywood types need to get out more. Ok, I have beat this hobbled pony enough. One last thing I must add, in the form of a question. Who in the name of Jor-El would want to have a super hero defending you who destroys entire urban areas in the process? Piece of advice for Man of Steel: lure Zod to a less inhabited area before engaging in your struggle to the death, for pete's sake. At least the suburbs. The damage from your sloppy villain fighting would then rise only to hundreds of millions of dollars, rather than the trillions of damage you dimwits caused throwing each other through skyscrapers.

At some point in the movie he asks Superman when some kids bullied him and Superman did not hit them or even stand up to them, Father asks "" Would it make you feel any better if you hurt those kids?"" yes, it would.

Not every superhero movie needs to have a joke every five minutes like Iron Man 3. Marvel are great for what they are but anytime you see a marvel movie trailer and it looks like its going to be serious its not.

5783441,1,B00D91GRA4,"I just finished watching ""Man Of Steel"" as a rental.  I had trouble watching it for a time.  With an hour left in the film it came to me how to watch this movie, and how to review and rate it.

I watched and rated this not as a superhero movie, nor as a Superman movie.  I watched and rated it as a sci-fi alien-invasion-of-the-earth movie, like Independence Day, for example.  Based on that, I rated this with one star.  I'm not a fan of those kinds of films.  They usually have flimsy stories, rife with senseless symbolism, colossal explosions, epic-style special effects and lots of screaming, both in fear and rage/pain/angst.  This seemed no different.  And, in that light, How the story's hero defeats the villain is not surprising, or all that shocking, if one doesn't view this as a Superman story.  I found this relatively easy to do.  Then at the end, they decided to connect this alien-invasion story to a Superman character.

I thought the writing to be shallow and obvious, the acting to be okay, the special effects highly proficient and boring, in the sense that they were really the story, with the actual plot and dialogue there to break the monotony.  I didn't like it.
I'm glad I watched it, though.

Now, I will go watch a real Superman story, probably the animated adaptation of ""All-Star Superman"" comic-book maxi-series.",1384560000,3,1344,4.688034188034188

They act like to cut anything out was some sort of blasphemous act and should never be done.  By the time you get to the end of the introduction ( if you can call it that ), the movie wasted a whopping 30-40 minutes.  Now I am of the belief that an intro should be about 15 min. And then you get on with the movie, but 40 min.? Who decided to pick this editor?  So finally we get to then real start of the movie and it starts to drag on and on and on and on as though no one was paying attention to what the story line was.  Which btw what the hell was the story line anyway? THis movie took so long that my internet went out. And I was happy to be able to go to bed w/o having to finish it.  The question is, did my internet go out from the movie being so long, or was it due to the fact the movie IS so boring?  Unfortunately my internet will come back on and I'll have to watch the rest of it.  Can't wait! NOT!

Edit:  So I finished watching the movie and it got even worse.  The plot is so weak it is nearly absent.  And all these people that say the graphics are great obviously love cartoons because the graphics were exactly that.  If movies are going to go to this extreme to make action scenes ""realistic"" then I guess overtime I will watch action/adventure movies less and less.  I was appalled at the fight scenes when they would turn into cartoons.  No thanks.  I hated this movie and wish I hadn't spent the $4.99 to rent it.  If I could give it zero stars I would.

I watch different movies for different reasons. Growing up in Jamaica in the late-1970s and 1980s with a black-and-white box, then the first colour box in my neighbourhood, meant my house was movie central. The television station was 9 to 5 for most of my youth, and evolved to late night viewing on holidays. Rambo, Dirty Harry, Rocky, spaghetti westerns, and SUPERMAN were highlights of Christmas holidays. Sylvester Stallone, Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman, and Christopher Reeve were family who came to visit on the holidays. We waited eagerly in front of the tube for them, were overjoyed when they arrived, and weeping when they left. The evolution of Superman over the years is a rite of passage along a mystical timeline for me. In 1978 I was still turning a knob to change a channel, and my dada was climbing on the roof in the rain to re-position the antenna. In 2013, I'm watching movies on demand, commercial-free, and online. From 1978 to 2013, Superman movies represent more than film production, acting, and criticisms; that's 35 years of entertaining all walks of life across the world, 35 years of technological advancement, 35 years of keeping the hope of mankind alive. Movies like Superman encouraged a little island girl to dream beyond boundaries, push the limits, and achieve beyond her imagination. The movie has come a long way since 1978, and so have I.

I should really give it 1 star, but the beginning of the movie was actually good and the special effects is very well done.
They just lost the plot in the end or more likely the director had too much money to burn on special effect and came up with bigger and bigger ways to blow that money.

Despite its darker take on the comic legend, there are some nice heartfelt moments from his formative years in Smallville and some well-observed mythic overtones as Clark Kent realizes his true destiny. Amy Adams makes a great, savvy Lois Lane, and Henry Cavill certainly has the look of a Man of Steel.

But as a movie and entertainment vehicle, this fell way short of the 1978 Christopher Reeve picture. That movie really delivered the goods, with its sweeping Lois Lane romance around the skies of Metropolis, laughably maniacal Lex Luther and bumbling Otis and Superman in top form, amazing city crowds and saving everyone in sight.

What we have in the climax of the ""Man of Steel"" is a mind-numbing, prolonged slug fest between Superman and General Zod that reduces Metropolis to rubble. And this is not an Earth-created conflict, but one that Superman's father created by sending his son to our doorstep. I thought Superman was supposed to help humanity -- not create more problems!

Loved everything but was overwhelmed by the final fight scene. Really loved Clark/Papa Kent relationship and Ill always love Diane Lane until the day I die.

Young Clark may have offered a it gets better moment to all those youngsters in the viewing audience who are being bullied. Although Jonathan and Martha try to keep Clark under wraps, his powers are the worst kept secret in town. I like that. Even his young tormentors become allies as adults. I read about Paul McCartney-once a Beatle- who moved into a small English country town. His children went to school there and he contributed heavily to the town. The residents would shoo fans away. He was a neighbor, you see, and deserved his privacy. In Smallville, Clarks supporters where quiet but solid folk. Its his own business. And I personally love that he sought advice at church-advice that he acted on.

And I like this Super Clark. Henry Cavill isn't a pretty-boy in a blue suit. There is some meat and potatoes there and his internal conflicts show in his face and body. Loved Christopher Reeves version for that age. However the Man of Steel is battling terrorists; serious work there. All in all the movie was a joy.",1384560000,5,1204,4.696682464454977

5783463,3,B00D91GRA4,"After seeing this film, I can understand why the critical reaction to it was largely mixed. However, for the life of me, I don't see why it got a worse reception than ""Superman Returns"". If you're looking for a Superman movie that avoids the mistakes of that film, you have definitely come to the right place - even if ""Man of Steel"" doesn't succeed on every level.

Here's a rundown of the good and the bad. WARNING: some spoilers within, though I'll try to avoid revealing any major plot twists.

THE GOOD:

The Effects: I can't say enough good things about this aspect of the film. This is the most truly alien take on Krypton we've seen in any Superman film yet. The harsh yet beautiful landscape, the intricate spaceships, the three-dimensional liquid metal displays...the entire opening sequence featuring Kal-El's home planet was truly jaw-dropping. The same level of quality holds for the scenes with Superman displaying his powers. Zack Snyder's more ""violent"" take on the hero's flying makes it look remarkably realistic. The visuals in this film never ""pop"" the viewer out of the story, they draw you in. Actually, if the FX were the only point in the movie's favor, I'd still say it was worth watching once just to see them. Fortunately, there's more.

The Storyline: I was somewhat disappointed when I learned Lex Luthor would not be returning for this film (though his presence in the Man of Steel universe is acknowledged in a very subtle fashion). Fortunately, the plot manages quite well without him, focusing on Superman's alien heritage rather than humans trying to bring him down. The theme of the implications of discovering that an alien walks among us lies at the center of the story, and leads to some interesting conversations among the main characters. The new mythology established for Krypton is very clever, and makes some of the typical elements of Superman's origin more rational. Kryptonite is absent, which is a good thing, in my opinion. Another weakness of Superman from the comics is used to prevent him being completely undefeatable - namely, his reliance on yellow sun radiation. All together, the plot is very coherent, though the actual storytelling suffers at times, as I'll explain later on.

The Main Character: The film's missteps aside, it did give us a worthy new version of the world's greatest superhero. Cavill nails the many faces of Clark Kent. Kansas farm boy, reluctant hero, alien visitor - he skillfully pulls off every aspect of the character...except perhaps for one, which may or may not disappoint the viewer. Clark Kent the bumbling reporter is not really featured here. I won't reveal exactly how the idea of Superman's dual identity plays out, but let's just say it's a bit more complicated than putting on a pair of glasses and magically deflecting suspicion. Also, in regard to a certain difficult decision Superman makes toward the end of the film - in context, it's made very clear that he had no other choice. That's not to say this scene was perfectly executed, but it definitely still belongs in the movie.

THE BAD:

The Pacing: This is Man of Steel's biggest flaw. Everything just happens too quickly. In the Batman films, we had time to breathe between fights and dramatic twists, thanks to scenes that helped flesh out the characters and make their journeys more believable. Despite MoS's two-and-a-half hour length, it feels like Snyder and Nolan were struggling to fit everything in that they wanted to show. The first half of the movie is so rapid-fire it feels surreal at times, and the second half is so congested with concrete-smashing fights that by the time I was done watching, I felt exhausted.

The Storytelling: I'm all for innovation in this category, but Man of Steel would have benefited from a good old-fashioned linear storyline. Once the Krypton scenes are done, we start jumping haphazardly between Clark's childhood and his adulthood, then back again. It's enough to make you seasick. I got the feeling that Snyder was trying to reinvent the wheel here. He veered off in another direction just as we were about to see the classic ""spaceship in the cornfield"" scene - no doubt an attempt to subvert expectations - but it didn't actually improve the film at all. Yes, we've seen the Kents finding Clark a hundred times before, but honestly, I wouldn't have minded seeing it again. And Clark would have seemed more relatable if his childhood scenes had all taken place at the beginning, giving the audience a better perspective on the gradual changes in his motivations and personality.

The Fights: This has been brought up many times before by other reviewers, but there really is too much property damage in Man of Steel. I realize that the locations in question were mostly abandoned, so the death toll from the actual battles was probably zero (not counting what Zod's evil plot probably did to a few unfortunate citizens of Metropolis), but I feel that there's still a problem here. Snyder was obviously trying to show the raw power of Superman and Zod by showing how much damage they did just by tripping over a piece of rebar (that's an exaggeration, but you get what I mean). However, after a while, you start to concentrate more on how many buildings are getting leveled than on who's winning the fight. It's distracting. You can't help but wonder, right in the middle of all the action, how Metropolis will ever recover from all this, and that takes your focus off the story itself.

The Humor: Or rather, the lack thereof. Let's face it - cool as it may be, Superman's story isn't exactly ""believable"". You could picture a billionaire playboy using gadgets to fight crime in real life, but not an alien with incredible powers living secretly among humans. Some gentle mockery here and there would actually have helped the movie. Instead, every single element of the Superman tale is treated as deadly serious. There are only a handful of funny moments here, and while they work, there aren't nearly enough of them. A few more laughs would have done wonders for the Clark/Lois romance as well. Also, call me old-fashioned, but I feel that a Superman movie should be family-friendly. It's just in the nature of the character. Instead, there are far too many moments of profanity (not from Supes, but still) and a little too much PG-13 violence. It's mostly bloodless, but it could have been toned down without adversely affecting the story. Sorry, but the world doesn't need a gritter Superman.

Amy Adams: Don't get me wrong, she's adorable, and she's a fantastic actress, but she brings nothing new to this role. I don't feel that she had no chemistry with Clark, but she lacked that feistiness that made previous Loises so enjoyable. The more subdued nature of her performance could, of course, be partly blamed on the lack of light-heartedness I mentioned. Erica Durance's Lois would have been asking why everyone was so glum. (I'm not a Smallville fan by any stretch, but she was amazing.)

Michael Shannon: He's not a bad actor, but his Zod came across as more petulant than intimidating. It may sound silly, but a British accent would have done wonders here - possibly because that's what people commonly associate with Zod. Antje Traue's Faora is far more successful as a compelling villain, even if she doesn't get much development.

CONCLUSIONS: Man of Steel is an essentially good film with some elements of greatness, and I believe that it signals a new and better age for the character of Superman. I probably will want to watch it again someday, though I'm still glad I rented it instead of buying it sight unseen. Hence the three stars instead of four. It doesn't quite deserve the 56% it got on Rotten Tomatoes, but it suffers from some unwise directorial decisions, a couple of poorly cast roles, and and a paucity of wit and charm. I highly recommend watching it, but don't expect the Superman movie you've been hoping for since the Christopher Reeve era. Perhaps that day will come in time.",1384560000,16,8009,4.841490138787436

5783466,5,B00D91GRA4,"The Man of Steel is a great movie, retelling the first superhero in the comic world and I believe doing him great justice. The Film of course is about Clark becoming Superman but he isn't Superman just yet. One of the reasons he's not called Superman in the film or any where on the title of the movie is because he's not Superman just yet. So for respect of the movie, I'll just call him Super Clark. Well Super Clark makes a lot of mistakes, things he WON""T make in the future, when he finally becomes the Superman. However, this movie made it clear that this was the beginning of his journey. One of the best flashbacks I have seen in a movie, allowed the film to progress very quickly and get to the real meat of the film, which was his Kryptionian brothers trying to obtain him, as Super Clark is a bit more essential and special when compared to his people. (Don't won't to spoil It) Anyways, once the Kryptionians come to get him, EPIC fight scenes occur and for the first time in live action, we get to see what a true Superhero can do. When I went to the theaters and saw this movie, I was purely wowed and if you give this movie a shot, you will too. But please be mindful, this version of Super Clark is gritty, a bit more like the comics now a days but still a good moral movie for the family. I give this movie a 5/5, enjoy :)",1384560000,4,1339,4.153846153846154
5783467,3,B00D91GRA4,"Well, of all the Superman movies, this is by far my favorite.

The storyline is pretty good. A slightly different approach but remains close to the basics. The weakest point of the storyline was the love story between Lois and Clark. It just didn't jive at all. Since a large portion of the movie revolves around Lois, the poor integration of Lois into the plot weakens the movie significantly. So, once I ignored the Lois portion of the movie, the rest was really good.

The acting was very good, especially from Henry Cavill. Russel Crowe was a great Jor-El. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane were good as the Clark's parents, but I feel no one will ever be as good as the parents of Superman as Annette O'Toole and John Schneider from Smallville. Michael Shannon was an excellent villain. It is nice to see Christopher Meloni in another role.

The acting also had some weak points, especially from Amy Adams (Lois Lane) and Laurence Fishburne (Perry White). The audience is almost automatically made to dislike Lois and there is not a lot done to warm her up. There is a reason CSI got rid of Laurence Fishburne. Lois and Perry were by far the worst parts of this movie.

The computer generated graphics were superb. Top notch.

Family friendly: No cursing, no nekkid people, no sexual stuff. There is a lot of fighting and destruction.

If the makers of this Superman would have left the Lois part out, or made it better, this would have been a really top notch movie. The rest of the cast and storyline keep it a good 3 stars.",1384560000,,1526,4.5510948905109485
5783468,4,B00D91GRA4,They managed to do enough of a twist on the plot on this one to make it interesting and enjoyable.  Superman tends toward a more macho image in this story and definitely sufficiently hot for the ladies.  Good job portraying his celestial as well as earthly families.  Great job on the villains.  Great effects yet some leaning towards what you see in really good game graphics.  It seems like we've seen all the Superman movies and yet we weren't disappointed or ho-hum in watching this one.,1384560000,5,491,4.662790697674419
5783469,3,B00D91GRA4,"This has NOTHING to do with the movie it self. It has to do with the content the studio is giving us on the Blu-ray and DVD's. The movie was great and I give it 4 1/2 stars. It was so much better than ""Superman Returns"" and had better acting, effects and story line. The only things I found redeeming about Bryan Singers creepy Stalker-Superman version (he should have stuck with ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" or that wouldn't have sucked as bad as it did) was that not only did he load the Blu-ray with tons of extras including 10 additional scenes, but he also cast Parker Posey in the film which made it slightly more entertaining.

I really enjoyed the film but over the past several years, I've noticed a rather upsetting trend taking place with home DVD/Blu-ray releases. This ""Man of Steel"" states ""NEARLY 4 HOURS OF SPECIAL FEATURES"" and while I've watched all the special features on the Blu-ray disc (and I'm not sure if any ""special features are on the DVD) and began watching the features on the second Blu-ray, I started to wonder, ""Where are the deleted scenes?"" There are features about how the actors got beefed up, one about the costumes and another (fairly annoying) feature about CGI which is hosted by the kid who played the young Clark Kent.

I always recalled being excited when the DVD's were released because they were loaded with extras (always a director commentary sometimes with actors weighing in), out takes, bloopers, theatrical trailers, the making of features that had aired on HBO, MTV or other stations and more.

The first time I really took notice was when ""Evita"" was released on DVD in 1997. While not the massive hit the studio hoped for, it did bring in over $140 million in ticket sales, won an Oscar and 3 Golden Globes for Best Song, Best Picture and Best Actress. There were no extra features on the DVD (given the many documentaries made by HBO and MTV and the the history of Eva Peron herself). In 2012, a ""15th ANNIVERSARY EDITION"" Blu-ray was released and it contained ""The Making of Evita"", Music Video of ""You Must Love Me"" and Teaser Trailer. The Laser Disc version of this film contained not only the ""The Making of"" and the music video, it also contained director commentary, shooting scripts, sketches, production photos and archive video and photos of Eva and Juan Peron. That's a lot of stuff that people may want to see.

It was about this time that I began replacing my VHS collection with DVD's. Some offered never before seen footage and behind the scene footage which was really neat. As more movie trailers were released, I started to notice that many scenes shown in the trailer weren't in the theatrical release at all nor did they show up on the DVD and the expanding market of Blu-ray discs. The last time I recall a set of movies released with alternate beginnings/endings, alternate takes, deleted scenes and almost everything under the sun were contained in the box sets for the first 3 ""Scream"" movies and ""The Red Curtain Trilogy (Strictly Ballroom, Romeo+Juliet and Mouliln Rouge!).

Since that time, I've seen studios release multiple versions of the same movie. My last count for ""Marvels The Avengers"" were 5 different versions NOT including the 10 Disc Set of the Phase One movies.""X-Men: First Class"" did a decent job of  adding some deleted scenes, but perhaps the most disappointing releases came with the last 3 bond films. To get the best bang for your buck is to buy the 3 Disc Special Edition DVD or the 2 Disc Collectors Edition with BD-Live of ""Casino Royal"" (there are currently 5 different versions of this film as well.) And as for ""Skyfall"", the top grossing Bond film of all time? Not one deleted scene. The biggest disappointment I've had this year was the ""World War Z"" Blu-ray. I've been a fan of the book since it was released, I even have the 12 hour audio book which is very entertaining. Even though the movie and the book have nothing but the title in common, for a movie that took 2 years to film it was treated worse than a B rate horror flick that was never released in the theater.

So back to ""Man of Steel"" and the lack of extended/deleted/alternate scenes, maybe I just bought the wrong copy? But with over 10 different editions and packaging for this movie alone, I have to just take a guess that no scenes were cut from the film and that there was no alternate or extended scenes. Maybe they thought they shot a perfect movie?

On that note, I'm still trying to decide which Blu-ray of ""The Avengers"" to buy. I don't need 3D, but I would like to see things like the making of the film and yes...those deleted scenes I'm in dire search of. Can anyone let me know which one would be best to buy?

If you're looking for the movie of ""Man of Steel"" and some interesting behind the scenes footage, than this is fine. But if you're in hope of seeing deleted scenes, there are none to be found.",1384560000,37,4889,4.565564424173318

5783472,5,B00D91GRA4,"Little effort will be made to keep this review spoiler free.

The first fifteen minutes establish that Zack Snyder might be the best director of opening montages that Hollywood has ever produced, but when I watched this in theaters and walked a way a little exhausted, feeling it fell just a bit short of the high mark it needed to hit to establish a bold new vision for the DC comic book movies franchise. When I got home and saw the lukewarm reviews (58%) I thought they were pretty fair, although I got taken aback later when Iron 3 acquired a significantly higher margin (79%). Man of Steel should have scored higher for the first minutes alone, not to mention its dramatically serious (if flawed) plot compared to Iron Man 3's cartoony concepts and tired hamster wheel story.

Since a second viewing I have revised my opinion. Man of Steel is neither the best dramatic film ever or the best superhero film ever (I can't say it outscores The Dark Knight on either category), but it pushes the bar in both categories. Although handicapped with some plot holes (why Zodd *HAS* to recreate Krypton on Earth or enter into a mortal conflict with Superman is never really explained), the narrative has enough logical sense and emotional resonance to carry the day. If not quite a revelation, it is still a thrilling film that has the virtue of instilling familiar concepts with enough energy to turn them into a cinematic tour de force. The performances, visuals, and editing come together to make a new face out of old material, and the result is a movie with a little soul (something I fear may be vanishing from the Marvel franchise).",1384473600,,1635,4.673611111111111

5783478,2,B00D91GRA4,"OMG!  Really?  Why is it so hard to make a good Superman movie?  The basic foundation already exists.  1 part Christopher Reeve, 1 part CGI special effects that are now available to make a kick butt film, a dash more action and a hotter Lois Lane and you got yourself the best Superman movie ever!  I'm puzzled why such a great property like Superman is so hard to reboot on the silver screen.  Superman Returns, ugh, enough has been said about that one.  I was pinning all my hopes on Man of Steel and was tragically disappointed.  Henry Cavill is totally buffed and the movie has alot of special effects, but everything else was missing.  Being an older film viewer, I was hoping to see the ""Golly Gee"" factor that was evident in the Christopher Reeve Superman movie.  People were amazed to see a man fly, they oohed and aahed when he swooped down and saved a cat out of a tree, they cheered when he rescued a lady falling from a building and they saluted when he vowed to fight for truth, justice and the American way.  He was tall, muscular and imposing, yet a sensitive and caring superhero.  Unfortunately, The Man of Steel is a completely different creature.  Firstly, the whole Krypton scene was just trash.  They made it WAY TOO long and complicated then it needed to be, which subtracted from more Clark Kent / Superman scenes.  All that weird Kryptonian cloning, genetic engineering, political battle scenes in Man of Steel was unnecessary.  What happened to the simple scene of the caring alien husband/ father/ scientist clinging to his loving wife, with tears and hope in their eye, as their world crumbled around them, while their son rockets to another world?  That's all you really needed, it spoke volumes.  Even the adoptive parents, the Kents, are kind of strange and stilted in this film.  It makes you yearn for Glen Ford and Phyllis Thaxter with their loving and poignant portrayal of parent's who adopt an extraterrestrial savior.  And you know what?  For all the dazzling special effect, can they just slow it down so you can watch Superman fly.  I really think some of the best scenes in a Superman movie is watching him lift off and flying around the city.  Not all the sudden bursts and blurring backgrounds that look like he's caught in a tornado.  Maybe The Man of Steel represents the kind of film people like today.  I still see in my minds eye a Superman movie with a wiser, more innocent hero, patrolling Metropolis in the air, taking time to wave at a little child looking up at him in awe.",1384473600,4,2525,4.582589285714286

I WILL however speak my opinion about a - if not the - SUPER-hero-MOVIE. It is supposed to be a lot of fun, action, good script and most important of all - inventive. It should show us our beloved Superheros in ways we've never seen them before.

This is ultimately not the case with this movie !!! It ripps of approximately 30 maior movies without the slightest bit of shame. to give you some examples: The ships attacking the cities (looking like the STAR TREK vessel nero uses) release an energy beam to destroy bulidings (INDEPENDENCE DAY). The Robot chick (TRON look) jumps (UNDERWOLRD MOVE, even with the bent knee). There is a lot more of this, but to complete the list, I would have to watch the movie again, and I certainly won't do that!!!

The girl-friend of the hero volunteers absolutely unneccessariely to go to the alien ship where she needs the computerized father of the hero (again, rip off TRON) to do nothing else than - escape! This escape fails so that the hero has - another - reason to save his - useless - damsel in distress. I'm not a feminist, but this portrait of a woman is shamefull! Useless decoration! Whoever wrote this should be visited by ""the black widow"" if you get my meaning!

The movie rips off shamelessly a lot of movies, but that's not the only bad part: the flashbacks happen now and then, suddenly and lame, don't help to build the already set super-heros character and even lack the right ammount of pathos, gravity and heroism.

This is the worst movie I've seen this decade - and I've seen Super-Shark and Sharknado!

WB & Zack Synder gave us something worth watching w/Man of Steel a fresh plot & a new perspective on who Superman is. I think adding Zod & the Kryptonian outcasts was a perfect way to show Superman's complete opposite and sets the conflict of the movie. I think the Zod/Superman fight plants the seeds for M.O.S.

1. He is not Superman yet, in fact he is only call it once in the whole movie.
2. He does not have these ""morals"" that seem to belong to Superman in the comics and past movies.
3. Superman has killed General Zod several times in the comics.
4. He is trying to find his way in a world where he has no place.
5. He is developing his morals throughout the movie.
6. What choice did he have other than to kill Zod? Zod was genetically engineered to protect, and if need be restore Krypton to what it once was. He would have stopped at nothing to do that...and in the process destroy the human race, to bring Krypton back.
7. People do not listen to the dialogue in the movie...listen carefully and you will understand why Kal-El did what he did and how his powers work when you think they shouldn't.
8. People always compare to previous movies and TV shows when a remake comes out. It is not the 70's anymore where Superman floats around Metropolis with Lois to sappy music and terrible effects. It is the 21st century where people, well at least me want to see something more believable than that.
9. Just because he puts on the suit doesn't mean he all of a sudden is the savior of the world, the doer of no wrong, the ideal person, every mothers perfect child, that doesn't kill and steal...he is trying to find his way and discover those things on his own.
10. At the end of the movie he is Superman. Not during. He is a young man learning by his actions. He is doing before thinking.
11.""Superman wasn't funny enough."" Well sorry I forgot he was supposed to go around cracking jokes while his people come to kill the entire race of people he has lived with his entire life.

Finally, the destruction...If Kryptonians were real they would be gods to us. Zod was terraforming Earth into the new Krypton, he is not going to as kindly for every human to evacuate Earth so he can form it to a new Krypton. He will kill anything and anyone that stands in his way. This is not the Avengers where an Alien race comes from space with the purpose to kill the human race and ends up blowing up tons of cars and destroying one building in the process.

5783493,4,B00D91GRA4,"This is by far the best Superman movie to date, but it does, unfortunately have some problems as well.

(Likely spoilers ahead.)

First, I especially liked the way the movie portrayed the Kryptonians having to adapt not only to earth's different atmosphere, but also to there new found powers. It always bothered me that every other Superman story (Superman II, Lois and Clark, Smallville) that involved Zod (or other evil Kryptonians) had them mastering their abilities as if they had them all their lives (Smallville being the worst offender, as Zod and his pals had greater mastery of their powers than even Clark had).

Second, I liked how they skipped the hidden identity (at least from Lois). It has been done to death and, as most Superman fans know, the two are cannonically an item (married even) so I'm glad they did not feel the need to go back to the ""will she find out and when"" scenerio of previous incarnations. This does lead to one logic problem, though. If Lois can find out so easily, why can't anyone else?

I really liked the way Jor-El was protrayed as well - as the father that inspires his son to greatness. This also leads to my biggest problem with the movie - Jonathon Kent. Worst incarnation ever. On the one hand he is telling Clark that the type of man he will become, for good or for evil, will change the world, but then he's teaching his son that it is OK for him to let a bus load of school kids die in order to maintain his secret identity. Then, later, after telling Clark he is here for some great purpose, he's angry with Clark for not wanting to be a farmer. Farmers are great and all, but it does not take superpowers to be one. That would be am obvious waste of Clark's abilities. His death was just plan lame as well. Better to have had Clark just reminising about his father at his grave and saying how he beleived that the world was not ready. Too bad he did not hear Jor-El in the beginning when Lara said ""He'll be an outcast. They'll kill him."" The simple response was ""How?""

The next problem issue for me was the battle at the end. Drawn out and the CGI, while looking good, did not feel real. This is one area where Superman II out did this with the ""less is more"" motto. The battle felt real in Superman II. It was more video game like in MOS. (Still, I liked MOS much more than SM2).

Finally, the final solution concerning Zod was very well done. I know there are a lot of viewers that don't like it, but I found it the most realistic and moral choice Superman could have made given the circumstances. Seriously, how is Superman going to subdue and detain Zod? But instead of going the easy, convenient death that the hero is not responsible for (such as Green Goblin in the Spider-Man movie), they forced Superman to make the hard choice. In the end, he made the correct (though painful) choice.",1384473600,3,2849,4.417142857142857

They very rare exception are assemblages of outakes, but even those are often lacking.  Special Features are another marketing ploy to allow studios to charge more than the feature product is actually worth.  That is true for this edition of MAN OF STEEL.

5783499,4,B00D91GRA4,"Just for fun.

Man of Steel: Five stars right up to the last moments and then the flight falters.a bit. I disagreed with the thumbs down reviewers in their assessment of most of the film, until the last few minutes and then I agreed with them: thus four stars out of five.

The first two hours of the film was a surprise and generally a delight. But the last 10 minutes had the feel of a film where the script, the direction and the production did not know how to close the deal with the viewer effectively. Here is where they went wrong: An overly long fight scene between Kal-El and Zod, an inexplicable death dealing neck twist, and the emergence of a completely undisguised Clark at the Planet left me and those I was with a bit let down.

The combat went on and on and on and on and was the same set of moves at different toppling skyscrapers. Lop five minutes off of it and it improves.

Superman does not intentionally kill others- thats one of his DC Canon hallmarks. Why couldn't there have been a Kansas Farm Boy bit of wisdom?..have Kal-El warn Zod that just as super-hearing can overwhelm so can the other powers and then have Zod burn himself out overusing his heat vision. Kansas wisdom: take it slow, moderation in all things, know your field before you plow it.

And then Clark is welcomed to the Planet (a lame word play? in a city that is all but destroyed with a smoldering Smallville somewhere off in the distance) this whole things seemed surreal. How can EVERYONE NOT recognize him? His public presence during the face off with the Fascist Kryptonians certainly was filmed by someone in this day of ubiquitous camera phones. Why not dare to take the Martian Manhunter approach where his physical appearance as John Jones is completely different from Jonn Jonzz? What if Clark had altered features like Lemont Cranton, the Shadow, did? I suppose it is too much of a chance, too big of a gamble, too far a reachbut it would have gone a long way it making his so-called secret identity a bit more real.

Still I loved the origin story with all its angst. We loved the two dads (and saw hints of the borderline personality in Jor-El that we got used to in Smallville). Their combined presence (in his Kryptonian genes and his Kansas jeans) are evident. We loved his I cant help myself heroism.

The Kryptonian science was interesting if not spectacular. Zod and gang were nasty enough. Lois was outstanding- a modern go-getter with as much drive as Kal-El but more certainty. She is Kal-Els partner almost from the start. Indeed a common theme in the film, as in Smallville, is that despite all his power, Superman cannot do it without a little (and sometimes a lot) of help from his friends: Ma and Pa Kent, a clergyman, a general, a colonel, a scientist, and his love at first sight star crossed lover Lois.

Will there be a sequel? I sincerely hope so.

Afterthought- As I watched the film my mind wandered once or twice to a more serious interpretation of the films underlying themes. Jonathan Kent raises the issue of being different with Clark and worries that he will not be accepted, or worse, will be rejected and attacked, if his true nature becomes known. In our oh-so real world the question is not a new one. The danger posed by aliens who superficially look like us but unless they have been fully acculturated could bring us down and then replace us was played out. When key characters recognize that: He is one of us. Its a turning point in the film. Could it be a turning point in our discussion of immigration, foreign policy, caring for the needy etc.  Hmmmm.",1384473600,,3596,4.526964560862866

I have a few minor beefs, with no disrespect to the actor Mr. Fishburne (personally I like Laurence Fishburne as an actor, he was great in the Matrix movies, and a real pain in the butt in the Predators Movie!) , but Perry White is a white man, also the suit was ok, although it could have been a little brighter in color.

5783509,4,B00D91GRA4,"Man of Steel is, in my opinion, a great re-introduction of Superman to the big screen.  Zack Snyder did an awesome job at giving new life to a character that has been off the big screen for about eight years.  A great deal was riding on this film from the beginning.  Superman has not been in theaters for a long time and the three installments that came before it (Superman 3, Superman 4, and Returns) have ranged from subpar to just plain abysmal.  Snyder had to have been under a great deal of pressure to make this movie good and, in my opinion, he succeeded.  This is probably my favorite Superman movie to date.  I even enjoy this a little more than the first Superman movie.  In fact this is probably my second favorite incarnation of Superman (first being Superman TAS).  I like that Snyder made the film more realistic, as least as far as Superman goes.  He also made it darker, but not dark like the Nolan Batman films.  For all those people who are expecting to see a movie as dark as those film, then you will be disappointed.

The cast is decent though I do have some issues.  Henry Cavill does an awesome job as Superman.  He is not as good as Christopher Reeve or Tim Daly, but he does do an adequate job at filling their shoes.  Superman in this film is made more human than in any of the other movies, even the first one.  Clark is a good person to look up to but not to the point where we cannot relate to him.  The moral dilemma he goes through in the beginning of the film makes him feel very real.
Amy Adams is not bad as Lois Lane but I did not love her as the character.  She does not have a lot of the wit and spunk that Lois Lane is supposed to have.  To me Margot Kidder is still the best Lois Lane.  I, however, do like how Lois is given a bigger role in the plot instead of being Supermans love interest and the damsel-in-distress.  She is given more to do here than in any of the other movies which I like.

Russell Crowe does an amazing job playing Jor-El.  He is a great leader and a good father figure for Clark.  I also like how he helps Clark and Lois out in the movie.  I personally believe that Crowes performance in this film is on par with Marlon Brandos.  Kevin Costner and Diane Lane as Jonathan and Martha Kent do a decent job as well.  They also play the parental figures pretty well.

It pains me to say it but I did not like the villain Zod here.  The character is right but the actor, Michael Shannon, did nothing for me.  He does not sell the character of Zod well at all.  Compared to Terrance Stamp and even the Zod in Smallville Shannons performance was lacking.

Laurence Fishburne as Perry White does a good job also.  The fact that Perry is black instead of white in this film does not bother me as long as the actor can pull of the role, which he does.  He plays the character of Perry well, but he is not given much to do.
The effects are easily the selling point of the film.  The effects in this movie are vastly superior to the effects in any of the previous installments.  This film looks even better than Superman Returns.  I did not see this in 3D so I cannot comment on how good the 3D is.

The thing I liked most is how they portray Krypton.  In any other continuity, including the previous movies, Krypton is portrayed as an ice planet, and the Kryptonians technology derived from crystals.  That is not the case here.  The Kryptonian technology is like something you see in Star Wars or the new Star Trek movies.  I also love how they go into the culture and history of Krypton and why Zod betrayed them.  I do not recall this being done to this extent in any of the other movies.  There are things that they added to the Kryptonian mythos that deviates from the source material but it works well.

The fight scenes are phenomenal.  The action in this film trumps the action in the other movies by leaps and bounds.  I was waiting for the day I would finally see action of this caliber in a Superman movie.  The action scenes are fun, explosive, and intense, though several really drag on.  I especially love the fight between Superman and Zod, though it ends on a controversial note.  Many Superman fans will probably not like how the fight ends.  I also found it weird but it did not ruin anything for me.

Overall this is a great re-introduction to Superman for both longtime fans and a new audience.  Any Superman fan should be excited.  I am very much looking forward to future installments.",1384387200,3,4460,4.279041916167665

I'm much more open to admitting that there isn't really a definitive Superman in movies, or on TV, or even (pardon my herecy) in comic books.  When I first watched this movie, I felt like they had missed the point of what Superman was all about.

I feel I can understand Jor-el and his actions now.  Jonathan and Martha make more sense to me.  I actually like this movie now.  I highly recommend watching again ifyou were disappointed the first time.  I also think ( and this is HUGE) you should avoid the 3D version at all costs!!!  This movie gained NOTHING from 3D, in fact I think it made it worse.  Having watched the extra version on the blu-ray, I don't think Zack Snyder  meant this to be a 3D movie.

5783515,3,B00D91GRA4,"I was extremely excited for Man of Steel for many reasons. First of those, the selection of Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent and Russell Crowe as Jor-El was excellent. Second, the reintroduction of General Zod and the Phantom Zone criminals, as well as the return to Krypton were long overdue (30 plus years) for a Superman series. Third, with the advancement of CGI and in the wake of the stellar Dark Knight trilogy, expectations for a fresh, realistic and awesome Superman were nerdishly and gloriously high.

With untamed glee and a pair of 3D glasses, I sank into my movie theater chair and calmed myself for what was to come. (Warning: SPOILERS may appear throughout. So please proceed with caution.)

The movie begins in a familiar place: Krypton --- visually striking, chaotic and different in every way than the planet familiar to fans of the first two Superman movies with Christopher Reeve. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. In fact, it allows us to see Zod and his companions in their prime, leading a resistance against the council. Jor-El comes to life like never before, thanks to Crowe's presence and skill. While I still prefer the gravitas and authority that Marlon Brando loaned to the role, Russell Crowe brings the character of Jor-El down to Earth (or Krypton, to be exact), instilling a sense of humanity that seems to be (or tries to be) the heart of this film.

The movie ensues as expected with the incarceration of Zod and his companions in the Phantom Zone (no longer a whirling sheet of glass, by the way), the sending off of baby Kal-El to Earth, and the destruction of Krypton and all of its inhabitants, with the exception of those trapped in the Phantom Zone, of course.

Once on Earth, we encounter some serious problems. Not only does the movie seem to lose its focus, but Zack Snyder makes some creative decisions that have left me somewhat disappointed.

First, I wish I could have been a mosquito on the wall when the director, producers and editors decided to turn Kevin Costner's contributions into a series of flashbacks and ""flash-forwards,"" as a result, significantly diminishing his emotional impact in the story. Why couldn't they have simply presented the story of Kal-El's developmental years with the Kent family in a linear fashion? Snyder must have been watching The Godfather II while editing this movie, but to no avail. The Godfather II masterfully follows the paths to power of the two main characters of the saga, Michael Corelone and his father Vito Corleone. Both stories offer great substance; powerful antagonists, believable character development and a sense of great depth and history. Man of Steel does not. Man of Steel's editing seems like a last-hour decision to take an average to above-average movie and give it a touch of complexity and introspection. Unfortunately, that is not the result. What we get is a warm, touching performance by Kevin Kostner (Jonathan Kent) broken up into bite-size segments intended to convey significance or document a milestone in the life of Kal-El (Clark). Why not include a few scenes that allow more time for Jonathan and Clark to bond like father and son? Instead, the relationship feels contrived and the film rushed. And when the moment of reckoning for Jonathan Kent arrives, I didn't know whether to laugh (because it was pretty funny to me) or cry because his role ended up being a spoiled opportunity to build the humanity of Superman. And thanks to this awful editing, I can't even tell you how many times I heard the same motivational lines from Costner to his son. The first time was meaningful, the next few renditions made me squirm in my seat.

What's extraordinarily awesome is Kal-El/Clark/Superman's (minus the uniform) journey after his father's death. These wilderness years find our hero trying to find his way in the world. First as an oil rig worker and then as a valiant savior who passes through people's lives, leaving behind what the news media begins to report as miracles. The movie should have spent more time in this area, as in Batman Begins, to help develop the character that would become Superman. It would help drive home Clark's fascination with the Daily Planet, where he would eventually hang his hat. Enter Lois Lane, briefly. I can't even begin to comprehend how she's able to sneak around and infiltrate such high-level-security locations. But she does. And it seems convenient to the story, rather than a consequence of her persona.

The interpretation of Zod was well done. And for those who are curious, Terence Stamp's Zod this was not. Stamp brought a controlled sense of malice and dread to his character, while Michael Shannon's Zod felt unleashed, overly bitter, hands-on, vengeful, unpredictable and highly dangerous. So that was great, but what about his cohorts? Yeah, I almost forgot they were in the movie too! Richard Lester's and Richard Donner's Superman II featured Zod and the Phantom Zone criminals to perfection. While their mannerisms (don't forget their porn star robes masquerading as uniforms) might seem dated, not-so-villainous, and sometimes campy by today's standards, we had time to get to know their characters. In Man of Steel, Ursa shows signs of a personality, but doesn't get enough screen time to fully develop into a memorable villain. Non, on the other hand, might as well have been an AT-AT from the Star Wars universe. Character development and screen time aside, both Ursa and Non participate in some spectacular combat scenes with Superman. In that regard, Man of Steel eclipses the Lester's and Donner's series without a doubt.

To wrap up this list of the good, the bad and the ugly, I was intrigued by the idea of the buried outpost spaceship containing Jor-El's holographic ""spirit"" and the Superman suit. It was cleverly done, and fit nicely with scene in which Jonathan Kent tells Clark, ""You're the answer to 'are we alone in the universe.'"" What's odd is how Jor-El plays such a vital role in the subsequent key events, considering that he's nothing more than a holographic image, albeit, with a talent for advanced computer programming and a mastery of forecasting that would give a meteorologist in Antarctica a run for his money.

Once I was able to ignore those glaring pimples in the plot, not to mention the colossal planet drill that kills countless inhabitants of Metropolis, the rest of the movie was enjoyable and goes down like cherry cough syrup. No longer chained to the hope that this movie would match the quality of Batman Begins or The Dark Knight, the movie plays out like your typical superhero/action/sci-fi epic. And that's what it boils down to: a monster of a movie that had everything it needed to be epic, brought down by poor editing and missed opportunities to give us a modern Superman that we could all care about and, at the very least, remember. My review hasn't said much about the character of Superman, or the acting of Henry Cavill, for that matter, for good reason. It's just not memorable.

There's talk of Ben Afleck suiting up as the new Batman to star in a forthcoming Superman sequel, and it's become apparent to me why Man of Steel is kind of a let down. Much like how both Iron Man sequels seem to exist merely to accentuate The Avengers super-moves, so does Man of Steel feel like a prerequisite for the long-awaited Justice League franchise. Was that Snyder's intent? I'm sure he wanted to make a great movie. But he couldn't quite get there.

In conclusion, I'd recommend Man of Steel to anyone, particularly those who enjoy a good action or sci-fi film over an in-depth, slow-building, emotionally-charged action/adventure, such as the one that I was hoping for. If you're a comic book purist, I'm sure you'll already have strong opinions about this movie. If you're a fan of the Lester/Donner series, then you'll either walk away feeling nostalgic or, at worst, mildly impressed. Luckily for me, I was both nostalgic and mildly impressed.",1384387200,,7977,4.892751479289941
5783516,2,B00D91GRA4,"I watched this with some friends the other night.  Honestly, the best part was referencing the other movies it made us think of.  The ""world engine"" scene - ""Mr. Incredible, Mr. Incredible!""  The part where Zod's got him by the cape and is swinging him around?  Imagine E's voice: ""No capes!""  The building where Zod dies...hey, wasn't that destroyed in Avenger's, too?  Or a building incredibly like it?
The flashbacks were useful in a way, but as I prefer a straight storyline, they quickly became annoying as well.  One or two flashbacks don't interrupt the continuity of a story for me, but this had more like five or six.
I'll confess up front that I haven't followed the comic books, so when I think to myself that I prefer the original storyline, I'm basing that on the original TV series and movies.
Yeah.  I won't be upset if someone else wants to watch it when I'm around, but I won't vote for it, either.",1384387200,,915,4.536585365853658
5783517,4,B00D91GRA4,"He's been living among us for 33 years, raised by a caring farming couple who understands what will happen if his existence gets out.  But he knows he's destined for something special, and grows into a wayfaring stranger who saves lives wherever he goes, leaving a trail of breadcrumbs for a dedicated young reporter.  She finds him...just as an outcast from his homeworld does, an egomaniacal patriot who plans to remake the Earth...by killing off all of humanity.

He is...Superman...kinda.

Purists will probably despise MAN OF STEEL, or at least have several bones to pick with it.  I, for one, have never really been into the SUPERMAN movies per say; I'm very picky about my superheroes, at least as far as film goes, and prefer darker, layered stories than what one usually gets with Superman.  Even with DARK KNIGHT director Christopher Nolan on board as producer, and David Goyer penning the script, MAN OF STEEL is still happy fluff; there's rarely anything at stake, we know how it's gonna turn out (mostly; there's a nice twist there at the end), and we know our hero will end up happily ever after. There are a few too many flashback scenes, almost all of them repetitive, and the strongest feature a very good Kevin Costner.  And the antagonism between Michael Sheen's General Zod and Henry Cavill's Kal-El just isn't quite there; this is largely the result of shoddy dialogue for Sheen, who has moments of brilliance interspersed between by-rote delivery (as though he's aware the character could've been better written).

What helps MAN OF STEEL stand out, and makes it worthwhile, is the crew behind it.  The film is visually stunning; say what you want about director Zack Snyder, but he always brings a visual flair to his films.  (By the way: this doesn't feel like a Snyder film until the final confrontation, which is actually quite breathtaking.)  Nolan's big-budget fingerprints are all over this, though it is wholly distinct from any of his own films.  The story itself makes little sense, and is so full of holes, if you aren't careful, you'll fall right through.

But story isn't the point; most of us know the story.  What MAN OF STEEL sets out to do is give a fresh take on the Superman mythos, while still adhering to its roots.  It does this (again, for the most part) fairly well, thanks to the crew behind the camera, and the film's principle star in front.  In Henry Cavill, we finally have a modern Superman we don't feel bad rooting for.  Cavill is charismatic enough to bring the character to life, but has enough depth to his performance to let us know there are things ticking beneath the surface.  It's not an Oscar-caliber performance, but it's good enough to help carry the film, and that's a step up from where we've been.  While MAN OF STEEL may not have been everything its makers hoped for, it's better than what some fans feared, and should at the very least inspire anticipation for the inevitable sequel.",1384387200,3,2953,4.754901960784314

Yes, the one's with Christopher Reeve especially # 2 was good. However, the special effects and story line are just super and where this movie should be in 2013. Much like Star Trek into Darkness and Ironman # 3, the story line, action and sci-fi are really just excellent!

I agree with the majority that this movie should get the respect it deserves with actors like Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Laurence Fishburne, etc etc... This movie you could literally watch every week just like Ironman 3 and Star Trek 2. For some reasons all the part 2's and part 3's are far better than even the first one's.

He wanted it for his birthday, but unfortunately this came out after his birthday, so I said that it will be late. He was sad, but okay. We just received it yesterday, and he wanted to watch it immediately. He is so excited, the case is absolutely wonderful. It is very durable, and a great collectible.

The stand itself is two pieces that snap together but the fit is not good and the two pieces like to come apart very easily the tin itself is nice no complaints with it's construction its actually got a foam insert to hold the stand since you won't be using it.,1384387200,,724,4.141843971631205
5783524,3,B00D91GRA4,"There are two camps in regard to this yet another exhumation of a comic book hero  those who worship at its altar  (and allow it to achieve a box office intake of $291,021,565 in the USA alone, with nearly equal international numbers), and those who see the entertainment value of the film that is in dire need of editing at least 45 minutes of extraneous repetitive CGI effects to make it tolerable. The cast is very fine  hunky Henry Cavill is a rather demure Superman and that is in his favor, Amy Adams makes Lois Lane credible, Michael Shannon is ominous as the evil General Zod, and then there are the home-baked goodness of Diane Lane and Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe and Amtje Traue as the variable parents (Krypton genes, Kansas adoption). Nods also go to Christopher Meloni, Ayelet Zurer, Harry Lennix, Richard Schiff, and Laurence Fishburne for trying to take all this seriously.

Plot (not really adapted from the original comic books):  A child, sent to Earth from a dying planet, is adopted by a couple in rural Kansas. As a young boy he learns that he has extraordinary powers and is not of this Earth. As a young man, he journeys to discover where he came from and what he was sent here to do. But the hero in him must emerge if he is to save the world from annihilation and become the symbol of hope for all mankind.

Sounds like a good story through the sci-fi telescope. The problem is the heavy handed emphasis on the monsters and space ships and tunnels and gore of Krypton and the mess made not only in Smallville, Kansas but in the major cities by the invading Krypton dudes. Makes you wonder when all the CGI minds behind it will tire of the noise and fire and space sailing of Superman. Enough already.

5783538,5,B00D91GRA4,"This was the best movie I have scene since transformers 3.  This was a very action pack movie, and it was very emotional as well.  Often superman/Clark Kent is viewed as the all American golden boy, who had it easy especially when compared to many other superhero' s lives, not true. In this version of the story Clark suffers from being bullied as he is growing up and from being different, the biggest difference is the people closest to Clark are fully aware of everything he is going through and they are there fully supporting him and giving him what he needs emotionally to be healthy.  I loved Henry Cavill in the role of superman.  I loved the fact that he made superman more emotional just buy the expressive looks on his face, he was perfect in the role, dare I say it Henry was a better superman, than our much loved Christopher  reeve' s.  Another thing that made me love the movie was the fact that they smartened the character Lois lane up, remember when Clark Kent removed his glasses and ever a led himself to be both Clark Kent and superman in the 70's version with reeve's, well that scene used to tick me off, cause after all she was in loved with superman and she worked with Kent everyday, how could she not know, that's crazy. In this version Lois knew exactly who he was from the get go, and to me it improved the movie by leaps and bounds. What also improved the movie is the fact that this Loislain is more likeable because she isn't the annoying know it all like past Lois lanes.  We also got to see what motivated the villains in t his movie which is something we didn't get to see with the original General zod.",1384387200,3,1639,4.354098360655738
5783539,5,B00D91GRA4,"The controversy, in my mind minor, that surrounded this film upon release shed great light upon the affection so many have for Superman - or at least, how dear THEIR idea of Superman is.  Yet the concept behind Man Of Steel is not one that allows the revisiting of the same exact Superman from Donner's films or the one that many grew up with.  That's not to say that this Superman does not share the values of that Superman - he does.  Yet Snyder, Goyer, and Nolan are more interested in HOW he got to that point and how the world would truly react if a superpowered being lived among us.  There's a reason why massive destruction happens when Kal-El fights - because he is THAT powerful.  Frankly, I'm not sure that any superhero has the overall power of Superman.  It is his power that also makes him most interesting.  For years, Superman has been seen as a mere Boy Scout.  He does the right thing.  He's the good guy.  But why?

Let's think about this.  If you were the most powerful person on the planet, capable of taking out whole military detachments by yourself, would you SERVE humanity or decide to DOMINATE it?  The most amazing thing about Superman is his CHOICE to serve, not to control.  We have so often taken this aspect of the character for granted, yet the filmmakers delve into this superbly.  At the heart of the reason are Martha and Jonathon, played superbly by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane.  It is through their love and care of young Clark that he matures and becomes Superman.

There are so many things to praise here, from the score to the plot to the pacing to the effects.  It is also worth noting that the screenwriter has stated that the destruction will be an issue in the second film and is also a reason why people do not fully trust Superman.

If you can, separate yourself from the past.  Christopher Reeve was wonderful in his day, but this is not that Superman.  It is the modern Superman that lives in a more complex world that would not embrace him unthinkingly.

Henry Cavill is also wonderful here, as is the entire cast.  Frankly, this movie doesn't miss a beat at all.  And the Special Features with the Blu-Ray reveal even more.  There are many things that I thought were not special effects that were.  The amount of detail the set and design was given is incredible.  You can just see the love so many had for this project.

With Man Of Steel, Superman soars like never before.  This film will tug on your heart strings, cause you to cheer, and let you look in wonder at Superman once more.  It is the greatest of the modern slew of comic book films, surpassing even the wonderful The Dark Knight and far exceeding anything done by Marvel (and most of that HAS been quite good).",1384387200,2,2727,4.4505050505050505

This film removes that restraint and opens a very uncivilized door. Whether this is a reflection of our current status in society or a hidden fantasy, it is disturbing. This telling of the myth clearly  lacks the morality of former tellings of this mythic tale.

5783548,3,B00D91GRA4,"To all the writers and directors out there. PLEASE stop making movies were the plot and story line is dictated by what the CGI department can do. Yes, we know the CG nerds are great at what they do, but it is becoming very obvious in these action movies that the plot is being forced to conform to the CGI rather than the CGI being used to compliment the story line and plot. The use of so many CGI effects is that they start making it so unrealistic that it becomes laughable and just plain silly.
While this is really a good movie, there are quite a few things which were over done or just did not quite fit properly.
First thing. Spaceships? In a Superman movie?
It is explained that Superman got his powers from the radiation from the sun, but later had them go away because of the air on Gen. Zod's spaceship? Yet he is perfectly fine flying in space.
It took years of exposure of sunlight for Clark to gain his powers, yet a couple of hours out of their space suits and Zods crew gets them. Oh.. That's right, it was the air again. Not the sun.
Every fight scene, someone is getting plowed through the ground.
How many fly into the gut, then crash through a bunch of building sequences do were really need in a movie? A lot less than were in this one.
Lois Lane falling, only to be saved by Superman at the last second. Almost a requirement in an ""I can fly"" action movie and a great tie-in to the original, but PLEASE... sure Superman saves her numerous times, but lets everyone fall to their death? Wait. He did save one other, but still, did she really have to fall from the sky every 30 minutes.
Way too many saved at the last second scenes.
Quite a few scenes that jumped away to something else and never concluded the tangent. At times it felt like parts of the movie skipped ahead, or was edited badly. Others just didn't added anything to the story.
The flashback sequences were annoying to say the least, and were often too long or detailed to make the story flow correctly. Namely the tornado scene. Several un-needed minutes and action to simply tell us that Jonathan didn't think the world was ready to know about Clarks powers, and then at the end was narrated with dialog anyway.
The killer of the whole thing was that Gen. Zod was crashed, smashed, burnt, shot, blown up, plowed through the ground, and knocked through buildings, yet remained unhurt, but is killed by getting his neck broken?
Past all that, it was a good movie and a decent restart of the original.",1384300800,8,2486,4.383116883116883

5783550,4,B00D91GRA4,"Like it or not, every superhero movie for the foreseeable future will be compared to ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Those two epic films are very hard to top, and overall, I have to say that ""Man of Steel"" doesn't step out of the Dark Knight's shadow. However, it is a solid, very good foundation. --Spoilers from here on--
I enjoyed the movie's fight scenes, especially the battles in Smallville and Metropolis. I, for one, was not upset at all when Superman killed General Zod. Superman will do what he has to do in order to protect the citizens of Metropolis. Batman is the one with the no-kill rule, not Superman. And if you go back far enough in the comics, even Batman killed in the beginning. The movie was not perfect; in fact, for me the weakest point was when Jonathan Kent was standing by the cars with a tornado coming up behind him. He motions to Clark to stay put, so as not to reveal his secret. Then Jonathan stands there grinning and lets the tornado sweep him away. Rather than hobbling to the safety(?) of the overpass that was maybe 20 feet away. That made no sense to me. Even with a conveniently bad leg, he could have made it.
While watching the movie, especially at the end, I couldn't help but wonder if humanity will develop a hate-fear relationship of all Kryptonians, not just Zod and his followers. After all, Metropolis and Smallville got smashed up pretty badly, and it wouldn't be unheard of for people to harbor an irrational hatred of another race. I imagine there will be some negative consequences of the giant brawl for Superman to deal with in the next film. The movie itself winks at the audience regarding a sequel, showing us a Lexcorp truck and a satellite belonging to Wayne Enterprises. Hello, Lex Luthor and Bruce Wayne!
Speaking of which, I was let down to hear that the next movie will feature Superman and Batman at odds with each other. I'd much rather see them team up, because let's be honest, Batman isn't winning a fight with Superman without Kryptonite, which was never mentioned in ""Man of Steel."" I think Lex Luthor could be an epic enough villain to keep both superheroes occupied.
So, to my original comment; I think that the next sequel could be a truly great movie, and that's about the only way to get people to stop comparing to the Dark Knight movies: make a movie that is decisively better. When I left the theater after first seeing Man of Steel, the sequel is the movie that I already wanted to see.",1384300800,3,2481,4.527839643652562
5783551,5,B00D91GRA4,"It only took decades, numerous embarrassing miscues and one real gem of a film (Christopher Reeve's first Superman film) to figure out how to turn the iconic Superman character into a real movie star. Previous films dealt with more Silver age type adventures as the character of Superman became more and more like Clark Kent, instead of the reverse. Now we are presented with yet another version as another new-ish actor and a new hot director try to solve the long standing riddle of making a great Superman movie. In this case it appears they have. Man of Steel finally just shucks aside the humanity and admits that despite any protestations to the opposite, Kal El is a God. And he needs to fight other Gods. Like Zod. And when Gods do battle among mere mortals, humanity is swept aside in a terrible wave of carnage. And it is finally exciting because we are shown this is a film where there are terrible consequences to punching someone with the power of a thousand tons of TNT and driving them through multiple buildings.

There was so much they could have done with this movie and they ruined it. With all the stupid scripts that make it into films these days man of steel should have been a bright spot. They had decades of tv shows, comics, films and books to learn from! I think the lowest point in the film for me was when the army girl at the end of the movie comments on how she thinks superman is hot. (SERIOUSLY!?!?!?!?!?!) I'm not twelve so stupid scenes like this that are suppose to be funny just come out as extremely juvenile. I'm so glade I didn't see this in the theater or buy it like I had planned. $6 was enough spent on renting the HD streaming version. I should have waited for it to be on Amazon prime.

5783559,5,B00D91GRA4,"This was the Superman movie I had been waiting for since I was a child.  Growing up Superman was my absolute favorite hero, not only because of his tremendous power - but also because of his compassion and morality; traits I identified as valuable and heroic even at a very young age.  More than just a reboot, and more than just mindless action - ""Man Of Steel"" brings Superman into the modern era with force and gravity that respect the character and lend strength to the story we all know.  The acting is wonderful, the smirks and glances shared between Cavill and Adams communicates the growing interest and intimacy between Clark and Lois.  Kevin Costner as Johnathan Kent offers an incredible performance full of emotion and strength that reminded me of the best qualities of my own father whom I had lost many years ago.  A couple of his scenes actually made the room seem a little dusty.  And, of course, Russel Crowe makes Jor El more than just a floating head in a crystal cavern, he makes the character legendary and leaves you hoping to see much more of him in future films of the franchise.  The casting in general is superb and I didn't walk away thinking anyone failed in their performance.  The effects are extremely well done, while there is (of course) lots of CGI in the film, it doesn't feel overwhelming but instead fits very well with the grand scale of events in the movie.  The writing was well done, many reboots belabor the telling of the origins story to a point that makes long time fans impatient - not so in this movie.  A different take and new offerings on the same old Son of Krypton make the telling fresh and interesting.
I have noted a lot of criticism of the movie; trashing it as over the top or doing injustice to the character of Superman.  I offer this to those who have not seen the movie yet because of such remarks; Christopher Reeves' Superman was legendary (and was single handedly responsible for my fandom) yet in modern culture he wouldn't have done well at all.  The story in this movie, the way it is handled, even the costume modifications are all essential for making Superman relevant and viable in the 21st century.

The acting is terrible (particularly the actor who played the main antagonist... unfortunate.), and the costume designs are so terribly ludicrous as to make one wonder how they were ever approved for the film.. the costumes of the aliens are so ridiculous-looking that it makes it impossible to take anything these terrible actors are saying seriously.  I tried three times to watch far enough into the movie that the plot may become interesting enough to outweigh the film's drawbacks, but ultimately was unable to sit through it.  And a word of warning to any fans of Hong Kong cinema out there... the hand-to-hand combat is exceptionally slow and lackluster, and the fight choreography amateurish at best- it reminds me of the barroom brawls in old TV westerns like ""Gunsmoke"" (although Gunsmoke had the advantage of being written by people with a grasp of how to tell an interesting story).  I don't expect fight choreography by anyone in Hollywood to match that of Lau Kar-Leung or Sammo Hung, but the painfully slow, brainless, oafish fight scenes in movies like this one and the most recent Batman film are downright embarrassing. This film is so terrible it actually makes my memories of those god-awful Christopher Reeve movies seem fond.

There are now thousands of kryptonians still running around so no need for clark to feel alone, oh wait there is no clark kent in this movie. They also have lots of space ships and can cruise the galaxy at will. In fact apparently superman holds the key to rebuilding the entire Kryptonian race.

5783569,4,B00D91GRA4,"This is epic.
And sometimes that can do more harm than good.  Like Thor, I think most audiences have a hard time with the superheroes in capes (except Batman).

First, the star power in this show seemed like overkill.  Amy Adams, great beautiful actress, but woefully miscast for this role especially where it was underused and very little backstory. ""Fish""? Another great actor but didn't need Perry White in this movie. Kevin Costner? gives good farmer ruggedness appearance (along with the acting chops) but again, he seemed angry. Why? Diane Lane is just too hot to be believable as a widowed farmer's wife.  Russell Crowe, great actor, he is MAXIMUS! But is largely wasted here.

Second, the storyline is massive!  Too many things going on. I mean I could have watched at least 45 minutes worth of life on Krypton.  That was great!  I've always wanted to see more of what Krypton was like (as opposed to looking like a crystalline world.)

Kal-El's basket-in-Nile-River-ride to Earth was quick then BAM! he's an adult.  But I did like the flashbacks to his childhood.  Again, I could watch more of this especially where there were poignant moments.  But we still had to get to the destruction, so cut short this part of the film.

The idea of an alien invasion was actually captivating but the movie didn't go too much more into this.  By show of hands, who thought this part of the movie was reminiscent of ""Signs""?

Then, it turns into the destruction of our beloved IHOP (plus a few other skyscrapers) while Sears stood tall.  Oh the subtle advertisement.  Then all of a sudden, we're back in the middle of the streets of Metropolis at the Daily Planet (like the mass destruction never happened.)

I know, I know. Sounds like I should be giving this movie a bad rating then.  Sure there are gaping plot holes and a lot going on.  But this is one of the better versions of the Man of Steel since Superman 2.  It's a reimagining.  It's not Smallville or the one with Richard Pryor in it (RIP) but MAYBE the start of it's own franchise.  Hence, the ""too much going on"" is probably warranted.  It's a rollercoaster of ride especially in terms of bang for your buck.  I think Henry Cavill is great (if not a little wooden) but the Man of Steel has to be stoic for truth justice and the American Way.  After all, he grew up in Kansas.

Should you buy it?? Sure why not.  At least it's not as bad as the last Superman. But remember, Batman at least uses his cape to glide.",1384300800,2,2473,4.521444695259594

I watched it in 3D and even that was disappointing.  The story was re-told in a way that would have embarrassed Christopher Reeve if he were still around.  Henry Cavill, although chiseled etc., had a constant dumbfounded look on his face like he just didn't understand why the chicken had to get to the other side.  Russell Crowe was the best part of this movie hands down and his presence throughout the film granted the second star in my rating.  Kristen/Amy Bell/Stewart/Adams or whatever it is, was absolutely useless for this role and a good actress that should stick to Oscar caliber films.  These guys going around re-making superhero films should get their act together and stop pretending that they're too cool for school by cutting up the story.  The experienced would have been so much more fulfilling if they would have followed the same timeline as the original and allowed the characters to develop without flashing all over and behaving stupidly.

This movie is an all star cast, with Amy Adams, Laurence Fishburne, Diane Lane, Michael Shannon, Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner.  Henry Cavill is the third british actor to play an american superhero, Superman. We had Christian Bale to play Batman he was my favorite, we also have Andrew Garfield to play Spider-man these two guys were my favorite actors to play two top american superheroes that I always admired.  No offense to Henry Cavill, he is good not good enough to play superman, because I miss Brandon Routh he was the perfect fit to play superman.  I rather have him to play superman in this movie, instead of him.  No offense, but I really enjoy this movie, it has an excellent plot, great character and great action.  I have to give Amy Adams full credit for this movie, she did a great job playing Lois Lane.  So does, the rest of the actors who plays in the superman franchise.  I also like the music in this movie, it was really amazing.  One thing I also respect in this movie, it was a lot different than the superman movie with christopher reeve.  Where Clark Kent travels to the artic to find the fortress of solitude and starts his kryptonian training.  But here it shows Clark traveling around the world, saving people and catching bad guys as an anyomus superhero before he heads to the fortress of solitude.  Lois Lane meets Clark Kent for the first time, before he became superman and knows his identity a lot faster than a few years.  It reminds me of Smallville Lois Lane meeting Clark Kent without the glasses before he became Superman.  That's the reason, why Amy Adams made an extraordinary performance in this movie.

The action is intense and of the kind that makes you want to re-watch scenes over and over.  Great fights.  Great explosions.  Science fiction aspects that are truly different.  From the ships to the creatures to the architecture to the suits--all very cool.  The effects are grand and incredible.

The acting is superb.  Cavill becomes Superman.  I am genuinely impressed.  There is no other Superman now.  He is the best.  Never expected that.  Most of all--because I have always hated Lois Lane--I actually liked Lois Lane's character for the first time ever! Amy Adams (and the writing) makes her likable, interesting, and admirable.  Zod and his right hand woman Faora are excellent villains fighting for a cause we can relate to.  They are unpredictable, believable, and never melodramatic.  The Kents are brought to life like never before.  They are not props or background pieces.  They are legitimate inspirations--superheroes in their own way.

Only the story and characterization lack--no fault of the writers, though.  The movie just is not long enough to address all of the questions, quirks, and revelations that would make this story perfect.  The film can only touch upon what makes each character tick, what made Krypton and its people unique, and the science behind Superman.  So that is a weakness.  Also, who the heck was that giant and why wasn't he characterized!?!  Wow.

They do not explain how and why Superman gets weak near the ""atmospheric conditions"" of Krypton.  That seems like a pretty stupid thing to neglect.  They would have been better off using the standard Kryptonite and applying plausible scientific explanations.

The big surprise?  Jor-El is an incredible hero.  His scenes are probably the among the very best in the film.  Crowe is incredible.  The action is incredible.  His downloaded consciousness is fun and entertaining and very helpful.

I apologize for being ""old-school"" and therefore being really disappointed with this attempt to update Superman.  Actually it's beyond disappointment...I hated this film and what they did to the hero I grew up with.  This is of course a personal opinion only...a lot of folks liked the film and who am I tell them they are wrong?

There wasn't one redeeming quality about it at all, well maybe one.  I didn't give a crap about any of the characters including Superman.  The dialogue must have been written by the same people who wrote ""The Brady Bunch,"" especially Kevin Costner's dialogue.  There is absolutely no warmth or emotional attachment between any of the characters, even between Clark and his earthly mother, Diane Lane who played Martha Kent.  Even the make-up was terrible; the older Martha Kent looked more like a crack addict than matriarchal.

The tornado scene was absolutely ridiculous.  Why didn't Clark rescue the dog?  He could have easily done it without giving away his secret.  Instead he lets his father push him away pretty much knowing dad is a goner.  And did I miss something, didn't Lois Lane and everyone else already know that the alien was Clark Kent from Nebraska, so what was with the ending?  And what was with the suite?  There was no explanation why there was a suite or why it had those colors or anything, it just happens to appear on a ship, put there by the dead Krypto father 20,000 years ago.  How fast Lois and Clark became an item?  The casual way earth accepted the news about alien life?  How quickly Lois and the scientist were able to understand, interchange, interconnect, blah blah General Zod's ship's drive field with Clark's baby ship's drive field blah blah and send everyone except Zod back to the Phantom Zone? I could go on and on about the things I didn't like about the film and I hate that I spent $30 bucks to buy it.

Maybe I'm totally off the mark and not getting it.  Maybe if I was 16 or 17 I would have enjoyed this version of Superman, but I'm not, I'm 56 and remember Superman from the old comics, Saturday morning cartoons and the 1978 version of Superman with Christopher Reeve.

Awesome fight scenes that really put into perspective what a punch from Superman would do.

For those that know of the original introduction to Superman and/or at least agree with this excerpt, ""Superman-defender of law and order, champion of equal rights, valiant, courageous fighter against the forces of hate and prejudice, who, disguised as Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper, fights a never-ending battle for truth and justice,"" might find ""Man of Steel"" to be very far removed from the ideal of Superman we have come to know.

I won't go into specifics as they would spoil what happens but suffice it to say that there are many out of character moments in ""Man of Steel"" where Superman does things which are just not Superman whatsoever. That is what has put me off from this film quite a bit. Others will like it and that's fine. I understand that the writers and producers and the powers that be are looking to make more money off the Superman franchise and are hoping to cash in on a whole new generation of folks that see things differently. Can't blame them for trying to make a buck, it's their right after all.

I'd simply say that this is indeed a ""new"" Superman, a different Superman. More of a man with super powers than a Super-man. If you were looking for Superman, then ""Superman Returns"" would be the latest rendition that at least was more in keeping with the ideal of Superman, otherwise head back for Superman I & II, and maybe even IV.

5783586,2,B00D91GRA4,"I was all for a superman reboot with more action and fighting scenes. Didn't expect the movie to be chalk
full of CGI. They tried to incorporate so much into this film, that it could have easily turned into a 10 episode
TV series. The scenes felt rushed and the supporting actors were dry and nearly emotionless.

I enjoyed the flashbacks into Clark's childhood and the beginning of the movie when Clark worked on a fishing vessel. The bar scene also added some realism. It would have been more realistic if Clark would just take out the truckers tires and damage the engine. The truck dangling in the air was a bit much.

It would have been more authentic ( real ) to see Clark's father pass away due to natural causes; instead of a boring and predicable scene full of CGI.",1384214400,4,774,4.443661971830986

Anyway, I got my popcorn and soda ready, turned the phone off, and was ready to enjoy what I had heard was finally a great Superman movie.  REALLY??!!  Did I just get the special effects version that totally sucked?  Maybe it was just me that got the version that had absolutely no plot, no story line and just lots of a beautiful man in a tight uniform fly around and let towns and cities be destroyed.  Lois Lane met him for about 3 minutes before she became ""the one"".
The actors did a great job, the CGI was good but became too much after a while.  When Zod was somehow (story line lacked and I got bored - forgive me) still on Earth after Superman had ""won"" the battle, I just turned it off.  I was ready to watch water boil at that point and had no interest in spending another minute watching this major FAIL of a movie.
DC is getting their butts kicked by their rival studio because they don't seem to realize that the public wants more than just CGI.  You need a good script too.  What I don't understand is that if you watch the animated DC movies, they are usually excellent!  Why not adapt one of those?

5783596,4,B00D91GRA4,"So, a Superman reboot. One thing I liked about Superman Returns was that it was an intelligent and elegant film with beautiful visuals of Superman and the city itself. Like a lot of people, one thing I didn't like is that there just wasn't enough ""pulse pounding"" sequences. Well, you definitely get all the mayhem and destruction you could want in Man of Steel. And yet, now I want some of the elegance that Bryan Singer was able to bring to the Superman concept. Maybe I'm just fickle, but can't there be both? The following comments I make not as a criticism but as a personal reflection. Now, I knew long before I saw the film that Zack Snyder hadn't used the John Williams music, but in my heart, the filmic Superman just doesn't exist without the genius of John Williams's score. I can't believe how well it holds up over the years--it sounds like it could have been written today, and Superman Returns was all the better for using it. The score for Man of Steel felt like your typical action movie crescendos and thumping. (I can only remember one, understated theme from the movie.) In a way, the soaring Williams themes felt like they gave Superman the ability to come alive and fly, since the association between the character concept and the music was so innately, strongly irresistible. That's Williams's gift. He has a profound ability to understand the source material and bring it alive with music. Would Jaws have been as effective if it didn't have that unbelievable, two-note theme that you could come out of the theater humming to yourself? And in E.T. you can instantly see the scene of the bikes flying through the air when that music plays. Are there any music sequences in Man of Steel that make you instantly remember the scene? The word for Williams's many iconic themes and melodies is, ""indelible."" I admire Hans Zimmer and the many other talented film composers out there,  but I don't think, in my lifetime anyway, there will be any film composer who captures the essence of film magic and the characters that inhabit that world in the way that John Williams has over his career. I say that understanding that there are plenty of people who turn their noses up at a melodic, gossebump score, the same way they turn their noses up at Tchaikovsky, and go to bed at night dreaming of having Alban Berg or Arnold Shoenberg as film composers.

That said, I liked the movie for what it is. But I would say only about half of the substance of the film felt like a Superman film. And I definitely understand the reasoning. The filmmakers wanted to break from the tradition of Superman movies, not be bound by the filmic tropes that have been so firmly attached to it, and to see what comes out. (One thing they did keep, which I like, was the Superman-as-Christ figure, with his crucifixion poses; the scene of him in the church seeking guidance as he sits directly in front of a stained-glass window depicting Jesus in Gethsemane praying to God for strength and guidance; and the ""He will be like a God to them"" line...) Let me say this, I've figured that Zack Snyder's style is something most people either love or hate. Me, I'm a lover. I like watching his imagination and visual sense on the screen. (I think Watchmen and 300 are both great films). So, for what it is, this is a very solid action movie. For me personally, can I say that this a fulfilling Superman movie? No, I don't think I can. I think the creators went a few steps too far in re-inventing the representation of Superman on film. There was nothing as elegant as Singer's version, or as operatic as Richard Donner's vision, and no moment as singularly powerful as Superman's harrowing reaction to Lois Lane's death in the original film.

As I was watching, I was wondering if there is a metaphor in here regarding those breathing masks that Zod and his gang have to wear. When they get removed, the character becomes disoriented and has to adjust to Earth's ""atmospherics."" Are we, the audience, wearing masks of preconception that the movie rips away, forcing us to adapt to this new vision of Superman? Maybe so, but I don't think I'll be re-watching this movie that much because--and I admit it, I did go in with preconceptions-- I felt punched in the gut when it was over and I didn't get to hear the Fanfare, or the Superman march theme, or the romance theme. And yes, I know that sequels are forthcoming, but to see the mild-mannered reporter only at the very end, left me feeling a little empty too. A lot has been made about the seriousness with which Christopher Reeve took the role (even to the astonishment of the cast and crew). As an actor, somehow Reeve was able to separate the two consciousnesses, Clark Kent/Superman, resulting in a classic representation the metaphor I think is most important in the Superman mythos: that there is a wellspring of goodness in all of us (Singer carries this forth beautifully by making the James Marsden character not an antagonist, but someone who represents the potential for heroism in the common man. I think most screenwriters would have been tempted to make him an insufferable a-hole competing for Lois Lane's affections, kind of like Brad Wilson in Superman 3.). As an aside, this contrasts with Batman, who commonly represents the darkness that exists in all of us.

Regarding the shocking carnage in the film, it was thrilling to watch, but I wonder if the pontificating by the characters in the movie Clerks about the genocide of innocents when the Death Star was destroyed by Luke Skywalker is applicable here. That is, the good guys won, but at the cost of killing an enormous number of non-combatants. In Man of Steel, yes we're glad Superman wins, but he was probably responsible for the deaths of untold thousands of people. One thing the Christopher Reeve Superman had to contend with in Superman II is that he had to protect the people WHILE fighting the 3 Kryptonians. His regard for the lives of the people is what prompts him to leave the city so that the fight can take place elsewhere and won't endanger the lives of the people of Metropolis. (It's kind of heartbreaking that the people think Superman is abandoning them rather than protecting them).

C'mon though, who's going to believe that the reporter with the world's most distinctive jawline isn't the same as the Super Hero with the world's most distinctive jawline. Christopher Reeve thoroughly understood the dichotomy of Superman--that Clark Kent and Superman really are two separate consciousnesses-- and he could play that beautifully, uncannily even. Indeed, as I said, I think THAT--the dual nature of Christ and Man--is at the center of the Superman mythos, in the same way Superman and Clark Kent are at once both separate and the same, and the way humans have the potential to be both common and heroic. (And that Jesus Christ was both fully human and fully God).  Brandon Routh didn't understand it quite as well, and I'm skeptical that Henry Cavill is going to be able to pull it off. But hey, I could be wrong. I was one who liked the casting of Routh. He had a good ""look"" for Superman. I wish he could have continued in the role. Once again, the thing I think Man of Steel misses is that Superman is a kind of foil for Batman. While Batman explores the hidden darkness within us all, Superman, to me, has always represented the potential for courage, nobility, and goodness within us all. Although the movie is dark, and I'm glad that it is relatively free of wisecracks and stupid comic relief, the tone of the film seems to undercut the theme I just mentioned. Comments about the music can be added here too. The Williams theme was inspiring to the viewer (and it was the mandate upon Superman that he inspire the people of earth, not always fight their fights for them), and it was, well, quintessentially American sounding. (Superman has super powers because he is Kryptonian, but he gets his ""aw, shucks"" boy-scout moral values from his Middle-American upbringing). Hans Zimmer's score, while rich, reinforces the darkness of the film, and will never be one of those ""iconic"" scores.

Objectively: Spectacular action and a story that benefits from a prepackaged archetypal narrative. Good visual sense, and I like the cutting back and forth between the present and the past, similar to what Christopher Nolan did in Batman Begins. I like that the sedition of Zod and his group is more fleshed out on Krypton. However, the movie is missing that ""something special,"" and I'm not referring just to the music. I love the very brief Christopher Reeve cameo in Cavill's face. The film does seem to borrow an awful lot in the visuals--the Pandora-esque vision of Krypton; the repeated Matrix allusions. Oh, and has Jimmy Olsen been replaced by a Jenny Olsen? I can't exactly tell.
Subjectively: What can I say? I'm a child of the 80's. I feel like a little bit of me was ossified after watching the movie. The ongoing saga has taken a dramatic turn, and the old Superman has been laid to rest, and I mourn.

I do recommend the movie.

Man of Steel totally blew me away the first time I saw it.  Partly because of the seemingly endless action, but mostly because of the constant sense of reality to the movie.  It made Superman feel real and totally relatable.  The second time brought the same exact reaction.  It was a total thrill ride both times!

What shocked me the most (as well as any other hardcore Superman fan) was the ""controversial"" ending to the film.

SPOILER ALERT!!! IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE YET, PLEASE IGNORE THIS PART OF THE REVIEW!!!!!

At the end of the final battle between Superman & Zod, there was a moment where Zod tried to kill people with his heat vision.  Superman then has a tough decision to make.  What does he do?  He breaks Zod's neck.  This marks the 1st time Superman has ever KILLED one of his enemies.  I was completely awe-struck at first,  but afterwards I realized it made sense based on the very realistic world being presented in the movie.  Its in human nature to kill when the situation calls for it.  Based on that belief, I think Superman did the right thing by killing Zod, no matter what any other fanboys would say.

Overall, Man of Steel is the definitive Superman movie of all time.  Lots of action, shocking moments, and little pinches of humor here & there.  I highly recommend Man of Steel for any hardcore Superman fan",1384214400,5,1598,4.498257839721254
5783603,5,B00D91GRA4,"Best Superman to date.  Well unless you are considering works of writing but I am simply referring to TV / Movie adaptations.

Reasons?

1) Plenty of Action (Purposeful action as well).

2) Plenty of back-story (Just the right amount to give you an investment to the characters and an understanding if you have never heard of them.  Sometimes to much back-story can really start to drag and I believe the movie found a great balance).

3) Great use of timeline.  (The way Zach presents the movie is perfect.  He keeps the main plot of the movie moving along while interweaving the back-story along the way so one end of the movie is not dragging and other is only filled with action).

Anyone who rated this movie 1 star should remove themselves from the gene pool.  Sure the movie isn't a monumental accomplishment that will go down for eons to come.  Or maybe your expectations were extremely ridiculous (what a shocker in this day and age).  But the movie was damn well worth the money and then some.

I thought Henry Cavill did a good job as Supes, and I can't wait to see him again in Batman vs. Superman.
I thought the father-son moments between Pa Kent and Clark were ludicrous and so unlike Jonathan Kent as to be a parody of him. Jonathan's death was just horribly played out. I think that's when I lost interest.
I'm glad others enjoyed it, but try as I might, it just comes off as a ten year old's fantasy for a ""really cool"" Superman film. It's loud, obnoxious and just overdone in the action department. I sat through the final action scene hoping the next punch would be the last. It just needed to be edited and cut down.

Long Review:

Man of Steel continues the Nolan Batman tradition of combining both serious dramatic story-telling with spectacular action and suspense. Snyder and Nolan are trying to do for Superman what Batman Begins and The Dark Knight did for Batman. As a result, the bar is much higher than for most other comic book movies. Whereas Marvel's comic book films are much lighter and can get by on humor, charismatic leads, and spectacle, DC has opted for much weightier story-telling, grounding its characters in a world that feels more like our own. This is not to knock Marvel as I think their cinematic universe is a lot of fun. Still, I am glad to see that DC is not trying to just copy their formula, and instead they are attempting a more mature and dark tone. Variety is the spice of life and I can appreciate both styles for what they are.

The script is quite good though far from perfect. At a high level I think the story arc was solid. We see Superman's origin and a very well fleshed-out Krypton. Zod was really well-written and acted too. He was a complete person and not just a villain. There are some details I didn't care for, but they are mostly nitpicks. Though I am glad they got away from the bumbling and goofy Clark Kent, I wish they had done more to make his secret identity seem secure (it is implausible that the government does not know who Superman is at the end of the film) and explain why the glasses work as a disguise (just to shut up that complaint for good). There are other details of the film's second act that I wish were different, particularly the destruction of Metropolis and the fight with Zod. One thing I liked about Superman Returns is that there was an emphasis on showing Superman saving humans. He wasn't an action hero - he was a guardian angel. Man of Steel could have used some of that. The destruction was a bit excessive given the light note the film tried to end on and I think the fight with Zod would have been improved had Superman been saving people (bracing collapsing buildings, containing explosions, etc.) throughout. These issues certainly don't ruin the film, though I see them as missed opportunities.

The story is not for everyone. Man of Steel does not pander nearly as much as Superman Returns, nor is it apologetic about its subject matter and theme. There is a lot of death and destruction and while I sympathize with people who wanted more levity and inspiration, I think the horror of the struggle with Zod is important to the film's theme. The Avengers featured a comparable amount of destruction but the film's tone muted our sense of tragedy as characters were too busy making jokes and smashing Loki around. Man of Steel does not shy away from the implications of powerful villains bent on terrorizing us (much like the Nolan Batman films). That kind of pathos is not what everyone wants from a comic book movie, but for me, it makes it all the more unforgettable. While the Avengers was a fun popcorn movie, Man of Steel was both exciting and haunting. Its story will stay with me much longer.

Man of Steel is, I believe, just the reinvention Superman needed, as the film is both gripping Sci-Fi and an excellent character piece on an exceptional individual. It is exceptionally directed and acted with the best effects I've ever seen in a comic book movie. It's production value is spectacular as is the art style and photography. Every moment has an epic feel and look. Put simply, Man of Steel is superb.

It is both the Superman movie we deserve and the one we need right now.",1384214400,10,3783,4.580502215657312

I must say that Henry Cavill is the first Superman that did not need a breastplate-LOL. I could not believe my eyes when I saw him without a shirt.
This version seems to be directed towards a more mature audience (minimal explosions, crashes etc.) , which I greatly appreciated.
Although towards the end, I felt it was slipping off into the wackiness with the length of the fight scenes and the number of buildings demolished while the folks remained intact, still I enjoyed it and look forward to watching the bonus features. I would recommend it, especially if you are inclined to watch in the comfort of your home.

5783609,1,B00D91GRA4,"Please note: *Spoilers* are needed to accurately review this movie. The biggest issue with this movie is that, at heart, it is not a Superman movie. It's a passable action film, though bloated in length (Mr. Snyder badly needs a film editor) and rife with plot holes. The solution to every problem is punch stuff, punch bigger stuff, punch the biggest stuff and then if there are any survivors left drop a building on them.

This doesn't make it a bad -action- film. It does however make it a bad SUPERMAN film. Superman is larger then any actor or portrayal of him. He is an ideal. A hero rivaled perhaps only by Captain America in his view of good and evil and part of this is that the good guy must NEVER sink to the level of the bad. Superman is not grey. Batman has grey areas. Wolverine has grey. Superman does not. He does not allow others to come to death because of his inaction no matter the consequences to himself because that is what a -true- hero does. He does not take life because that is the action of a villain. Even Batman wasn't compelled to take the Joker's life in the greatest superhero movie ever made (The Dark Knight) but here in the first film in which Zack Snyder helms the greatest superhero our culture has produced Superman snaps a neck, takes the villain's life and also invalidates this completely as a Superman movie. This is not Superman. This movie is 'Alien Punch-Man undergoes pathos and wrecks s***.'

Superheroes rise in print and media when the world needs them.  With the way things are, the world needs to see a Superman right now.

I was hoping for a strong sequel to 'SR', but instead got some guy in scale mail armor in a grim, grey, depressing Batman movie.  The beginning on Krypton was interesting, but it really went downhill from there-- Zod's face is like a plastic mask of caricatured anger with bad dentures that make him mushmouthed, they made Lois even more bland than in SR (and her interaction with Superman is very different than any other version I'm aware of), and I just didn't think Superman was an interesting character-- he was too human for my taste.  If this guy is so super, then why is it such a dilemma for him to figure out how to operate covertly?  I'm also seriously getting sick of this trend of 'color backlash' which now afflicts almost all superheroes on film, and I don't see why the Man of Steel would need what appears to be scale-mail armor.

5783616,5,B00D91GRA4,"**This review covers both the movie and the actual Man of Steel Collector's Edition Bluray Combo Pack. If you are only interested in my review of the actual Man of Steel Collector's Edition Combo Pack and not the movie itself, you can skip to the bottom.**

Personally, I can't stand critics. Screw 'em! If you are a fan of movies, you owe it to yourself to see Man of Steel!

Granted I am a huge fan of Superman, but Man of Steel may very well be the best movie I have ever seen! Considering movies like Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"", Peter Jackson's third installment in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, ""Return of the King"" and Whedon's ""The Avengers"" top that list, that's saying a ton! As you can likely tell, I'm an enormous fan of the action/sci-fi/fantasy genre, so your mileage may vary (meaning if those movies don't strike your fancy, you may want to look elsewhere).

What Zack Snyder has done with this film is ""genius""! This is such a grand movie, yet nothing feels forced or exaggerated. Everything is given to you in exactly the right dosage. You aren't force-fed action like in other summer blockbusters. In Man of Steel, the action feels natural as if it is part of a story being told. Imagine that!

The origin story is there, but it isn't too much that it bores you to tears and Snyder goes about it all in precisely the right manner - through flashbacks. This way, you get the gist of how Clark came to be the man he is, without the movie needing to be longer than it has to.

All the actors/actresses do a fantastic job in their particular roles and help the movie to do what it is supposed to do: tell a story. While I'm still adjusting to a fair-haired Amy Adams in the role of Lois Lane, I can say that I left the theater content with her performance. She really grew on me by the time it was all said and done. However, both Michael Shannon as Zod and Russell Crowe as Jor-El were very much spot on for me. I was extremely happy with both performances in their respective roles.

Growing up as a huge Smallville fan, I was convinced that nobody could do the role of Clark justice after Tom Welling. While Brandon Routh fit the role physically in Superman Returns, he was just too stiff and too much of a Christopher Reeves knockoff to leave me satisfied. I'm not saying Reeves was bad in the role (quite the contrary), I just would have preferred it if Routh had brought something he could call his own to the role.

That's where Henry Cavill comes in! The best way I can put his performance is this - he owned the role!

You know how it goes. Often times you've seen an actor or actress cast in an iconic role, only to be dissatisfied with the choice after seeing the movie (or perhaps before and after). With Henry Cavill, I can say this, ""Henry Cavill is Superman!""

The whole time while watching the Man of Steel, I felt as if Cavill was truly an outsider from another planet. And, I mean that in the highest regard! Movies are often about the suspension of disbelief and we as moviegoers sometimes need a little push in the right direction. Cavill's performance did that for me. The fact that the guy looks like he trained day and night nonstop, tells you all you need to know about his dedication to the role. Kudos Henry!

The special effects didn't hurt either. As far as cutting-edge special effects go, this movie has it in spades! By far the best special effects I've seen in any movie to date...hands down! Better than Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Pirates of the Caribbean, Matrix, Avatar or any of the Marvel movies, including The Avengers! Words cannot describe them, particularly the Metropolis battle scene! Truly epic!

Speaking of battles, the fight between Supes and two notorious Kryptonians (formerly seen in another of the Big Blue Boyscout's movies) was in essence, borderline orgasmic!

That battle seen alone was worth the price of the movie's admission!...And Man of Steel still had plenty left in reserve.

Let's face it; we don't go to movies about comic book heroes to be bored to death by dialogue. We want action and suspense to go along with a good, relatively fast-paced story. In Man of Steel you get that!

It currently is and will be by summer's end, the biggest and best movie you will see this summer. Mark my words!

Do yourself a favor and don't walk, run faster than a speeding bullet to see this movie! I promise you, you will not leave disappointed! If you do, then you're either dead or worse, a critic! ""Gasp!""

As for the actual product itself, the Man of Steel Collector's Edition Combo Pack: I'm going to keep this short and sweet! Unless you are a diehard Superman fan and look to collect all things Superman, do yourself a favor and save your money. This product though somewhat (albeit barely) cool, isn't nearly as wonderful as I had hoped. :(

Yes, it has all the film related media including both 3D and 2D versions of the film; however, the metal ""S"" glyph is actually a tin container identical to those that used to carry your lunch around as a kid and nothing more. I was expecting something a bit more ""solid"" and not a ""lunch box"" made to hold the movie discs, etc.

Had this not been The Man of Steel or had I not been a huge Superman fan, and had I not purchased this product at its cheapest price point offered here on Amazon (which just so happened to be less than $10 over the cost of the regular combo pack), I would be promptly sending this item back for a refund. There's a snowball's chance in Hell that I'd pay anything above $40 for this and certainly not the $50 plus asking price Amazon originally had this listed for.

So in summary, keep in mind when purchasing this product that it's nothing more than a ""S""-shaped lunch box containing the Bluray materials inside that sit atop a plastic stand. It is NOT as nice as one might expect by looking at the picture alone, that's advertised here.

However, once again, the movie itself is fantastic and highly recommended, but you are probably better off saving your money and simply purchasing the regular Man of Steel Combo Pack.",1384214400,13,6075,4.474683544303797

I actually loved the first movie and thought it was well done but this new movie successfully has carved out it's own niche.  The first go at Superman had a lot of humor in it but this film takes a much more dramatic approach.  The special effects were dazzling with the final battle scene between Zod's forces and Superman seems so realistic.

I highly recommend you watching this movie and if you buy films worthy of adding to your film collection then hurry to your store and buy it!",1384214400,5,626,4.464912280701754
5783618,4,B00D91GRA4,"Everyone knows the Superman story - it's one that's seemingly burned into the subconscious from birth. So clearly and definitively rendered was this comic tale in Christopher Reeve's 1978 blockbuster that the last filmmaker to tackle the character (X-Men's Bryan Singer) lifted its iconography wholesale for 2006 misfire Superman Returns.

That film was hamstrung by nostalgia and left audiences nonplussed, so the latest big-screen version is understandably a clean break from the past with Dark Knight duo Christopher Nolan and David S Goyer hatching a story to re-invent DC Comics' flagship hero.

Man of Steel begins on Krypton as Lara (Ayelet Zurer) and Jor-El (Russell Crowe) welcome the planet's first natural birth in centuries. Their people, once ambitious intergalactic explorers, genetically engineer newborns to serve in pre-determined roles. With the planet's natural resources exhausted and Krypton in its final days, Jor-El rockets his son to safety as military leader General Zod (Michael Shannon) stages a last-minute coup with designs on purifying the race and starting over. He's banished to the Phantom Zone, but only after vowing to find Kal-El.

Director Zack Snyder then makes a daring cut from Kal's plummeting rocket to a fishing trawler carrying a bearded Clark Kent (Henry Cavill), wandering the globe looking to help those in need. In a neat structural trick similar to the one employed in Batman Begins, we flash back to see a younger Clark struggling through adolescence due to his nascent superpowers. In the present day, a spaceship buried deep in the Arctic Circle points Clark in the direction of his destiny, while also putting him on a collision course with a Zod hellbent on resurrecting his obliterated home world.

Whereas previous films have used Lois Lane (here gamely played by Amy Adams) as a key emotional crutch for Superman, here the emphasis is on fathers and sons, the push-pull between Kryptonian and human heritage and Clark's desire for belonging and acceptance.

Screenwriter Goyer cleverly plays out this thematic thread between Clark, the Kents and Jor-El ('alive' as an echo of his preserved consciousness), while also keeping it a key component to Zod's masterplan (and thus a way to conjure up jaw-dropping spectacle).

Snyder's instincts as an action director quickly come to the fore as he marshals skirmishes on Krypton, a huge-scale battle in Smallville and a Metropolis smack-about that sends Superman and Zod careening through skyscrapers. With the latest digital tools at its disposal, Man of Steel is easily the most exhilarating and arresting interpretation of Superman yet. When Cavill's predecessors took flight it all seemed so leisurely. Here, his lift-offs are positively supersonic.

The Brit actor cuts an impressive figure both in and out of the red and blue. He tackles the role without a trace of irony, meaning he's in keeping with the straight-arrow seriousness of the film but perhaps lacking the immediate charm of Reeve's Superman. When it comes to sheer physicality, though, he's far more dynamic and intimidating than any of his predecessors. Snyder and co have gone to great lengths to ditch the boy scout label.

Man of Steel's supporting players, a veritable who's who of A-list talent, are all excellent in their limited screen time. Daily Planet chief Perry White (Laurence Fishburne) acts as a nice counterweight to Lois's early eagerness to expose Clark's anonymous do-goodery, while Shannon is chilling in his dogged commitment to duty.

Costner and Crowe both crucially find emotional poignancy as the guiding lights who help Clark on his way to greatness. They're helped in part by a great score by Hans Zimmer, who hits upon a motif that can be tinkled quietly on the piano or blasted out by an orchestra.

Impressive as all this is, Man of Steel is not quite the perfect movie. Snyder's deployment of handheld camerawork works to create an intimacy between viewer and action, but this aesthetic jars horrendously with the 3D conversion (see in 2D if you can). Character loses focus in favor of action in the final third and there are also shades of Clark's character that go unexplored (for instance his split identity and deeper relationship with Lois). These threads are left tantalisingly open for a sequel, though. The foundations are firmly in place for what could be exciting further adventures of Superman.",1384214400,7,4408,5.187060478199719

5783621,1,B00D91GRA4,"Note: I am rating ONLY the Digital Copy.

When I order a combo pack, I expect to receive a Blu Ray, a DVD, and a digital copy that is usable. For 99% of us, that means an iTunes code, so the digital copy of the movie that we purchase is stored with the other movies we've paid for.

Here, the consumer is provided only with some bizarre UltraViolet / Flixter code, which not only requires you to sign up for two separate accounts, but also requires precludes the consumer from using the digital copy of the movie in any reasonable manner.

DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO CONVENIENTLY USE THE DIGITAL COPY ON YOUR iPAD or iPHONE; IT IS COMPLETELY INCOMPATIBLE WITH iTUNES.

UltraViolet/Flixter is a scam. Shame on you, Warner Brothers.

EDIT (11/13/2013 at 10:03am EST): I want to clarify the whole ""not being available on iTunes doesn't make something worthless"" series of comments.

To be clear, this isn't my primary concern or complaint. For personal reasons, I want access to this movie on iTines because I've built a legitimate iTunes movie library and have invested in AppleTVs and other Apple stuff on which to enjoy my library. Because of the artificial limitation in digital content imposed by Warner Brothers, I can't watch this movie that way. This movie isn't part of my organized library, and as this fragmentation continues, instead of going to one place (iTunes) to enjoy the movies I've *purchased*, I'll have to remember which proprietary service has which movie. I don't want to have to remember that. When I buy a movie, I don't want to be told how/when/where to watch it. I don't care about whether or not UV is easier, better, or whether I'm a total Apple fan-boy or not (I totally am). The flaws and defects in iTunes are a discussion for a different time.

I'm just so incredibly sick of bring manipulated and disrespected by companies like Warner Brothers. I bought this movie, with real money. Why shouldn't I be able to watch it wherever and however I want? I spent years and many dollars dealing with format wars (Beta v. VHS; HD-DVD v. BluRay; BluRay v. 3D), buying new editions, buying extended editions, buying platinum editions, and the like, and after all of that, I'm then told I'm a criminal if I rip a digital copies of a DVD's that I purchased for my own use. Now, even when I spend good money to purchase a movie legitimately, I am artificially limited to a ""new, special service(!)"" like UV. It's aggravating to spend good money on a movie that I can't watch the way I want to watch. They don't offer an iTunes digital code... Even if I paid extra. Why? Who knows, but the answer likely has NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do with bettering my experience as a consumer.

I don't want to be steered to creating a second, separate digital movie library, and then a third, and a fourth, and a fifth, etc... when *they* decide that UV is no longer profitable enough. I don't need a different service because I'm happy with my iTunes library. But it doesn't matter that I like iTunes. What matters is that I have purchased a movie and I shouldn't be limited in the manner in which I enjoy the movie that I've just purchased.

What I'm mostly trying to say here is that as consumers, we need to be shown a little more respect when we spend our money.",1384214400,111,3285,4.535472972972973
5783622,4,B00D91GRA4,"To start off i grew up on superman and loved his comics even more. The movie was fantastic maybe some of the fight scenes went a little to long but they were still very good. It keeps true to the superman orgins and gives it a little bit more darkness to the story. cavil plays a great superman(i'm still more into Reeves but cavil rocked too.) michael Shanon was a very good and very dark Zod and thought he played the role to a tee. I felt every one did a great job except maybe amy adams as lois. i have nothing agianst adams and most of the time enjoy her acting but she just didn't sell me on the lois lane role. but i'm sure others might disagree.

Now about the 3D. I have written a lot of 3d reviews and i do love that style. man of steel however is what most would call a mixed bag. now to all those who saw man of steel in the theater like myself probably came out thinking this was a lackluster 3d movie and i 100% agree with them. However the 3d blu ray release has gone pardon the pun ""leaps and bounds"" better than the theater 3d experirence. It is still kind of lack luster comopared to how it could have been. The depth is way better on 3d blu ray and there are about 5-8 pop outs i can remeber and most happen pretty quickly. The only thing that makes me sad on the 3d area is that with the story,lay out and with all the cgi they used they could have made a big time 3d experince that would have made avatar look like amauter hour. But the kept the 3d in the reserve area. so in other words, did they use 3d in the movie and have it shown..Yes is it as good as it could have been...far from.

The movie is a 4.5/5

the audio is a 5/5

the 3d is a 3.75/5 to a 4/5

Overall a great movie. fans of the dark knight series/superman or comics in general will probably like the movie. I gave it 4 stars cause everything was there for me to like except i wish they would have pushed the 3d a bit more cuase they could have the 3d in this movie go from average to one of the best 3d experinces you could bring home. either way it is a great movie and i highly recommend it.",1384214400,8,2082,3.947619047619048
5783623,5,B00D91GRA4,"I admit to being a bit of an addict when it comes to user reviews on Amazon. While movie critics often rehash the same old cliches and viewpoints filtered through the pseudo-sophisticated lens of reminding everyone that this is a ""comic book movie"", user reviews can get deeper and more interested in the guts of these films and generally treat them with far greater reverence. Why the need to mention this? Simply, ""Man Of Steel"" has to be the most dissected film since ""Watchmen"" (interesting that both are Zack Snyder films). I cannot remember many other films that have such polarizing responses to them.

When it comes to the comic book versions of Superman, I am still scratching the surface. When I visit either the comic shop or Barnes & Noble, it's generally Batman that dominates the shelves. Couple this with Superman being the type of character he has been over the years, the shade of each story arc can vary greatly. While something like ""Earth One"" gets to the true essence of the character, there also exists a version where Superman is wearing an apron and doing housework. Overall, the Superman that everyone knows and loves can be quite different.

As for the film itself, this is handily my favorite of any live action version of Superman. To me, this is an adult take on the Man Of Steel while still being available for viewing to the kids who are now growing to admire Superman. This reboot is about a stranger in a strange land who is trying to understand how and why he has powers that his peers do not. The entre crux of the story felt like Clark Kent's journey inward to make sense of the person he is on the outside. And like any comic book film worth its weight, it has more than one iconic moment that, if you felt as I did, will leave you with chills.

Much has been made of the spectacle that takes place in Act 3 and while I believe some of it to be valid and interesting in it's way, a good amount of it can be thought of us a reimagining of the downtown fight scene of Superman 2 fully realized. When you consider two men who can lift a car over their head with one hand, the idea of them crashing through a building makes more sense. For my money, it felt massive and enjoyable.

I have been anxiously awaiting the chance to view ""Man Of Steel"" again. Second viewings can sometimes shatter the pedestal of fresh eyes, but it can also cement the esteem you felt the first time. I am betting on the latter.",1384214400,9,2439,4.425389755011136

This movie scores a perfect 5 out of 5 or 10 out of 10. It doesn't matter what scale you're using.  I'm one of the toughest movie critics I know and my friends often discount my movie reviews because I'm constantly giving movies low scores (and deservedly so).  I couldn't find a fault with this movie even when I tried. It's the perfect blend of action and story line and plot.  Zach Snyder does a great job with this reboot of giving viewers the best view of what Kryton looks like and how it was before the planet blew up.  Just to give you measure of my movie rating scale, I rate Bourne Ultimatum & The Shawshank Redemption 10 out of 10.

 Henry Cavill is an excellent actor and play the perfect superman in this movie.  His depiction of Clark Kent/Superman rivals what Christian Bale did for the reboot of the Dark Knight trilogy.  He really bulked up from when I last remember him in 300 where he had more of a cut-up build.  He lends real credibility to Clark Kents vulnerable insecure side to his powers living amount humans and you can see the confidence builds as he finds himself as Superman.

The entire flow of the movie is excellent from start to finish. There's no boring moments or lags in this movie.  I love how they really showed Kryton in this movie and how the planet looked and how the society was.  Michael Shannon plays a great villain in General Zod in the movie. The acting doesn't get much better than this.  Amy Adams playing Lois Lane was the only weak link in the acting dept but she played the role just okay.  The action in this movie is some of the best done action fight sequences I've seen.

5783634,5,B00D91GRA4,"Okay I didn't get to see this in the theaters and I'm completely kicking myself in the butt that I didn't. I did however pick up this Blu Ray/DVD/Digital Download set from WallyWorld and I was able to get the SteelBook edition. Very nice presentation I must say, but lets get to the film. It's beautiful...gut wrenching...up lifting...and by far the best Superman movie to date, EVER. Now before all the Chris Reeves fans start burning ""S"" into my lawn...I'm not saying the original Superman movie was bad...it wasn't it was a masterpiece for it's time (and yes I saw it in the movie theaters as a wide eyed 9 year old)...but being true to the character this one is better hands down. So no flying around the world backwards to go back in time...BTW...if thats the case why didn't he just keep doing that and go back before Lex ever got the nukes in the first place?? Anyway...on to the MAN OF STEEL...The acting is incredible....Russell Crowe as Jor-El was amazing and Costner as Pa Kent...there is a scene with a tornado and without giving anything away it literally brought tears to my eyes. Henry Cavill plays the part of Superman/Clark with such conviction it never seems corny or cartoonish...and he truly makes you care about him and his story. Amy Adams is brilliant as Lois and plays the part as a leading lady not the damsel in distress who is in the need of being saved every 5 minutes. Although she does get saved a couple of times, but she comes off more as Superman's partner not his Achilles Heel. Michael Shannon as Zod was perfect...he pulls off the part threatening not only the father but the son with charisma and evil that bleeds into the screen. I'm a comic book nut and have been since I was 5...I've seen every hit and miss Hollywood has put out. To me this is one of the top 3 comic book movies ever made. Zack Snyder is a pure genius when it comes to comic book movies because his Watchmen film is my #2 out of those top 3 films. I think Warner should hand over the DC Stable to Zack and just let him run wild, because you can tell he loves these characters as much as we do. He grew up with them and that affection he feels comes through every minute of this film. I've read the reviews and heard the complaints and I honestly feel these people couldn't be watching the same film. I even saw the review where some one states the Supes and Zod battle can never compare to Superman II....Really? No honestly...do you remember the scene where Superman throws a cellophane ""S"" off his chest? That's high drama? Even as a kid when I saw that..I screamed it was a cheat...show me one comic where he threw Easter Basket cellophane at anyone. It was borderline stupid and insulting even to kids the film was aimed at. This Zod battle defines both characters...and was very well done. The destruction of the city and the size and scope are felt on all levels. This was an epic battle where only one could stand...and even the city lay victim. If you are on the fence...rent it buy it but do yourself a favor and at least see it. You won't feel like you wasted your time....you will be surprised how engrossed you become and the 2:20 run time will fly by faster then a speeding bullet. You'll find yourself wanting to watch it again and looking forward to the next time we see this Superman appear again. Thanks for your time. Take Care ~ Jase",1384214400,3,3360,4.429725363489499

On a similar token Henry Cavill, Russell Crowe, Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are all accomplished actors and actresses in their own right, and they helped to breathe new life into the mythos of Superman. I honestly do not care what critics have written about this film. I believe Nolan did a great job showing the audience the humanity of Superman and why he would sacrifice anything to save earth, no matter how much pain it caused him.

I will say this to the fans that cry ""Superman doesn't kill.""  I am not very versed in the loooooong history of the comics so I can't comment who he has or hasn't killed during that run.  But at the end of Superman 2 The Movie, Superman kills Zod.  Don't believe me, watch this clip and fast forward to 3:50:  [...]

Up to that point, all he had done was save a few lives.  Battling supervillains hadn't even crossed his mind yet.  Hell, he had just learned to fly and shoot lasers from his eyes.

5783644,5,B00D91GRA4,"There have been numerous opinions about positive and negative points dealing with this film. No movie will ever be perfect and please everyone but I have to applaud Zack Schneider for giving us a new vision of Superman never seen on screen before. When 'Superman Returns' came out in 2006 most fanboys were screaming about having no action in the film. ""Superman didn't even throw a punch"" was a common critique. Well, WB heard their complaints and made a 180 degree turnaround. As far as I'm concerned, they went from one extreme to the other. I've described this film to others as a rollercoaster ride that rarely stops. It's shocking how much is thrown at you during the course of this story.
You will not see a Clark Kent with perfect parents who bake apple pies and have the perfect answers for any questions Clark has. You will not see a completely happy childhood where little Clark has no real cares and worries until his father dies. You will not find a Superman who has all of the answers of exactly what he needs to do to solve a problem. This is a movie where Clark is uncertain who he is and doesn't necessarily want to have his powers and abilities that set him apart from everyone else causing him to be a target by others. He learns how to control his anger with people he would be able to turn into a pretzel if he wanted to. He does not know how to deal with another kryptonian named Zod who wishes to rule planet earth. He just knows he needs to stop him from this alien invasion.
There are a few scenes that I believe were inspired partially from the Avengers. When Superman is handcuffed and marched into custody it is almost exactly the kind of shot used when Loki was marched to his cell in the Avengers. Near the end of the film there is an invasion that also takes me back to be Avengers inspired. Is that bad? I would say no. Zack Schneider had a tremendous undertaking to take a hero who was losing interest to Batman and give him a huge comeback while also setting up a DC universe of films at the same time.
There were big changes made to Superman's origin story. There are changes in how his father dies. His fortress of solitude is very different than what you imagine in any other Superman film before it. But none of these things take away from the identity of the character of Superman. Only people like me who grew up with the Reeve version may try to compare films like this.
Of course, there is an extremely controversial ending. If you don't know what I mean, this is a SPOILER ALERT.... Superman makes the ultimate life or death decision to either allow Zod to continue his mission of death to all humans or stop him. In one pivotal scene he makes the quick decision to break Zod's neck rather than allow him to do any more killing and destruction. Some people were screaming how Superman doesn't kill. They need to realize that Superman has killed before. For goodness sakes, he fought and killed Doomsday in the comics. In Superman II he allows the three Kryptonian villains to fall to their death. In Schneider's world Superman doesn't have the hard and fast rule that you NEVER take a life. He made this decision based on the basis of a killer who cannot be killed. And now he will live with it for the rest of his life. For this Superman, it probably is the origin of the no-kill rule. It's going to be interesting to find out how they deal with this in the next installment.
I loved the casting. Russell Crow is a wonderful Jor El. There are also ties to other Superman shows. Diane Lane was in ""Hollywoodland"" where she played the girlfriend of George Reeves, the actor who portrayed Superman in the 1950s. By the way, I also was very excited to find out Ben Affleck will be Batman in the sequel because he played George Reeves in the previously mentioned movie and donned a Superman costume. Lois Lane Amy Adams was in the first season of Smallville. For me it was just fun to watch these characters who had a Superman connection previously.
Was it a perfect film? No. Name one film that is. But it does do justice to the world's first Superhero and tried to find a balance between the darkness of Batman and the opposite brightness of Superman. This movie is not a bright one like the previous films. It is shot in a grittier fashion. For those seeking a Superman film with bright scenes and beautiful colors, you won't find it here. Go back to the Reeve films. But Superman is finally given a story that many fans have been waiting a very long time to see. I think it's a very well done film and I hope you do too. Superman flies high and seems to relate to what happens in today's world. I enjoyed it and am looking forward to the sequel in 2015.",1384128000,4,4696,4.398850574712644
5783645,5,B00D91GRA4,"Simply put: Man of Steel was freaking awesome. I have been waiting for this type of Superman movie for longer than I can remember.  The original Superman movie was a good flick for its time, and Christopher Reeves did a masterful job of making us believe Superman could hide his identity behind the faade of a bumbling Clark Kent. But I'm not ashamed to admit I am from a generation that loves spectacular action and special effects, and I have been craving a Superman movie that really taps into the modern day potential of movie magic, with an equally engaging storyline and characters. Man of Steel delivers in spades.

I don't give this praise lightly. I had serious reservations and doubts about this movie going into the theater. The bitter taste of Superman Returns was still fresh in my memory. I know the critics have been espousing that the former movie was better than people gave it credit for, that it actually got better reviews, etc.  Maybe Superman Returns wasn't a bad movie, but it certainly wasn't a good movie either. At best it was a ""blah"" movie, and for a Superman movie that just won't cut it. Superman never even throws a punch in the movie. In fact he gets his ass kicked by a couple of thugs while under the influence of kryptonite. In fact the biggest ""super"" feat in the movie was lifting a big rock, incongruously while under the influence of the same kryptonite that allowed the thugs to beat him nearly to death. In contrast, Man of Steel has some serious throwdowns with other Kryptonians. Even the super lifting feat included in this movie, holding up a collapsing oil rig tower, is a heck of a lot cooler than slowly lifting a big rock into space.

My reservations about Man of Steel continued in the early days of the production as news trickled out. Nolan and Goyer became involved, and though they did a spectacular job with the first two installments of their Batman series, I was skeptical about their suitability for the Superman franchise. How would their dedication to ultra-realism translate to a story about a man who can bench press mountains and fly through space? Furthermore, in my opinion the last installment of their take on the Batman mythos strayed way off course, compounding my doubts. We soon learned that Zod would be the major antagonist of the new movie, and while I was encouraged that Superman would have a real superhuman opponent, I feared we would get another poor copy of the original movies, just as Superman Returns came across as a poorly plagiarized version of the original. The earliest trailers for the new movie didn't help either. They seemed to suggest a long drawn out discovery process, devoid of the Superman action sequences I was craving. The most exciting thing they showed in the original trailer was Superman flying. We've been there, done that.

Subsequent trailers offered more promise, though they still didn't show a lot. I guess they were using the old trick of the strip tease, show us just enough to get us interested. In hindsight I'm glad they didn't show or reveal more, because every moment of the movie was a treat, unspoiled by over divulging trailers prior to release. I often despair when I have to sit through another origin story for these comic books icons that I know so well. I'm anxious to get to the good stuff. But Man of Steel managed to make the new origins fresh and interesting, and extremely relevant to the overall story.

And holy crap did they nail the casting of the new Superman. Henry Cavill's Superman makes previous movie renditions of the character look like guys playing Halloween dress-up. This guy looks like he could bend steel, even without the movie magic. The acting was solid all the way around. Superman came across as caring, complicated, and heroic. Lois Lane was likable, smart, and had a real adventurous spirit, and loads of integrity. You could easily see why Superman would fall for this mortal woman. Contrast that with super-bitchy Lois from Superman Returns. Is it any wonder he decided to leave the planet for five years?

Some critics have argued that this Superman is too violent and not true to the character. These people obviously don't know much about the character. Most of Superman's stories (comic books, animated series, original Superman movies) involve violent conflicts with other superhuman opponents. Do they really think we want another movie where Superman battles the elements and catches falling airplanes.

So to summarize, why is Man of Steel the best superman movie ever:

  1. Awesome action that makes great use of the environment (smashing buildings to pieces, mega explosions).
  2. Intense superhuman versus superhuman combat (can you say using a train as a weapon -  gives new meaning to more powerful than a locomotive).
  3. A villain with a goal that makes sense (unlike Lex Luthor from Superman Returns, who thought an ugly chunk of black crystal/rock would make for prime real estate).
  4. A Superman that looks the part (I am very much a straight man - but even I had to think DAMN when I saw Henry Cavill as Superman, and sans shirt in a particular scene).
  5. A Superman who embraces his role as humanity's protector (I loved Smallville, but Clark's crying about being different could be tiresome in the early seasons - come on you can run faster than the speed of sound and juggle tractors - yeah, sucks to be you. Not to mention being able to see into the girl's locker room).
  6. Lois Lane is no dummy (A pair of glasses were never going to fool this girl).
  7. No more camp (Man of Steel has it's humorous moments, without resorting to the type of campy antics that were pervasive throughout Superman Returns).

In summary, Man of Steel is the Superman movie I have been waiting for since I first fell in love with the character. I can't wait to see where they take us next.",1384128000,4,5858,4.719607843137255
5783646,5,B00D91GRA4,"I almost never write a review about a DVD/Blu-ray that haven't come out yet and it comes out officially tomorrow and I will get it.
It's one of the few blockbusters that came out this past summer that I've been waiting to pick up, Man Of Steel is not a perfect film but I think it is the Superman we all finally deserve.
If you truly want the 'comic book' version of the character watch Superman The Movie with Christopher Reeve that movie in my opinion will never be surpassed for classic Superman but Reeve isn't with us anymore and the silver screen needs a current Superman. I love the Nolan Batman films and as I think most people will agree Superman Returns was a fun but very weak attempt to recreate the Reeve years.
Kevin Spacey is an amazing actor but completely wasted in that film because all he did was ape Gene Hackman's portrayal when he could have been saved for this franchise and been the most menacing Luthor ever.
Man Of Steel to me is the perfect flipside of the coin to Batman Begins, while Batman is an intellectual and uses mostly his brain Superman is the brawn and while the Dark Knight Trilogy is mostly a drama Man Of Steel is mostly an action film.
I love THIS Superman and Cavill is perfectly cast as is Amy Adams, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane and the rest... THIS is the Superman we finally deserve.
The only thing to ruin it is the casting of Ben Affleck as Batman in the forthcoming sequel ... Christian Bale really should be back in the cape & cowl again for Man Of Steel or whatever it is called.
But this Man Of Steel it seems is already going to be another stand alone movie because I'm certainly not interested in seeing Ben Affleck as Batman in the sequel... it really is a pity because Man Of Steel complimented Batman Begins so well, just as Batman and Superman should be: opposite sides of the same coin.
Light and dark, day and night, hope and obsession...
I was so happy when I saw MOS steel in the cinema and saw it 5 times, it's not my favorite action film or even comic book movie but I agree with another reviewer on here that has said people can't seem to make up their mind what they want in a Superman film.
It will never be Christopher Reeve again, and they already tried that and failed with Superman Returns. I loved MOS because it was a reinvention of the cinematic version of the character exactly the same that Batman Begins was a reinvention of Batman and both work wonderfully.
Man Of Steel was also more than just a new Superman movie, I'm not religious but the allegory to Christ was unmistakable giving the story layers and comparing Superman/Clark Kent to Jesus Chris has been in the comics for decades...
Also, and no one else seems to see this besides Man Of Steel being a great Superman film it is also in its own right the best science fiction movie I've seen in a very long time.
If you watch The Day The Earth Stood Still, MOS has many themes very similar to that classic of science fiction. The outsider/alien who tries to save humanity because although he will never truly be a part of it connects with a few individuals who show him that humankind are worth preserving.
The invasion of earth and the uncaring tidal force that threatens humanity, and I'm talking the original classic TDTESS not the Keanue Reeves terrible remake movie.
Lois in Man Of Steel is like the mother in TDTESS and Kal-El is Kaatu while te Kryptonians and especially Zod of course are akin to Gort... there are so many layers to Man Of Steel that make more than simply an ""action movie"" or a ""superhero"" movie that blows Superman Returns out of the park.
The journey of Kal-El from childhood to adulthood, the Christ allegory, in many ways a much better remake of The Day The Earth Stood Still.
This is an intelligent, remarkable, entertaining film filled with action, romance, comedy, wit and even tragedy when Kal-El is forced to decide between his own people who he has sought his entire life and the human race.
Do not underestimate MAN OF STEEl, it is a movie worth watching many times over because of all those reasons and more.
I do love how Lois and Clarks relationship is subtle, these characters are just meeting for the first time. They don't have time to fall in love yet but they are attracted to each other...
Give MAN OF STEEL a chance, it's just a terrible shame that WB and Chris Nolan and Zack Snyder aren't doing everything humanly possible to get Christian Bale to come back for MAN OF STEEL II.",1384128000,4,4458,4.444444444444445

5783648,5,B00D91GRA4,"I'm surprised any movie could live up to the hype this one had, but in my view, if not 43% of the critics, Man of Steel did it. Critics are complaining for the exact reason I love it. Unlike lighter toned, past films, this story was pretty serious almost from beginning to end, realistically reacting to grave dangers on both Krypton and Earth. It also takes a more realistic (PG13) approach to the death and destruction caused when opposing, massively powered Kryptonians wage war among us puny humans. Mankind is completely powerless in the epic scale of this threat and only Superman stands between us and annihilation. I'm guessing about 45 minutes of the movie was filled with action and apparently that was too much for some critics. Considering the quality of the origin story and the lead up, it felt appropriate to me. $250 million buys some of the best special effects I've seen, a perfect cast, and the best soundtrack (Hans Zimmer) I've heard in decades, but the story and directing always come first.

It is also a visually and aurally flawless HD transfer, but at times the spectacle of it is thrown off by the clearly fake effects. It's interesting what aspects of the facade of movie making appear totally real on the big screen, but when put on the microscope that is a television contain only a fraction of the realism. Does this detract from the experience of watching the film? Only slightly, but the story's break-neck pace is what maintains its momentum and forces you to pay attention.

Will the Man of Steel Blue-ray win over people that didn't like the film? It's possible. At times I felt the special features were more interesting than the movie, but not everyone will share my opinion on that. I was worried that I wouldn't enjoy the film as much on repeat viewings, but after dissecting the Blue-ray and watching the bombastic action sequences, I can say with certainty that I like the flick a lot.

5783651,4,B00D91GRA4,"First of all let me just say that this was a very good film. It took the source material and gave it a serious tone that helps make the movie more enjoyable. The acting is done very well and the action will have you mesmerized. Henry Cavill far outshines Routh's portrayal of the man of steel. And Snyder does fairly well with Nolans influence. Again overall a very good film. Now, let's be honest, even those who absolutely LOVED this film or the man of steel will honestly have to admit it's not without its shortcomings. 1. While the somber tone is refreshing it does at times seem a bit forced. What felt so natural in the batman films is harder to recreate when you're main character is an alien that can fly and shoot heat rays from his eyeballs. 2. The action can be overwhelming. While done well, there are times during the action sequences, the finale in particular, in which everything is going so fast you nearly go cross eyed trying to keep up. And finally, 3. The film felt so uneven! This was my biggest complaint after seeing this. It felt like WB hired Nolan to do the first and second act and then for the finale just said: Ok Zack, smash stuff!!! The finale while spectacular felt so out of place when up to that point everything had been much more contained. But these flaws although notable, are not enough to keep you from enjoying the best superman film since The first one with Reeves, and will have you more than willing to ""look into the sky"" for the sequel!!
P.S. Did anyone else catch all the messiah references! Also, in the finale there is a quick nod to Lex Luthor's company Lexcorp.",1384041600,2,1613,4.434343434343434

Most of the bad reviews come from old people and critics like myself who are old enough to been around when Superman the movie came out. The only ones who are complaining are the ones who are nothing but familiar with Reeve's movies. It was a great movie back in the day. But things has changed a lot since then. Is a reboot, go to see it for what it is, a new superman for the new generation. If you expect Casablanca or Godfather material, keep walking, this is not for you. If you are a true Supes fan, if you had read Birthright, All star Superman and such, you are gonna love it. Don't expect him saving little kitties from a tree or stupid things we human can do for ourselves. He landed, he kicked butt and he conquered . And was freaking awesome...Did I say was freaking awesome?? 9/10 on my book....One more thing, I do feel like 143 minutes were not enough to cover Supe's mythology, that's my only complain, maybe an extra 20 to 30 minutes would had been better. Hope we'll get some an extra extended version on Bluray. Oh and you people that didn't like it because is not like previous version of him on the big screen, you know nothing about superman. Go and read Kingdom Come, Birthright, Red Son and you will have a better understanding of what was accomplished with this film.

The culture of Krypton is finally developed. The interaction between Zod and Jor-El is fascinating - they were once allies, now enemies.  It doesn't get any better than Kevin Costner and Diane Lane as Clark's parents, and Amy Adams as Lois. Michael Shannon as Zod is brilliant as is Russell Crowe. The backflash story technique is done here masterfully. It's not goofy. It's not overly funny. The villains aren't silly.  It's serious because it's the end of the world.

But MAN OF STEEL comes up to bat and while it might not be a grand slam, it is certainly a home run.

Zach Snyder and Christopher Nolan have added a new layer of complexity to the Superman storyline, while still allowing for character development, action, and a storyline that stays true to the original mythology.  Henry Cavill (Superman/Clark Kent), Amy Adams (Lois Lane; she had an appearance as a villain in ""SMALLVILLE""), Michael Shannon (Zod), and Diane Lane (Martha Kent) all give great appearances in their roles, big or small.  Russell Crowe is a fantastic and very believable Jor-El; let's hope they can re-utilize him in future DC Comics/SUPEMAN/Justice League sequels.

MOS is a unique film compared to previous Superman storylines.  From the 1951 ""ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN"" through the cartoons of the 1960's and 1970's to the 1978 SUPERMAN film with Christopher Reeve to the recent SMALLVILLE TV series, every showing of Superman has shown Superman advancing in chronological order, usually from birth/his appearance on Earth.  But MOS took a different tack which makes the film very interesting, where series of flashbacks (like dream sequences) from Clark's time on Earth are interspersed with the main storyline.  So you see a very young Clark in school, an adolescent Clark saving a school bus, an early-20's Clark working at a bar, Clark on a fishing vessel, and the death of Jonathan Kent (great performance by Kevin Costner) at different times in the film, seemingly popping up at random.  It accentuates the importance of these events in the younger Clark's life and tells the story of his time on Earth in a different perspective.  The ordering of the appearances fills in the blanks and makes the story arc of the Last Son Of Krypton riveting and appealing to those who already know the Superman mythology (which is probably most of us).  Very well done !!

As for the movie itself:  Jor-El and Zod's relationship is dramatic and a new twist on Zod's megalomania; it is too bad they couldn't explore this in further detail or go back in time when they were strong allies (perhaps in a sequel?).  I have always thought that a story arc focusing solely on what happened with Jor-El/Zod and the rest of Krypton before the planetary cataclysm would have made for a great storyline.  The darker tone of MOS would have lent itself more to such a story (more so than the Kryptonian Council scenes at the beginning of the 1978 SUPERMAN movie).  Pay attention to the difference in Clark's tone and attitude toward his parents when he is complaining to Jonathan Kent about following in his footsteps as a farmer, and later in the movie when he goes after Zod for 'threatening his mother.'

Lois Lane's relationship to Superman is introduced in a different fashion than in previous incarnations of Superman.  Another positive; the writers and producers stayed true to the basic Superman story arc but knew they needed a few 'changeups' to make this different to captivate the audience, besides the darker tone.  Perry White's character is much less interesting (and funny) than Jackie Cooper's portrayal in the 1978 film.  But if Lawrence Fishburne is OK with it, who am I to complain ?

The ending has plenty of action, and the complaints by some that there is too much rock-'em-sock-`em action is a bit off base.  This isn't the BATMAN trilogy where you are dealing with a brilliant martial arts detective, you are talking about super-powered beings whose dense molecular structures are magnified probably 1 trillion-fold by the power of Earth's Sun.  The complaint about SUPERMAN RETURNS was that the trailers had most of the action and the movie had very little follow-up.  That isn't the case in MOS.  Even little things are accentuated, as this film pays attention to detail: check out Clark's eyes when he helps heals Lois' injury.  Nice touch !

Plenty of extras are to be included in the Blu-Ray version of the movie:  behind-the-scenes, deleted scenes, etc.  The move lasts 143 minutes, which is rather long, but it flows very evenly.  The movie is laid out in such a way with different `story blocs'  that it flows better than if they had followed the chronology of the 1978 movie from Clark's rocketship appearance on Earth to the present.

""MAN OF STEEL"" is a great film in its own right and a worthy successor to the 1978 movie which was one of the biggest box office hits of the 1970's.  Some have commented that the ticket sales for MOS were disappointing, but it is possible that the SMALLVILLE TV series (ended 2011) and SUPERMAN RETURNS (2006) both dampened any pent-up demand for a successful and new version of the story.  BATMAN BEGINS was 8 years after the final George Clooney semi-camp Batman movie but the Nolan Trilogy didn't kick into high gear until THE DARK KNIGHT hit in 2008.  MOS did better than BATMAN BEGINS by almost 50%.  When THE DARK KNIGHT followed up BATMAN BEGINS 3 years later it more than doubled the earlier film.  One wonders if there was a Superman-only follow-up (instead of the rumored Batman-Superman ""Justice League"" hookup) if it could springboard on the first film's success and reach the levels of the 2nd and 3rd films in the Nolan Trilogy.  Looks like we'll never know, so let's hope Ben Afleck and the scriptwriters don't screw up the successor to MAN OF STEEL.",1383868800,8,5583,4.806282722513089

Kal's mother gets in minute of coolness, before she's returned to the same weeping woman watching her kid leave that she's been in all other Superman incarnations. Lois gets a few bits of being interesting, tracking down the elusive Clark Kent when nobody else has even noticed him, and then she's throwing herself on him. There is not chemistry between them, no reason for for her to suddenly fall in love with him, except it's scripted.

The final battle between Zod and Krypton is like watching Dragon ball-Z but with superheroes, one of the biggest complaints was that there was too much destruction and fighting, but it's superman. That's like saying there's too much stealth in a batman movie, it's a man from outer space against an army of beings exactly like him that can't really get hurt in a city, there's going to be destruction.

5783663,2,B00D91GRA4,"When the previews of the new Superman movie made its rounds on the internet, I was excited to see a new modern, more serious take on the Man of Steel. While the first Superman movie with Christopher Reeve was fun, iconic and kept with the true spirit of the Simon and Schuster comic book classic, it was a bit on the light side and a bit too humorous. When it was announced that Zack Synder was directing this new interpretation of the Son from Krypton, my expectations were unexpectedly high. Both Watchmen and 300 were brilliant comic book based movies. Unfortunately, Man of Steel, was not.

Despite having some very interesting and creative scenes of Krypton with Russell Crowe and some very touching scenes with Kevin Costner and young Clark Kent, there was a definite disconnect with the plot due to large gaps in sequencing. The movie felt choppy and uneven in trying to teeter back and forth between present day and past scenes of Clark Kent.  It seemed Synder was more concerned about creating atmosphere instead of adequately telling a story. Worst of all, there were absolute lapses of logic. The first meeting and subsequent meetings between Clark and Lois Lane felt hallow, unconvincing and most of all, lacking of any chemistry whatsoever. You felt absolutely nothing between this new take of Superman and Lois while in contrast, the 1978 version of Clark and Lois felt genuine and magical. In the final battle between Zod and Superman, Superman tosses Zod through building after building, causing 9-11 level destruction as buildings collapse in the middle of Metropolis, resulting in thousands of innocent deaths, and yet, all he cares about is saving Lois? And in the end of the movie, people are supposed to honor and respect as a hero after all the death and destruction his presence has caused??? One pivotal scene at the end of the movie (without revealing a spoiler) is so uncharacteristic of Superman, that it's literally inexcusable and unforgivable for us that grew up reading Superman.  By emulating Christopher Nolan in reworking the superhero mythos, Synder has given us a sad, moody and emo Superman. While this may work for Batman, that's not Superman. For that reason, this movie fails to revitalize the myth to modern sensibilities. It lacks the charm, the chemistry and the solid storytelling that the 1978 original brought.",1383436800,9,2356,4.944444444444445

5783665,4,B00D91GRA4,"Let me start by being honest to myself. Man of Steel is not a great movie, and far from being a Great Superman movie. It was supposed to be the best movie of the Summer 2013, even for the entire year 2013 and it was far behind movies like Pacific Rim, Iron man 3, and others. I'm a huge fan of the Superman Character, but we have to admit the facts. There was not a real story, not a real plot, and poor character development. I'm not getting into dtails for each scene, but let's face it guys, when you Watch a superhero movie, there's a time during the movie, you kind of wanting to be that superhero. There was not a single scene where people wanted to be superman. Do you remember the First superman movie when Superman saves Lois from falling from the building "" I got you mam "" ? And "" Who's got you "" ? When the helicopter was gonna fall on them ? When you Watch that scene, even now, in 2013, it gives you goosebumps. Do you remember in Superman II when Superman showed up to face General Zod and his clan ? The newpapers were flying all over, people were looking in the sky and Superman showed up outside from the window and ask General Zod to come outside ? That scene was phenomenal . Do you remember when Superman, in Superman returns saved the plane and its passengers from crashing, even before when he was flying after the plane, and went through the second wing  ? OMG, these scnes make you Wonder in the theater "" Why can't I have power to save people and do great things like him "" ?  But there was nowhere in Man of Steel where you wanted to be Superman, absolutely nowhere. I expected Snyder to reach the level of Richard Donner or Lester with the Superman franchise, but I think he failed. It's so evident that he has to bring Batman back to combine with Superman to try to do that in the second one. Man of steel should have brought at least a Billion dollars to the Studio, which it did not do, cause people had so many complains.

He's just Clark Kent, the well-manered alien with a  passive personality who is always restrained in his actions. Great person to be around in real life, not so great for the big-screen. But the movie was just ok in my eyes. Will satisfy the special-effects buff, not so much the hardcore Superman fans. Script was weak, Cavill's acting was ok not great.

I think that such an expectation is unrealistic and always prone to disillusionment.

Edwin O. Eschberger (a fellow Amazon.com reviewer) gave a great review that reflects pretty much all my thoughts about this movie.

In brief, the action was insane, just what I'd expect from Superman and what I feel that the last Superman movie had absolutely lacked. I enjoyed the new angle to Superman, it felt a bit more like a Sci-Fi movie than a superhero movie, in a way.

5783671,4,B00D91GRA4,"Man of Steel is to Superman as Batman Begins is to Batman; It brings back a popular comics character to the big screen in a fresh way. While Man of Steel is not quite as triumphant a success as Batman Begins was, it is the best Superman film since the 1978 masterpiece. It has a bit in common with Batman Begins, like the realistic approach, but the alien world aspect makes this film feel more like a sci-fi/fantasy adventure than a conventional comic book movie.

Man of Steel`s narrative structure is similar to Batman Begins. This is not surprising considering it has the same screenwriter David S. Goyer and the Batman trilogy's director Christopher Nolan acts as a producer.

The first fifteen minutes or so are the most entertaining part of the film. The movie treads in full sci-fi fantasy territory, on the dying world of Krypton, where, as is familiar to any Superman fan, Jor-El (Russell Crowe) places his infant son Kal-El into a tiny spacecraft and sends him across the stars to our planet. Meanwhile, Krypton's military leader General Zod (Michael Shannon) attempts a coup, but is caught and tossed with his followers into The Phantom Zone. The dying planet is visually impressive and the previously mostly unexplored territory makes things feel fresher and less generic.

After the epic Krypton sequence, the film starts with Clark as an adult and then periodically uses a series of flashbacks sketching out his past. The first half or so deals mainly with Clark's background: his birth, his childhood with the Kents, his feats of strength, he and Lois crossing paths, Clark finding his father's hologram and learning the full potential of his powers.

Things get far darker than any Superman film ever has been about half way through this movie when Zod shows up with his minions on Earth. This is where the movie turns into a colossal action extravaganza, serving up both epic spectacle and lots of bombastic superhero action, which is something Superman fans have been starved for on the screen.

Needless to say, Superman defeats Zod but at the great cost of probably a billion dollars in property destruction and a great loss of life, which may seem a bit too un-Superman-ish. Is this the right tone befitting the character of Superman? Maybe. Maybe not. There may be something a little iffy about a movie centering around one of the most unfailingly noble, pure-hearted superheroes reveling so much in Transformers-level carnage. The Man of Steel of the golden age comics was brutish and took no prisoners, so for this Superman fan, it works. The ending sequence gives us Clark Kent, mild mannered reporter

The visual effects are first-rate, and the action scenes, which are frequent and lengthy, have a quick pace. Sharp-eyed viewers will appreciate some Easter eggs as well (most prominently the LexCorps logo). Goyer also dispenses with at least one hackneyed plot point from most previous films by having Lois discover early on that Clark Kent and Superman are one and the same (though the ending suggests the glasses that magically render him unrecognizable might still have their effect on everyone else).

All in all, Man of Steel is far from a perfect motion picture, but it's highly-enjoyable summer blockbuster entertainment, serving up epic spectacle that should entertain most moviegoers, albeit at the cost of sacrificing some heart along the way. Faults aside, I never found the movie boring, but it is not as pure as the 1978 film.",1383004800,6,3468,4.938250428816467

The film gave us a different perspective of his life, not just a guy right out of high school and transformed into a costumed super hero, but as a man looking for answers, traveling about looking to see how he can fit into the world at large. How best to use his ability's in a social environment that would initially reject him. Johnathan Kent gave him a moral background and Jor-El gave him direction. With this The Man of Steel was born.

5783677,1,B00D91GRA4,"Please bear in mind that I am a fan of both Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan. I'll spend pretty much every day until my terminal breath defending Sucker Punch and Snyder's Watchmen adaptation. Nolan's work with the Batman movies is nothing short of absolutely amazing and he has one eye for a tragic superhero story. He turned the story of Bruce Wayne into a beautiful tragic story of a man who must choose heroism or sanity. Watchmen is the story of former superheroes who realize that even though they're retired, they have a lot of saving to do- themselves for a starting point. And so when you take Superman and give it a dark spin, it's bound to succeed, right?

Absolutely wrong.

Alright, so maybe the movie isn't bad. If you're a pedestrian viewer wanting an explosion filled action movie, then you'll get that here. But for us Superman fans, it's a disgrace. I don't know who these ""fans"" are telling us that this is close to the graphic novels, in fact the way they adapted the comics is among some of the most appalling adapting work I've ever seen. There are problems right off the bat when Jor-El is stabbed to death by General Zod. REALLY? If anyone has even read the comic books, you'd realize that Jor-El is much stronger and more defensive than that. But it doesn't stop there

To begin with, the Superman is greatly raped with a stove pipe and executed Tarantino- style throughout. He spends the whole movie angsting and whining. It's as annoying as The Tenth Doctor's final episode of Doctor Who. Alright, that's a little dramatic, sure. But half the exchanges between Clark Kent and people around him consist of:

PERSON X: Clark, can we talk? CLARK: I don't want to. PERSON X: Look Clark, nothing is wrong with you. CLARK: I know. PERSON X: so why don't you send your powers to the world? CLARK: No, you don't understand. People CAN'T know who I am. They'll reject me.

Every time one of these rubbish soap opera dialogues rung out over the cinema speakers, I groaned. To be fair, it is SLIGHTLY true to the comics, but they take it up to 11 here and it's unnecessary. The cutting of the film is really off here too. One minute, Superman is being interrogated, the next he's in the desert. It comes off as if Snyder dropped the script on the ground one day thus messing up the pages, then decided, ""ah, never mind, let's just shoot it like this"". Your head will explode trying to make sense of this thing, man.

And then there's the second half, filled with nothing but action, explosions, Superman pushing General Zod through several buildings (I laughed several times). The action itself is bloated, boring and incomprehensible too. Shaky camera and quick cutting combined with 3D, when I wasn't falling asleep, I was wondering what in the hot frak was going on. And then the climax, or lack of was just laughable.

So, are there any positives? Well, the cast do a good job. I did like Henry Cavill a lot and I think given the terrible script that he had to work with, he did a decent job. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner are also great, but the highlight of the film is easily Michael Shannon as General Zod. He really knows how to make a bad guy scary- watch the film ""Bug"" for proof. But he shines here and he plays the villain in such a way that you both feel bad for him and hate him at the same time, which is proof of a well executed villain.

Otherwise, stay away from this turkey at all costs. Don't believe the positive reviews, the critics are right for once. I figured it was just the unhealthy and unfair hate-on they have for Snyder, but nope. They're right. I'm guessing WB hired plants to write reviews, because a lot of the reviews do seem very much vague.

5783679,3,B00D91GRA4,"I hated the start of this movie. Everything was too computer generated and unrealistic with how it all played out. Apparently on Kripton if you do something bad they spend TONS of manpower, money, energy, and time on putting people into ice crystal things and rocketting them into space. All I could think was how annoying that must be for the people of Kripton who would most likely be saying ""Why can't we just put them in a cell and have them walk there? It would save money and resources."" The worst part is that they send the criminals into space just before the planet dies making sure they are the only ones who live. What was the point of that? Just keep them on the planet so they die with everybody else. And let's not forget that those scenes lasted for over TWENTY MINUTES! I missed the very end of the movie because I just got tired of sitting there for so long watching such a long movie. They really could have cut that first part down by a lot!

So it was a very long and dramatic lead up to superman arriving on Earth, but then they just SKIP OVER his arrival and have him as a grown up. They do some flash backs of when he was a kid though. I wouldn't mind if they skipped over his arrival if they didn't just spend over 20 minutes building up to that point.

I did like Lois and her tracking back his deeds and find out who he was. It was always unrealistic that somebody like Lois would not be able to figure out who superman really was so PROPS to that.

I didn't like how superman STOLE clothes. Superman wouldn't do that. He could have just ASKED for some clothes. Superman is an honest and good guy with strong moral character .. that's why people love him, not just because he has powers. He's not a thief. He also would have cared about the MASSIVE destruction that went on with the over the top fight scenes.

Everything clearer. The heroism portrayed was refreshing because people who did heroic acts in this movie did them because they needed to be done - not because they wanted to be a hero or heroic. The movie isn't perfect, but it's damn close and I am glad for this second viewing to prove this movie is much better than I originally saw it. Solid 5/5 Stars. Now, here's my original review below, unedited...)

From the relatively quick Krypton opening, Man of Steel quickly gets to the goods and, like 1989's Batman, it saves us from the rehash of the Smallville chronicles and just provides the necessary flashbacks that made Clark who he will become. I mean, really. Smallville was on for 10 TV seasons. If you wanted to see that, spent that much time in front of the TV. This is a Superman movie!

But...it's not the Superman you or I grew up and loved. This is new, fresh, exciting and more real than ever before. There was so much good that was added, altered and enhanced that I embraced every change including one MAJOR modification that I will not ethically spoil.

Now, this is not all to say we need to forget the silliness - okay, OVER-comical previous films. If you want to see that, simply watch them. This is a brand new vision of my all-time favorite superhero and after watching the previous entries countless times, it was absolutely breathtaking to see such a new twist and explore a new avenue never been done before.

In 2006, Superman Returns simply continued the storyline from Superman II (yeah, it told you to forget III and IV ever existed, and for the most part, most people had, even without Returns.) Returns used the same characters, the same campiness, the same music, the same Kryptonite and even a guy who looked and acted exactly like the late and great Christopher Reeve.

And that's all well and good. It's also good that was the end of that saga. Much like what happened to The Dark Knight Trilogy's mythology. Hopefully.

I didn't know what to expect here. More of the same, i.e. reboot but with all the same themes and the same Superman and his morals? No. This couldn't have been further from the old series.

I loved Henry Cavill as Superman/Kal-El/Clark. (Oops, sorry, spoiler there. Duh.) I loved his depth, his convictions and his imperfections. I love that he is NOT the Christopher Reeve version of the last son of Krypton. And just to clarify, I love both versions of Superman. Nicely, now I can choose which I would like to watch once this hits home video and I need my Supe-fix.

You may think you know the story of Kal-El, but all that remains is that Krypton does fall, General Zod & Friends are banished and imprisoned and baby Kal does end up with the Kents in Kansas. From there...It's a whole new world.

Clark's trying to find himself, his way, his future and his past. Along his journey, he does meet up with Lois and she's as equally altered as is this version of the Man of Steel. Simultaneously, that nasty Zod gang does make their way to Earth and has some things up their sleeves.

Will ""Superman"" - or so they call him - rise to the occasion and prove himself as a world-class hero? You think you know the answer?

The movie had incredible graphics, wonderful flying sequences, great sound, decent score and the acting is believable from all fronts. But...

...now that all my praise is out there, the movie isn't perfect by any means. Number one, the writing is off...quite a bit at times. So much so, it will be probably my inevitable second viewing before I can piece together all that was wrong with it. They do throw quite a bunch at you to distract you from any script problems. Also, it didn't help that my 3D-glasses were a bit scratched. Luckily, I didn't find the 3-D all that great, so my next viewings will be cheaper as I hang those glasses up.

In addition to the sometimes poor writing, is the sketchy editing and perhaps too many flashbacks to the point it's hard to decipher past and present. I mean, I don't believe Martha Kent aged a bit in 30 years! (If she was real, she might consider that a compliment, until...she realizes I meant she looked ancient back then and still does in present day.)

There is far more to love in this movie than those points of criticism. Personally, I was so wrapped up in the newness and fresh aspect - even though I grew up knowing Superman one (completely different) way - that even when I knew there were script issues, I didn't care. I loved the new Superman, the new direction and can't wait to see where this is headed.

The incredible action also helped in my fun time. After the comedy Iron Man 3, it's nice to put the action back into the original Action Comic.",1382745600,5,4848,4.511972633979475
5783681,5,B00D91GRA4,"had this movie not been about Superman, it probably would have received better reviews. But it would seem the public just can't accept it when something is different. It is a fantastic film and accomplished what it set out to do, which was re-imagine Superman for a new generation. What matters is that the movie did stay extremely close the original source material and didn't alter characters as to where they no longer resembled their comic counterparts (I'm talking to you, Batman & Robin).

And even if the movie wasn't perfect, far worse movies have been made. People are acting as if this was a complete line by line remake of Superman IV (An exaggeration, but after reading some of the things that have been said, a person who has not seen the movie would probably expect to see something of the quality of Superman IV)

I do agree there was too much action, but I can forgive that after being denied good Superman films since the 1980's. I think Zack Snyder was trying to make up for 30 years of bad Superman films. I probably would have still enjoyed the movie anyway if it was just Superman lashing out at bad guys from start to finish.

One last thing to think about is that this is merely Superman's Origin and last but not least, Clark Kents Origin. This movie was given bad ratings because of how it had very little soul to it or any happiness that we've seen in the Richard Donner films, but we must remember that the Donner films were almost completely about how Clark Kent alternated between his public life and his life as Superman, and in Man of Steel, Kal-El only becomes the true Clark Kent at the very end of the movie. If that doesn't tell us anything about what we should expect from future films than nothing will. We all need to keep in mind that this simply the first movie, and like the start of many great movie series, the first movie is always the one in which the creative team behind it figures out what works and what doesn't.

When you look at this movie in the most basic way possible, it is simply reminding us how Kal-El came to earth and became Clark Kent, not Superman.",1382745600,20,2110,4.444444444444445

5783690,4,B00D91GRA4,"Well, I thought this was a pretty decent effort. Many reviews focused on a couple of key points: Krypton was more interesting than in the older films. The actors were good esp. Cavill and Shannon and Crowe. Adams was better than the previous Lois Lanes but none of them can compare to Phyllis Coates in the first season of Adventures of Superman: she nailed Lois for all time, not only the character but the looks as well. I agree with those who complained about the duration of the battle scene; the destruction became unimaginative and repetitive. The main virtue of this rendition was the restoration of Superman's tougher persona. Look at the stories from the original comics of the late 30s and 40s and you'll see a Superman who roughed up bad guys and used fear convincingly to get confessions and information. In the first season of Adventures, George Reeves played him as a very tough character and the noirish plots framed that portrayal very well. Only after the first season, at the behest of sponsors and networks was the show turned into a children's show and Superman into a boy scout. And that became the mold for Superman for over 50 years until now. Superman has to be potentially dangerous at all times and he has to learn to be self sacrificing or the stories will just fall back into the same rut.  The climax of this film will surely give the writers a basis for Kal-el to become the Christ-like figure we want him to be. But that should be his struggle, not a given. And for those who have never seen George Reeves in  the role, give it a shot esp. Season 1 of Adventures.",1382227200,5,1594,4.53125
5783691,1,B00D91GRA4,"""Man of Steel"" feels like a throwback to 8 or 10 years ago when directors and producers were in love with CGI special effects for their own sake.  It doesn't have to be that way. When special effects are used to advance a story rather than to take it over, the results can be truly spectacular. Avatar proved that as did Star Wars before that.  I had hoped that Avatar had put an end to the CGI-for-CGI's-Sake big budget film, but apparently Christopher Nolan, who produced Man of Steel, didn't get the memo.

The director and producers of Man of Steel were more into a special effects extravaganza than into presenting a film with a dramatic core or characters to which the audience can relate. There's nothing wrong with the special effects except that there's far too much of them and everything else in the film plays second fiddle to one more explosion, crashing building, or fist fight.

Batman benefited from the Christopher Nolan treatment. Superman doesn't.

If non-stop special effects are your thing, you'll love this movie. Otherwise, it's a big disappointment and does not bode well for the future of the Superman franchise in its current reincarnation.

Here's a tip for you: If you can pretend this is a film about a never before seen super hero, you'll probably enjoy it more because this film is more about Christopher Nolan's ego than it is about Superman.",1382227200,15,1374,4.7521008403361344
5783692,2,B00D91GRA4,"***SPOILER ALERT!!!***

Superman is arguably the most iconic comic book hero in the world, and he has been for many years.  People all over the world know who he is.  Superman may be the only superhero who is not thought of as an American hero, but as a world hero.  Why is that?

I collected comic books for over 15 years.  I grew up watching ""The Adventures of Superman"" and the Superman movies in the 70s and 80s.  No other hero embodies what it means to be a hero more than Superman.  He embodies it so much that he has often been ridiculed over the years for being cheesy, a boy-scout, or just plain boring.  Superman embodies all that is good...so much so that over the last 35 years, the writers have even endowed him with a ""Messiah-complex.""  We can always trust Superman to do the right thing when it comes to the safety and welfare of others.  These have been timeless qualities that make him who he is, as much as brooding and incredible deductive reasoning make Batman who he is.

""Man of Steel"" attempts to change much of Superman's character.  The writers are trying desperately to make Superman more realistic and gritty; more of what they feel the world wants Superman to be.  I am a Peace Corps volunteer in Macedonia.  I lost count of how many people here, in this small country, have seen the film and asked me, ""why did they change him?  That isn't Superman.""  One thing that I liked about the film was that the ""S"" symbol is defined as ""hope.""  And that is the one thing that Superman has always meant to so many people.

Unfortunately, ""Man of Steel"" gives us a Superman film that is practically all flash and very little substance.  Given the incredible cast that they had to work with, I was disappointed in how little time and development is given to Clark, Lois, Perry, and others.

We get a fairly impressive scene on Krypton.  No longer is Krypton a crystallized world, but one of metal and technology.  The writers decide to take a page out of the ""Matrix"" playbook as people on Krypton are not born, but grown.  Kal-El (referred to laughably as Kal, which makes me think of Titanic), is the first naturally born Kryptonian in thousands of years.  As we know, Kal-El is sent to earth as the planet explodes, but not before Zod and his minions are banished and the explosion of Krypton frees them.

The film opens with Clark wandering around in the north somewhere.  Yes, he leaves his mother behind on the farm.  We aren't given much of an explanation as to why.  Jonathan Kent has all but instilled a sense of paranoia within Clark; so much so that Jonathan sacrifices his life to preserve Clark's secret.  This is done is a very implausible manner.  Jonathan is about to be killed by a tornado (notice that his hair doesn't even move when he's within a few hundred feet of it!), and Clark stands by and watches, even though Jonathan does hold up his hand and shakes his head.  I haven't seen a version of Clark Kent, until now, who would stand idly by and watch his own father be killed.  In fact, I don't know many people who would do this, if they felt that they had the chance to save a loved one; secret be damned.  Not to mention that Clark has super-speed and could have saved Jonathan without anyone seeing him.

Lois Lane is given an assignment in the north to cover a scientific-military operation.  She sees Clark in the distance and wanders out in -40 degree weather without a hat or facial protection.  I have been in temperatures that low before, and your ears would be frost-bitten within ten minutes, and Lois isn't even shivering.  Just like that, she happens upon a large alien craft where Clark is finally introduced to Jor-El.  Naturally, Clark ends up having to save her life when Kryptonian defenses see Lois as an intruder and attempt to kill her.  We have a couple of minutes of Lois & Clark time before we shift the story again.

Virtually the entire second-half of the film is a CGI-action fest (which is okay at best).  Zod and his minions (easily over 20) come looking for Kal-El and decide to make Earth their new utopia.  Here is where things really get pushed over the edge.  Up until now, we have had little character development and suddenly Superman who has just mastered flying, is thrown into the frying pan as a large invasion force descends upon the Earth.  The amount of destruction and deaths are higher than in any other Superman feature film.  I also lost count of the number of times Superman would hit one Kryptonian fifty feet above the ground, sail for a few miles, and then back the other way we come.  Zod, a great military general, only allows two other Kryptonians to attack Superman, when he could send over a dozen of his people to different points on the globe and thus, incapacitate Superman's ability to save the planet.

The action scenes, frankly, were not that impressive to me.  After a few times of people slamming into each other and through buildings, it became tedious.  Frankly, I wasn't emotionally invested in Superman.  There wasn't enough character development for me to care.  Lois, a reporter, is even given a military mission.  I guess there weren't any military personnel qualified to do it; to put a Kryptonian computerized device into a slot.

I also wish the flying scenes were better.  Superman and Superman II still have the best flying sequences of any Superman film, and there was no CGI.  Christopher Reeve contorted and turned his body to mimic flying.  We see Henry Cavill straight on a few times and then these fast, distant fly-bys.

I, like many others, also have a problem with Superman's ""killing"" scene.  Had there been no other options, I might have considered that Superman had no choice.  But that isn't the case here.  He could have turned Zod's head in a safer direction (if you're strong enough to break someone's neck, then you can turn their head), or he could have grabbed him and flown him out of the train station.  In other words, he had options.  And even though Superman is overcome with grief for his action, it simply doesn't work.

If you're going to do a good Superman film, then you first have to know the character.  Zack Snyder and the writers clearly don't.  They tried to change and mold an iconic character to make him relevant (in their minds) to today's world.  For me, it didn't work.  We are given a transformers-type action fest that detracts from the story rather than enhance it.

Amy Adams, Laurence Fishburne, Diane Lane, and Kevin Costner are given very little screen time. Cavill makes the most of what little time he does have.  Michael Shannon's Zod is the best and most developed character of the film along with Russell Crowe's Jor-El.

I was really looking forward to seeing this film, based on what I saw in the trailers.  And again, I was disappointed that a movie that is nearly two and a half hours long, failed to give me a Superman and characters that I care about.  If you can't do some character development and go deeper within that amount of time, then as a writer, you might want to look into a new profession.

I will say that the music in this film is pretty good, but it's hard to top the epic score of John Williams that exemplifies power, greatness, and hope.

For now, I will stick with Superman I & II.  They may be older films, but they are still classic films that work today and give us the Superman that most of us know and love.  Perhaps someday, we'll get a film that does justice to the world's greatest superhero.",1382227200,7,7498,4.547085201793722
5783693,5,B00D91GRA4,"Directed by Zack Snyder (300, Watchmen), Man of Steel is a re-telling of Superman's origins, where Kal-El, or Clark Kent to humanity, must protect the Earth from General Zod, who was banished for war crimes and has come back to save and ""advance"" their race after their planet is destroyed, wiping out most of the Kryptonians. But as General Zod raises the stakes and begins to cause utter chaos and destruction, Kent learns that he must go beyond what he knows if he is to save us.

Man of Steel is, by far, the best Superman film to date. I will admit, I am of a younger generation and was not there to see the first Superman hit screens, but I still liked it when I saw it, and I still do. But this Superman doesn't necessarily stick to the comics more-so (more than the other films, in certain respects) but it captures Superman in a different light. When we see Kent in other films, he's already become part of society and saves the day when need be. Here, Kent is an outsider, and he doesn't know what to do with his life. He's always moving, going state to state and job to job, never settling down. But when he discovers an ancient Kryptonian craft the government is trying to excavate, he finds out the truth of who he is and where he came from. But it's when General Zod comes, when he discovers his true purpose in life; his destiny. Zack's directing is superb, capturing the epic scope of a Christopher Nolan film (who also produced this), all the while showing the scale as well, instead of just a small look at the conflict. The acting is great, especially Michael Shannon as Zod, who is both terrifying and yet, somewhat understandable. Russell Crowe was also incredible, and very deserving of an Oscar nomination along side Shannon. Cavil is damn good as Superman, but it's Crowe and Shannon who stand out the most. The visual effects are top-notch, Hans Zimmer's musical score is haunting and grand, and the script is good. It's not award-winning, but very memorable and worthy of note.

Man of Steel is not for everyone, but is a great sci-fi epic. I also wanted to say, not only am I disappointed with the critics (like most), but I don't understand comments on the character development. Superman does develop over the course of the film, greatly. From discovering who he is, ""adapting"" to disasters that have befallen him over time (shown through flashbacks), and a price he paid dearly at the end of the film, when he's left with no choice. This Superman is a more human Superman, but no less incredible or amazing. I can't wait to see how the sequel turns out.",1382227200,6,2583,4.540772532188841

I saw Man of Steel because I was trying to see a movie with my two sons (ages 20 and 17) within a limited amount of time, and both Into Darkness and Ironman 3 started too late for our schedule. I figured, whatever, we'll just go watch Man of Steel since none of us have seen it yet.

I was pretty well blown away. This film is so well cast it's ridiculous. There was no one in the film who was miscast, including Amy Adams, of whom I an not a fan. The choices for both sets of parents (Russell Crowe and Ayelet Zurer on Krypton and Kevin Costner and Diane Lane on Earth) were spot on. Henry Cavill was born for this role.

There are a few things in the movie that are out of place with the comics, but the changes all make sense and don't ruin the story. Everything is well explained but is not glaringly obvious. The goals for Kal-El/Clark Kent by his two fathers works to shape him. It seems they work at cross purposes, and yet, neither of them is wrong.

About a week and a half after I saw this with my sons, I was sitting at a restaurant with my younger son and we had a conversation that went something like this:

Me: I seriously can't get Man of Steel out of my head. It was an incredibly movie. I'm seriously thinking of hitting a theater and seeing it again.

Son: There's a theater two blocks over and if you catch the first showing it's only $7. Man of Steel starts in 40 minutes.

Less than an hour later, I found myself sitting in a darkened theater waiting for the movie to start. It's that good. And it was that good the second time around. If I had to find a complaint, it would be that there was nowhere near enough Russell Crowe for my taste.

He was pretty super. For some reason I really like his heat vision like how veins around his eyes would slightly pop out like like he was using a muscle, great details!
I surprisingly really liked Faora, she was a friggin badass and I also liked how they made General Zods character sympathetic and a monster at the same time.
A lot of information was jammed in this film, which could get overwhelming at times and pacing got weird like during the random flashbacks throughout the movie.

5783699,1,B00D91GRA4,"Unfortunately, the standard set by ""Man of Steel"" was not only for ""greatest cinematic disappointment this year"" but ""only film I have ever walked out on in over thirty years' worth of movie-going.""
  To put this in perspective, let me say that superhero movies are probably my favorite kind,that it all started with the the original Superman back in 1978, and that I watched the trailers for this film on Youtube numerous times and with growing anticipation (and in my opinion whoever managed to cobble those exciting trailers together out of this colossal mess either deserves some sort of an award, or to be tarred and feathered for tricking so many people into wasting their money and time).
  I had no problem with the cast (well, except with Zod, whose voice and accent struck me as a trifle too 'hick' for the role; but maybe this was just in contrast to Crowe--or in reaction to my having recently seen Cumberbatch's Khan in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-Into-Darkness/dp/B00F35BV64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek Into Darkness</a>); I just had a huge problem with what the script called for them to do. It began with the first scene, which I thought was distinctly TMI, hit a high point when--SPOILER!--Mrs. Kent unhesitatingly sent her husband back into the path of a tornado to save the family dog (was there something about their marriage we weren't being told?), settled into eye-rolling disgust when each new scene made it clear Superman was not really going to be allowed to do anything either heroic or even half-way competent, and finally ended when, just after the last battle began (at least, I think it was the last battle: it certainly should have been by that time), I couldn't take the thought of another ten minutes of boredom, ducked out of my seat and fled up the aisle.
  I spent the drive home assuring myself that my money hadn't been completely thrown away, as at least I had a new measuring-stick for badness.

An adult Kent talks to a Priest for advice on how to handle his secret identity.  It is hard not to roll your eyes.  These pretensions are put in place to validate the Superman character in our contemporary culture, which is flooded with various takes on superheros and action characters.  This is like the post-post modern Superman, trying to retrofit many aspects Dr. Manhattan into the original mythos.  The problem is, Dr. Manhattan himself is pretty dated at this point.  We've evolved past the singular all powerful superhero, and moved onto to comic book characters with more complex inner lives.  All that said, director Zack Snyder delivers solid action sequences throughout this movie, a decently developed subplot driven by Lois Lane, and solid antagonists for Superman in his fellow Kryptonians.",1381881600,2,967,5.0

We get it Hollywood, computer technology has advanced enough for you to spend all your budget on making computer generated worlds and huge, shiny explosions, it doesn't mean the audience enjoys being bombarded with it throughout an entire movie. I want a story that grips me, I want to feel something strong for the characters, if I feel nothing for freakin Superman then you completely failed as a director/producer.

From the solid performances from Cavill's wonderfully heroic Superman and Shannon's menacing yet sympathetic Zod, to the wonderfully directing and writing that hold the movie together. The only complaints I have are that the pacing is a bit off, the shaky cam can get a little annoying (especially since I'm used to Snyder's slowmo), and there is an unnecessary action scene when Superman is fighting the world engine's tentacles. This aside, this is an amazing origin story and lays good groundwork for the tone and setting of future Justice League movies.",1381622400,12,744,4.687022900763359
5783705,5,B00D91GRA4,"I give this a 5 star review and most people probably wouldn't agree with me. They seem to be stuck on the old Christopher Reeve Superman movies and don't really see this as a good Superman movie.

But I think that the directors and producers didn't want to make this into a remake or a tribute to those old and still good Superman movies.

I find that this is first and foremost an origin story. Most people that I speak to about this movie don't seem to understand that. All superheroes have to start somewhere. Superman didn't know what kind of superhero he wanted to be. But he knew that he was one. Or that he would be a supervillan, but his upbringing with his human parents made him understand what sort of man he was supposed to be, even if that man was a little different than the average.

I liked that we didn't see much of Superman himself. We got to see more of Clark Kent as an adult learning to go about his own way in world he wasn't sure was ready for someone like him. And it seems that most people in that world were not. Until Zod and his cronies showed up and Clark was forced to out himself, I have a feeling that Clark would have been perfectly happy to be that man in the background that saves people.

I absolutely adored the way that they created Lois Lane. That is the one big pick about the Superman mythos is that if Lois Lane is a reporter, she would have figured out and did investigating on her own to figure out exactly who Superman was, especially if she was obsessed about him as she is supposed to be. In many incarnations of the Superman myth, Clark himself has to tell Lois who he is. This Lois took charge and used resources and chewed on this like a dog with a bone to find out exactly who the superhero was, even before he was Superman.

So yes, I give this a 5 star rating. I loved this movie. Yeah, the destruction was a little much, but again, Superman and Zod aren't used to their powers and people should have probably left the area anyway. I love movies with destruction and this wasn't enough to dampen my enthusiasm nor my rating.",1381622400,11,2078,4.250632911392405

Shot in an all gray color palette (nothing could be further from lurid comic illustrations!) it's tedious on the eyes, the plot makes no sense, the actors are all poorly cast and seem to be confused as to why they're there (so am I) and it's just flat out BORING.  Amy Adams as Lois Lane is not even remotely believable.

We open with a scene straight out of Dungeons & Dragons, with the people of S-man's homeworld flying around on giant winged creatures and declaiming in cryptic yet trite EPIC FANTASY SPEECHES!  S-man's dad shoots him into space with a specially recorded message (offscreen, we imagine, mom asks can she leave a message for her only son too?  you know, since she's about to die and all.  NOPE!).

5783707,5,B00D91GRA4,"I grew up at a young age with Christopher Reeve and the John Williams theme. Reeve's performance is as classic and/or iconic as you can get in a different time period in its respected era. Now that we got that out of the way, after that debacle in 2006, 'Superman Returns', though classic is always a nice homage, I realized the Reeve's vision of Superman needed to be laid down and put to rest for good. Those classic elements just didn't seem to jive or connect with this modern world and the Superman character was stuck in quick-sand because of it. It was kind of sad to realize your favorite character of all time would forever be stuck in a time-warp and never would be takin' serious again.  Years leading up to Man of Steel, this Super-fan wanted more action. Wanted more edginess. Wanted a new direction that would force people to take Superman serious rather than a big cliche'. We got just that in Man of Steel. Not only does Man of Steel flesh out the origin of a New Krypton as we've never seen it before, but we see a brasher, more impulsive Superman told in a nonlinear way that breathes fresh, new life into a 75 year old character in serious need of an oil change. The mythology of Superman has been changed and though the older fans will forever cling on to their Superman of yesteryear, new and accepting fans alike have a chance to embrace Superman's comeback in  a way where it has only just begun.

Goyer seems to have forgotten the rule in writing ""show, don't tell."" This movie is full of subplots that go nowhere, flashbacks that serve no narrative purpose, good actors going completely to waste, and action set pieces that drag on for so long that the action actually becomes boring. The cast is amazing, but the actors have nothing to work with because there is nothing resembling actual characters in this movie. People just go through the motions that we're supposed to expect from Superman-related characters, but none of it feels genuine or earned, and there is no character development of any kind, no actual arc at all. The entire second half of the film is one long action sequence that is so repetitive that I was begging for it to be over. I love myself some gratuitous explosions, don't get me wrong, but there is so little variation in the action, and the action does little to nothing in the way of advancing the story, that it became tedious. The audience should never be bored when godlike superbeings are duking it out with the fate of the world in the balance, but I was. The movie is not without some good features. As I said, the cast is excellent; visually, it's very pretty; the music is fine, if a bit forgettable (not as iconic as John Williams's Superman theme, or Danny Elfman's Batman, or Hans Zimmer's earlier work on the Dark Knight trilogy). Where this movie failed was in the writing. I've come to expect much better from David S. Goyer. This is some of his worst work, worse than The Crow 2, worse than the David Hasselhoff Nick Fury movie. I guess I should have had lower expectations because of Zack Snyder, because this movie is consistent with his level of work. It was worse than Watchmen, but not as bad as Suckerpunch.  It blows my mind whenever I call Man of Steel the biggest cinematic disappointment of the summer and people look at me like I'm crazy.

For me, Zack Snyder hit it out of the ball park, homerun! I can't imagine a better cast for each of the characters. Not to disrespect the old Superman movies (RIP Christopher Reeve), but this was a breath of fresh air.
As I mentioned before, I haven't read comic books and a majority of the people I know haven't read them either, so it was a relief when the movie portrayed certain details about Superman that were a mystery to me: why kryptonite makes him weak, why he has super powers, and the specifics of why he's here on earth. A while back I kinda got bored of watching Lex Luthor get trashed rather easily in all the other movies, so it was nice to see a villain that could actually stand toe to toe with Superman.

5783713,5,B00D91GRA4,"The title of my review is saying a lot. I know that. But it is true. I am a huge fan of comics and super hero movies. All of them. Even Elektra and Daredevil. That being said, I can watch X-Men Origins Wolverine, but I really dislike that movie. I love the Avengers, and in my opinion Man of Steel was a lot better than Avengers. The formula for Avengers was awesome but predictable. World needs heroes, heroes clash, heroes make up, heroes save the world. And while Man of Steel and Avengers are two different types of movies, the formula for man of Steel made things unpredictable. MoS was gritty, sort of dark, with alot of destruction that would come from gods fighting on Earth.

Many people complained about the death and destruction in Mos. I say this, it was realistic. Superman had just learned who he was and then his ancestors descend on Earth. A ship full of Supermen and women. I know when watching a Justice League cartoon, and we see Superman punch someone through buildings, we all have said, I wish a Superman movie could be like that. Well, now we have it.

People complained about the ending. What Superman did. If you don't know, you will and it will be amazing. And when you do see it, try to understand that this is the first event in Superman's life were he is faced with anything. He makes mistakes just like a young Batman would, only when Superman makes mistakes, buildings are flattened and millions die. AS his life progresses, I bet he will adopt a personality much like the Superman we all know and love.

People found plot holes, well not so much plot holes, just scientific inaccuracies. Like Lois falling from a black hole when everything around her is being sucked in. And there was this machine that the military had to transport, but people were up in arms saying, why couldn't Superman do it for them? To these folks I say just enjoy a movie about an alien who can fly, shoot fire out his eyes, basically do anything, and stop worrying about dumb stuff. And stop trying to be scientists. It's like all these years of Stargate SG1, Star Trek, and Doctor Who, people are all of a sudden experts.",1381190400,7,2130,4.484536082474227
5783714,1,B00D91GRA4,"Yes, Superman Returns was really bad. But that's no excuse to turn Kal'El into THIS. ""Long"" and ""loud"" should not be the first descriptors used when discussing one of the finest comic characters ever to grace the silver screen, but one has few alternatives in this case. It's understandable that Zach Snyder would have no grasp of the character, because the mere concept of ""character"" is completely lost on this big budget video-game cut-scene director. Chris Nolan should know better, however, even if he lost his grasp on the Batman character more and more with each successive Dark Knight film.

It was obvious things were going to be rough when during the early promotional appearances Snyder and company said they used the ""Death of Superman"" storyline as the inspiration for much of the film. Choosing to use the most universally reviled storyline in the Superman canon? Sure, why not? What could go wrong?

Everything. Throughout the film Superman is a cipher, and the last hour plus of mayhem is antithetical to the character's entire purpose.

Not to mention that this movie has some of the most dumbfoundingly stupid dialogue of all time. Examples (paraphrased because who gives a flying patoot):

1) Zod: ""There's only one way this ends: Either I die, or you die."" Actually, Zod old sport, that's *TWO* ways.

2) Random Generic Female Villain: ""We have an evolutionary advantage, because we have no morality. And as history has shown, evolution always wins."" Always wins WHAT? EVOLUTION?????

3) Lois: ""They say it's all downhill after the first kiss."" Superman: ""I think that only applies if you're kissing a human."" So.... Clark is saying that he's going to get bored with Lois because she's human. Well, forget you too, buddy.

This movie is start to finish a disaster. I hate to operate in hyberbolic absolutes, but if you disagree, even a little, you're wrong, and your opinions from here on out are moot.

5783715,3,B00D91GRA4,"What you are going to see here is ""Man of Steel,"" not ""Superman."" Actually it IS Superman, but not the one you knew in the past. ""Man of Steel"" takes itself very seriously, with the re-imagined DC Comics hero that is much darker than you would expect. This is not surprising after all because the 2013 film is directed by Zack Snyder of ""Watchmen,"" co-produced by Christopher Nolan and written by David S. Goyer, which is based on a story by Nolan and Goyer.

From the very opening that describes the last day of Planet Krypton with spectacular visuals, you know ""Man of Steel"" is going to be different. After the promising start, however, the film's narrative gets more and more complex with frequent flashbacks to Superman/Kal-El's younger days. This might have worked with Christopher Nolan who effectively employs non-linear narrative to make his characters' back stories more intriguing, but Snyder only confuses us, making the film's pace slower than necessary.

When the Kryptonian warriors led by General Zod (Michael Shannon) arrive, the action finally picks up, but despite the big and loud sequences (with flying cars and so many destroyed buildings), the effect-ridden climactic action becomes soon repetitious. No matter how fast and high he flies like a supersonic plane, Superman here (played by Henry Cavill) looks like just another action superhero, humorless and frustrated, and nothing more.

Plus, there is a subplot about a Daily Planet journalist Lois Lane (Amy Adams), who meets Superman in the most contrived way. This is a visually dazzling re-imagination of the Superman saga that could have been much better with a more skilled storyteller.",1381190400,,1667,5.1213235294117645

The film explores Superman's struggle with acceptance and looking for a place to fit in on Earth.  The film is action packed and puts Superman into a predicament that he has never faced before, and yes this film finally lets Superman throw a punch and show off his strength.  In order to become the hero both of his fathers intended, Superman faces a critical choice. Does Superman protect the planet that adopted him and might not accept him, or does he join the genocidal General Zod and ensure the survival of his own race.  Henry Cavill embodies Superman like never before and portrays a Superman that struggles with carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders.  Michael Shannon gives depth to the villain General Zod and plays the villain as a psychotic lunatic, but with a hint of sympathy.  General Zod is a man who has lost everything due to events that will unfold in the prologue and will stop at nothing to accomplish his mission to save his race.  Amy Adams is a great Lois Lane and could have benefitted from some extra screen time to give the relationship more depth, but can be explored further in the inevitable sequel.

5783724,5,B00D91GRA4,"As a Superman fan, this was the reboot I've been waiting for. This movie helped erase all memories of the lackluster Superman Returns and paved the way for a take on the 75 year old character that feels both fresh and energized.

The Good: First and foremost, this is a Sci-Fi story at its core and I loved that most about this movie. It was great to see a look of Krypton that did away with the crystalline structure of the Donner films. This movie feels much closer to some of the more recent comics including elements of John Bryne's Man of Steel and Superman Birthright (where we see Clark traveling around the world and taking up various odd jobs). I really enjoyed the non-linear style of story-telling, it was very reminiscent of Batman Begins. Jumping between an older and younger Clark Kent helped us get to know him, without spending too much time treading on old ground.

Performances: Henry Cavill does an excellent job portraying the Man of Steel. We see a Superman that's lonely, conflicted and struggling to find his place in the world. One of the character traits I, personally have found very relatable. Amy Adams, what can I say, shes awesome. A much better actress and way more attractive than Margot Kidder or to a lesser-extent Kate Bosworth. Michael Shannon nearly stole the show as General Zod, compared to the campy (but still great) performance of Terrance Stamp, we get a Zod that is both ruthless and menacing. Finally, Russell Crowe as Jor-El. One of my favorite characters from the Superman mythos and Crowe absolutely blew me away. He provides the explanations for why Krypton becomes ultimately doomed, why he sends his only son to earth and why Kal-El must use his gifts to help others. Another one of my favorite aspects of the movie was that we got plenty of screen-time with him (both on and off Krypton). I was entertained ;)

Special Effects: The CGI was some of the best I've seen yet! The scenes with Henry flying around are absolutely spectacular and almost realistic looking. Compare that to the final scene in SR where Brandon Routh looks like a poorly modeled PS3 character.

The Not-So-Good: Feels a little rushed in a few areas,Maybe a little too much action for the first movie and not enough time spent developing some of the characters. I'm sure we'll get some more of those in the sequel, but the main focus of this movie is Superman.

5783728,1,B00D91GRA4,"I wasn't expecting much to begin with from this film since I consider the 1977 SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE an amazing film that beautifully captures the essence of what Superman is.  After watching this film, I don't have high homps for this new, twisted franchise that made SUPERMAN RETURNS look like a masterpiece.

It's the screenwriter's and the director's job to establish a cohesive storyline that resolve every point it inserts into the film.  It makes sense to leave a few crumbs that will establish the next set of stories for the franchise but this film did a horrid job of creating a character people can relate to.

Watch it for yourself and see.  You may like it or you may hate it as much as I do since this film is so divisive.

SPOILERS BELOW -- YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!

The things they tried to pull off in this movie were just unbearable --

-The Codex is absolutely BS. Another useless plot point. What the hell was this skull all about and why was it so important? All I saw was a skull jizzing into the embryos of Kryptonians. Granted the connection of Lois to Superman was leaked throughout the news but that doesn't justify taking her back to the ship at all. Again, it was a simple way to use her as a way for Superman to escape, nothing more.

- About this environment BS, we all know Superman gets his power from the sun. They decide to through this wrench of environment issues just to make it ""believable"". Seems like MAN OF STEEL raided AVATAR's closet by having people ride flying animals in Krypton and throwing in the ""we're having atmospheric issues"" for good measure. Superman had over 30 years to get over it but it took Zod 5 min? Please. Lack of atmosphere didn't seem to be an issue for Superman when he decided to fly to the edge of space where there's no atmosphere whatsoever. He seemed happy and ""breathing"" fine.

- With regards to terraforming Earth, what's the point? If Krypton sent thousands of ships for exploration and not 1 was able to create a habitable world after their amazing ""terraforming"", why the hell would Zod think it would work in this instance (BTW, Zod states he's a warrior while Jor El is a Scientist. How the hell were these brute warriors smart enough to change the Phantom Zone equipment to a Warp Drive? Thought that's what scientists do, not warriors). Looks to me the scientists messed up big time developing that terraforming machine.

- What was the point of showing a ship with an kryptonian empty pod?  To me it looked like the director wanted to imply that a Kryptonian did survive when the ship crash landed 20,000 yrs ago and may even be alive.  What happened to that plot point?  Forgotten, much like the brains of the creators of this abomination.

- Couldn't stand the embryos-in-a-ship plotpoint as it held the potential for a can of worms. As for Superman playing abortion doctor, the embryos were on the ship AKA the ""Fortress"" of Solitude that landed over 20,000 years ago that Superman discovers in Canada. The ship was undisturbed for al that time until he showed up. If Superman is supposed to be the only hope for ""his people"" he should have found a way to acclimate them to this world. If HE could survive, why can't they?

- If a group of people as strong as Superman were in town and I were Superman, I would tell them to get the hell out of town. And if the people decided to run screaming, I wouldn't blame them for one bit. That's when genocide comes knocking on your door. A quiet community suddenly disturbed in such a fashion would certainly cause understandable fear and panic. I wouldn't tell them to stay in their homes or businesses. That was just insane to me. If he would have at least moved the fight elsewhere, it would have shown that he was thinking about the welfare of others, not just his mom or Lois.

- Fact is two ships came straight to the Kent Farm to find the Cryo-ship that held Kal El to find the codex (stupid codex). No other reason than that. Can't say there weren't looking as Zod was so pissed that he flipped the car into the house. If the military noticed this (in real life they would have), they would ask: Why go there? What's so important there? Must be important if Lois Lane was at the house to. (Hell, ET handled the arrival of an alien better than this turd).

- Superman's Cryo-Ship. How was that even picked up by the military? They don't know where it is except Superman and Ma Kent. Lois knows how to kickoff the phantom zone but needs the ship. Last I checked, Lois isn't Supergirl nor did she have a spare tow truck lying around. All we see is the ship sitting on a military truck about to be loaded onto a plane. Why didn't Superman just fly the Cryo-ship to the plane? What the hell was he doing that was so important that he couldn't do it himself (risking the exposure of his identity)? Wouldn't that raise questions?

- Superman killing Zod was a low point that was immediately followed up with a shallow comedic scene involving unmanned surveillance plane. People keep comparing Superman to a cop who has to sometimes use lethal force. Difference is a cop isn't faster than a speeding bullet. If cops we're they wouldn't need guns. Why didn't Superman just cover Zod's eyes when he was shooting heat vision at a family of idiots? Why stand there when you can, I don't know, move to the right & out the door? Why didn't Superman just pull a KILL BILL 2 and rip Zod's eyes out (or at the very least gouge them)? Killing is ok but eye removal is too much? You can't heat what you can't see and you certainly can't heat without eyes. Since solar radiation is what powers Kryptonians, why didn't Superman just bury Zod deep in the ground and surround him in lead (lead blocks radiation)? He'd be blind and unable to stay powered without the Sun's Ray. If friggin' smoke from a terraforming machine can weaken Superman in South Asia, why can't he do something similar to Zod?

I love Superman and his history but this movie butchered the character's image. Amazed people don't realize what they're watching. Puppets just enjoying the half-assed special effects and glossing over the obvious mistakes the film had.

Comics Alliance and Mark Waid (writer of SUPERMAN: BIRTHRIGHT and KINGDOM COME) wrote on this as well:

5783729,5,B00D91GRA4,"While I can see and understand some of the complaints against this film, some of them, on the other hand, are hypocritical nonsense.

The internet isn't the best way to put a films reception into perspective. From perusing comic book message boards you would think this is the most hated film of all time. Not so. It is mostly met with favorable praise. But the vocal minority is REALLY vocal on this one. Complaints about structure and editing are one thing (I don't agree with them at all but they are legitimate) but the huge hubbub over the destruction in this film is over the top and frankly all out misguided and downright false.

It seems the internet can't make up it's mind on what they want their Superman to be. For YEARS all fans ever did was say they wanted a Superman movie where he can really show off his powers. They begged and whined and pleaded for a Superman film to deliver the action that the character deserves on screen. And when Superman Returns came out that begging and pleaded grew exponentially. ""WE WANT SUPERMAN TO PUNCH SOMETHING!"" seemed to be the go-to phrase. People finally get what they were whining for and what do they do? They turn their nose up at it.

The way people complain about the action you would think this is nothing but wall to wall mindless explosions. This is not so at all. After the opening scenes on Krypton and a quick rescue on an oil rig the film doesn't have much action until the last act kicks in. The last act is no longer or drawn out than The Avengers ofr any of the Nolan Batman films. In fact I think I read somewhere the finale to Batman Begins is a few minute longer than Man of Steel.

For one thing this is a superhero movie. Two, this isn't only a superhero movie but a SUPERMAN movie! What, you don't expect insane action and visuals? Really? The action in this film is incredible. It's hard hitting, edge of your seat kind of stuff. THIS IS WHAT SUPERMAN SHOULD LOOK LIKE ON THE BIG SCREEN!

Whiny fanboys go on and on and ON about the amount of destruction in this film like it's Supes fault. They literally blame the destruction on Superman like he caused it all. If one simply watches the film with the most minimal amount of attention they will know this is simply, idiotically false. The most purely destructive thing Superman himself directly does is crash Zod through a gas station. Literally everything else is Zods fault. Superman tries the whole last act to stop them and gets his butt handed to him a lot of the time.

Another HUGE misconception is that the final fight in Metropolis is horrible because it's in the middle of the city and causing more death. Again, if people paid a modicum of attention they would have seen that the entire portion of the city they were fighting in is DESERTED. TOTALLY DESERTED. No people around.

I for one am glad the destruction in this film was so realistic. People were shown to really be dying and in peril. Most other superhero films feel safe in this regard, like nobody is really in jeopardy. It's safe, clean destruction. Not so in Man of Steel. It makes Superman feel MORE like a hero and not a perfect action figure imo that he has to struggle and can't save every living soul. Did people really want him to just fly around catching people out of windows the whole time? ""WAH Metropolis got destroyed ans Superman didn't save enough people!"" I'm sorry, did you not see him save the ENTIRE world by destroying the World Engine, which damn near took him out as well? I guess not.

I know I'm ranting but I can't help but feel a lot of the reactions to this film are misguided in the extreme. This is the mythic, larger than life Superman film we've been needing. And mythic is exactly what Superman is. This isn't the joyless shell people are making it out to be either. There is light comedy sprinkled throughout the film. It's the Batman Begins of Superman. I have a feeling if this came out around 2005 or so it wouldn't have gotten the fanboy slamming it did.",1379462400,"1,254",3994,4.454172366621067

5783732,3,B00D91GRA4,"This review is based on seeing the film (last night) in the theater and does not review or rate the DVD and/or Blu-ray or other digital release.

MOS isn't the worst superhero film I've ever seen, but it is something of a disappointment. It actually has a lot of the same issues that Superman Returns had--that is, what to keep from the comics and the Reeves films vs. what to do differently, plus story bloat.

The choices that get put up on the screen in MOS leave me shaking my head. There were so many things done well and yet so many things aggravatingly awful. I think where it really goes wrong is in what is supposed to be the exciting climax vs. Zod.

I like Henry Cavill as Supes, but I think he would make an even better Wolverine. Brandon Routh looked better as Superman in SR's version of the updated tights, in my opinion. Cavill looks more like the guy from Twilight or something in a sculpted body suit (which he doesn't need because his body is so sculpted anyway).

I'll give this a slight edge over Superman Returns. I thought SR had more satisfying moments and was more visually interesting in terms of giving us the world in which Superman is supposed to exist. But the homage to the first two SM films got tiring, and Lex Luthor as the ultimate villain is too under-motivated to take up so much film time. They should have spent more time with BR as CK and/or SM. And they should have made much more of his trip back to Krypton (stuff that was basically cut from the release).

I know many fans will say MOS is more original--because it doesn't draw on the first two Reeve films at all. But visually it seems to recycle a lot of ideas from Dune, Aliens, Spielberg's War of the Worlds, Avatar, even Transformers (and that is not good), etc. The depiction of US military forces doing their thing, done to death in how many films anyway, is just tedious.

I realize that films like SR and MOS are really huge collaborations, but as with the recent ST films, perhaps the producers and directors are bringing in TOO MANY different pieces and visual coherence suffers. It was supposed to be a more 'realistic' Superman, but instead what I saw was this very jarring shift from an intergalactic civilization (that would belong in Green Lantern) to a world that looked like it was filmed more cheaply than Smallville and then to a world that gets destroyed (seriously did Metropolis really look like a real city to anyone, even before it got levelled?).

There just was no really believable social realism to the film (something for example Spielberg got so right in the first hour of War of the Worlds). It did look like he was walking around as a fugitive in the landscape where they filmed the last X-files film.

Another strike against originality is just how much this film draws on Superman Returns--the use of flashbacks to childhood, holographic projections of the dead father, Christ-like imagery in presenting SM--and even in the climactic action of doing something really titanic and confusing with something going on in the ocean that was titanic and confusing, while his powers are being zapped.

And then there is the implausibility of the story once you accept the fantasy reality scenario that is given you--basically the destruction of Krypton. I guess the writers (including Nolan?) subscribe to some sort of theory about civilization collapses, but why Krypton would need Earth and why it couldn't survive in all its previous colonies is beyond me.

Might have worked better had they done a parallel story of two Kryptonians--Supes and Zod. A sort of Abel and Cain story or something?",1379116800,4,3616,4.662480376766091

5783736,2,B00D91GRA4,"Based on the trailer, I thought this would be a fantastic movie, but it failed to deliver. Apart from the fight scenes that were just too long, I didn't feel like there was enough of an internal conflict (which since Superman is invincible is the only good superman plot you can have in my opinion). I never saw Superman himself lean towards not helping people. There were outside forces telling him to hide his powers, but he never had that Peter Parker moment, if you will (the tornado scene doesn't count- that was just Papa Kent being dumb. He went to save his dog and wouldn't let the invincible guy do it. What was he thinking?)

5783737,2,B00D91GRA4,"This is the third revamping of the General Zod storyline. Superman, Smallville and now this. Alex Ross redefined Superman in the comic books and Henry Cavill is obviously designed to fit the image. The problem is that none of the characters are particularly likable. Perry White (Lawrence Fishburne) is now black. Well, I guess that's okay because now the green Lantern of Earth 2, Alan Scott, has come out as being gay in the comics. (Please DC, don't make Robin a victim of child molestation by Bruce Wayne just to be politically correct and honor the memory of Dr. Frederick Wertham, who said as much decades ago in his book, Seduction of the Innocent). All of the performances in Man of Steel seem soulless and wooden. CGI ridden, writing deficient, I felt like I was watching Transformers II. I did not care much for Zod either. Callum Blue was far, far better.

The General Zod storyline didn't really emerge as anyone of significance in the Superman arc until 39 years after the legend began with the first Superman movie, which appears somewhat cheesy today, but there's no excaping the fact that Christopher Reeve made Clark Kent human. Warner Brothers then went and took the evil Zod and turned him into Jor-El when ""Smallville"" was made with Terrance Stamp playing both characters. Lest we not forget that ""Smallville"" also had Clark's girlfriend become Clark's earth mother and his cousin, Kara become his Kryptonian birth mother, leaving one wonder whether Smallville is really somewhere in Kentucky. The fact of the matter is that Zod is not that interesting a character, and why are we made to suffer through a rehash of a storyline that we know the outcome of? At least, Callum Blue added dimension of Zod's character. Henry Cavill's Zod is just angry all the time.

Before DC writers went insane, science on Krypton wasn't that advanced. Krypton didn't have any space travel and the rocket in which baby Kal-El was sent to earth was a prototype. Krypton exploded, because of uranium core that fissioned and Jor-El was a respected scientist, as was Zor-El, his brother. Krypton wasn't in some other galaxy. It was in the Milky Way, and when it exploded, two parts of it had survived: Argo City, which came off as a huge chunk, which continued to revolve around Krypton's sun, and Kandor, which had been stolen, people and all, by Brainiac, who turned out to be a robot, who went around collecting cities from various planets and displaying them in bottles. After Krypton blew up, every bit of ground in Argo City turned to kryptonite, which shouldn't have affected non super Kryptonians, but for some reason it did. Fortunately, apparently, there was a sheet lead factory on the outskirts and Zor-El was able to direct the survivors to roll out tons of it to cover every bit of land, as others  worked furiously to make use of the plastic from the plastic factory to create a huge bubble to hold in the atmosphere. Rockets were later installed underneath the planet fragment (from the steel factory) and with fuel from the jet fuel refinery, propel Argo City to our solar system, which all of the Argonauts gained superpowers. Zor-El, idiot leader, decided this was bad, so back they rocketed to Kryptonian space until around fifteen years later, there is a meteor storm that smashes the dome and using the only other rocket prototype, Zor-El is able to send his only daughter, Kara, to earth, where she becomes ""Superman's Secret Weapon"". As the only other survivor from a dead planet, Supes should have mated with her to renew the Kryptonian race. Forgetting the fact that she was only 15, it was the Kentuckian thing to do. But, he had this thing going for the idiotic earth woman who drove him nuts trying endlessly to destroy the one thing that gave him some measure of peace, his secret identity. Let's not even try and figure how a man with superpowers can have sex with an ordinary person or how his super-sperm didn't blast right through her. On the Tonight Show, Johnny Carson asked Margot Kidder how this was made possible. Kidder, kidding, said that Lois Lane used a kryptonite coil. Or maybe it was the fact that Zor-El and his wife escaped at the last minute into the Safety Zone, a Phantom Zone-type dimension that Zor-El had invented. (several questions: why didn't Jor-El save all of Krypton by projecting them into the Phantom Zone or at least his own family? Or why didn't Zor-El do the same with the Safety Zone. And when Argo City blew off, how was it that there was enough gravity to hold everything and everyone to the planetary chunk? Well, all this took place long before we were all savvy to such things and knew how yellow sun radiation can cause Kryptonians, apparently all built from transuranium elements, to gain superpowers.

The point being that Brainiac was a far more interesting adversary than Zod, as was Metallo, a criminal, given a robot body with a uranium-powered heart that he eventually switches out for kryptonite (hmmm, did Stan Lee steal this concept for Iron Man and a later steal for Robocop?) or the Parasite, a man who gained superhuman strength by absorbing life energy from anyone he came in contact with, including Superman. The Parasite would have been an even greater concept as to why he turned bad, since, like Rogue in X-Men, he could never have a relationship, since his condition would kill anyone who comes near.

There was a great episode of the Adventures of Superman with George Reeves that would have done far better than the storyline here. Season 2, Episode 12: Panic in the Sky, December 5, 1953  ""Superman rams a giant asteroid on a collision course with Earth. The impact causes the asteroid to now orbit the planet. However, Superman is staggered as he returns to Earth. He manages to change back to Clark Kent (apparently a reflex action) but doesn't remember who he is. Meanwhile, the orbiting asteroid still presents hazards for Earth. Only Superman can place an explosive device that will demolish the asteroid -- and no one, including Clark, knows where Superman is."" No villains. No CGI every minute. This was a story about a man who subconsciously just wanted to be like everyone else and had to come to the realization that his own personal life was less important that that of the rest of the world. This was sort of the theme of Superman II. In fact, the best part of all of the Christopher Reeve movies was where Lois Lane dies and, despite Jor-el's warning, Superman turns back time to save her.

So why Zod all the time? And, by the way, in the comic books, Clark would have given out a high-pitched super shriek to cause everyone in the crowd to wince and grab their ears, as he rescued his father. Not let him die.

Man of Steel simply lacks heart, but then I see David S. Goyer as more of a rewriter than a screenwriter. I guess, though, if you have enough money to spend as does Warner Bros., you can bag rocks and label them diamonds. Man of Steel was as much of a disappointment to me as was Prometheus, which was replete with gaping plot holes and riddled with screen written stupidity. But I can't wait to see Ben Affleck as Batman (I say that with extreme sarcasm) in the comic book heroes first filmatic get together (first united in World Finest Comics in 1954).",1378598400,12,7273,4.7032967032967035

I'm not a big fan of remakes, reboots, etc.  I thought the Dark Knight series was fantastic.  I went to see 'Superman Returns' because I like Bryan Singer and because superhero movies are like pizza...even when they're not good, they aren't that bad, knowing that is the type of movie you're going to see.

When I heard Zack Snyder was directing, I thought oh crap.  I thought '300' was a flaming turd of a movie and haven't liked any of his other films either.  However, sometimes people surprise you and Chris Nolan did a great job on Batman, so I thought he might help Zack reel it in a little.  Teaser trailer looked good, so I was hopeful.  The later trailers showed more of it, so I began getting worried again it would be bad.

Henry Cavill is good.  Definitely a little more sullen than the last two Supermans, but no big deal.  Krypton was a bit too stylized for me.

The visual effects are incredible, but that gets boring after a few minutes.  Yep, big, amazing action scenes that drag on too dang long.

I overall liked the movie up until the final battle.  Sure, some of the earlier action could have been toned down about 90%, but not a huge problem.  I like how once he puts on the suit and turns himself into the army he shows them he is cooperating with them, but he certainly doesn't have to and there isn't anything the army can do to control him.  Once the final battle starts, oh man.....big, and looooong.  I thought tossing each other through buildings and it not even effecting them was silly.  Yes, I realize there are human looking aliens that are flying around and I'm accepting that as not silly, but you have to have some way to hurt them or slow them down.  Invincible characters are boring because there is no risk.  Not to mention, they just killed thousands of people by knocking all of those buildings over.  So, after wishing for the end, it came.  Okay, they've just been smashed through how many buildings and had super punches, etc and it didn't even phase them, but Superman can break Zod's neck.  Are you f'n serious.  First off, Superman doesn't kill people.  He is GOOD and he is smart, he would find another way.  Secondly, if a building won't slow you down, and you're basically invincible, how the eff can your neck be broken?  F'N retarded.  While Superman 2 was pretty cheesy, it made more sense how he could defeat them.  He had to take their powers away because the four of them would destroy Earth fighting an un-win-able fight.  I'm not saying the movie should have followed that formula, but the heart of your main character should should remain true to the past 70 years.

Movie should have been 30 minutes shorter and should have toned down the action a lot.

I know lots of people liked this movie.  That's too bad.  I wish it would have tanked so Zack Snyder didn't get the opportunity to screw Batman up as well.",1378425600,6,2933,4.541108986615678

5783743,5,B00D91GRA4,"I don't know what all the complaints were about.  I loved every minute of this movie save for Pa Kent's death...wouldn't it have been better to have him die of cancer or a heart attack where Clark knowingly couldn't save him despite all his powers.  He could've easily ran at super speed, grabbed Pa and ran back under the overpass.  Alas, that's a minor inconvenience.

Now the complaint about all the destruction in Metropolis at the end seemed appropriate at the time but I have a theory:

1. He's not SUPERMAN as we know him..yet.  He's an untrained superhuman battling a veteran soldier.  He was completely acting on impulse against Zod, focused solely on neutralizing Zod at all costs.  The collateral damage wasn't apparent to the rookie Superman.

2. All the damage in the fight is a very logical step in creating a motivation for Lex Luthor to want Superman dead in the sequel (and to use Bruce Wayne to do so).  Here is this alien who can destroy cities at will, why would Lex want this guy to live?

That's why I didn't think the destruction was over the top.  Yes we all wanted to scream at Supes to lead Zod out of the city, but do you think Zod would've followed?  He would have stayed in the city continuing to kill/destroy/maim while Superman tried to lure him out.  He had to fight in the city.

All in all, I loved this movie as a start to a bigger universe.  And Hans Zimmer's music still gives me chills.",1378166400,10,1424,4.44015444015444

5783745,1,B00D91GRA4,"As a 30+ year comic book fan I was in anticipation for this film. I had really loved what the Dark Knight Trilogy had done and Watching the Marvel Cinematic Universe expand from Phase 1 into Phase 2 pushed the whole genre to a new level.

Man of Steel was supposed to be a chance for DC/WB to get their universe started strong and carry it through to an eventual Justice League franchise. I couldn't wait to see that universe unfold. I went opening day with my comic loving friends. As we watched all 3 of us couldn't believe what we were seeing. Horrible wooden dialogue and acting, a plot that seemed too rushed at times and then would speed up at other times, constant flashbacks, uncomfortable awkwardness, and digital effects that seemed out of date and not as seamless as other films in the genre. Really, I felt the quality of the whole film was just terrible. It just wasn't up to the standards as Nolan's Batman or Marvels universe films. Those films have a clear direction and are very confident in themselves. Man of Steel seemed to be a huge mess that didn't really understand what it wanted to say.

When I first saw Iron man and Batman Begins in theaters I remembered thinking ""wow! I can't wait to see what happens next!"" Those films were near perfection, and laid a strong foundation for future films which continued to be great. The only thing I though after Man of Steel was...time to reboot again. In my opinion this was a terrible foundation to start a DC Cinematic Universe and I am scared to see what follows.

If you liked the film I'm glad, I hope it was what you wanted.",1377993600,18,1595,4.455479452054795
5783746,5,B00D91GRA4,"This is the modern Superman film that we have been waiting for. I cannot emphasize that enough. It is not a flawless masterpiece - in spite of the obvious similarities and parallels, this is not on quite the same level as Batman Begins - however, it absolutely gets the conceptual approach that was needed to take this character and re-launch him as a realistic, real-world entity in the heavier landscape of the twenty-first century. Not everyone likes this, but that just goes to demonstrate an ideological divide among viewers.

Superman has spent far too long chained to nostalgia for either his 1930s/1940s origins and/or the aesthetic and tone of Richard Donner's iconic 1978 film. Even in 2006 Superman Returns was looking decades back into the past for inspiration. Not that there is anything wrong with reveling in a franchise's heritage. But that should never consume a character. Man of Steel takes the core concepts and brings them forward to the present, and it does a wonderful job of it.

I used the word ""realistic"" a few sentences back - of course a being with superhuman powers is not a real thing in our world. But this film is science fiction. It is a first-contact story, designed to show how such an event might play out if it did occur. Thus, the characters (all of them, including Superman and the other the Kryptonians) act and react like real people, because they are real people. This version of Krypton involves more of a focus on technology, but it is just advanced technology, not magic. As the saying goes, any sufficiently advanced technology at first seems that way.

Again, I do not consider this film a masterpiece. The script could be better, for one thing, and some of the editing is a bit jumpy. And so forth. But the thing is, Man of Steel's virtues far, far, far outweigh any of its weaknesses. It is beautifully rendered in the cinematography and visual effects, wonderfully cast with a group of terrific actors, and contrary to what some may say, has substantial heart and emotion at its core.

There is the issue of the ending, but for me, it is a complete non-issue. Again, this is intended to be a realistic take on Superman. He is not a god, he is not immune to mistakes or shortcomings, and he is just starting to fully embrace the implications of his heritage and his abilities when everything goes crazy, and the earth and humanity are basically in danger of destruction. Nothing about what happens contradicts the identity of the character. Those who disown this film because of the levels of action or destruction are completely missing the point, if I may be so bold as to say so.

The main thing is that in spite of its imperfections, Man of Steel is a very special film. It is a new type of superhero film. It looks different, feels different, is different. We are fortunate that we were not given just another cartoonish episode or just a retread of what has already been done in the past. This is the opening chapter of a new world. Not everyone will love it or appreciate its qualities, but this mythology is moving forward, and I am energized and inspired to be along for the ride. If you have not seen it yet, approach it with an open mind, treat it like it is really happening, and it may very well take you someplace beautiful and meaningful.",1377993600,13,3303,4.629692832764505

5783750,3,B00D91GRA4,"I was disappointed by the movie and did look forward to its release in theaters. I thought they brought together an awesome cast. My problems with the movie stem from its lack of a cohesive structure, in other words they did a poor job in story telling. I think they had the right idea in presenting the material as aliens have landed but produced a crappy script. The dialog was horrible and it was basically all nonstop action. It begins with a slugfest on Krypton between Jor-el and Zod. Then it goes from Krypton to a ship/oilrig disaster with a grown up Clark saving the day. What happened to his childhood on earth? That was thrown in with flashbacks in between an adult Clark helping and coming to terms with his powers, alla Smallville. Then Zod and company arrives and they start destroying planet. Very poorly put together! The movie would have been much better had they turned to a professional novelist to pen the script as the producers of the classic Christopher Reeve movie did. Had they done so they could have captured the difficulties, humanity and passion of the the character. Instead they focussed solely on the action and special effects. I also would have chosen a different director maybe Steven Spielberg, or Peter Jackson.

5783751,5,B00D91GRA4,"(Note: this is a review of the movie itself, not the discs or packaging or whatnot)

I say that because the premise of X-Men: First Class and Man of Steel have some striking comparisons. But while Marvel chose to focus their heroes on fighting for survival in a dog-eats-dog-eats-mutant world, Christopher Nolan's film portrays Clark Kent, though rejected by most ""normal"" people, as really being ""the better man"". Multiple times in the movie (no spoilers of major plot), Clark comes up against someone who bullies him. And he could crush them. Literally. Most likely with both hands behind his back. But he never does. He always chooses the high road.

In an age where people seem to love a hero with a dark side, Man of Steel reminds us that there is a dividing barrier between good and evil, and you can only go so far before you become what you're trying to fight. But the movie is not preachy by any stretch of the imagination, and there's a lot of super-cool action sequences.

Really, the way the fights play out is some of the best CG stuff I've seen. It actually looks like two titans clashing. Buildings don't just get damaged, they fall like card houses. One guy throws Clark three hundred yards, and instead of just skidding on the pavement, it crumbles around him. Watching in I-MAX 3d, I felt like the whole room was shaking around me.

And of course, the acting is superb, particularly the scenes between Clark and his biological father. What less could we expect from a Nolan film? 5 stars",1377907200,10,1505,4.6254681647940075

5783755,2,B00D91GRA4,"Besides Star Trek Into Darkness, this was literally the disappointment for my summer 2013 movie viewing. The only thing this movie set out to do for me was take my money providing no real entertainment value. It's an overrated mess of a story for the first true comic book super hero.

The ""S"" stands for shaky.
Zach Snyder's cinematography for this movie is such a joke. I'm not talking about the sets, super use of CGI, or look of the film. I'm talking about his over use shaky hand cam he used to film this thing. Every scene, and I'm being serious here, had a shaky documentary effect that proved to be more annoying and completely pointless when watching this film on the big screen. I thought the Hunger Games was annoying. Heck no, this blows that shaky cam issue out of the water! Also there are segments of ""scenery"" of object emphasis that I thought was tailored only for that teaser trailer that ran in front of the Dark Knight Rises. You get that here no matter what, ladies and gentleman. And to top it all off we have another over used camera effect for almost every CGI scenes. A very Battlestar Galactica (redo series) zoom in tactic when anything flies or falls down in this movie. It becomes so predictable with Hans Zimmer score that you could literally turn it into a drinking game. The Dark Knight Trilogy, hell Pacific Rim's, action scenes are tame to Man of Steel's calmer sections. Why do we need to shaky cam a conversation between Pa Kent and young Clark and why do we need to zoom in on Lois's escape pod as it falls to the ground when we clearly see it the first angle? The fight scenes are what you call the meat and the bones of this feature. Some seem to just go on and on like I was watching a hyper violent Anime like Dragon Ball Z. Don't get me wrong here, Zach's intention of Kyrptonians fighting each other would be on the same destruction plane as this, but at least make them interesting and not a chore to get through.

The ""S"" stands for Superfluous.
Oh boy, then the plot! Which had either too much going on or ended up confusing it self with the littlest things. Because we know if Christopher Nolan is involved as producer and David S. Groyer is here to write the story, then we're going to have things overly explained. Segments like the atmosphere issue with Kryptonians, Kal-El being the first natural birth in awhile, the Phantom Drive and exploratory machines, and the codex felt like moments from the infamous plot shotgun (where writers throw ideas into one barrel then blast it at the wall and try to make sense out of it.) Story elements like these could have been explained easier or completely cut out. Remember Superman II, people? The explanation for why Zod and his lackeys are super powered were explained in 5 minuets. NOT ALMOST THE WHOLE MOVIE. So I'll get this out of the way then: If Groyer states that a Wonder Woman movie is impossible to write, but Marvel literally lets a talking raccoon use a machine gun, then I can honestly say that Groyer knows nothing about how to make Superman interesting. I mean they put Zod into this movie for the sake that he is the villain mostly everybody remembers from the old Superman movies. While we don't get any amazing lines like ""KNEEL BEFORE ZOD!"" We get a muddled CGI science fiction plot that was mixed with action scenes that overstayed their welcome. I'm going to say they should have made a live action version of the first three episodes from the Superman The animated series cartoons (seriously, go watch them!), because the technology reeked of a different villain. ""Nah! We'll just use Zod again. Everybody knows Zod. And I like redoing old movie stories. Nobody would would like Brainiac"" as told in my interpretation of David S. Groyer's mind.

The ""S"" stands for Sub-par.
There is no point in going into the full detail of the main actor's Superman because he's about as interesting as a painted brick. He's there to look shiny, but there is not real oomph to it. I have no idea where critics get the idea that the supporting cast was purely awesome.  Amy Adams became the weakest link in the whole bunch with Kevin Costner being bland as ever. No wait, Kal-El's mother was the bland 2 X 4 here. I'm assuming that Kyrptonioan physiology must be that different from humans, but come on! You just gave birth the kid with the imminent destruction of your home planet! I know I would be bawling my eyes out. I guess Russell Crowe's ""space ghost dad"" had some good moments. But because the bleakness of this film, it was hard for me to enjoy most of the acting performances presented. If there was any charm, wit, or humor, well, I certainly didn't notice that much. Like, why am suddenly supposed to care about Jimmy Olsen's replacement? Why am I more of perplexed instead of saddned of Pa Kent's random death? The only person here who knows to bring his ""A game"" to the table was Michael Shannon as Zod. If nothing else, watch it for him, and the commercial placement getting wrecked because they had more characteristics than the rest of the cast. Seiously, the movie should have been called ""Zod Breaks Steel.""

The ""S"" stands for Sort of?
So did I enjoy anything in this movie? Pretty much anytime the camera wasn't shaking or zooming in. Like the epic science fiction Kyrpton segments that showed scale of the Phantom Zone drive. There were scenery shots that reminded me of some of my favorite comic book moments. For example, when Superman finally reveals himself, that scene was something like reading Alex Ross's Kingdom Come. Hans Zimmer's score here is now one of my favorites of his. While there is no triumphant John Williams theme that can make adults and children hum at anytime, this score is full of emotions that makes you want fly or fight for humanity...you know while you destroy your beloved city in the process. When Superman and Zod finally fight just each other, I was actually entertained. I thought to myself, ""this right here is what I paid to see."" Hell, I wasn't even shocked by what Superman had to do at the end of the fight. I myself thought it was a justified action since this could be the lesson for Superman to learn. Then the ""I'm sorry sir, he's just SO hot"" dialogue part happens. BOOM! like an airplane crash, I immediately remembered everything of why I hated this film. Thank you so much Mr. Snyder and Groyer!

The ""S"" stands for Scared.
I am a huge DC comics nerd and I was hoping this movie was going to return some of that inner teen when I watched marathons of the Justice League from the still perfect DC Animated Universe. I was scared that with Snyder directing, because his 300 and Watchmen approaches were, although true to source material, his execution of it ended up as still meh. I understand that this is not the Superman I grew up with and the movie was striving to be something different. I'm open to revamps or reincarnations, but only when they are done right and it's enjoyable to watch as a whole. What we got was a movie that either pleases fans or non fans but also created a huge negative reception from fans and non fans. Usually you strive to please the most, not cause a huge rift between the two. I have no clue what Snyder's attempt was with direction this movie, but I have to assume that he thinks newer audiences always dig grittier things for heroes that usually aren't. Also we apparently have attention spans of fleas with these camera techniques used. The thing that hurts the most? This movie is now Warner Brothers and Legendary picture's template for the DC cinematic Universe, and that is a serious problem. See, the difference between this and Marvel's approach, was that Iron Man was enjoyable from the start and Robert Downey's acting enthusiasm that charms the audience right from the start! For DC, I'm scared of what the next set of movies are going to be like if this is what they base it off of.

I have to point out one final issue: Why was it called ""Man of Steel?"" Was it because it's a Superman movie and the title pertains to one of his many comic identities? At least in The Dark Knight we received Jim Gordon's message for the climax of the film to help personify why Batman is called this, or you know, they say the freaking title and it meant something! In this movie, we get nothing! I'm assuming it's titled that because Kal-El crashed through tons of steel then. I don't know, you tell me!

Well, for now, this ""S"" definitely stands for SUCKS.",1377734400,10,8461,4.53997378768021
5783756,3,B00D91GRA4,"This review is for the actual movie and not the blu ray release.  Re imagining Super-man to make him relevant seems like a daunting task, but Zack Synder, David Goyer, and Christopher Nolan were able to pull it off.  Another obstacle to overcome was creating a new theme for the movie, but I am actually very fond of the soundtrack.  It is very difficult to make someone that has almost every every strength imaginable seem vulnerable, but through some interesting story telling it became somewhat believable.  What I like best about the movie was the indecision that Super-man had about becoming a hero and telling the world about himself.  Johnathan Kent (played very well by Kevin Costner) does a very good job raising his adopted son regarding the good side and bad side of humanity.  This was one of Costner's finer performances.  The best part of the movie actually took lace on the planet Kypton and even though the story was strong, it seemed to fall apart after that.  Once of my biggest complaints is that the movie is too long and I felt like there were extra scenes thrown in to make the movie seem more epic than it needed to be.  Those extra scenes actually took away from the plot and also ruined how good the movie looked because of the poor special effects.  SPOILERS AHEAD: I also didn't care for the fact that most of Metropolis and Smallville were damaged in hopes of replicating the effect of the epic battle at the end of the Avengers.  Most of the damage was not caused by the antagonists, but Super-man as he was trying to ""save"" everyone.

5783760,2,B00D91GRA4,"I was captivated by the trailers for Man of Steel, especially the first two or three of them. I really thought the film was going to delve into the psyche of Superman, to let the audience feel what it would really be like to be in his shoes. Those who've seen the film will remember a very brief scene where he learns how to fly. For me, this is what the movie should've expanded upon. I wanted to see a good hour and a half devoted simply to Clarke learning where he came from and what he was capable of - the joy or whatever feeling he might've had at being able to do the things he can do - all the nitty gritty of what it's like to have super powers. And I wanted it to be done in such a way that I'd buy the whole story, and I'd relate to it. To me this kind of exposition is what can really sell the character as a ""real"" person. Instead, the movie spent a grand total of about 10 minutes exploring the mind of Clarke. Beyond those 10 minutes, the film distances itself from Clarke's psyche and we're left with an unapproachable and larger-than-life character that I personally find boring. Moreover, the film's makers spent time during its promotion talking about how the film would be a serious exploration of the implications of alien life arriving on earth. In reality, the film didn't do any such exploration, and yet again we have to take it as a given that the human characters will just swallow the whole spectacle without question. Overall, the film failed to accomplish what I was hoping it would, which was to create a solid, well-developed, and plausible character for Superman, and instead gives us some sort of Transformers/Independence Day mash-up that I doubt will linger in our minds for more than a few minutes after the first viewing.",1377734400,7,1759,4.432098765432099
5783761,4,B00D91GRA4,"A steady decline in the popularity of happily-ever-after, stereotypical fairy tale princess stories has been apparent for years now, both in the reactions of kids and in the popular movies coming out--stories about feisty, strong young women (instead of damsels in distress) or about mixed-up fairytales are very common nowadays (e.g. Shrek, Enchanted, Tangled, Brave). Accompanying this decline is the decline of the popularity of bland do-gooders who just happen to be invincible to boot. I'm not saying I'm against this; it's just a trend. Kids love Spiderman and Batman, but Superman is just too perfect to relate to, to feel for, and to subsequently root for as a hero. This portrayal of Superman gives him an entirely non-comic book feel, which some comic aficionados can feel is essential to the Superman story and some feel is too corny in this modern day and age. Although I understand those purists and don't necessarily feel as if comics are corny (although I do love the new take on the costume), I love how Christopher Nolan was able to take the popcorn-munching comic flick into a real story with depth and feeling that still kept the bones of the original story. This is a Superman people can relate to and take seriously. His problems are real, and when he keeps his ideals in spite of everything, it's great to see. This is what separates a fun movie from a great one. Though it was a bit too violent at times, I loved the Dark Knight trilogy for this depth of story and feeling, and although I did think the overlong sequences of crumbling buildings were a bit much (after all, what's so interesting about a whole lot of falling buildings?), I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.",1377648000,8,1691,4.774744027303754

We get to see Kal-El's home world unlike any other movie has shown with some tweaks on characters that added more depths to the characters then this is a bad guy and this one is a good guy. I mean the villain has a good reason for being bad, but he just gets twisted at the end. It does a decent job of presenting a story about Kal-El trying to find his way on our planet and how having all these powers can prove to be hard to hide since he seems to find people to save or walk away from to avoid hurting others. The only thing I found a little lacking were the scenes with Lois, her boss Perry, Jimmy Olsen wasn't present in this movie but is mentioned I believe, there wasn't enough story with them it's like there were just there to help the story a bit. When the fighting starts its pretty much the rest of the movie but its nice to see that he's given a challenge, unlike other movies the issue is how to fight a being with godlike powers and is near invincible. The ending wasn't a totally shocker but you see it coming once its set up. And no matter what you say Superman has done it on a very small never of times with no other options available. Christopher Reeves character did it while smiling lol. It'll be interesting to see the sequel with Affleck as the new Batman and how these two confront each other and conform to be a team. It's a great movie I wasn't goin to reveal much if anything if you are one of the few you hasn't seen it yet.",1377648000,3,1509,4.11864406779661

5783764,3,B00D91GRA4,"t was with mixed feeling that I went off to Man of Steel. The trailer actually looked pretty cool, but this is a Zach Snyder film and I loathed 300 (way, way too poor a representation of that most awesome of historical battles), found Watchmen overblown, and was just plain blown by by Sucker Punch. Actually Sucker Punch fascinated me. It was both so bad and so intriguing at the same time -- plus the soundtrack rocks. The film just failed as a film.

In any case, the Superman reboot. Some things I liked:

The visuals and art direction. Boy does a lot of stuff explode.
The soundtrack. Sounds like Batman (not surprising, Hans Zimmer returns).
Henry Cavill is just about right as both Clark and Superman.
Amy Adams is cute as Lois.
Krypton and the Kryptonian technology. It looked cool. Somethings were silly - but it looked cool.
The impressive sense of power given to Superman and his opponents.
Some strong visual references to Superman II.
Russel crow leading Lois through the spaceship.
The fact that both dads were Robin Hood.

Some things that sucked:

Too many explosions. Not enough character development.
Superman's cheesy Kryptonian mom and even cheesier birth sequence.
A lot of the plot feels rushed and barely makes sense.
Everyone seemed very calm and well informed (they needed to be to make the plot work).
The extras (like the Daily Planet staff) = cheesy!
The whole tornado sequence. Fromage!
A lack of any dual identity antics.
The forced ""Clarks gets a job"" sequence at the end.
Michael Shannon as Zod. Lame. Lame. Lame.
Plot holes. Lots of plot holes.

Fundamentally, Man of Steel tries too hard and takes itself too seriously. There is almost no sense of humor. It focuses on plot and background at the expense of character. What arc it attempts, Superman's deliberate act of choice of humanity over his (not highly appealing) Kryptonian comrades is hardly in doubt -- and forced at best. We are treated to numerous statements on the part of both fathers as to Clark becoming the ""kind of man he should be."" Heavy handed to be sure. But still, they kinda, sorta, maybe worked, mostly I think because of the equally heavy handed but effective sound track and slow Synder-esque directorial style.

I really did basically dig the whole Krypton thing and particularly the visuals of the home-world and tech. All that gray particle stuff I interpreted as nano-tech, but who knows what they had in mind. And what the hell with the dragon-fly dragons?

Given that Superman is nigh on indestructible, the insane building smashing during the fights was kind of cool -- until the hundredth building. I mean they really punched through shit. Lots of CGI in this film, most shots. The battle between Superman and Zod was decent, although one does have to wonder given all this invincibility why and how one of them actually can be killed. It didn't make a lot of sense.

There is no subtly to this film. The character driven mechanics of the 1978 Superman and sequel are missing entirely. Lois meets Superman as Superman, there is no Clark Kent reporter or secret identity, and hence one of the amusing/enjoyable things in secret identity superhero stories. This human drama has no room in this film of epic space battles and guys getting slapped through buildings. I can't understate this -- Kryptonians are punched through large solid structures at least 200 times in this film.

Some questions:

How do the new Kryptonians ""powerup"" so fast?
If Superman's dad was so worried about Zod choosing the bloodlines, how come he got to choose them himself?
Why is there only one copy of the codex? And while we are at it, why does it look like a plastic skull?
And #1: if you planet is dying, why do you ""save"" all the villains by tucking them away in a black hole?
Why do the masks/helmets of the bad guys keep fading in and out except to show who they are?
How can the energy drive of the 2 part teraforming machines link up? Some cross planet induction?
Why does Lois get to go on a military bombing mission?
How come everyone in Metropolis hangs out for so long when the killer alien squid of doom shows up?
I can understand how Superman really gets around, but it seems like Lois and the military dudes can teleport.
Why does even young kent have a magnetic attraction to disasters? (tornados, falling buses, exploding oil rigs)
Why doesn't Zod kidnap Superman's mom and use her as leverage?
Why does he explain all his plans? Wait -- he's a comic book villain.
Regardless, it's a watchable film, and certainly Snyder's best yet. It's just not a great film by any means, being about 95% style over substance. Isn't it obvious to these studio types that movies are really all about character? I guess not.

And most amusingly, Man of Steel and The Last of Us (the latest Naughty Dog game) both came out on Friday. Apparently, LTOU grossed more!

Can't wait for the sequel with Batman and the future justice league! Just mad they're waiting so long to release it in blu ray and dvd....Cmon November!!!!",1377475200,7,422,4.4935064935064934
5783766,4,B00D91GRA4,"Man of Steel definitely has a Christopher Nolan influence, but also has the gorgeous Zack Synder cinematography necessary to make the CG believable. This combination makes for the best Superman movie that feels as grounded as aliens fighting can be, and gives you a lot to think about. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer forges it's own path with magnificent pieces that stand out and take place of John Williams well known score respectfully. This movie adds more scifi to Superman lore than most and by doing so makes it seem more viable in modern times. The cast is AAA and Henry Cavil aptly fulfills the role of Superman in all aspects. Clark Kent is effectively developed throughout the film and feels like a believable character. In the film they say that Superman's existence will change things forever and redefine what it means to be human. However instead of capitalizing on these tantalizing thoughts they rap up the film with a Micheal Bay style fight between Superman and Zodd that drags on just a few minutes too long. This fight is followed by a smart wrap up that opens things up for a sequel while completely glossing over that fact that Superman is now emotionally scarred by certain events at the ending of the film. This transition feels forced but is good enough to make you partially overlook it. All in all this is a good Superhero movie that promises a deeper message in the beginning and in my opinion does not deliver by the end. I look for something deeper in movies and did not get that, just a great action movie. Thus knocking this down to a 4/5.",1377475200,3,1571,4.634408602150538
5783767,2,B00D91GRA4,"The Good: The special effects are phenomenal. The fight scenes capture the feel of the Superman: animated series with Superman putting baddies through buildings. Henry Cavill does a solid job with what he is given to work with. From an acting standpoint, Russell Crowe is the best thing about the movie. The movie also presents some interesting twists on the mythology of Superman (or as they refer to him in this movie, Kal-El).
The Bad- The plot, despite all it's tweaks to the known story is at an elementry school level. That may work for some action movies, but for Superman, with 70 years of history I expect a lot more. Here is the plot: General Zod wants to build Krypton on earth. Superman must stop him. There are no sub-plots, good dialogue, character development, and most importantly, no real emotion in this film. Superman is extremely stoic. In the far superior Christopher Reeve films (1,2), you can see Superman take joy in getting a cat out of a tree or saving a kid from plunging to his death at the Niagra falls. He throws a light-hearted quip 'Sorry, only one ride per customer' and flies off. That element was sorely lacking in this film. I guess this is the 'Nolan-ized' version of Superman. Unfortunately, brooding is not an adjective that should ever apply to Superman. So it misses by a mile in terms of characterization.
The Deal: This movie is a bootleg view at best. For a movie with virtually no story, this thing drags for nearly two-and-a-half hours. The best comparsion I can make for this film is that of Star Wars: Episode II, great special effects, but you could care less what happens to any of the characters. Chris Nolan should take a break, between the overthought and convoluted 'Dark Knight Rises' and now this. It looks as if he is suffering from a case of burnout. Any chance they can reboot Superman a third time? They ain't building a franchise based on this movie. It's only marginally better than the loathed 'Superman Returns' This movie has the feel of a Michael Bay movie, explosions for the sake of explosions.  In other words, it's a dumbed down version of Superman, enjoyable special effects and some cool scenes, but I expected something that would do superman justice.

The characters weren't half bad, except for Lois Lane, completely useless. I will give the movie this, it had an awesome soundtrack, thank you Hans Zimmer. If you like the Christopher Reeve Superman, this one has alot more action, and a decent story, but adequate characters, sadly, even Superman.",1377388800,4,630,4.7889908256880735

5783771,5,B00D91GRA4,"First of all I just want to say how happy I am with the packaging update for this movie. This looks so much better, IMO. As for the movie itself, I went in with high expectations. Although the last Zack Snyder film I saw, I didn't like, I had high hopes for Man of Steel. I was richly rewarded. This is a spectacular film on many levels. The music alone is so epic that I just can't stop listening to the soundtrack, it's beautiful, calming, powerful, thoughtful, sweeping, majestic, etc, just like the film itself. It is also such a visual feast that I can't wait to watch it again to pick up things I missed. Henry Cavill did an incredible job as Clark/Kal-El/Superman. Whoah, poor Superman has three personalities, not just two like most Superheroes. Anyway, he looked amazing, and his acting was perfect for the part, IMO. Russell Crowe did a good job as Jor-El, and I liked the scenes on Krypton a lot. It was nice to bring more of Krypton into the cinematic world of Superman. Kevin Costner did an excellent job as Jonathan Kent. Pa Kent's contribution to this film had some controversial elements, but it felt real to me, and I thought Costner' execution of the role was brilliant. Michael Shannon's Zod was very good. I liked his Zod a lot. But, I felt that newcomer Antje Traue as Faroa Ul, Zod's lieutenant was the best villain in the film. She was down right creepy cool! She was more of an enigma than Zod. Her personality was ruthless, and knowing less about her and her motives/motivation made her more intriguing to me. Traue did a marvelous job of making her screen time memorable. I hope she makes it back from the Phantom Zone in upcoming films. Her fight scene with Superman in Smallville was the best one in the entire movie, IMO. There were some problems with the resolutions of the plot in some ways, but I still loved this movie, and can't wait to see it again.",1377302400,4,1884,4.479651162790698
5783772,5,B00D91GRA4,"This movie is simply the film that I've waited my whole life for. First some background on me. I was born march of 1980; right into the Chris Reeves legendary era. Everything that I had growing up was Supes. I got cracked out on Smallville and watched the whole series and then watched the awesome final season on T.V. I have always idolized Superman as the ideal righteous path in life. I have studied his history through pop-culture and his MANY different takes throughout the years. I followed every detail of this film throughout the course of its production; sometimes waking a thin line of being obsessive. I believed that we would get the Superman of OUR current age a proper treatment. I loved this film. I was moved by everything in this movie. As a child of an adoption myself Supermans inner turmoils and finding where he belongs in the world is something that I think everyone can relate to.

Now to the haters. This is not a Marvel popcorn movie. The D.C. Characters were created by more than one guy (Stan Lee) over the course of the past 75 years. There are many ways to tell a legend. Marvel characters have simply not been explored by enough writers to create that legend. I.e. there is only one way to tell a Marvel story. Batman and Superman are the O.G.'s, everyone else is wannabes.

I went to theaters 5 times to see this. Something that I haven't done since Burton's original Batman.

As a matter of fact since the story of Superman is so well nine and dear to all our hearts there should very minor changes (if any) to the original orgin, like Louis Lane knowing the real identity of Superman.

So the basic storyline of this Superman movie is the origin story of Superman. And we see Clark Kent/Superman played by Henry Cavill who I thought was the perfect pick for Superman. Other characters include love interest Lois Lane (Amy Adams), father Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and villainous General Zod (Michael Shannon). They set the stage for the intended new series of a shared universe of DC that will possibly lean towards the set-up for a Justice League movie (not to be confused with the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise and The Avengers).

If you plan on seeing this movie expecting to see a hero you won't.  Henry Cavill is almost as boring as the title sequence in the Christopher Reeves Superman.  Amy Adams left me hating Lois Lane, but not as much as I now hate Perry White.  Michael Shannon gave his best performance, but it was hardly memorable.  You know a film is damned to fail if Russel Crowe is the most captivating actor.  And now the sequel will be sodomizing Batman also?

5783777,4,B00D91GRA4,"My first reaction to ""Man of Steel"" when I heard about it being made was .... Zack Snyder... Who the heck is Zack Snyder. Then I thought, OMG, Not that guy who made The Watchmen and (gulp) Suckerpunch. 2 of the worst comic book movies in my opinion. Only Daredevil and the Ang Lee Hulk film are worse. Then I realized, well... he did also make 300. Now that was a good movie. So even though I was concerned that a director who had 3 of the biggest stinkers I ever watched (lets not forget Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole)to his credit, I figured Nolan would be the one to set the tone. Nolans story was well fleshed out. Yes, we have seen all of this before but it is necessary to do an origins story when trying to reboot a franchise. Batman Begins was excellent and I hoped Man of Steel would be equally so. I wasn't disappointed. Between Nolan's story and Snyders action sequences, it was a very good escape. That is not to say it was perfect or it didn't have its flaws. It did. My biggest gripe was the final battle between Superman and Zod. It was certainly action packed but I felt like the director was simply trying to ""one up"" the Avengers. The destruction of Metropolis was too extreme. Every other building was falling down and in the end, it looked like a nuclear bomb went off. I know that was the point, after all, you had 2 indestructible god like beings battling it out, but again, I just thought it was too much. When Superman finally won that battle, by breaking his biggest rule, I genuinely felt for Superman. I could feel his anguish, and I give credit to Henry Cavill. I was very concerned when I heard he was going to play Superman but when I saw him in the suit, I thought to myself, He IS Superman. The rest of the cast was absolutely perfect. Kevin Costner was totally believable and Russell Crowe was a perfect Jor El. The wonam who played Lara (Supermans biological mother) was heartbreaking as was Diane Lane as Martha Kent. Even Zod's second in command was wonderfully cast. Amy Adams was absolutely beautiful and perfect for Lois Lane. That leaves me with my second gripe. Zod....Michael Shannon, Umm, No. He is a good actor but I did not feel him as Zod for even a second. But then, After Terence Stamp, no one really has a prayer of pulling off Zod. When Stamp so arrogantly commanded ""Kneel before Zod"", yeah, you know what I'm saying. Shannon was a suitable villian, but he just didn't ""feel"" like Zod to me. My third biggest gripe, and its a whopper..... Not once did we hear the signature Superman theme. Yes, I know it was a reboot and they wanted to get as far away from the earlier movies as possible, but Superman, above ALL OTHER super heroes, is identified by his theme music from the original Superman movie. I usually like Hans Zimmers musical scores, but this one was so lacking. Part of it actually sounded like a previous score he did and to me, that is blasphemy. John Williams would never rehash his music for different movies. The decision to avoid the Superman theme music was wrong. They didn't have to use it in its original form, they could have modified it, but they chose to avoid it altogether, and the movie suffers for that.

So, in closing, I'm not usually this verbose with my reviews, but Man of Steel deserved it. My barometer for the quality of a movie is simple. I ask one question. That question is ""Did I enjoy it?"" and the answer is a resounding ""YES""",1377043200,2,3435,4.409448818897638
5783778,4,B00D91GRA4,"Of all the comic book heroes Superman was always my favorite. Personally I never had a problem with the Red Underwear on the outside of his costume and never really thought much about it. However I guess we all have our issues and I can't begrudge someone for that.

Christoper Reeve's Superman although a bit long and dated these days will always be my the bench mark for Superman movies.  Brandon Routh in Superman Returns made a good effort and it was an entertaining film with nicely update special effects.  However he was basically playing Christopher Reeve playing Superman. Again good effort, but alas it may have sunk his career by playing it that way.  Now then flip forward a few years and we now have Man of Steel and Henry Cavil puts on the red cape. This time we have the badly needed reboot of the man with an S on his chest.

Overall the movie is pretty good, and all the actors and actresses played their parts terrifically. The chemistry between Mr Cavil and Ms Adams is very good and is a credit to them that they could play their parts so well. The special effects although extreme where believable and worked when needed.

My issues with this movie concern the climatic battle in Metropolis.  Am I the only that remembers all those 1000s of people who died in New York on 9/11? When you destroy a building in a major city people WILL DIE by the hundreds if not thousands.  If you destroy several large buildings 1000s more will die. Although the special effects where terrific, the battle went on far too long in my opinion. Rather they should have maybe started in Smallville, moved to Metropolis and then taken it into outer space.

Another thing I found slightly annoying was the lack of legacy parts.  In the Christopher Reeve movies they always featured interesting Cameo Appearances by the past actors in bit parts.  They even did this with Superman Returns and it would have been welcomed in this movie.  How about giving the role of the Priest Clark Kent talks to someone like Jack Larson (the original George Reeves Jimmy Olsen)? The role of the Waitress in a Canadian truck stop to Margot Kidder (Ironically this would have been perfect for her, because she is from that region), Perhaps given the role of an elderly dinner in Smallville to Noel Neal. The tough guy trucker who's swings at Clark and comes out only to find his rig mangled; what a perfect part that would have been for Dean Cain. Superman is and was the ultimate superhero; even Marvel's Stan Lee once said in an interview ""none of his creations are anywhere near what Superman is, and anything he tried to create the resembled him would have been a cheap knock off."" That's pretty high praise from a rival. There was all sorts of bit parts that could have been filled by these actors and actresses from ""Superman's Past"".  I appreciate, and fully agree that Superman desperately needed a reboot, but the director should not forget where it came from either.",1377043200,4,2955,4.616412213740458

I'm not a film Critic. I have no credentials. I'm a fan of most things geek. I loved it.

I went to this movie with two mindsets. One mind set was callous one which was saying; ""I can't believe they changed his outfit, they better not screw anything else up."" The other mindset was the open realizing; ""No movie can live up to your imagination. Not Game of Thrones, Not the Hobbit; Nothing can live up to the power of my imagination, so take it as it is and trust that it was done earnestly.""

Superhero movies have been getting better and better with each Generation of them since the death of them in 1997 at the hands of Batman & Robin. In my opinion it started with X-Men in the year 2000, then Spiderman 2002. Not that they were very good but they proved that Comic book are packed with stories primed for the big screen. I think X-Men and Spiderman were the stepping stones for the other comic book movies.

Batman Begins (2005), I believe, set a new standard for origin stories and comic book movies. But the DC universe didn't capitalize on it. They dropped the ball with ""Superman Returns"" (2006); not that it was a bad movie, it just wasn't new, it was still standing on Christopher Reeves.

Instead, someone at Marvel saw the big picture of the universe they created and worked towards presenting the best of that world starting in 2008, Creating Iron-Man, Hulk, Thor and Captain America and bringing them together as the Avengers with Nick Fury and Shield under genius of Joss Whedon. Not only did they succeed but I believe they pulled through with out sacrificing their characters, costume or story.

Now in a post Avengers, post Hulk Smash world DC is getting their act together, but, also, keeping the ""realism"" torch lit by Nolan's Batman Begins. Batman's suit was built with utility in mind. They Couldn't come up with a story to Sell the classic Superman suit to the audience so they threw that away. Not sure if they tried or if that was the first thing to go. However; they did present a Krypton that gave back story enough for a big symbol on the chest and a cape, which was enough for me to acquiesce to the new suit.

Some how as I watched the film, the callous side of me was stripped away. Perhaps I was tired of being mad, bitter, and shaking my fist at people scribbling on things solidified in my imagination. Or perhaps this film captivated me as I watched something new come from the longest lived, most popular, most known superhero of my time.

The amazing action was almost an apology for ""Superman Returns"" and at the same time an answer to the post Avengers' Hulk; ""Can 'Man of Steel' smash?"" Answer: Yes. To me, the action was a big nod to the Superman Fans as to say, you knew all along this is how Superman can fight, and now we can finally make it happen, live action.

The origin, the whole movie was basically Superman's origin story. Honestly, it wasn't until the very end of the movie, nearly the last scene, that I felt like Clark, Kal, actually became Superman. As I watched it and saw him do all the things he did, never in my mind past the notion, ""This is Superman"".

After leaving the Theater and thinking, meditating, I still didn't feel like it was a Superman movie. I still hold Christopher Reeves as THE Superman And Brandon Routh as the next best thing. But the following week I went back and watched it again. I liked it just as much the second time. I still didn't feel ""Superman"" but now this is a new feeling. This is not Superman, but The Man of Steel.

While I disagree that one coming off a very successful run of the BATMAN franchise, which the next installment of this Superman is allegedly going to merge with won't sit on the sidelines, to shut those people up let me say this has a very NOLAN-ISH vibe to the drawn out storytelling, which BTW tends to be almost be a 75 percent rip-off of Lion King only that at least moved and flowed better. So the bottom-line is someone really BORROWED Nolan's long-winded style as well as darkness in telling this latest Superman tale and I MAINTAIN it was Nolan!]

While Nolan certainly brought the ""dark"" back into Batman and kudos for that (even though nothing will top the 1989 Keaton/Nicholson movie)Nolan so over-tells the damn story to death. Each of his Batman trilogies gets worse and worse in that regard since apparently no one puts him on a leash! For those that found that aspect...most notably in the third and final Dark Knight saga....he takes that even farther on this Superman flick! DEAR GOD!!! Nolan can take a scene of a kid picking up a rock and drag it out 15 minutes! While I was curious with this latest reboot of Superman going dark I think Nolan's slow pace destroyed it and all I came away from after watching it was near 3 hours of my life I'll never get back! Beware and if you MUST HAVE wait 6 months after it comes out and get it for a $1.00!!!",1376870400,18,1487,4.466911764705882
5783785,3,B00D91GRA4,"Of any film to be released with Christopher Nolan's name somewhat behind a project it was Man of Steel. What I enjoyed most was the first twenty minutes of the movie that took place on the planet Krypton. I would have enjoyed seeing more of planet Krypton be fleshed out. Then the story comes to earth and that's where I felt everything was rushed. To start, the story was all over the place and was trying to be told through action-set pieces, disasters, and chaos. It was difficult for me to care or understand what Cal-El was going through as he took on the mantel. Cal-El's relationship with Lois Lane was forced considering I didn't feel any kind of chemistry between the two. I think there could have been more character development for Lois and maybe carry the love element into the sequel rather than all in just one film.

Another thing I wasn't a big fan of was there being too much action in the last 45 minutes of the movie. Now it's not like action is terrible to be in a movie but there needs to be balance. The story got muddled in-between with Zach Snyder's style and Christopher Nolan's vision. There were a lot of great elements in the movie: planet Krypton; the S symbol being a sign of hope; and the task in keeping your secret from others and the amount of responsibility placed in the hands of someone who is different from everyone else.

Lastly I will mention one individual who did not disappoint and that was Hans Zimmer. If I can say the one thing that was great it would have to be Hans Zimmer's score for this movie. Hans continues to amaze me and every film he becomes a part of. So for Man of Steel I would say there was potential and unfortunately it became a disappointment. With the sequel of Man of Steel including Batman in the mix I am worried that too much will be forced into the movie; especially if they still have to introduce Lex Luthor, Batman, kryptonite, and how long after it has taken to rebuild the city.",1376784000,5,1953,4.407202216066482
5783786,5,B00D91GRA4,"Wow this is the Best Superman ever...The Donner films were good, but had some major flaws; such as Lex Luthor being a moron the original film(allowing Miss Tessmacher to be alone with Superman after he threatens to kill a city with her mother there--Hackensack,NJ).

In Man of Steel unlike any other Superman film we finally see the internal struggle of Clark Kent to reconcile his super powers with his humanity and his loneliness without making him into a creep(like in Superman Returns). The action is amazing, the story telling is excellent with only a small amount of forgivable flaws...I can't wait till BATMAN and SUPERMAN team up in Man of Steel 2!!!!!! YIPEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also Amy Adams surprisingly makes an excellent Lois Lane. She actually fills the shoes of Lois nicely and at times helps superman and the plot move...and doesn't just scream for superman to help her.",1376784000,6,891,5.061224489795919

I liked some of the earlier Superman movies better where Superman is always portrayed as a good guy, well-liked by everybody, always saving people.  If the Man of Steel had not been arrested, I'd probably give the movie a 5.  But there is a lot of violence.",1376697600,3,532,4.377551020408164

I'm not a film Critic. I have no credentials. I'm a fan of most things geek. I loved it.

I went to this movie with two mindsets. One mind set was callous one which was saying; ""I can't believe they changed his outfit, they better not screw anything else up."" The other mindset was the open realizing; ""No movie can live up to your imagination. Not Game of Thrones, Not the Hobbit; Nothing can live up to the power of my imagination, so take it as it is and trust that it was done earnestly.""

Superhero movies have been getting better and better with each Generation of them since the death of them in 1997 at the hands of Batman & Robin. In my opinion it started with X-Men in the year 2000, then Spiderman 2002. Not that they were very good but they proved that Comic book are packed with stories primed for the big screen. I think X-Men and Spiderman were the stepping stones for the other comic book movies.

Batman Begins (2005), I believe, set a new standard for origin stories and comic book movies. But the DC universe didn't capitalize on it. They dropped the ball with ""Superman Returns"" (2006); not that it was a bad movie, it just wasn't new, it was still standing on Christopher Reeves.

Instead, someone at Marvel saw the big picture of the universe they created and worked towards presenting the best of that world starting in 2008, Creating Iron-Man, Hulk, Thor and Captain America and bringing them together as the Avengers with Nick Fury and Shield under genius of Joss Whedon. Not only did they succeed but I believe they pulled through with out sacrificing their characters, costume or story.

Now in a post Avengers, post Hulk Smash world DC is getting their act together, but, also, keeping the ""realism"" torch lit by Nolan's Batman Begins. Batman's suit was built with utility in mind. They Couldn't come up with a story to Sell the classic Superman suit to the audience so they threw that away. Not sure if they tried or if that was the first thing to go. However; they did present a Krypton that gave back story enough for a big symbol on the chest and a cape, which was enough for me to acquiesce to the new suit.

Some how as I watched the film, the callous side of me was stripped away. Perhaps I was tired of being mad, bitter, and shaking my fist at people scribbling on things solidified in my imagination. Or perhaps this film captivated me as I watched something new come from the longest lived, most popular, most known superhero of my time.

The amazing action was almost an apology for ""Superman Returns"" and at the same time an answer to the post Avengers' Hulk; ""Can 'Man of Steel' smash?"" Answer: Yes. To me, the action was a big nod to the Superman Fans as to say, you knew all along this is how Superman can fight, and now we can finally make it happen, live action.

The origin, the whole movie was basically Superman's origin story. Honestly, it wasn't until the very end of the movie, nearly the last scene, that I felt like Clark, Kal, actually became Superman. As I watched it and saw him do all the things he did, never in my mind past the notion, ""This is Superman"".

After leaving the Theater and thinking, meditating, I still didn't feel like it was a Superman movie. I still hold Christopher Reeves as THE Superman And Brandon Routh as the next best thing. But the following week I went back and watched it again. I liked it just as much the second time. I still didn't feel ""Superman"" but now this is a new feeling. This is not Superman, but The Man of Steel.

Maybe I will see Superman in the next movie, until then, I am happy with the Man of Steel.",1376611200,10,3630,4.4206586826347305
5783790,5,B00D91GRA4,"During The Great Depression two young adult's imagined a hero that would allow them to forget the sorrows of the time.  In 1938 Superman was published by Action Comics and has adapted over the next seventy five years.  The character has become one of the most recognizable characters to date.  The character has had several iterations in book and movie form; including a movie which helped propel this American culture icon to new heights in 1978.  This particular adaptation didn't follow a comic, it bent the archetype to the movie.  Which worked well, Christopher Reeve has become so engrained as this icon that in 2006 Brian Singer's remake Superman Returns became a train wreck.

You are probably thinking ""Why am I getting a history lesson on Superman?""

The reason is simple, many people are only familiar with the adaptation from Richard Donner.  Man Of Steel sought to not only reinvigorate the character but the entire franchise.  Similar to the approach in comics.  They've molded the character into a very real, compassionate character, that is loved by millions.  However, this character has a distinct principal that violates all other characters- he will always be a strong and fast as he needs to be.  Which means this character by nature will always be considered the most powerful character.

All of this information is important is it muddled several viewers; it became a ""you like it"" or ""you don't like it.""  Which from history doesn't bode well with the audience.  The reason this has become evident is because Man Of Steel tries to take too much and pack it into the film.  An example would be Batman Begins, it created a drama which engrossed viewers in a powerful manner. Unfortunately this didn't bode well for a large amount of audience people who wanted to truly see Superman's power with some originality.  The Amazing Spiderman or Superman the movie, they sought to focus on the relate able nature of the character. The Avengers who was an action spectacle, with earths mightiest heroes created havoc in New York City from an alien invasion.

By themselves they are all strong movies as they committed to a style.  Man Of Steel deviated drastically from that approach, it tried to encompass it all.  This had merit and value, which made the movie quite good but not great.  The methodology for telling Kal-El's origin was done uniquely and quickly, which had a very strong flow earlier in the movie.  Some of the modification to the story made it quite odd, especially with Johnathan and Martha Kent.  They are ultimately the ones whom instill the morality of right and wrong for a Godly being.  This lacked severe depth, which ultimately makes the climactic shock at the end extremely difficult to relate or empathize.

The next hurdle was a balance of story and action; clearly Zack Snyder chose the Godly aspect. Really focusing on how young and immature Kal-El is in the usage of his powers; they continually wanted to show how he tried to figure out how to beat the villain.  Also they wanted to show how a structure wasn't able to stand against his presence.  Though this was a nice touch, it became excessive.

They also really wanted you to relate to the character as an outcast, which did move and capture this nature.  Unfortunately by poor editing or a lack of foresight the movie felt choppy especially for a movie at two hours and thirty five minutes.  Almost like they didn't want too much of one style, but more of a balance between the three.  So it made a potentially great movie and made it okay.

Each time I watched it I captured more elements, but it was quickly followed by an imaginative thought about the direction.  Mostly because they chose to be vague rather specific; which made the plot quite opaque when viewing.  You continually created assumptions rather then concrete evidence.  When viewing it and dissecting each aspect it becomes a more full movie, but as a whole it becomes hard to rate it.  Mostly because it tries too hard to be everything.

I would highly recommend the movie, it was enjoyable.  They imagined Superman differently, they did it well but still could be better.  If you are expecting Man Of Steel to be campy, you're mistaken.  It is a darker more serious approach, as I mentioned above is due to them trying to encompass two additional movie elements to the stories tone.  I wouldn't rule the movie out, but go in with an open mind and you might enjoy it.

Hopefully this helps.",1376611200,5,4463,4.765319426336376
5783791,5,B00D91GRA4,"This movie was absolutely fantastic. The effects and action sequences were breathtaking and had me at the edge of my seat for the entire film. Prior to seeing the movie, I was worried that it would consist of nothing but action and a weak plot. My fear was completely unnecessary. The plot is extremely compelling and keeps the audiences riveted. We all know the basics of the story of Superman - but the director does an excellent job of making him somehow more real than we could have hoped for, and has us sympathizing with Clark on a deeply personal level. There is a certain artistic flavor to the way the movie was filmed that makes it edgier and even more satisfying, giving us a cinematic experience that is very difficult to forget. In fact, I found myself back at the theater to see it again in 3D (which made the effects all the more outstanding), and then one more time in 2D once my theater stopped showing it in 3D. As a broke college student who is forced to spend her meager finances very carefully, the fact that I couldn't resist spending almost forty dollars on watching this movie should give you an idea of how absolutely worth it this movie is.",1376524800,7,1166,4.47887323943662

5783794,1,B00D91GRA4,"Warning: may contain some spoilers (but will try to keep from divulging too much).

First, the good:

1. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane were wonderful as Clark Kent's Earthly parents (see ""the bad"" point #1).
2. Clark before embracing his Superman side and out on his soul-searching journey was interesting and fun to watch (see ""the bad"" point #2).
3. The evolution of the battle on Krypton and it's demise was interesting (see ""the bad"" point #3).
4. The kid who was mean but grew up to become the manager of IHOP was amusing, what little there was of him.
5. Lois Lane investigating Superman to figure out who he was.

Now, the bad:

1. The method of Dad's death was ridiculous. There was no reason for that to have played out the way it did; it came across as contrived and forced.
2. Once Clark became Superman and allowed himself to fully embrace that role he became even more sullen and rather lackluster.
3. The battle on Krypton, like all the battles in the movie, went on too long.
4. No matter what they did to each other, no one from Krypton was able to injure each other in any fight until the last battle and the manner of death was nothing that we haven't seen humans do in war movies.
5. Thousands, possibly millions, dead and Superman only reacted to save a human when he saw that it was Lois.
6. Having never been a fan of Superman but willing to give him a try since he was no longer wearing his red underwear on the outside (much like the Batman revamp), I went into this movie hoping to like it but found little redeeming in the plot or Superman himself.
7. I never realized it was possible but there was so much action that it got boring. I almost fell asleep several times. I would jerk back to awareness just as a battle ended thinking that it was finally over only for another battle to start moments later.

I could go on but, really, my last point summed up the worst part of the movie. I hardly blame the actors but rather the final cut person who thought this much action equated to engaging and entertaining.",1376352000,50,2036,4.361477572559367

P.S I really don't know what movie the critics watched, I don't think most of them had an understanding of the character at all...",1376265600,5,470,4.402298850574713
5783797,3,B00D91GRA4,"*SPOILER WARNING*

Man of Steel was good but not great. Heavy emphasis on special effects with a thin story. Reeve's portrayal remains superior though Cavill is convincing as Kal-El (being given more lines might have helped him even more). Cavill did come across as a true pro in the marketing interviews for this film and that counts for a lot. Most but not all of the performances are good. This seems like a remake of Superman: The Movie and Superman II. This slightly different take on the Superman mythology sees Superman discarding his dual identity so don't expect him to be jumping back and forth as Clark Kent (who appears only in the final seconds). Lex Luthor, Otis and Jimmy Olsen are missing. The scene of old Pa Kent (Kevin Costner) dying is particularly irksome and laughable as he is engulfed in a slow-moving tornado while he yells at Young Clark who stands ""helpless"" nearby. Some of the backstory is also changed from Krypton ""reversing its axis"" to a civil war/resource shortage. Admittedly Crowe does a good job as Superman's biological dad but it's hard to forget he is Russell Crowe. Loved certain touches, such as Young Clark reading Plato. The movie plays out in flashback sequences of Young Clark. Those tend to be the best scenes.

Superman's traveling name is only mentioned once or twice and I don't recall Metropolis being mentioned at all. There isn't much to describe in the way of plot development because they don't advance the story beyond a sci-fi alien invasion theme with lots of punches thrown by both sides. Information content is lower than the original (we see more but we don't learn much more). So we don't get as close to the characters since it's mostly Transformers meets Total Recall-like action. The whimsical fun of the original films and comic books is tossed here in favor of a darker Superman which almost works but is not explored sufficiently. The downside is that Superman doesn't seem so super without his powers (it seems to be an attempt to make Superman more ""human"" or real with some but not all of his powers). As a ""Superman spinoff"" it does work well. This is an attempt to re-invigorate the crown jewel of superhero franchises. It is admittedly much better than Superman Returns and the action works for what it is. Visually it looks good with the costumes and CGI but Superman is turned into a sci-fi/boxing story. So forget about all the tall buildings, locomotives and cats to rescue because Kal-El has important work to do. It's worth checking out but it's no ""Dark Knight"" so fans of the franchise are warned. Christopher Nolan lent his name to this work as a producer/writer but don't expect to see his stamp of Batman panache here. Zack Snyder directed Man of Steel and the impressive Dawn of the Dead remake. He does the best he can with the material. The focus on explosions and action allows the CGI to take over. The result is that few of the scenes have any magic. Things just happen. Superman getting arrested was used heavily in the promotions but he is quickly released so it lacks credibility, purpose and plot development. Clark getting beat up by some bully and flying in to save the day in Superman II makes a lot more sense. An amazing score and soundtrack is also missing.

Forget about chemistry between the characters because it's mainly green screen stuff. Most are in their own world. Doesn't look like General Zod was in the same room as the rest of the cast. Zod indicates ""I'm taking over now"" before he is captured 21 seconds later and sent off-world. So they introduced him to set-up the CGI and go 12 rounds with Kal-El? Man of Steel tries too hard to be convincing (""this could really happen"") but it feels restrained as if Superman flying and acting super would turn movie buffs off. It's science fiction and fantasy so why not make it imaginative and dramatic? Box office estimates indicated Man of Steel would gross over $1 billion but it looks like that was optimistic.

5783798,5,B00D91GRA4,This isn't your dad's Super Man. He's much more grounded and the writers made a valiant attempt to explain his abilities with science. The plot of Man of Steel appears to have gone way over peoples heads with it's complexity. Of all the people I've spoken with about the movie very few had any clue about what was really going on. I loved it of course. Fortunately the action and quality provide something for everybody. This is the Batman Begins of the Superman story and I highly recommend it.,1376179200,5,495,4.573033707865169

5783800,5,B00D91GRA4,"Most Superman fans tend to either love it or hate it.  There's certainly at least one scene that is very bold for a Superman movie.  It's made it very controversial, but I think it's what has made the movie go beyond a safe, boring and generic experience.  Viewers were disappointed with Superman Returns because they said it didn't have enough action; now critics say Man of Steel has too much action.

I enjoyed both movies, but they were very different kinds of movies.  Superman Returns was a movie about SUPERMAN - an experienced and recognized hero who sacrifices himself for mankind.

Man of Steel is pre-Superman.  Right now, Clark is someone who is trying to find his place.  He knows he wants to help people; but he's always been helping in small ways.  His whole life he has been holding back his strength and powers.  During the fight with Zod, we can see that this isn't the experienced Superman we are used to.  This is his first time revealing himself and the first time he is ever in a REAL fight.  A fight between Kryptonians is devastating.  He's outnumbered, outmatched, as well as being the most inexperienced.

The devastation caused by the Zod and Superman fight have certainly set the stage for the next movie.

Overall, tt's a more realistic take than any previous Superman movie.  If you are expecting a Christopher Reeve experience with updated special effects, you will be disappointed.  It's not that kind of movie.

My favorites: the extended scene on Krypton (finally!), the updated suit (beautiful), as well as Zod and Faora.
Biggest con: sometimes, the movie just didn't flow from one part to the next - had a sort of ""choppy"" feel.

Still, I loved it.  Saw it several times as soon as it came out and look forward to the release date!",1376092800,10,1767,4.675324675324675
5783801,5,B00D91GRA4,"Warning: This review will contain spoilers, but I'll try my best not to give too much away.

Premise: Zod and his cohorts were sentence to the ""Phantom Zone"" for their crimes against Krypton and right before the planet explodes, they are sent away. But they weren't the only Kryptonians to vacate the planet before its inevitable doom. Jor-El and his wife managed to send their only son, the last natural birth son of Krypton to Earth so that he may live, and with him goes all the hopes and dreams and the future of Krypton. Of course, Zod and his brood escape the Phantom Zone and find themselves on Earth to raise hell and rebuild Krypton. It's up to one man to make sure that doesn't happen.

(I tried not to give too much away in the premise.)

Okay, for those of you who don't already know this about me, I am a HUGE Superman fan. I have every movie, cartoon, and TV series ever made. I even enjoyed watching the 1980's Superboy TV series and if you've ever seen a clip of that, you know just how much of a fan one would have to be to tune into that show every week. Have I read every comic book? No. But that's only because I'm not a comic book reader, but I know his origins and his story just like every other Superman expert.

Now, having said that, I must say the ""Man of Steel"" was THEE Superman I've been waiting for my entire life! I know there's a huge controversy out there regarding the ending of the movie, but that's one of the parts I loved the most. Superman was created in the 30's and let's face it, there was a LOT of injustice going on during that time that was never reflected in the origins of his stories. So a part of me always felt his personality was outdated. Fighting for ""Truth, Justice and The American Way"" leaves a lot open to questions, such as; What is the ""American Way""? How was America founded? That should be the first question you have to ask yourself and the answer isn't necessarily the way Superman should go. One man's truth is another man's lie and One person's Justice is another person's injustice, which is why people are falsely accused and criminals get away with committing crimes. It's a tricky thing that's not always black and white. There are many shades of gray in between.

So let's face it, Superman needed a 21st century reboot and fast! Thank goodness Director Zack Snyder and writer David S. Goyer knew exactly what to do. Superman may be Kryptonian by birth, but all of his ideals are human because that's all he's ever known.  He was raised by humans, loved by them, he's grown up watching them fight and die to protect their family, land, county and those who can't protect themselves. So this is what he should believe in, this is what he should uphold. And in the ""Man of Steel"", he did.

This movie pushed Superman to his limits and it was nice to see him use his abilities to the max. He was paired with villains that left absolutely no room for peaceful negotiations and Superman had to open several cans of whoopass on the lot of them. There was tons of action from beginning to end and I think I sat there in the show with a cheesy grin on my face like the Joker the entire time. I really loved how they did the flashbacks because we didn't need yet another movie showing us how Clark Kent grew to be Superman from the moment he was discovered by Johnathan and Martha Kent. We have the Christopher Reeves Superman for that and the awesome TV show ""Smallville"". So they didn't beat us over the head with his childhood into adulthood, but instead gave us pertinent flashbacks that helped tell his story and the beliefs he had as an adult.

The plot was solid, the action was packed and it doesn't apologize in the least for getting your blood pressure pumped and your heart racing. I can appreciate that. :D

And Henry Cavill was supersexy as Superman. All I can say is; bring on Man of Steel 2 and then the Justice League!!!

5783805,5,B00D91GRA4,"I will admit, I had my doubts about another ""Superman"" movie.  Since the 2006 release of ""Superman Returns"", I was down on Superman.  I had trouble seeing how his story can make a comeback.  Marvel was taking all the fame and glory with ""Iron Man"", ""Hulk"", ""Thor"", ""Captain America"", and ultimately, ""The Avengers"".  Not to mention that the ""Dark Knight Trilogy"" had taken Batman's story to a whole new level.  I was worried that there was no room left or even a but least of chance for Man of Steel hero.  I really did, at first, believe that ""Man of Steel"" was going to fail.

But then I saw the movie in theaters and I was completely corrected by the amazingness of ""Man of Steel!  I was surprised that I actually started loving this movie when it first began!  The story, the acting, and the suspense had me looking on to see what happens next!  For once in my life, I was shocked and excited for this movie.

When I found out that the legendary, ""Christopher Nolan"" had written the story for the film, I was freaking out of my mind!  I knew that I recognized the beautiful development of the world and of the storyline as well.  Christopher Nolan was (and still is) my inspiration.  Since his work on the ""Dark Knight Trilogy"", I have used him as an inspiration.  And then we even have Zach Synder directing the movie too.  I love his work on ""300"" and ""Legend of the Guardians""!

We also have great actors who helped bring their characters to life.  Like Henry Cavill, who did an amazing job at portraying Superman and actually making us feel for him.  A man who is trying to discover who he is and where his place is in this world, while trying to stay hidden from a world that fears him.  Amy Adams's Lois Lane was one of the greatest acting characters I have ever seen!  She completely allowed us to see a ""real"" Lois inside of her and also bring out something new as well.  And we also have the legendary Russell Crowe, who finally brings us a ""badass"" Jor-El.  Russell allows us to see Mr. El in action and also allows us to actually like him and bring out a whole new personality of him too.  But then we have the villain, Zod!  Michael Shannon brings out his ""soldier"" acting and transforms it into something amazing with one of the greatest foes that Superman has ever faced!  We see his evilness and also his will to do what is necessary for the greater good.  He is what a good soldier really is about and Michael brings it to life for the first time.  Both Martha and Jonathan Kent are played by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane, who make everything about them from the comics come to life and show us how they really would be in a movie like this.  And finally, we have Laurence Fishburne, who gives us perhaps the greatest acting as Perry White since the original Superman films.  Not only do we see a familiar Perry White, but we also get to see a little bit of ""Morpheus"" inside his character.  Trust me when I say it, the acting is just amazing from every single actor and the people who chose them did very good!

The storyline of this movie was beautiful and it was so Christopher Nolan-style!  Everything was great in depth of every character, including moments as well.  Despite the lack of character-development, the story of this movie was amazing and it brought back Superman from the grave!  Christopher Nolan understands the world of these superheroes!

This is a movie that is totally worth buying!",1375833600,6,3426,4.443017656500802

The CGI was tremendous, but I must admit that the fight scenes were a bit excessive and tended to run a little long; however, not enough for me to lose interest or not go back and see it again...and again.

5783809,4,B00D91GRA4,"I' am a huge fan of Superman reading his comics when I was a kid along with Conan the Barbarian. First what I liked about the film, I thought casting Cavill as Superman they couldn't' t have found a better actor to fit this role. The director and screen writer, editor of this film, I can' t say much about them! These 3 people made this film into another typical action pack super hero movie! Superman is not typical, he represents more than being your regular super hero than the others do!
 But that is how he is portrayed in comic books with movies this film I do give it credit by making the film up to date. By his costume and the great sequences of Krypton! The tongue and cheek of past Superman movies you will not find here. This movie takes itself seriously and the director wants you as the viewer to do so too! The biggest complaint is the character development in this film was lost and replaced with more action sequences than dialogue.

 For the kids today to know who Superman is they won't by this film! In fact, the violence, religious undertones ( in which Superman is NOT religious)I would be cautious in allowing a child under the age of 10 to view this picture! Watching Cavill is captivating and I will look forward to the second one which I hope they give him more lines to speak than just a couple here and there! Additionally, find another director for this movie is not about a rich man with gadgets but a man from another world who is struggling with inner turmoil of being a man from another planet who is carrying a lot of weight on his shoulders and that weight is to save people in a world he didn't come from but was raised in.",1375660800,5,1660,4.314102564102564

5783813,4,B00D91GRA4,"I didn't really want to see this movie. I'm not a Superman kinda girl. If I was, I prefer Christopher Reeves. The last Superman movie was awful (Superman Returns). However, I did enjoy many elements in this CURRENT installment of the Superman franchise. I liked the more science-fiction element of the movie. It begins on Krypton (sp?) and gives the audience a better understanding of Superman's origins. It actually made sense and didn't rely so much on ""comic book"" logic. It actually sounded plausible.  I'm not a comic book reader, but the stories behind some of these characters are so out there, I'm like ""Yeah, right."" Don't get me wrong. I have enjoyed most of the movies so far that have come from comics, so no hate comments PLEASE!  I watched the cartoons as a kid. I loved X-Men and Spiderman cartoons. Although I did have to adjust to the way the characters were portrayed on the big screen. I never heard much about Iron Man, but the movies are now part of my favorites...Go RDJ!

But I'm getting off the subject. I was impressed with Superman's back story. I liked the fact that he had a spiritual background that was brought prominently to the front. The hero is just an average person like anyone else who is searching for his identity. When he finds it, he has to make a choice.

Henry Cavill does a pretty good job. But he was just big for no earthly reason! Well, they saved money on not having to pad the costume. I think anyone could've played Lois Lane the way Amy Adams portrayed her. And why was Laurence Fishburne in this movie at all? Did he need gas money for his jet or something? Kevin Costner was Kevin Costner, doesn't matter which movie. Loved Christopher Meloni! Ok I just like him because I liked his character on Law & Order so he can do no wrong. Russell Crowe was creepy as always. And the antagonist played by Michael Shannon was convincing, very convincing! His haircut probably added to the (whisper this now:) ""I think he's insane"" factor.

I didn't give it 5 stars because some of the fight scenes were boring. How? They kept repeating the same sequences: someone's thrown into a building completely destroying it and they get up unharmed. Someone ELSE is thrown into a building completely destroying it and they get up unharmed. No variety. Nothing to make me say, ""Did you see that?!"" But I do recommend this movie even if you don't want to see it. It has a plot!

There's moments of quiet conversation going on and yet the camera is shaking like there's an earthquake! WHY?!?!? When I saw this in the theater it was all I could do to keep my lunch down. Now I officially HATE this film bc of stupid ""shakey-cam"". It ruined the entire experience for me. I understand using this technique if there's a reason for it... like the fight sequences. But when there's no reason for the camera to be moving IT SHOULDN'T BE MOVING!!!

I'm not even going to get into how bad Kevin Costner is or the fact that Lawrence Fishburne is completely wasted doing virtually nothing.

5783815,5,B00D91GRA4,This version of Man of Steel did a good job of telling the backstory of Krypton and of his youth then telling the struggles of becoming of the hero that we all love today.,1375315200,3,171,4.0588235294117645
5783816,2,B00D91GRA4,"Zack Snyder (300, Watchman) did an honest job in trying to reinvent the franchise, however he fell short in the most important area, the story.  Man of Steel had no real plot that develops. I don't mind adjusting the lore (SPOILER: Jonathan Kent dies in a twister?), but above all else you need a story that engages me into the characters.  David S. Goyer (Threshold, Flashforward) story that was penned by himself and Synder lacked any real depth or for that matter originality.

I am a huge Superman fan (from Kirk Allen to Dean Cain), and I could even appreciate the better points of Superman Returns a few years back with Brandon Routh as the alien from Krypton which also had major issues, but this film had no ""WOW"" Superman moments. It was like watching 300 (nothing but fighting) meets Transformers (hard to follow who was hitting who) meets Cloverfield (the camera shook even on the most intimate close-ups) meets the remake of Godzilla (what's the point?).

Now, the good things I saw were actually for once Russell Crowe (Gladiator, Les Miserables) was properly cast as the father of Kal El (Superman), Jor El. Although a short part, his pushy nature of guiding his son as well as the earthlings seem every sincere and more so on the scenes where he puts his baby son in the spaceship that takes him to a strange new world.

Okay, Henry Cavill (The Immortals, Stardust) does an honest attempt at playing the American Icon even though he is British. He seems sincere in his convictions and honest to the character. Defiantly a good looking man, but again he as an actor and as a character had very little to stretch his acting muscles on.

Amy Adams (Enchanted, Monster) as Lois Lane, although small in part is always a delight to watch. Once again, she didn't have a lot to work with, but what she did with what she had was good. Amy is a far more talented performer than what they gave her to do here in the movie. Another good, short but memorable performance came from Christopher Maloni (Oz, Law & Order) who plays a military sergeant who is the first one to believe and trust in Superman besides Lois of course, weirdly enough.

Kevin Costner (Dances With Wolves, The Untouchables) as Jonathan Kent and Diane Lane (Perfect Storm, Jumper) as Martha Kent were perfectly cast if not for the re-inventing of the famed Superman lore. Diane was amazing sincere and real while Costner was the most fatherly I have ever seen him perform.

General Zod played like a punked up with steroids version of Adam Ant was performed by Michael Shannon (Take Shelter, The Iceman). Although he looked menacing and shouted well, he didn't have the gravitas as an actor to play the broadly proud and menacing personality that is the character. He just came off like a big bully with special powers. Weak of spirit of conviction  if strong in his efforts of pointless violence.

The film is too dark to be a Superman film. It is not triumphant and proud and downplays the grandeur of what the American Icon has always represented. I hope Synder does not direct the sequel if there is one and coupled with the gloomy cinematography Amir Mokri (Pacific Heights, Queen's Logic), the not so interesting redesigning of the costumes by Michael Wilkinson (Sucker Punch, 300) and the bold and broad but un-heroic score of Hans Zimmer (The Lion king, Pirates of the Caribbean ), I really hope it doesn't destroy the DC Line of super heroes. Although The dark Knight series did okay (Heath Leadger in the second was my favorite even without Batman in it), I just wish that kids could walk out of Superhero movies these days feeling like a superhero themselves and having fun. Like the Avengers film! There were no claps, cheers, boos or applauds during this film. Superman Return's had that and I won't begin to mention the standing cheers of crowds at Christopher Reeve's Superman: The Movie directed by Richard Donner.  I was more than disappointed and I was really looking forward to this one! Go see Star Trek: Into Darkness - it is a far far far far better film (thick with story)!",1375228800,15,4069,4.668994413407821

5783818,5,B00D91GRA4,"First off, this is NOT one of the Donner/Reeves Superman movies, nor is it Superman Returns - that seems to be the beef with many people giving this movie bad reviews.  This movie stands on its own, as those earlier movies did, too.  But, to paraphrase someone else, if you are a true Superman fan, you'd like 'em all.

The movie spends a lot of time delving into the experiences and events shaping Clark Kent's life prior to donning the Superman suit, but without dwelling too long on them (think flashbacks), including the fate of Krypton at the time of his birth.  This also explains his actions once he dons the suit.  At times the movie is fast paced, and as this is in effect an origin story, character development for some of the supporting cast is therefor sacrificed (fodder for sequels?).  Some have commented that the ""spark"" between Superman and Lois is missing, but given the amount of time they spend together in the movie, and under the circumstances they are together, romance would be far-fetched, but their budding relationship is established.  The movie has also been criticized for excessive violence - perhaps, but if a ship load of Kryptonians arrived with the same powers as Superman, and they were intent on destroying Earth to remake it as a new Krypton, wouldn't you expect violence to ensue?  Another criticism I feel is unwarranted is the lack of humor (again, shipload of really bad Kryptonians - where's the humor in that?) - the movie has some humor, but it is subtle - such as when he is learning to fly, or when he is handcuffed...and then there is the episode with the truck.  At no point did I find the movie slow or boring.  To be honest, there were a few things I found questionable - I had a hard time understanding what some things were on Krypton, and it wasn't explained how General Zod and his crew could speak English (especially since they were just alerted to the planet's existence).  I also thought the peoples' (of Earth) reaction to the arrival of aliens from outerspace to be too low-keyed (wouldn't you expect a lot of people to be freaking out?).

The casing was great, and credit must be given to Henry Cavill - he LOOKS like Superman - he could have literally jumped off a page in the comic books.  I'm glad they updated the suit - spandex and the red underpants would have been dated!  And they explained its origin.  However, I can't help wonder about the cape - why?  What purpose does it serve?  If we learn anything in life, it should be the immortal words of Edna 'E'Mode from the incredibles: ""NO CAPES""!

5783819,1,B00D91GRA4,"I hate this movie. It's like picking up a Superman comic fresh from the store, and being forced to read Superman's beginnings all over again, with different artists & illustrations.
How much more is the typical home audience forced to endure another bit of Smallville & Clarks meeting of Lois Lane?
At least the George Reeves television series had a beginning and moved on to many adventures. Christopher Reeve tried, but was met with lame villains & situations. Brandon did fairly well, it showed promise, but Brandon bailed out. His bad. Kirk Alyn was before my time, but his serial still moved on in spite of amateur special effects. My suggestion to Hollywood is to read the Superman encylopedia, & gain some new insight as to Superman universe, a showdown between him & Bizarro would be most welcome. Anything but the continuation of Jor-El's plight at having to let go a son, and seeing so having to see him off into the new world.",1375142400,3,937,4.719512195121951

5783821,4,B00D91GRA4,"This is a theatrical review of ""Man of Steel"" and may contain spoilers.

Like Spider-Man and Batman, Superman gets a reboot as director Zack Snyder, with a big assist from producer Christopher Nolan, conjure a darker setting for the Krypton immigrant. The film opens on the doomed planet Krypton where Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and Lara Lor-Van (Ayelet Zurer) have borne a child, conceived the old fashion way which is illegal based on the government's genetically manipulative mandate. Consistent with Superman lore, the planet will soon self-destruct mostly due poor management by the government.

In actuality both Jor-El and Gen. Zod (Michael Shannon) have beefs with the government, but Zod acts on his own authority which gets him sentenced to a lifetime of floating in space. Jor-El and Lara manage to send baby Kal-El into the void destined for Earth along with some magical codex which will allow Jor-El to materialize later and provide fatherly advice. I was quite impressed with this original act. The artwork is excellent and there is a nice mixture of advanced science mixed in with rides on flying dragon-like creatures.

As the scene changes quickly to Clark Kent working on a fishing boat then a young Clark having to ""save"" a school bus that plunges into a lake, I'm wondering where all those earlier years went. We do get to fill in the gaps as the film occasionally goes into flashback. What makes this second act compelling is that we understand Clark/Kal-El's dilemma. His adoptive parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent (nicely played by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane), believe Clark (a bulked up Henry Cavill) should keep his super powers a secret. They are rightly concerned that this ""difference"" will ultimately be detrimental to his growth. Mankind has a history of not always accepting others who may be different.

Clark eventually leaves Kansas searching for the right answers. This leads him to the Arctic where he finds his biological father in the form of a codex hologram. Jor-El suggests that Clark was sent to Earth to improve human existence where they failed on Krypton. Lois Lane (Amy Adams) has entered the picture by now. She's a prize winning reporter who is searching for the mysterious man who has saved many lives.

""Man of Steel"" does depart from familiar legend in several ways. First, Superman is only spoken once that I recall. The ""S"" on the eventual suit is a Krypton symbol, not an ""S."" While Superman can indeed be weakened, it isn't by some glowing green rock. Most interesting of all is that, there are few secrets between Clark and Lois. We don't have to ask ourselves why Lois doesn't recognize that ""Sup"" is Clark with horned-rimmed glasses.

So where does this movie begin to falter. In the final act, as Superman must deal with Zod who was freed when Krypton exploded. Zod, and his hot lieutenant and man hater Faora-Ul (Antje Traue), want the illegally conceived Kal-El destroyed and wants to take over Earth for his own species. The movie goes into full out ""Transformer""-styled destructive mode. While some will feel this adrenaline rush is needed after the cerebral middle section, I found it tedious, loud and frankly, pretty boring. We've all seen it before in ""Thor,"" ""The Avengers"" and many other movies. It goes on forever. It's as if the producers said, ""Hey, we've still got some budget left, let's get the computerized wreckage in high gear."" Those looking for romance and humor will find little of it here. I suspect we may see more of that in the next episode. A final note. I saw this movie on a big screen (not IMAX) and in 3-D. I found the 3-D to be very good if conservative. That's the way I like it.",1375056000,4,3670,4.82670906200318

I am a movie buff, and have watched all the top 100 most successful movies of all time. This movie deserves nothing but 5 stars. Why? Because it emphasizes the human element of Kal-El, a.k.a. Superman, why is he here on Earth and how important he is for mankind.

In addition to that the movie features mind blowing special effects that will put ""The Avengers"" to shame. By mind blowing, I mean, crazy, out of the world, never before seen action...that WILL blow your mind! If you have grown up reading comic books, and if you really like action-packed/special effects, then you WILL appreciate what's in this movie.

5783824,2,B00D91GRA4,"I really really wanted to like this film.  I so wanted Superman to received a movie worthy of his enduring affection in the public eye (and in mine).  I came out of Man of Steel wishing it had been made by someone else and hoping there will be no sequel produced by this team.

Why?  To be honest I think they were embarrassed by their subject matter.  The word ""Superman"" is barely mentioned.  His colours are muted and strong attempts are made to turn the Man of Steel into the Son of God.  (He's 33 years old.  He's been wandering in the wilderness.  He's a powerful being hiding among men with the requisite beard.  His scenes with his adoptive parents reinforce the image).  To be honest I highly doubt his Jewish creators intended him to be Jesus but apparently super-powered Jesus is less embarrassing than Superman to Nolan and co.  Not to mention the fact the thing is as serious as a sermon.  There is little-to-no fun to be had here with only a moment of joy when the young Supes flies for the first time and a couple of clever bits of business, mostly involving Russell Crowe.

If you know the Superman story there are no surprises and it's retold here (twice over in case the 30 minute prologue didn't do it for you).  To me it felt like going down a list and checking off element after element.  The editing was awkward, jarring at times.  The music was lifted straight out of Inception (though I don't blame Zimmer.  Who could find much fresh inspiration in the awkward and perfunctory script?)  It was almost as if the movie wasn't made for earth at all but for distribution to some far-away planet where no one knew anything about Superman.  It's a primer, a beginning.  It fills in but it has very little to say, especially if you know anything about Superman going into it.

There is an emotional story to be told with Superman but it wasn't told here. I didn't feel a thing aside from an uncomfortable boredom.

It wasn't all bad.  There were a few effective scenes.  I especially loved the cleverly orchestrated escape from a certain Kryptonian vessel, assisted by an effectively played holographic blast from the past.  I also liked that they found a much more interesting way to handicap Supes than throwing Kyrptonite at him.  The way the interloper's powers developed as they went along was also a nice idea.  There are even nods to Wayne Enterprises and Luthorcorp.  There was potential but the heart of the thing was in the wrong place.

The cast were good, certainly very (very) earnest.

Superman/Clark himself was a blank slate, low on personality, but that was more due to the clumsy script than Cavill's efforts.  Zod was angry and driven (and that's it).  Lois was bold and curious (though used in a very contrived way).  Everyone was just as you'd expect if Superman was a joyless franchise.

Colour is desaturated as if Metroplis has been mistaken for Gotham City and Superman, who risked exposure for a handful of kids on a bus at one point, is knocking down sky-scrapers without a care in the overly-long fight scenes that make up the second part of the film, apparently giving no thought to the civilian population (Also known as Acting Out of Character).

Nolan may get Batman but he doesn't appear to get Superman and I am not sure he minds.  Batman was made for love. I left feeling Man of Steel was made for money.  Nolan doesn't know how to come at his subject matter.  He doesn't know that you can be a little silly so long as you give Superman a real challenge and some balance.  Superman is good, he's almost too good, and if he isn't tempered he can be dry and dull.  He can be a Sunday sermon, an overpowered boy scout, and little more.  (Perhaps Nolan should have watch Captain America: the First Avenger to get some ideas on how to give a spirited treatment to a slightly hokey ideal).

In Nolan's Gotham there was more fun to be had than in its less oppressive sister city.  After sitting through this joyless retelling I firmly believe there is something wrong with that.

5783825,3,B00D91GRA4,"I have read quite a few of the reviews for MOS and they go from absolutely loving it to those who hated it. I saw it only once and my initial reaction was disappointment. I was hoping for something more. I've seen enough of Luthor and Zod, It would have been better to have Brainiac or Darkseid or even Bizarro. I know this is a superhero movie with ""The Super Hero Of All Times"". It would be nice to blend more story line with the action[ C.G.I. destruction of Metropolis.]I have seen IronMan3 and Star Trek and Man of Steel this Summer and frankly I am getting tired of all the destruction that has  been displayed on the screen. Sometimes less is more. Speaking of more the next movie will have Superman and Batman together. D.C. and Warner Bros. it is unfortunate that Marvel has left them in the dust. By the time they release a Justice League of America movie Marvel will probably be releasing Avengers 3! P.S. I am a Big Superman  Fan I am old enough to remember seeing the last few years of ""The Adventures Of SuperMan"" on it's initial airing.

5783826,3,B00D91GRA4,"I wanted to love this so badly.  Snyder, Nolan, Cavill, Crowe, Shannon...Failure seemed nearly impossible. I must confess to being let-down. I am not a huge Superman fan. I did enjoy the Christoper Reeve versions but that's about it. I'm a Batman fan. But when I heard this was coming out, for some reason I was giddy with excitement. While others were in shock that a British man would be playing Superman, I was excited. I had just finished watching The Tudors when the announcement was made(Cavill is fantastic in it!) and I was surprised, and excited. Henry Cavill is a great actor. Subtle, but commanding. I did not mind his Superman. In fact, his brooding nature was a positive in my mind. I wanted a more serious version of Superman than the ones previously made. Cavill is not at fault here.

The main problem with Man of Steel is it just feels discombobulated. The pacing felt off and the flashbacks, which I assume were supposed to help form a backstory, just felt out of place. They took you away from the drama and distorted the focus of the film. It's nice to see how Clark established himself as a human, always trying to fit in. His life was clearly not an easy one, but he was certainly loved by his adoptive parents ( Diane Lane and Kevin Costner). It's not that I minded the flashbacks aspect of it, I just didn't quite like the way they were handled.

Amy Adams is adorable. But she isn't Louis Lane. She isn't even pretending to be a reporter. She offered nothing to this tale, not even romantic attachement. Her 'relationship' with Clark felt forced and just odd. She might as well have been eliminated from the film alltogether.

Michael Shannon as Zod did OK with what he had, although it was a bit over the top at points. His climactic fight scene with Superman was borderline comical since they managed to destroy 90% of Metropolis within minutes. His backstory isn't very interesting either.

There are quite a few things going for Man of Steel-Visual effects, musical score, his costume(which I really liked), and of course Superman himself. But the rest has to be factored in as well. I was not blown away, but it certainly is a valiant effort.",1374796800,12,2172,4.602067183462532
5783827,5,B00D91GRA4,"I will preface this by saying I have never been a superman fan-I found the movies starring Christopher Reeve silly and dated. There are some movies that are timeless (star wars), and other that, to me, just come off cheesy and reek of the time period they were made in. I guess it comes down to taste. I know others who are staunch fans of the Reeve Superman films and I wouldn't try to convince them otherwise. They just never appealed to me.

I loved this movie. I loved Henry Cavill as Superman, and the story IMO was very involved and a bit darker to match today's taste. The special effects were top notch, Amy Adams was adorable as Lois Lane, and I really enjoyed Kevin Costner and Russel Crowe as Kal El/Clark's two fathers. Michael Shannon was a great villain who had motivation for what he was doing, something I often find lacking in these super hero movies. The villain often has some lame reason for chasing our hero, but here it was justified. I saw it in IMAX 3D and was amazed, especially at the final showdown.

I guess it depends on your taste-there were some older people in the theater I was in who left-there is A LOT of violence/fighting in the last 1/3 of the movie, so if you are looking for the innocent comic book fare of the old movies this might not be for you.

5783832,3,B00D91GRA4,"You'll have to forgive me. I don't ""gush"" about movies, ever, and I am not in the habit of rating action movies or superhero movies with 5 stars. But my choice to rate Man of Steel so highly is not my own. Well actually, it is my own. But it was my own several weeks ago, when I saw Man of Steel in the cinema.

Below is what I wrote, or rather, transcribed, as the words flowed from my fingers through the keyboard. This is a moment captured in time, written several hours after I saw the film. They are my thoughts on the film before I had a chance to think it over, to contemplate it, to read what the critics thought.

These were my INITIAL feelings on Man of Steel:

  ""WOW! Now THIS is how to do a Superman movie! For once, a film that lives up to the hype! For once, a film that makes Superman compelling, relateable, and conflicted. Sure, it's nothing like the comics! There's little humour, less warmth, and Superman is given the Dark Knight treatment (and proves that he can stand up to it, unlike some other superheroes. Marc Webb, I am looking directly at you (Thanks for ruining The Amazing Spider-Man)). But the entire cast gives stunning roles: Crowe and Costner manage the weightier bits with ease, Cavill is perfect (mastering the human side and the super side of Kal-El, and looking the part 100%), Adams is good, but feels underutilized. Shannon oozes menace and quivering rage, and Lane is great too.

  The villains are a real menace, with Shannon managing to keep up with Terrence Stamp (a very hard act to follow), and the other Kryptonians providing muscle and real danger. For once, Superman feels vulnerable and weak compared to these machines of war. This is superhero fighting without arrows, webs, batarangs, or hammers. This is superheroes fighting down and dirty, mano el mano. Matrix style, with less kung fu and bullet time.

  The action is grand, gritty, and intense. The score by Hans Zimmer is brilliant and blood-rousing! Nolan appears to be keeping Snyder's wilder side grounded (No ramping! No super--slow motion!). The result is a large, sprawling, and weighty Superman movie. Where Iron Man 3 was perfect popcorn Marvel entertainment, Man of Steel strives for something greater. It does not always reach it, but when it does, the result is truly incredible.

THIS! IS! SUPERMAN! 4.5 Stars!""

Woah. Check that out. I really WAS gushing. I was using ALL-CAPS and exclamation marks. I inserted a slightly cheesy Zack Snyder joke. I must not have been in my right mind.

And I wasn't.

The film had overwhelmed me. There was just too much to comprehend. My brain was still in awe from booming Zimmer music, darkly comedic and completely awesome one-liners, gigantic all-destroying setpieces, and the sight of two Spandex-clad superheroes throwing punches that would level a city.

If I was to rate the film now, I would probably give it 4 stars, not 5. I see now, why critical reception has been mixed. There is an absence of strong female characters. The plot is jumbled and does not always work. What on earth was up with hologram Jor-El? There is just TOO much CGI city destruction (and you though Transformers was bad), and the casual attitude in which superheroes destroy gigantic buildings, most likely killing thousands, is, well, sickening. And Superman does something completely unlike Superman - he kills.

Man of Steel is, like Zack Snyder's 300, a relatively simple minded affair. A film where you leave your brain at the door. Lots of action, lots of six-packs, a lot of punching, and not many female characters.
And like 300, the action is superb and intense and gritty, the six-packs are present, the punching is awesome, and the result is an epic (I say this in the truest sense of the word) action superhero film.

I repeat my praise for the actors. I felt Henry Cavill turned in a (literal) towering performance. Michael Shannon was a quivering, bellowing mass of rage. Superman's two dads are perfect. Both Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner moved me to (metaphorical) tears with ""You will give the people an ideal to strive towards. They will race behind you, they will stumble, they will fall. But in time, they will join you in the sun. In time, you will help them accomplish wonders,"" and pretty much anything Costner said. Seriously, Costner was TERRIFIC!

You may pine for the simplicity and the charm of Superman I, and Christopher Reeves' dimple and forelock. I certainly pined for the criminally underrated Superman Returns (don't kill me for it, please, please, please), since it captured the Big Blue Boy Scout side of Superman. But Man of Steel is in a category of it's own.

It is not a wholly seamless film. It has many, many problems. But I ask you to overlook that, and see the greatness beyond. I feel the words of Jor-El are appropriate in describing Man of Steel: It stumbles, it falls. But in time, it accomplishes WONDERS.

The result is nothing short of amazing.

UPDATE: I've reconsidered and realized this movie is a giant disappointment.
P.S. Go easy on the dislike button for my past self's sake. He didn't know what he was doing. I'm just following orders...Please..please!",1374624000,13,5154,4.748040313549832
5783833,3,B00D91GRA4,"Man of Steel highlights just how far special effects have come since the 1978 Superman film. In Man of Steel, Superman really looks like a man suspended in flight, compared to the 1978 film, where Superman looks like he is suspended in front of a jittery screen. In addition, there are plenty of explosions, CGI-laden battles and an epic bad guy showdown--in short, everything you'd expect from a big-budget summer blockbuster. On the downside, there was a great deal of product placement in the movie. The Daily Planet is not a real newspaper, so why do the businesses need to be real? Some of the ads are downright intrusive, so much so that they momentarily stall the action. The worst ad appears toward the end of the movie, when Superman takes off into the air from a street. When this happens, the camera doesn't follow Superman's path; instead, it stays focused on the street. Now, why did the audience need to see that shot? Why didn't the camera immediately follow Superman? Obviously, the director wanted the audience to see a Sears store on the street, even though that put a temporary lull in the action. That was such a blatant product placement that some people in the audience laughed. There were also some odd scenes involving Lois Lane. What was she doing aboard a military aircraft carrying a special weapon designed to kill the bad guys? She's a reporter, not a bombardier. And when an alien small arm fell into her hands, how did she know how to fire it? Lois Lane should have played a minor role in the film, since she doesn't investigate Superman until Clark Kent is working at the Daily Planet. Overall, MOS is a flawed but entertaining movie.",1374624000,6,1666,4.689419795221843
5783834,5,B00D91GRA4,"A Superman movie that shows a well rounded character that is still a hero (if a green one). Serious without being forlorn (I'm looking at you Superman Returns), and seriously action packed. Placing such a huge Earth threatening event at the beginning of his career gave us a story that made the hero truly worth watching. While some may have felt that this caused too much destruction and loss of human life for a Superman movie, I would say that Superman himself is still presented as a hero we know. He is constantly fighting to save the world and  believes in the sanctity of life.

*****************
Without spoiling too much, the ""controversial"" ending, actually shows more about why Superman does not kill than I have seen in any medium. Any human being would have no qualms about stopping a mass murderer to stop them from killing others, but for Superman this turns into an issue he wrestles with at his core, leading to begging a psychopath to not making him go any further and tears.
********************

The implied body count may have been high in one city, but it creates a situation where one hero saves the whole world (First time we have seen that in a Superman movie yet). It also presents a threat so big that we actually worry about whether the hero can succeed, or even survive the onslaught. Most people complain that they don't like Superman because everything is too easy for him (at least in most movie portrayals). It was interesting to see a viable threat that makes him struggle without the crutch of Kryptonite.

Its a 3D post-convert and while in the theater it wasn't the best 3D ever it was better than most post-converts. The Highlight 3D scene is definitely a back-story-exposition scene with Jor-El. It is done with Art-Deco statues and is a beautifully rendered 3D scene that hopefully the Blu Ray will be able replicate faithfully.",1374537600,8,1868,4.7384615384615385

Zack, Henry and the rest of the team successfully updated the Man of Steel for a modern world and audience without alienating long time fans. He's still all that is Superman, just in a modern world, with modern consequences.

And then as the film rolled I sunk lower and lower in my seat until I just couldn't stand it anymore and left when the final battle got underway. Believe the negative reviews from many of the professional film critics. Nolan might have been involved as a producer, but he wasn't the principal script writer and he wasn't the director, and that makes all the difference. The script was terrible. The direction was terrible. The only reason I can come up with for the film's popularity among so many Superman fans is that they have been so hungry for a film that they would have liked almost anything. I give it 2 stars for at least trying to make Superman relevant again.

The thing to remember is that even though Superman has Kryptonian abilities, his personality is 100% human. He was raised since infancy on a farm in Kansas. He might feel different, but at heart he is a small town American and this film completely missed that. In focusing on the 'alien among us' angle, they gutted Superman's personality that was so well portrayed by Christopher Reeve and Brandon Routh. The Clark Kent we have all come to know and love through the years was completely missing. There were so many elements of the plot that made no sense. There was CGI overkill. Superman Returns had some plot problems, and could have put Superman in a few more action scenes, but overall that movie was far more faithful to the origins of the Superman character.

The fact that Avengers was so successful should prove that a superhero movie doesn't have to copy The Dark Knight to be a hit. A superhero movie can be light, it can be funny, it can be human, and still be a fantastic movie. I have nothing to say about the relationship of this movie to recent comic book adaptations or graphic novels. As a movie, it is no better than all the other CGI-fests out there with tons of explosions and destruction. Superman is supposed to be special.",1374451200,27,2060,4.549865229110512

Of course, ""Man of Steel"" is better than any current standalone Marvel Comics movie (i.e., Captain America, Thor, The Incredible Hulk, or any of the Iron Man trilogy). But the question most people may ask is: ""Is it better than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marvel-s-The-Avengers/dp/B008NCSZQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marvel's The Avengers</a>?"" More on that in a moment.

Anyone who knows me knows I'm a big Supermen fan and not much of a Marvel fan (save for Daredevil and The Punisher), but I can honestly say that ""The Avengers"" was an excellent film -- the most perfect (next to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dark-Knight-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B001GZ6QDS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>) comic book adaptation to date. When critiquing a comic book film, I not only look at story, acting, and directing, but also if the film sticks to or addresses the original material. Both Marvel and DC comic characters' origins have been retconned, reimagined and rewritten so many times over the years since they first were originally introduced to the world that filmmakers have had a lot of material with which to work. And while some creative license is allowed, the story must stay mostly true to the comic book story and the characters have to definitely stay true to their comic book counterparts.

I remember seeing the original 1978&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-The-Movie-Four-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000IJ79UW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman - The Movie (Four-Disc Special Edition)</a>, starring Christopher Reeve, and loving it. I still love it to this day. But that Superman was one for younger and/or more general audiences -- a tongue-in-cheek Lex Luthor, his goofy, bumbling sidekick Otis, the sexy, misunderstood ""bad"" girl Miss Teschmacher, and a Lois Lane who is nothing short of annoying. Reeve's performance was excellent, but, as most Superman fans can tell you, his Clark Kent was the C.K. of old. The new Clark Kent -- while still a little bit of a klutz and wearing glasses -- isn't quite so dorky (think Tom Welling's portrayal from The CW's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smallville-The-Complete-Series/dp/B004XWLN20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smallville: The Complete Series</a>). Also, no offense to Richard Donner's masterpiece, but the 1978 film simply does not achieve the greatness of the comic and who Clark Kent/Kal-El/Superman has become over the years since. When I was a kid and a teenager, I always preferred Batman to Superman because Batman was a darker comic and darker character; his parents were murdered, people died. The teen angst in me related to him and his plight. Whereas Superman -- at the time -- seemed like a goody-two-shoes, a boy scout. And while he still may be that kind of superhero, as I've grown, my admiration for the Kryptonian has grown, seeing how he has more problems than one may contemplate. If you were to think more about Superman's plight, you'd see that he doesn't have it so easy either. There are many philosophical complexities and moral dilemmas presented in Superman's stories. ""Man of Steel"" features all of these complexities of Kal-El's existence:

  1) The knowledge that despite his love for humans and his feeling of being one, knowing he will always be an outsider -- check!
  2) The knowledge that any time an alien comes to defeat him or make him suffer, it is his mere presence on Earth that brings them there so he believes any destruction or human casualty is his fault -- check!
  3) The knowledge that any small physical reaction could lead to instant disaster and would garner great scrutiny and fear from the humans he so loves -- check!
  4) Having to truly sacrifice those he loves the most ... even meaning letting loved ones die for the ""greater good"" -- check!
  5) Being solely opposed to killing ... no matter good or evil -- check!

It has been reported that the ""controversy"" (if that's what you want to call it) of ""Man of Steel"" particularly touches on two aspects of the film. One involves that last bullet point I just mentioned. The other is the destruction of Metropolis at the end of the film when Superman (Henry Cavill) fights General Zod (Michael Shannon) and his Kryptonian cronies -- an inevitable result considering a bunch of super-powered alien beings are there to take over the planet and trying to kill Superman (this is definitely no Superman II where Superman flies away to avoid destruction and human casualties). The fact that the destruction of a city is even an issue proves that critics and audiences are merely nitpicking for any negative criticism they can find. Was there a lot of this nitpicking when ""The Avengers,"" ""Watchmen,"" ""Transformers 3,"" or ""G.I. Joe"" were released (and that doesn't include all of the numerous alien-related films where New York is destroyed)? Did their destruction of a city sully the film's worth? Besides, if you want to get into semantics, then you have to remember that Superman has unlimited strength and can move at the speed of light, so I'm sure the city could be rebuilt in no time. Besides, if it weren't for the heavy action you expect from a Superman film, then those same critics who are moaning about the destruction of a city would be saying how little action there was in the film (remember what most people said about Bryan Singer's 2006&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-Returns-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000J10ERO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman Returns (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>?).

So ... onto the question I originally posed: Is ""Man of Steel"" better than ""The Avengers?"" Yes. And I'll tell you why. Basically the same type of threat that was in ""The Avengers"" (i.e. a demigod being attempting to have alien beings take over Earth, starting with a major city) is the same threat in Man of Steel. The one major difference? The threat that took an entire superhero team (and a few random regular humans) to diffuse in ""The Avengers"" took only one man (and a few random regular humans) in ""Man of Steel!"" But it's just not that. Man of Steel takes the audience into every aspect of Superman's character (his birth and more background into his birth parents and home planet, his formative years, and his reclaiming his heritage and powers), and also injects some of the new origin material that has inhabited the comics for the past few years. The scope is massive and Snyder pulls it off without making the audience roll their eyes. To say this is not your grandfather's or father's Superman is a huge understatement! ""Man of Steel"" introduces the audience to the contemporary Superman. Nolan and screenwriting partner David S. Goyer inject more of the alien world and technology of Krypton into the story, which is necessary seeing how the main hero and villain(s) are alien (Kryptonian) and this is an origin story. The film explores both Clark's farm-bred past and his isolated present, which is what makes the story so great. Unlike ""Avengers,"" which would not have worked if not for each character (save Hawkeye and Black Widow) having their own respective movie before its release, ""Man of Steel"" shows both Kal-El and Zod's background, almost making Zod a character with which to sympathize. In fact, there is a bit of art imitating life when it comes to Zod's views as well as the reason behind Krypton's fate. But I cannot go into those points without giving away the story.

I believe an updated cinematic origin and retelling of Superman is long overdue, and Nolan, Snyder and company have greatly succeeded! The acting is well-done, the writing is stellar (with plenty of quotable lines), there is plenty of action (at least enough of what a fan would expect from a Superman movie), and every major complexity of Kal-El's life is conveyed in all of its bittersweet glory. Plus, there are hidden hints at the existence of both Lex Luthor (see the tractor trailer logos?) and Bruce Wayne (see the satellite Zod throws at Superman?). What more could a true fan ask for?

****SPOILER ALERT****

Some may not like the fact that Lois Lane (Amy Adams) finds out Superman's true identity but I thought it was a breath of fresh air. Honestly, how could a respective, professional reporter like Lois not tell who Clark was just because of him wearing glasses?

****END OF SPOILER****

Some critics did not like the way particular characters were treated but I found all situations understandable and adding more depth to the story. It should be pointed out that if Nolan & company did a somewhat ""traditional"" origin story -- the same one all audiences have seen over and over again -- critics and audiences alike would be quick to point it out and complain about how unoriginal and ho-hum the film would be. If there are two things that ""Man of Steel"" is not, it's unoriginal and ho-hum! These people are just overly critical blowhards who can't be pleased. And for anyone who thought any part of the film's story was confusing, I'd wonder where they were coming from as I found the film's story not that difficult to follow. When you go to see ""Man of Steel,"" prepare for lots of action, a good glimpse at Krypton, a touching story and the epic beginning of a spectacular universe of characters! If ""Man of Steel"" is the beginning franchise in what DC Comics Films will be offering, we're in for one hell of a fun, imaginative, heartfelt, cool ride! ""Man of Steel"" is the best big movie of the summer and the best action film I've seen so far this year!",1374364800,18,10473,5.449105490438002

All I can say is that I think Warner Brothers was more on the right track with ""Superman Returns"" than with MOS.  I am really sorry to see that they decided to go this direction with Superman.  Mr. Nolan, Mr. Synder and everyone else involved with the making of this film have all but destroyed a great American icon.

I've read some reviews that said there was not enough character development and that the final third of the film had too much action. I don't agree with either of those opinions. I thought the setup with Clark searching for his origins was really well done, I thought the use of flashbacks moved things along faster and was very interesting, and I loved the way Lois tracked him down and the way their first meeting went.

As far as the action and special effects went. Wow!! I will say that I can understand how some people would feel that the length and intensity of the action at the end might be exhausting, but in my case, I have been wanting to see Superman in that kind of building-collapsing slugfest since I first HEARD of the character. It was GREAT!! And the part where you see Zod gaining the power of flight and taking off his Kryptonian armor was truly scary. I found myself thinking, ""Jeez, if Superman doesn't take him down right now, he may not be able to later, and the world will be lost!"".

Reeve's portrayal was too goofy, cheesy, corny and sweet which may be what the 1970s want. Nowadays the tougher audience deserves a true Man of Steel and Cavill's portrayal as an alien demi-god who is not 100% perfect yet fits the bill. No saving kittens from tree tops for little girl, thank god! I also enjoy the plot even if the last battle scene is a tad long. But all the devastations that the haters complain about are realistic and needed as we are talking about clashes of titans here. The special effects are fantastic and the fast moving plot kept me glued to the screen and in my seat.

5783860,5,B00D91GRA4,"The Man Of Steel is back and this time for good! What I like about this take of the character is that Snyder, Goyer, and Nolan kept his mythos mostly the same but also added in their own realistic tone to give Superman a go for this generation and for those past and in the future. This version also did not tip toe around the fact that Superman was and is an action packed character and with Snyder its a win all around. Also worth noting is Snyder used a handheld camera for I believe the entire film yet except for 2 or so scenes it wasn't noticeable and it didn't annoy me or anyone really and in fact it made the film more ""real"" and less polished, it also helped give you the feeling a man really can fly, again! All in all this is a faithful adaptation that is worth repeated viewings and will be looked back upon as the film that gave Superman his popularity back and added some more in depth mythos. 5/5 stars.

Note: The cast was remarkable! Henry nailed the character just as much as Reeve if not better and Kevin and Russell were excellent in their respective father roles.",1374019200,12,1085,4.266990291262136

  In the middle of the movie there was a very emotional part and I cried.  It was probably the most I've cried in a movie (I haven't seen Les Miserable's yet :-).)
  The movie had some very engaging action parts and a few funny parts (I wish they could've put a few more funny parts in.  Oh well, there's always the sequel.)
  I thought they picked a very nice Lois Lane (Amy Adams)  and an Exceptional Kal-el/Clark Kent/Superman (Henry Cavill).

5783862,3,B00D91GRA4,"*Spoiler Alert*

Though Man Of Steel had great production values, a handsome Superman (Henry Cavill), a brilliant Jor-El (Russell Crowe), and a competent cast overall, I found this to be a dark, militaristic version of the Superman tale. The film starts well, with Jor-El and Lara launching their infant son into space to avoid the destruction of Krypton. Russell Crowe was wonderful as always and looked awesome in his spandex (he must have worked out hard to achieve spandex perfection!). But I found other elements of the film less wonderful; for example, Kevin Costner was playing Kevin Costner, and I felt that though she was good, Diane Lane was miscast as Ma Kent. But I went along with the story changes and understood the desire of the director to take a different direction with the mythology, at least until the last 40 or so minutes when the movie degenerated into a repetitive and un-exciting battle between Kryptonians Superman and General Zod. It gets tiring watching super people throwing one another through buildings and destroying an entire city, especially when at the end of the fight, Superman simply wrings Zod's neck and kills him. Why didn't he do it 40 minutes earlier? (Okay, 38 minutes sooner) If Zod was going to die, why put us through so much overdone CGI? Also, in the original comics and previous incarnations of Superman, Superman NEVER killed anyone! Super villains were returned to the Phantom Zone, or wherever they came from. Crooks were sent to jail. Superman never ever would have wrung someone's neck. I found the gratuitous violence totally unnecessary and felt it denigrated the heroic qualities we look for in any re-telling of the Superman story.

I would have given the movie 3 1/2 half stars if I had the option because there were many good elements, but I couldn't bring myself to give it 4 stars, so 3 it is. I know they'll do a sequel of some kind, and am not looking forward to it. For this re-boot, one was enough.

Christopher Reeve's Superman was more fun, more true to the creators' vision, and suitable for kids to see. Reeve played 2 parts: the bumbling Clark Kent and the beautiful, charming Superman, contrasted with Cavill's single characterization of a Superman filled with angst and uncertainty, which for a guy who can fly and resist being killed by normal means, seemed a bit tough to believe. I suppose I'd recommend the movie if only to watch Crowe steal the show as he so often does.",1374019200,23,2450,4.787234042553192
5783863,4,B00D91GRA4,"Let me start by saying this that I'm a HUGE DC/Superman fan. I have every seen single animated or regular superman movie that has ever been made. Justice league, Superman vs Doomsday, All Star Superman, Superman/Batman apocalypse etc and all Reeves movies. I was really excited for this movie and watched it in Imax 3d with my gf and some friends. First of all Henry Cavill is so far the BEST Superman. Although I didn't like who they picked for Lois Lane. Seriously Lois is suppose to be hot not mild. Zod was good, so was Russell crowe. What I didn't like about this movie is that it just didn't have the depth it needed.

SPOILER ALERT
Some of the things that really bothered me.
- Superman values Human life but beats Zod through buildings filled with people without any concern of people getting killed? I counted at least 8 buildings
- Kryptonians captura Martha Kent and simply just let her go? Really the evil geniuses didn't know they could use her to get to Kal el?
- Clark revealed himself to Lois way to soon.

Over all its a decent movie except for some plot holes. I hope they use less CGI in the next one and make it more realistic and give the story more depth.",1374019200,6,1177,4.394495412844036

If you don't like sci-fi this will give you a change at heart. There are some negative reviews and comments about this movie and trust me I've read and watched a ton of them. Some said it had too much action...uh it's a comic book movie based on one of greatest of all time. I mean do you want a superman that saves kittens out of trees lol. Some didn't like the movie at all because Super-Man is now wearing his underwear under his pants...I know right. One person said it was boring, and no its not again I've seen it 4 times. And some have seen it 9 or more it really is that good. However I will agree on something, the character development. I'll admit that some of the other characters didn't matter all that much but who cares read the title of the movie that's what its all about. I love where this movie went, I mean comic books every so often are reinvented. Change is good. The beginning is beautiful, the middle is exhilarating, and the end as in the very end is awesome. Get this movie its worth the buy. If you're skeptical rent it for a $1.50 when it hits Redbox. P.S.

5783865,5,B00D91GRA4,"First off, I would like to thank Henry Cavil for stepping into the role of Superman. His presence & prowess has been noted in the film. I would like to think of Henry as our generation Christopher Reeve. Yes. A milestone indeed when you consider Reeve as the iconic Superman. I have been a big fan of ""Superman"" since growing up. I love ""Man Of Steel"" because they took a different approach to Superman's life. We never had an in depth look of Krypton. Most of my remembrance of that was readings from comics. Krypton and its people was explained & examined in such a way that led the movie from start to finish. I am a firm believer of needing a story before putting anything on film and everything else comes after. Not only that, but the comic fans will follow the movie closely. Pleasing them will not be easy because of previously failed attempts.

The movie never disappointed me in any way. I actually like this version of Superman better because is more realistic. Especially, the debatable actions of what Superman did towards the end. It really showed how much compassion Superman has for his adopted planet. We all have to make hard choices at one time or another but like Kevin Costner said in the movie, ""What you choose to be either bad or good will have a great effect on the planet."" Especially, with someone of his god like caliber. Having good parents is the root of having good kids. Whether if your an orphan, adopted, or an alien being from another planet. The rules still applies the same.

As for the actions in this film. Wow! Especially, when watching on IMAX 3D. I had to go see it twice. It was that good! The scale of fight scenes magnified 100x times more than the likeness of Superman 2. Personally, I can't wait for the 2nd Man of Steel movie. Who will the next villain(s) be? Hopefully, with all the Easter Eggs I saw in the film I will eventually get to see the Justice League movie made. I am crossing my fingers! I definitely know that it will beat out the Avengers. The key is how will DC approach Wonder Woman? An iconic female super hero of all times. I believe she will pave the way for the Justice League.

5783866,4,B00D91GRA4,"After being hyped up for months on end with trailers, pictures, and secrets about this movie, it's over.  Superman has arrived in a new cool suit.

Wow, where do you begin?  Well, how about Russell Crowe delivering a baby on the dying planet of Krypton.  I often wonder if alien planets were out there, would their technology look as cool as the stuff we imagine?  Kudos to the minds who thought up these visuals.  Perhaps they had an alien muse from Area 51. Aside from the nifty technology, Crowe was great throughout the picture alive and dead (you'll have to figure that one out).

Move onto planet earth with Kevin Costner and Diane Lane, more legends on the screen giving great performances.  The movie offers insight into Superman's younger years with terrific performance from the young lad (Dylan Sprayberry), who plays his part.  It's an internal struggle that Clark must journey on his own to find his identify.  His earthly father teaches him wisdom and restraint with his gifts, until he finally meets his real father and learns of his origins and why he is on planet earth.

Enter cute Amy Adams who plays Lois Lane, destined to fall in love with Superman.  As one army woman says at the end, ""I think he's hot.""  And hot he is!  Henry Cavill did a great job in the role with the internal identity struggle and the will to do good among the humans he has lived with for thirty-plus years.  It's not until the end in order to save the planet does he finally succumb to willfully killing another to save others.  Amy is cute in her own right, falling in love with a handsome well-dressed alien in red and blue, but she is also acquainted with the man in jeans and a tee shirt.  I'm sorry, but you just can't help but wonder what making love to Superman would be like - perhaps we shouldn't go down that road.

The technology of the aliens is quite cool.  The alien ships, suits, and costumes are unique. Though many humans are killed in the battle for earth, there isn't a lot of blood and gore.

The only complaint I really had about the movie was the lengthy fight scenes between Superman and the aliens.  They seemed to go on forever, and frankly I think they could have cut a good half-hour out of the movie.  All right, you get the point, it's a fight of evil and good, but a few good cuts on the editing floor would have done the movie better.  My guess is the guys in special effects were like kids having too much fun seeing how many walls and buildings they could throw Superman and his enemies through.

Of course, as you watch the movie you think things like -- How can he fly in space without air?  How can he get beat up for a half hour straight and not have a scratch or drop of blood on him?  How can he walk through fire?  How can he breathe under water? How could society recover at the end with so much devastation?  The list goes on and on - but hey, it's Superman!  I suppose if we ever do get invaded by aliens, I'd like this dude on my side.

It's quite obvious at the end that sequels are coming, because it ends with Clark Kent getting a job at the Daily Planet to blend into society. Of course, Lois Lane, who has probably kissed him a few more times by now, knows his secret!

One more note, Hans Zimmer does a great job at a musical score.  A bit dark like the Dark Knight, but nonetheless quite good.  I love the guy's music anyway.

Is it worth the watch?  Sure.  Just for the story and the visuals, plus the top-notch stars in the movie.  Is it worth two-hours and twenty-three minutes?  I could have done with one and forty-five and less fighting between Superman and Zod (played by Michael Shannon), who by the way is one of those damn villains who just won't die!

All in all, Superman is just super. It is not a movie filled with jokes and lighthearted scenes. It's serious. He overcomes obstacles constantly when he should have died at least twenty times in the movie from all that he went through to save the human race.  Probably a little over-the-top but that's the movies.  It's all make believe, epic sci-fi special effects, and cute Henry Cavill in one good looking suit.

And it's not an ""S"" on his chest - it's a symbol that means hope.  But on earth, it's an ""S"" to us, standing for Superman.  There are some great lines in the movie that stay with you.

""You will give the people an ideal to strive towards. They will race behind you, they will stumble, they will fall. But in time, they will join you in the sun. In time, you will help them accomplish wonders.""

If only the human race could really accomplish wonders and rise above a Zod mentality. Surely, we need someone to show us the way, even if it's in a movie.",1374019200,6,4676,4.341407151095733
5783867,5,B00D91GRA4,"This is my first review so I will keep it short and try not to give a long winded review that gives you vertigo...

First off, I am a fan of Zach Snyder, at least I have been since 300 and Watchmen, so I was happy to hear he would helm this movie, which from the point of its conception would forever be linked and compared to all previous Superman movies including the classic Reeve era Superman Movies and the quite frankly disappointing Superman Returns. Now Christopher Nolan produced and co-wrote this movie with David S Goyer, who wrote The Dark Knight Trilogy which was directed by Nolan, if your a fan of The Dark Knight trilogy you wouldn't have passed up a chance to see this then would you? However even if Christian Bale seems to scrawny in your eyes compared to the conventional Batman physique or his take on how Batman should sound (less Kevin Conroy deepness and more dog getting sick), it shouldn't deter you from enjoying this movie which seems a little Dark Knight esque(realistic) but has heavy fantasy elements woven in

To The Movie:

The plot itself is fairly straight in terms of Superman vs Bad guy, in this iteration General Zod. The opening scenes of the movie are very heavy on the special effects which these days make you think ''that scene, was it filmed on Krypton'', you know if your gullable and/or an idiot or crazy. In my opinion the Krypton scenes give you a taste of the scale of the movies which prepares you for later on when the scale is shoved down your throat, in a good way sort of. We get to experience Krypton's end, Kal-El's(Superman) birth, Jor-El and Lara-El's (Supermans Birth Parents) race to save their son. Not from Krypton's end as you would think but from Zod and his hunt for 'The Codex' which serves as a plot device for the opening scenes and ultimately the movie. The emotional essence of these scenes allow the viewer to get invested in the characters and gives you a sense of the sacrifice some make for others and for what is morally right.
At several points in this movie, it strays back and forth to the past, and present time to tell the story of Kal El on Earth, as a child, as a man trying to find his place and his struggle with his heritage as The Last Son of Krypton, although sometimes this format may slow the movie or confuse some, I think it was handled well and doesn't cause discomfort or kill the pace. Kal-El is forced from exile and the shadows when Zod, after being trapped in The Phantom Zone (Kryptonion prison) escapes and sets out to retrieve the codex from Kal-El's transport ship which brought him to Earth. Introducing himself to the conscious of his Father aboard a scout ship Kal-El transforms into Superman by donning his iconic Suit/Armor which has been kept on a scout ship in the arctic (plot-hole anyone?), setting out to save the day and become, at his father's request Earth's savior and Kryptons last hope. However Zod the ever present obstacle of the House of El stands in his way, ever a formidable enemy to superman who is played by very talented actor(Michael Shannon 'Premium Rush','The Iceman',Boardwalk Empire'). While Lois Lane and Martha/Johnathan Kent(Kal-Els adoptive parents), serves as a grounding for Superman to his Earth/Human heritage, not all of Humanity is accepting of Superman and so after many run-ins with the Military and the scared defensive nature of human kind there is room for Superman to earn his place among Humans and become Earths Mightiest hero(yes I went there), by rising to protect all that Superman stands for, Freedom, Justice and Hope to which he wears proudly on his chest.

Soon after the movies intro and the characters are established and the plot is fleshed out with heavy reliance on comic book heritage and fresh takes on Supermans mythology. The movies explodes with action and consequences that satisfy your lust for explosions, carnage, carnage and lots more carnage and once the dust settles will leave you feeling shaken and disorientated, soon after it will shake,shock and throw you in the air again right until the end credits.
The ending of the movies, rest assured does give a degree of closure and will also leave you wanting more, but that's for you to decide. I found an enjoyable movie in 'Man of Steel' as I am a long time Superman Fan and was not disappointed with what I saw. Regardless I recommend you see it if you have not already.

The Actors/Acting

Henry Cavill: SUPERMAN/KAL-EL: A very convincing Superman. Superb acting with really intense emotion displayed by someone who clearly has the acting chops to reign in this kind of role with poise and if I may say perfection. I'm not going to say better/worse that reeve because this isn't a comparison but a damn good Superman.

Amy Adams: LOIS LANE: Not my first choice for Lois, but a terrific actress with enough heavy duty roles under her belt to command enough respect in this role and who plays it a little loose if not relaxed and therefore never really fits into the role but manages to pull it all together where it counts.

Michael Shannon: GENERAL ZOD: Just a great actor who really brings the heat to a psychotic villain that while doesn't so much terrify you but gets the movie racing and provides some darkness and quite a large obstacle for our hero to overcome, an antagonist if there ever was one

Antje Traue: FOARA-UL: Our secondary antagonist and Zod's right hand man(so to speak, all right fine 'right hand woman') who is played by someone who is unknown to most but so very clearly talented. A truly badass chick who really shines in this movie. Very intense

Russell Crowe: JOR EL: Played very well by Crowe and the right choice for this role in my opinion, Shows true compassion and intense emotions, exempt when he's a machine/mind interface, then it weird

Kevin Costner: JOHNATHAN KENT: A great role for Costner who delivers greatness to this role, his acting breathes life into a very important part of Supermans life and journey as well as the overall emotional tone of the movie

Diane Lane: MARTHA KENT: A woman who needs no praise and deserves no less in my book, plays her character well who acts as Supermans anchor to is Human side

Many other cast members in this movie deserve praise for their acting ability and their character portrayal's who under Snyder's direction shine in their respective roles.

With Snyder's Direction and Nolan's Influence and writing this movie sticks to a proven method of Superhero Entertainment on par with Batman and Marvels iterations, it raises the bar in scale and storytelling that gives comic book fans hope for future movies from the DC lineup like Wonder Woman and Flash, while sticking to proven methods for bringing the genre to a wider audience. A good fun movie that's enjoyable and thoroughly entertaining 9.5/10

5783868,5,B00D91GRA4,"This is my first review so I will keep it short and try not to give a long winded review that gives you vertigo...

First off, I am a fan of Zach Snyder, at least I have been since 300 and Watchmen, so I was happy to hear he would helm this movie, which from the point of its conception would forever be linked and compared to all previous Superman movies including the classic Reeve era Superman Movies and the quite frankly disappointing Superman Returns. Now Christopher Nolan produced and co-wrote this movie with David S Goyer, who wrote The Dark Knight Trilogy which was directed by Nolan, if your a fan of The Dark Knight trilogy you wouldn't have passed up a chance to see this then would you? However even if Christian Bale seems to scrawny in your eyes compared to the conventional Batman physique or his take on how Batman should sound (less Kevin Conroy deepness and more dog getting sick), it shouldn't deter you from enjoying this movie which seems a little Dark Knight esque(realistic) but has heavy fantasy elements woven in

To The Movie:

The plot itself is fairly straight in terms of Superman vs Bad guy, in this iteration General Zod. The opening scenes of the movie are very heavy on the special effects which these days make you think ''that scene, was it filmed on Krypton'', you know if your gullable and/or an idiot or crazy. In my opinion the Krypton scenes give you a taste of the scale of the movies which prepares you for later on when the scale is shoved down your throat, in a good way sort of. We get to experience Krypton's end, Kal-El's(Superman) birth, Jor-El and Lara-El's (Supermans Birth Parents) race to save their son. Not from Krypton's end as you would think but from Zod and his hunt for 'The Codex' which serves as a plot device for the opening scenes and ultimately the movie. The emotional essence of these scenes allow the viewer to get invested in the characters and gives you a sense of the sacrifice some make for others and for what is morally right.
  At several points in this movie, it strays back and forth to the past, and present time to tell the story of Kal El on Earth, as a child, as a man trying to find his place and his struggle with his heritage as The Last Son of Krypton, although sometimes this format may slow the movie or confuse some, I think it was handled well and doesn't cause discomfort or kill the pace. Kal-El is forced from exile and the shadows when Zod, after being trapped in The Phantom Zone (Kryptonion prison) escapes and sets out to retrieve the codex from Kal-El's transport ship which brought him to Earth. Introducing himself to the conscious of his Father aboard a scout ship Kal-El transforms into Superman by donning his iconic Suit/Armor which has been kept on a scout ship in the arctic (plot-hole anyone?), setting out to save the day and become, at his father's request Earth's savior and Kryptons last hope. However Zod the ever present obstacle of the House of El stands in his way, ever a formidable enemy to superman who is played by very talented actor(Michael Shannon 'Premium Rush','The Iceman',Boardwalk Empire'). While Lois Lane and Martha/Johnathan Kent(Kal-Els adoptive parents), serves as a grounding for Superman to his Earth/Human heritage, not all of Humanity is accepting of Superman and so after many run-ins with the Military and the scared defensive nature of human kind there is room for Superman to earn his place among Humans and become Earths Mightiest hero(yes I went there), by rising to protect all that Superman stands for, Freedom, Justice and Hope to which he wears proudly on his chest.

5783869,5,B00D91GRA4,"This Man of Steel is the best Super Man movie since Super Man 2. True the humor, and the lightheartedness of the original Donner and Reeves movies are missing, but for any fan of Superman (of the comics), you will be pleased to see the nod thsi movie gives to the newer stories of Superman portrayed in the comics. I admit,t he first time I saw the film, I still had Christopher Reeves en-grained in my head, but the second time I was able to give Man of Steel it's due respect in being it's own film and not trying to take anything away from the original Superman movies. I appreciated Michael Shannon not trying to emulate the original General Zod, but making Zod his own and more similar to the comics, a general who makes the reader/viewer not sure whether to root for him or against. The casting was unbelievable and as much as people seem to give a hard time to the development being solely on Superman, it makes sense as a franchise starting film. Expect to see a lot more character development of Lois and the other main characters such as Perry White in the second film. Overall, great movie, great experience!

But anyways, the movie, the graphics, the acting, and the story line was beyond amazing! Alot of people here are complaining about the movie having too much CGI, or too much action, and blah blah blah. To me this movie was awesome! Henry Cavill,was such an amazing actor playing Superman. And getting to see his sensitive and more ""human"" side. In my opinion, He's the best one who has portrayed Clark Kent/Superman ever! Movie is amazing, and I'm definatley buying this!!

Superman was portrayed as a mighty but humble hero in this beautiful film. Definitely on my top favorite film's list as a perfect combination of action, beauty, and emotion.

5783873,5,B00D91GRA4,"The ""Man of Steel"" movie is both action and plot heavy, dealing with complex spiritual issues as well as what it means to be human. On the other hand, the action is heavy-handed, with punches, bullets, and other weaponry being thrown at people on a regular basis. This combination of depth and intensity creates a powerful film, both visually as well as in theme. The performance of the story was breathtaking. As expected, the visuals were stunning; the special effects were phenomenally crisp and the scope of the camera was often wide, presenting the scenery itself as a spectacle. The acting was exceptional as well. Shannon's Zod was angry, driven, and resourceful, everything a good soldier is meant to be. His lines were powerful and his intentions and thoughts were practically visible on his face as he acted. Cavill's Superman also performed exceptionally. Each line was delivered with honesty to the character. His part was not really dialogue heavy, but his role was emotionally demanding, requiring sadness, fury, remorse, and empathy at various points in the film. His character is vulnerable and emotional, unsure of himself, which Cavill communicated well. Adams as Lois Lane was an interesting choice, and her role is not given as much screen time for development, but she did do a good job playing a driven reporter, dedicated to her work, even if it means bending the rules. It will be interesting to see where her character is taken in the next film (which is confirmed as a Batman/Superman film according to news from Comic Con). The standout performances are definitely the two fathers, Costner and Crowe. The fathers, without giving anything away, are given numerous occasions where emotional scenes are required of them. Their sequences were powerful and convincing. I almost cried in the movie twice, and they were involved in them both. Their performances were moving.
The story itself was the highlight for me. The story fearlessly stepped into religion, humanness, choice, evolution, and power, stepping out unscathed. There will be many who disagree with the film's presentation of the ideas, even I would disagree in places, but, by dealing with them, they gave the film depth. Also, besides philosophical depth, the movie's plot was gripping from the beginning and, overall, solid. The film revealed just enough of the plot to keep the audience informed and then continued, using flashbacks to catch the audience up as necessary. The plot had no real twists, but the plot was not necessarily predictable (I have not read the comics, but the comics could deal with the story. So, comic book fans could be familiar with the plot; I am not sure). The story was compelling, emotional, and relatable. This film ranks, in my opinion, as the best so far this year. The acting, story, and music were all great, giving the Man of Steel a five star return to the big screen.

5783875,5,B00D91GRA4,"This movie was hands down the best Superman movie that has ever been made!  The backstory was entertaining and informative and showed us how Superman came to Earth and how he learned to control his powers.  It also showed us what happened to Krypton and why the main villain wanted to hunt down and destroy Superman.

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

Another thing that was cool is that we find out that the suit that Superman wears isn't just a costume, it is clothing from Krypton.  The ""S"" on his chest is also explained as not being an ""S,"" but it's a symbol for hope on Krypton.  It never occurred to me that the symbol could mean something else on his home planet.  It was a very cool twist and very creative!

Also if you watch closely, you'll see subtle references to other super heroes and villains in the DC universe such as Batman, Lex Luthor and Super Girl.

The best part of the movie was when we FINALLY get to see Superman fight a super villain!  In all his other movies he's just lifted heavy things and flew around.  Unless you count that slap fight he had with Nuclear Man in Superman 4.  So this fight scene with Zod and the other Kryptonians was just amazing!

***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***

Some people complained that there was too little of Lois Lane in this movie.  But it's a SUPERMAN movie, not a Lois Lane movie.  My only real complaints about the movie is that there is no mention of Kryptonite and Zod didn't say his classic line of ""Kneel before Zod!""

While it is probably possible to make a dramatic and compelling scene with Pa Kent and Clark agonizing over how/if he should use his abilities or if maintaining his secret identity is more important--I can't see either of them entertaining for one minute that a school bus load of kids should die rather than Clark saving them--sorry-- that is not true to who the characters are.  Similarly, in every other incarnation of Superman, Clark probably would have found a way to save his father rather than standing by and letting a tornado sweep him away into oblivion.  This just doesn't ring true.  While there was an obvious effort to give this movie emotional depth and complexity, overall it could not overcome the flatness that often comes with the Superman character-- Unlike, say, the Avengers or Iron Man-- there is virtually no humor in this movie, no personal revelations/development that compare to Tony Stark's transformation, no twists & turns with the villain as intriguing as with Loki or the Mandarin--and, overall, not enough human moments that remind us of who we are and the world we live in.

I must admit I was a bit leery about watching ""Man of Steel"" (hereafter MoS) after hearing rumors that he would undergo some sort of dark, tortured, and psychologically probing ""Dark Knight"" makeover, or some sort of Spiderman-like brooding existential angst.  No matter how eager you are to confirm realistically Superman's importance to our modern jaded times, you really don't have a lot of dramatic wiggle room with the legendary Kryptonian.  We must face facts; for over 75 years, Superman has been as close to God as a mortal can hope to get.  How do you reintroduce Superman as a new, fresh character without fundamentally changing who he is?

  MoS addresses this unenviable dilemma by, yes, combining some of that Spidey existential angst with the old ""journey towards your destiny"" plot, while still maintaining and elaborately explaining the basic elements of his origin.  This time, though, the realization of his Christ-like destiny as mankind's protector and savior is more tentative, erratic, and uncertain.  Superman has all the marvelous powers we know and love, but he must learn to control, focus, and use them at the right time.  The movie's shocking depiction of young Clark's uncontrolled X-ray vision and how it compels him to hide in his school's janitor's room is a novel illustration of this.  Also, his forbearance will be interpreted as wimpiness, so he will be unwisely baited by kid and adult bullies to fight back. Clark/Kal-El (buff but endearing hunk Henry Cavill) will learn from his holographic father/mentor Jor-El (a solemn Russell Crowe) that he is the symbolic AND genetic embodiment of his race and must accept the task of not only setting an example for Earth, but also somehow regenerating Krypton.  Furthermore, he must accomplish this task without frightening the suspicious, fearful earthlings. This is indeed a heavy Herculean burden.

  But, was there any real doubt that Superman could bear this burden?  Besides Jor-El, he receives unexpected guidance from intrepid, globetrotting newspaper reporter Lois Lane, no longer the clueless, hopelessly reckless victim of old.  She doggedly follows Clark's odd job wanderings and convincingly pieces together who he is and cares about him as a person first (and not a love at first sight).  Of course Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) provide the down-to-earth grounding and patient nurturing that Clark needs as an emotional anchor.  MoS shows that Superman will need that guidance when the wild-eyed maniacal Kryptonian General Zod (Michael Shannon) and his troops accidentally burst free from the Phantom Zone due to Krypton's explosion, and make a beeline towards Earth as a platform for his own ruthless resuscitation of the old homeworld.  There's nothing like a planetary threat to help a superhuman decide what he wants to do with his life.

  Of course, this will involve epic, world-shattering clashes that would make the Transformers rust with envy.  But once the dust and rubble clears, the iconic, and reassuring Superman (and Clark Kent) personas emerge at last.  That is why I mainly enjoyed MoS - it respects what Superman represents and is while still exploring his thoughts, feelings, and hopes for the future, and challenging his values and morals.  This is a tricky dance, but MoS executed it well.

P.S.  As other posters have logically and thoroughly documented, MoS does have its head-shaking inconsistencies and plot stumblings.  For example, we have the infamous tornado scene; Jonathan should have realized that Clark could have saved him at blurry super-speed without revealing his identity.  This could have also applied to the school bus rescue.  Jonathan's obsession with concealing Clark's true nature was also maddeningly baffling. And, of course, the destructive Superman/Zod showdown.  Superman realistically would be facing a tidal wave of civil and even criminal litigation, and the Smallville/Metropolis populace would be outraged and want these aliens gone. Finally, Superman's deadly resolution of the Zod problem was most likely unnecessary.  There were numerous other ways to end the threat before resorting to that uncharacteristic act.  Nonetheless, MoS is both thoughtful, introspective, and just plain rousing, slam-bang entertainment that rates a 4.5",1373846400,5,4350,5.3392070484581495
5783880,4,B00D91GRA4,"When I heard there was going to be a Superman reboot I was very skeptical.  I was in favor of a continuation, and I thought ""Superman Returns"" was pretty well done, although it had an odd plot.  I wanted to find a reason to not like ""Man of Steel""; after growing up with ""Superman"" and later watching/enduring 10 seasons of ""Smallville"", I thought the last thing the public needed was another retelling of the origin of Superman.  I am a big fan of the original Superman movie and the spirit behind ""Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut"".  I did not think a reboot could capture the spirit and good feeling of the original.  ""Man of Steel"" turned out to be a movie I thoroughly enjoyed and even came back to see it again.  I don't mind at all if my initial presumptions are proven wrong and I have to eat my own words - ""Man of Steel"" exceeded expectations and was an awesome movie.  The story on Krypton was ok, but when the movie really gets moving it does not let up.
I was initially skeptical of Michael Shannon playing General Zod, especially given his eccentric role on ""Boardwalk Empire"", but he did fine.  The pleasant surprise is the character of Faora, General Zod's second in command, played by basically unknown actress Antje Traue.  She has these beautiful, yet predatory eyes, and stands out in the movie. There are some actually unique aspects of a story told many times, like with the Kryptonians having a hard time adjusting to the Earth's atmosphere.  The cheesiness of Superman past is diminished, and he is often known as just ""Clark"", ""Kal-El"" or ""Kal"".  The story of his growing up in Smallville is smartly told in flashbacks to get right to Clark/Kal as a man.  Amy Adams does a nice job as Lois Lane as does Laurence Fishburne as Perry White, Kevin Coster as Jonathan Kent, Diane Lane as Martha Kent, and Russell Crowe as Jor-El.  Henry Cavill does an excellent job in the title role; his face conveys a lot of emotion, he is absolutely ripped, and probably looks the closest to the comic book version of any actor yet.  The franchise follows in a solid foundation that Christopher Nolan established with the newer Batman movies.  Like ""The Dark Knight"" series, the movie has a good story and has the best interest of the franchise in mind vice following a basic formula to try and just make a blockbuster movie.  ""Man of Steel"" is a homerun; it does not take away from the original ""Superman"", but compliments it as a different, modernized version.  The special and visual effects are amazing as you would expect.  I highly recommend.",1373587200,7,2558,4.596916299559472
5783881,5,B00D91GRA4,"I am a lifelong reader of comic books and have been a viewer of every incarnation of Superman starting with George Reeves in the original TV show.  So how does MAN OF STEEL stack up when compared to its predecessors?

Pretty damn good, I would say, mainly because:

Plot tension: is Kal-El/Clark Kent the last son of Krypton or a freak marooned among an alien race?  This one of many questions driving David Goyer's script which tackles what it means to be an outsider and whether one's destiny is predetermined or a result of free will. This gives Superman some much needed internal conflict and a theme to drive the story.

A great Superman: Henry Cavill has the looks and the physique to pull it off, but he has the talent to convey Kal-El/Clark Kent's inner battles.  Cavill has to do a lot of acting without dialogue and express a broad range of emotions with his eyes and body language.  He is far from the cipher some critics have charged him with being.  He doesn't make you forget Christopher Reeve, but perfectly compliments the earlier performance.

A great villain:  Michael Shannon is a terrific General Zod, and that's not taking anything away from Terrance Stamp's version of the character.  But MAN OF STEEL manages to explain and deepen his motivation, giving his animus toward Kal-El a real edge.  All super hero movies need a great bad guy to go up against, and MAN OF STEEL really delivers in this department.

Great fathers:  Russel Crowe and Kevin Costner as Jor-El and Jonathan Kent respectively.  Crowe's Jor-El sees his son as a future champion, the embodiment of all the greatness of Krypton; while Costner's Jonathan Kent raises Clark to hide his powers from a public that fears and hates what it does not understand and can't control.  And there is one hot Momma here as well as Diane Lane makes Martha Kent sexy for the fist time in a Superman movie.  (I'm not forgetting Annette O'Toole on Smallville, but that was TV.)

Great battles: the final throw down between Superman and Zod makes skyscrapers crumble and the earth itself shake.  This is exactly the kind of fight we've waited years to see.  And I have no problem with the way the battle is resolved, something many Superman fans did not like.

Great tweaks in the origin story: I'm not going to detail them here, but let's just say they work.  I especially like how Crowe's Jor-El was given a lot more screen time and the demise of Costner's character was changed so that it resonated more.  Lot's of die hard fans most emphatically did not like these changes, and some of them I would agree with, like when Jonathan Kent implies that Clark should have let his friends drown rather than risk revealing his powers.  Then there are those who just can't buy into ""comic book logic,"" and for them there is no help.

Amy Adams is a fine actress, and she does give Lois Lane the proper amount of pushiness, but I just don't like the way the script has her simply slip onto the long buried Kryptonian ship and discover Superman's origin and identity.  At the same time I like the way the story does right by some minor characters like Pete Ross.  But where is Jimmy Olson?  I do miss some of the humor Richard Donner brought to his 1978 movie; everyone in MAN OF STEEL is very serious and very earnest.

Nevertheless, MAN OF STEEL is a great reboot or re-imagining (whatever) for one of the 20th Century pop culture's greatest icons, making him relevant again in the 21st.  Siegal and Shuster would be proud of what producer Christopher Nolan, screenwriter David Goyer, and Director Zack Synder have done with their creation.  And I can't wait to see what they don next with Superman; maybe take on Brainiac? Or Lex Luthor.",1373587200,8,3704,4.626339969372129

Many of you have come to know Superman since you were young and unless you have read its comic or watch its animation before, you will feel that Zack Synder's Man of Steel is a little bit different. It's different in a good way of course. It's not just a reboot or remake of the original Superman but more of an in-depth character study about Clark Kent and his alter ego, our ever helpful Superman.

""Smallville"", ""Metropolis"" and ""Daily Planet"", these are the proper nouns that most of you should be familiar with. Yes, they are the key locations in the comic that's been featured in the film. I have one thing to confess here. After watching the first teaser trailer since last August, I've been in love with this reboot of such a long running series. It has definitely gained my affection. So, I might be quite biased but if it's good, audiences will see that it is.
There have been a total of five Hollywood motion picture, from Superman in 1978 to Superman Returns in 2006. Christopher Nolan dared to take up the challenge and started this project to revive Superman to the motion picture and putting Zack Snyder as the director, I have no slight complaint at all.

Ever since I've watched the first official trailer this April, I've been wondering how Zack is going to direct this reboot. How is he going to introduce this character? How is he going to tell his story and show us the growth and maturity of Kal-El, who is commonly known as Clark Kent or Superman. Surprisingly, he did it with a familiar technique, called flashback, and it's terrifically done. I'm very happy to see how everything turned out. The plot progresses in a moderate and good pace. There isn't a scene that was felt unnecessary in the film and nothing has been overly illustrated or prolonged. The first one and a half hour is the gem of the entire film in my opinion. Some might feel that it's slow and somehow dull but it's what made a superhero story great, the part where they discover their abilities and growing into a true hero.

Let me share with you more elements of the film while keeping spoilers to the minimum. Krypton, as you know is the birth place and planet where Kal is born. It's a dying planet but I'd have to say, it's depicted as being far more technologically advanced than ours and having a civilisation more ancient and established than ours as well. Those scenes at the beginning of the film are quite similar to what we usually see in those sci-fi films like Avatar and Star Wars. During the early age of Kal, his earthly parents taught him to control and master his unusual abilities that made him different from the other kids. For a person with such great power, he has to learn how to control and put them to use for greater good. Is he truly capable of greater good and can he help us achieve wonders? We shall see.

No doubt, this is a superhero movie so there's bound to be some or a lot of action sequences. There's a lot of it in the second half of the film and it got a little bit too noisy. Seeing the scale of the destruction across Smallville and Metropolis, I'm amazed, but not impressed. If you are to destroy half of Metropolis in a fight like this, how will it be when he's facing a greater enemy in the Justice League? Will there even be an Earth left to fight on? The battle scenes towards the end were a bit too much, but if you're looking for some great action at the end, it's there and it's epic. Try to think of it as the Transformer, maybe you'll understand what I'm trying to leak to you.

Now comes our main character, Henry Cavill is Clark Kent/Kal-El. He has surely trained himself well to don the red cape. With all the well developed muscle on him, this new Superman looks really fit and smart. His character stayed quite true to the Superman from the comic as his superpower came from harnessing the solar energy from our Sun. Our leading actress, Amy Adams plays the ever daring and front line reporting legend, Lois Lane. Her character is well played and compelling. Whenever there is action or mysteries, she will be there. I thought Jimmy would be there to hold the camera but he wasn't and instead, Miss Lane was doing everything by herself. She's a persistent one, isn't she?

Russell Crowe played the righteous Jor-El and Kal's father while Ayelet Zurer played as Kal's mum Lara Lor-Van. They showed us that all their hope were placed on their only son, Kal-El and they believed that he has the freedom to choose the path he wants. On Earth, Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are Jonathan and Martha Kent respectively. They named Kal Clark and brought him up to become a righteous and well behaved person. Although for most of the time, what his parents said to Clark might sound clichd, but those words are very reassuring and comfortable to hear as they're meaningful teaching to a young one. Perry White, as played by Laurence Fishburne wasn't playing much of role but he wasn't a coward when it comes to times where people's lives were at stake. Also, he's as eager as Miss Lane when it came to unravelling the truth behind the mystery man as well.

What about the villain? General Zod as played by Michael Shannon was a kind of accurate portrayal from the Zod we've seen in the comic. He's born to be a warrior and his sole purpose is to fight. So fight he will to make sure that his people don't perish but prosper till eternity. His motive and purpose drives him towards Earth. His sub-commander, Faora-Ul as played by Antje Traue was quite a fighter too. Her lack of sense of morality made her being relentless in combat.

When it comes to the soundtrack in the film, Hans Zimmer brilliant score never disappoints and sets you right in the moment. In my opinion, the greatest part is where the young Clark's story was being told. It's melodiously soothing and most of all, made me feel emotional. The picture is really dazzling and the use of depth of field is wise and nicely implemented. Both the video and audio presentation are awesome so I had a wonderful experience.

Honestly, I kind of realised that throughout history, Superman isn't quite an easy story to put to the motion picture. Zack Snyder's adaptation of it isn't perfect and left more to be desired, but it's every spot of what the Man of Steel is and I'm really glad to see everyone has done a marvellous job at it. Kal has finally found himself a place amongst humanity, so will he make a return to face an even greater foe? Nonetheless, let's welcome him to the (Daily) Planet and hope that he has a warm stay.

P.S. I'm confident to visit the cinema in my country again thanks to Digital 2D and a Student ticket for only RM8 at GSC isn't too much to ask for.",1373587200,6,6727,4.469869706840391
5783884,3,B00D91GRA4,"This movie was an awesome action movie with a great cast from Laurence Fishbourne as Perry White to Henry Cavill as Clark Kent/Superman. Russell Crowe did a great job as Jorell, and the back story of Krypton was also enjoyable. So how with all these great things did I feel the movie missed the mark from being the greatest Superman movie since Christopher Reeve, well here is the list and don't read further if you want to avoid SPOILERS!!!!!!!!

I'm doing my list by the worst decisions made in the movie to least important.

1. Superman/Clark Kent does not kill. He has a heightened sense of right and wrong, and would have stopped Zod without killing him. Superman is the Boyscout, and would not cross that line. Batman would be more apt kill someone for the greater good, and even he has principle about killing. That last scene in the movie ruined the whole film for me personally.

2. The first 20 minutes or so of the film I felt I was watching Batman Begins again. You can defiantly tell Christopher Nolan directed this film since he took the story ideas from Batman begins and brought it directly to Man of Steel. No where in the comics did Clark Kent travel on a fishing ship all rugged trying to find himself. The only thing missing was Liam Neeson making an appearance to mentor him and give him purpose. Oh wait I forgot Russell Crowe filled that void when Clark made his way upon the spaceship.

3. I feel Lois Lane was miscast, she did not have the feisty and strong personality of Margot Kidders Lois Lane or Erica Durance from Smallville who I personally feel would have done a much better job in the role. I also feel Tom Welling would have done an awesome job as Clark/Superman since he had done it for 10 years, and basically had the torch handed over to him from Christopher Reeve, but hey what does he know, he was just the only successful actor to portray Superman on the big screen and succeed. I don't want to knock Henry Cavill though he did a great job in the role.

4. In the comics Krypton was shown and being more technically advanced, but also a beauty to behold. Krypton in the movie got the technical part right, but made the world a dark and ugly place. This is more an aesthetic opinion than a deal breaker for the film.

My bottom line on this film is that if you never read the books you will probably love this movie and as a stand alone sci-fi action film it is a entertaining movie, if you are a purist like myself you will walk away from it, and hope one of these days Dc comics will get it right when it comes to these superhero films and stop Hollywood and their directors from trying to put their own stamp on the movies.",1373500800,9,2666,4.36491935483871

5783886,5,B00D91GRA4,"Man of Steel portrays a young Superman who is forced to confront his secret extraterrestrial heritage when Earth is invaded by members of his race.

After seeing the previous attempt at remaking Superman (which failed miserably), I was hopeful at the new reboot that brought more of a Dark Knight style of movie to the Man of Steel. I was not disappointed, this new remake blew me away with its visual effects (including the 3D), a great story, great action and an awesome villain. Henry Cavill played a great superman who is trying to find his way. Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner both played their roles as Superman's fathers very well with Crowe playing a huge role throughout the movie. Costner brought an almost Field of Dreams like quality to his role. Michael Shannon played one of the best villians I have seen onscreen in a while. His scowl throughout the movie made me believe he would do what it takes at completing his mission no matter who or what stood in his way.

Although some of the original elements of the Superman story were changed (no surprise as most movies seem to do that), I wasn't bothered by most except the dramatic ending, which I won't give away here, but seemed to be out of character for Superman.

They finally did the Superman story right for the most part and I look forward to this on Blu Ray and look forward to the sequels.",1373328000,,1363,4.555102040816327

5783888,3,B00D91GRA4,"Now we have a third version of Superman 2, to go with the original Richard Lester version and the Donner recut.  This time out, the origin story from Superman 1 takes up a third of the movie (in S2 it was covered in a few minutes of clips from S1), and it's interesting enough.  Superman's Kryptonian and Terran fathers are top tier stars perhaps just a touch short of Brando and Ford, but that's a minor point.  Russell Crowe has an extended role to play that is going to disturb purists, but it's pretty effective.  The rest of the cast is fine, including the new Superman himself, Henry Cavill.

The battle with Zod and his confederates is the key element of the film, and the degree to which Zack Snyder turned it into a modern action film in the mold of the Marvel films will determine how the viewer reacts to it.  Warning:  this movie is not about Superman creating and preserving his Clark Kent identity.  He is a suitably conflicted individual, searching for his role in this world, but in the end it's all about his fight with Zod.",1373328000,9,1041,4.442105263157894
5783889,3,B00D91GRA4,"Do you ever feel like an outcast or an alien?  Superman (inner and outer) searches for the answers to:  How can I use my talents and strength?  What's my place in this world?  Who am I?  What do I follow?  In other words, this is more than a rescue fantasy for the young and old.  Before working for the newspaper, we see superman as a waiter and a truck driver.

Zod saying that he was raised to be aggressive reminds me of a story I once heard  about a woman who experienced a lot of betrayal in her life.  One day upon hearing that she was pregnant decided to groom her child to grow up and take revenge on others so that the mother could vicariously take pleasure in his behaviour.  Decades later, in therapy, the daughter told her therapist that she felt like her mother's weapon and that she disliked people and wanted to heal.  Zod, in order to receive his mother's love, most likely had to accept his mother's wishes. I think a clue to this phenomenon occurs at the very beginning of the movie when superman, just after being born, was told by his parents, ""Our hopes and dreams go with you.""  The intention and context is different but the idea is there that parents have wishes for their children.  What (un)conscious beliefs might a child pick up from their parents?  Could any of these beliefs be the ""enemy"" within that the heroic side of us is faced to wrestle with and heal?

I think the lengthy adrenaline provoking special effects distract from the inspirational aspects of this tale.",1373241600,3,1501,4.463235294117647
5783890,3,B00D91GRA4,"WARNING: THE FOLLOWING REVIEW HAS BEEN APPROVED FOR APPROPRIATE READERS BY THE ARAA (Amazon Review Association of America) BUT DOES CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS.
Let me just say, I was really excited about this movie. I'd known about the movie for a while and was looking forward to it as the next great super hero movie. I was sadly disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I liked it! It was a fun movie. As a thrill ride, I'd give it a 4.8. Sadly movies aren't and shouldn't be rated or made to be fun. Filming is an art, the purpose being to create a well crafted story and a new world for the audience to escape to. It should be fun, but it shouldn't be about fun. Anyway, before I go to far into films, back to Man of Steel. There were a few main things that bothered me about the film.
  Firstly was the insistent action! Oh my gosh! I have never seen so much destruction in a movie. MOS blew every other action movie before it out of the water, even Transformers: Dark of the Moon. I don't mind action, in fact I love it. What bothers me is when it won't let up and I walk out of the theater wondering if I watched an action flick or video game brawler. The over the top action was pointless. It didn't add anything to the movie accept to get our testosterone running. It took away from the story because I was consistently thinking, ""How are they going to pay for that?"" The finale battle decimate almost all of Metropolis, the terra forming laser beam striking pretty near to the Daily Planet, yet in the final scene, we see the city all back to normal within, I'm assuming as they never give you the time lapse, a month or so. How on earth could a city recover from that much damage and that much death that quickly? It doesn't make sense.
  The acting wasn't bad. It wasn't the great either, but it wasn't bad. The two actors who stood out were Henry Cavill as Superman and Michael Shannon as Zod, mostly the later. They both embodied their characters perfectly. Amy Adams, Lawerece Fishburn, Kevin Costner and Russel Crow all disappointed me with their lack of emotion. The leads me to another problem: there was no emotional appeal in the movie! I expected that with Christopher Nolan being on board there would be some pretty sad scenes in the movie. When Superman's parents have to send him to earth I expected to have tears in my eyes. Instead the actors were so emotionless that I felt disconnected from them. If your audience isn't feeling and emotional connection, then there's something wrong with the film. An I'm sorry but Johnathan Kent being killed in a tornado trying to rescue a dog? Lame!
  The finale problem, and this is the biggest one, was that I think they missed the whole point of superman. In the trailer and the movie we keep hearing Jor-el saying the Superman would be an ideal for the people of earth to strive for. The comics and original movie showed Superman just like that. He was marvelous and majestic! He was the epitome of perfection something we could become if we tried hard enough. They alluded to that, but missed it completely. If I were any of the people in the movie I'd be afraid of Superman seeing the death toll he caused by throwing the enemies threw buildings, causing enormous explosions and copious amounts of destruction. Beside that, Spoiler alert!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SUPERMAN KILLS!!!!!!!!!!!! He kills the bad guy in the end! What's up with that? That was one of the things that made superman so great was that he would not kill. Yet here he is killing the bad guy! You may say, what was he supposed to do? Maybe knock him unconscious and get him into the phantom zone... Perhaps the screenwriters didn't even need to end it that way! He also steals some clothes and stealing is never, ever, ever justified.
  When I saw the trailers for MOS I thought ""Hey, this isn't going to be a movie chalked full of action! It's going to be a movie full of heart, story, and the majesty of Superman."" My siblings have pointed out to me that I never complained about the action in Transformers and they've pointed to the fact that I can't wait to see Pacific Rim. My response? Superman isn't supposed to be like that. You don't walk into Transformers with a criterion more than, ""I want to see some action!"" You expect that from those kind of movies. You don't expect that from Superman, especially with Christopher Nolan writing the story. Overall, it is undeniably enjoyable. However, it was also very disappointing.",1373155200,5,4464,4.529776674937965

Self-doubting and lonely, young Clark Kent wanders aimlessly until a band of militarists, led by General Zod (Michael Shannon), arrive to subjugate Earth and use Clark in their plan to revive their dead civilization.  Superman (Henry Cavill) is born.

This film was too long and the plot was too busy to rate a top score, but I quite enjoyed it.  Director Zack Snyder, with David Goyer and Christopher Nolan, really make an effort to get under Superman's skin here and make him more than just an overstuffed Boy Scout.  I think they are successful, but the rest of the cast, with the possible exception of his two fathers, is given little to do as a result.  Unlike many, I kind of liked the flashbacks to Clark's boyhood; we were already on familiar ground with yet another retelling of Superman's origin, and I didn't much feel like sitting through thirty minutes of his Nebraska upbringing.  However, you really can't leave Pa and Ma Kent out of it, so it seemed like a reasonable choice.  Cavill is a great Superman but it looks like we have to wait for the next movie to we see whether he is a great Clark Kent as well.

5783894,2,B00D91GRA4,"It's better than SUPERMAN RETURNS but that's not saying much.  Cavill makes a decent Clark/Kal-El (""Superman"" isn't acknowledged in the end titles), and Diane Lane acquits herself nicely as Martha Kent, but Amy Adams is an awful Lois (Lois Lame might be a more appropriate name for her character), and Laurence Fishburne's Perry White (complete with earring! ) is more Frank Langella than Jackie Cooper.  The one casting choice I had high hopes for was Michael Shannon as Zod, and while he brings a great deal of menace to the proceedings, he lacks the calm, cool confidence of Terence Stamp's interpretation.  Perhaps modern audiences expect their villains to be over-the-top bad asses with no shades of grey, and if that's the case, then this new Zod delivers.  Christoper Meloni, one of my favourite LAW & ORDER actors, has a nice supporting role as an army officer.

But my main quibble with the film is the way it approaches the action sequences.  Perhaps I'm out of step with the times, but I don't see the point in making a SUPERMAN movie where it's painfully obvious all the actors are standing in front of a green screen and the ""epic"" digital action is out of focus and cut with attention deficit sufferers in mind.  When Christopher Reeve played Superman, you could actually see his derring-do whereas in MAN OF STEEL the action is cut so quickly you have to guess.  Also, the Kryptonian architects were most definitely inspired by H.R. Giger this time out, so it's little wonder Jor-El and the Missus had no interest in raising a child in such a dark and uninviting environment.  One last note:  I'm glad they didn't try to tack the Williams SUPERMAN theme onto this as it wouldn't have worked, but Hans Zimmer completely misses the mark with his score for MAN OF STEEL.",1372896000,14,1782,4.737864077669903

I want a Superman that stands for truth, justice, and the American way-a Superman for my children to look up to as a source of good.

5783897,3,B00D91GRA4,"The ""Man of Steel"" is a movie of extensive computer animation, action and flashback of defining moments of superman's childhood; starred by Zack Snyder, Russell Crowe and Kelvin Costner.

Most of us know that Superman is an alien, coming from a dying star; the movie covers a bit more about the star Krypton. Krypton is a star with heavier gravity and tons of science advancement - a glimpse of why the people there can fly on earth and their power.  Kryton is dying after many years of rapid evolution in science where the population is planned, every birth is planned with a purpose; and the leadership council is incompetent. Superman's father is the leading scientist and hopes to find a solution through his son, who is the only natural birth.  At the same time, the head general starts a coup to get rid of the incompetent council (with somewhat similar purpose to extend the life of people).  With the rivalry and the crisis, come tons of action and scientific animation.  Infant Superman is sent to the planet Earth; and the leading general was captured with an exile, just before the total collapse of Kryton.

Superman, with an earth name of ""Clark Kent"" is brought up in Kansas. Kelvin Costner, playing the role of his father, is an unbelievable perfect guy in the movie; who is convicted that Clark is here with a purpose for big things?  Then it tells some defining moments in Clark's childhood - his relationship with parents, his relationship with his classmates, his struggle to understand his power and his loneliness to live a different life.

Just when we think this maybe something different, the standard ingredients show up and take over.  Amy Adam's Lois Lane, the ""future-to-be girlfriend"" of Superman movie, shows up; the bad guy shows up, this case, the lead general in exile; the bad guy threatens to destroy earth; then superman comes; saves the world with obviously extensive collateral damages. As bad guy confesses that he is born with the purpose to protect the greater good of Krytonians, is he really a bad guy?

If you like Superman story, there is something of everything in this movie.",1372636800,8,2122,4.804945054945055
5783898,5,B00D91GRA4,"Superman is one of the most iconic and well known characters not only in comics, but in entertainment history. Superman was the ideal that brought the modern day superheroes to life, and through the combination of revolutionary action comics and successful films (at least earlier on), Superman rose to become the best of superheros. However, after his second big screen adaptation, Superman lost his throne as king of comic books. His drop in quality in comic books and films made a lot of people lose respect and love for the character, and the original Superman film was dethroned by ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Avengers"" to many people as the greatest comic book movie of all time.

This summer, director Zack Snyder (Watchmen, 300), producer Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight trilogy, Inception), and screenwriter David S. Goyer (Batman Begins, Blade) are here to attempt to change this, with Man of Steel. Man of Steel promises to be a more realistic take on the character, promising to finally make the character of Superman relatable, while delivering a Nolan-esque story, and promising to deliver on the epic action sequences after the lack of them in the latest Superman film, Superman Returns. Being hyped up as one of the most anticipated films of the year, can Man of Steel live up to the hype, or will this be the final piece of Kryptonite for the Superman film franchise?

Man of Steel is the retelling of the Superman origin story. For those of you who aren't aware of the origin story, the film involves a planet far away called Krypton. At the start of the film, a baby is born on this planet, and shortly after, we learn that the planet is doomed, and that its core is collapsing on itself. So the parents of this baby, the father being Jor-El (played by Russel Crowe), are forced to send the baby to Earth to guarantee the survival of it and Krypton's citizens. Along with this, you also are introduced to the main protagonist, General Zod (played by Michael Shannon), as well as some other elements to the plot which I will not give away here.

Once we reach Earth, the film jumps right into the main plot of the film, which juggles flashbacks to Clark Kent's childhood which run parallel to the events and character development in the main plot. The main plot involves the Superman origin story that we know: Clark Kent growing up being a bit of an outsider to most people, finding the Fortress of Solitude (which is much different in Man of Steel than in the previous films), and becoming Superman. However, shortly after finally donning the cape, General Zod invades Earth, threatening the existence of man kind. From there, it is up to Superman to stop him.

I know, I know, a lot of people are most likely sick of superhero origin stories, especially reboots. However, to those who cry foul at these origin stories, you can be rest assured that Man of Steel's approach is the freshest and most exciting yet seen in recent comic book movies. Man of Steel includes the origin story of Superman, but this is NOT the same one that we saw in Richard Donner's film. Many new themes are explored, characters are given more of an amount of depth than in the previous films, and the storytelling, thankfully, doesn't focus on events we have had beaten into our heads before. For example, in the original Superman movie, the film went straight from a couple of scenes in Smallville straight to the Fortress of Solitude where he becomes Superman, but Man of Steel does a good job at exploring the character of Clark Kent before that.

We learn more about how Clark Kent was an outsider, how he had to struggle with being human when he really wasn't (might I add, in a realistic way), and we also get to see a bit more of what happens to Clark between his voyage from Smallville and him finding the Fortress of Solitude. So, in this respect, even though it tells an origin story again, Man of Steel's storytelling does not feel at all like the previous films. In fact, thanks to Goyer's persistence at slowly feeding information about Clark's past to the audience throughout the film (even to the very last scene), Man of Steel's storytelling is interesting, fresh, and exciting.

One of the biggest complains people have about the character of Superman is that he isn't relatable. Well, thanks to a clever script and a story centered much more around the development of Clark Kent, Man of Steel fixes this. This take on Superman shows Superman as much more vulnerable, and much more of a ""man"" in the title of ""Superman"" than the previous incarnations. Goyer's attempts at making a more relatable and modern Superman really work. While this Superman still stands for justice and is selfless, he is also human, feels pain, and is, ultimately, a man inside of an alien body. The film does an excellent job at displaying this, making the audience feel far more connected to its hero than in previous Superman films.

In addition to making Superman more relatable, the main villain, General Zod, has been given a surprising amount of depth in the film. People say that great drama comes from opposing ideas of right and wrong, and Man of Steel really embodies this with General Zod. General Zod certainly is menacing and villanous, but some of his actions are also justified. He is a villain who is a bit misunderstood, who has good intentions in regards to his own people, but someone who uses violent methods, and is ultimately holding onto a world that is helplessly gone forever. It is great stuff, and a fantastic reimagining of the classic villain.

What has also been further explored in Man of Steel is the father son relationship. I wish I could talk more about it, but suffice to say, both Jor-El and Jonathan Kent, Superman's human father, are both further explored and freshened out in the film, and the scenes with them and Clark really make for an emotionally captivating and moving experience. I never thought these characters would be fleshened out, or given the amount of screen time, that they were, but I am certainly glad that they were.

There are other elements to the plot, such as some sci fi elements that relate to the comics, the story of Lois Lane and Superman growing as a couple, the film treating Superman's arrival as sort of a ""first contact"" type scenario (which is brilliantly executed by the way), and some other plot points that I can't really further talk about here, but suffice to say, despite the number of things that it has to juggle at times, the story is simple enough, but deep enough, that it is all satisfying. Man of Steel's story is extremely ambitious, and fortunately, it does a fantastic job at delivering.

Delivering as many thrills as the story is the ensemble. To start, Henry Cavill is a fantastic Superman, and is without a doubt the best one we have seen since Christopher Reeves. Henry Cavill is humble, selfless, and heroic as Superman, but also bringing out the pain in his character, as well as his human side, far more than many interpretations of the character. When we see what he has to sacrifice, the choices he has to make for the better of people, and see him grow as a charater is so satisfying thanks to Cavill's performance. Additionally, he REALLY looks the part, and he sounds exactly like you would imagine Superman sounding like.

Just as fantastic, although not sharing as much screen time, are the two fatherly figures: Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent and Russel Crowe as Jor-El. Jonathan Kent is far more concerned about Clark Kent revealing who he really is to the world, but he still loves him like a son, and Kevin Costner does a brilliant job at displaying that. There are some truly emotionally moving scene between him and Clark throughout the film that really make us connect to both characters, and Kevin Costner's performance  sells every single minute. In a similar sense, Russel Crowe does a fantastic job at playing a father who, ironically, wants his son to explore who he really is, and to help other people with it, and these sort of opposing ideas really play out in interesting ways, and in ways that aren't so black and white, and it is quite refreshing.

Michael Shannon does a great job as General Zod for the interpretation of the character that we are given. While I wish he was slightly more menacing, I still very much appreciated his performance, and I felt that he was a very good villain for Superman to go up against. On the other hand, I found Amy Adams to be the best Lois Lane in the history of the Superman franchise, thanks to her charm and her display of feminist qualities that make her far more than another damsal in distress. Additionally, her relationship with Superman felt much more natural than it does in other comic book films. While they didn't explore the relationship as much as some people would want, there is definitely room for growth in future sequels.

Additionally, the rest of the supporting cast, including Diane Lane as Martha Kent, Laurence Fishburne as Perry White, and some extremely talented kids playing young versions of Clark Kent (seriously I normally hate kid actors, but they were great in Man of Steel), the acting across the board is fantastic.

One of the biggest complaints of past Superman films is that the action is seriously lacking, and Superman simply doesn't kick enough butt. Well, to everyone who had previously complained about that, your prayers have been answered with Man of Steel. The action sequences in this film are big in scale, epic, and powerful. Superman throws more than just a couple of punches, and buildings and city blocks are knocked over and destroyed like legos with a little kid. These fight sequences feel as if they were ripped straight out of Superman comic books, and they are awesome. They really display how powerful Superman is, how deadly a fight with him can be, and the modern wonders of CGI that can be used to show off a powerful superhero.

All of these scenes, both the amazing action sequences (including the best final fight I have seen in a superhero movie) and the quieter, more tender moments in the film, are complimented with an amazing original score by Hans Zimmer. While nothing can top the original Superman theme by John Williams, the score here by Hans Zimmer is truly amazing, and compliments the film brilliantly. It also isn't as heavy on drums as some of his previous scores, and there are some more memorable themes to be found here, which is great.

While there are so many things in Man of Steel that delivered, there are some minor flaws that are worth pointing out. First of all, as stunning and incredible as the action scenes are at times, I found that they were a little exhausting towards the end. Again, the quality of the action scenes were amazing, but I felt as if they could have cut out a little bit of it in the end. Additionally, there is a point in the plot between where Clark leaves  Smallville and finds the Fortress of Solitude where he is job hopping while also saving people and developing as person. The scenes we are given here are amazing, but I wish we had more of them. There were maybe only two or three of these scenes throughout the film, and I thin that the film would have benefited a bit more from just a few more.

However, these flaws, while significant, are more forgivable withe everything the film does right, as well as one thing that really makes Man of Steel a truly ballsy and incredible reboot: the ending. I won't spoil exactly what happens, but I will say that my reaction to it could be described only in one word: wow. It was incredible in my mind, and really did an amazing job at bringing closure to the story, exploring parts of Superman that hadn't been explored before, and also somehow bringing the lore back to familiar, yet fresh territory. It was amazing, and I couldn't think of a better way to end the film.

All in all, while Man of Steel has minor flaws holding it back from perfection, it undoubtedly delivers on all fronts. Its fresh and exciting storytelling, stellar cast, beautiful action sequences, and fantastic new direction make Man of Steel one of the best movies of the year so far. The fantastic direction of this franchise makes Superman relatable and awesome again, and seeing one of the greatest comic book characters of all time in that stage again is truly remarkable. The amazing thing too is, while the film does leave open for the future, and the audience does want more, the film ultimately wraps up in incredible fashion, also leaving me entirely fulfilled and satisfied.

Combine all of these elements, and you have a film that truly is, well, super. It is one of the best comic book movies of all time.",1372636800,6,12711,4.678299776286353

The movie, in my opinion, would've shined so much brighter if it had stayed focused on Superman's/Kal-el's struggles adapting to life on earth and showing how he came to be from those struggles. Instead, it veered off into eye candy and action that would've been best served--on a much smaller scale, I might add--for the next movie (which, I assume, there will be one).

5783905,5,B00D91GRA4,"MAN OF STEEL delivers one of the most visual and dramatically rich films of the year. Brilliantly crafted and realized by director Zach Snyder, the film wastes not a moment in weaving a complex tapestry that redefines the greatest superhero in history on an unheard of epic scale.

And make no mistake, this is the Superman of the 21st Century. Director Zach Snyder and writer David S. Goyer have combined elements and touches of the most definitive Superman comics and graphic novels of the character's last 27 years to insure MAN OF STEEL is a faithful reboot, unlike Bryan Singer's failed ""Superman Returns."" References and scenes abound from `Man of Steel,' `Earth One,' `Secret Origin,' `Battle of the Supermen,' `Birthright,' `Last Son of Krypton,' `Secret Identity,' and `New Krypton,' along with the New 52 re-launches of `Action Comics' and `Superman.' Snyder and Goyer also courageously mix in new mythological elements that address our own world's controversial geo-political issues, all of which are grounded in the character's high morals and science-fiction mythos.

Those with pacemakers, heart conditions or in walkers better get out of the way - this is also 21st Filmmaking at its best. Snyder has become one of the leading stylists in a new breed of directors who mix film stocks, exposure speeds, camera movement styles, visual effects and processing textures for narrative purposes - and he's never been more in tune with his gifts than he is here.

At times, the tone and drama of the dialogue and performances fly at you just as fast as his visuals, with each line and intonation as vital as his visual effects. The extended opening on Krypton is layered with as much philosophy, religious contemplation, and environmental debates as it is with stunning renderings of technology and creatures.

Yet, Snyder takes time to slow down when emotion, performances, earthbound reality, and narrative tone demand it. Writer David S. Goyer has structured his screenplay in a fashion similar to ""Batman Begins,"" which he co-authored with MAN OF STEEL co-producer and co-story author Christopher Nolan. While Nolan maintained a consistent pace and stylistic approach in ""Batman Begins,"" while cross-cutting `timelines' in that film, Snyder utilizes stylistic shifts to allow his visuals to become a visceral extension of Goyer's screenplay structure and dialogue.

With regard to the film's performances, the casting could not be more perfect. Henry Cavill embodies his triple roles as Kal-El, Clark Kent and Superman with levels of subtlety, regret, humanity, humor, compassion and - above all - humility. He paces himself in each scene as `evolution' is the key demand of the role. This is really a Clark Kent story, as film reveals to Clark just who he is and who he is destined to be. In the first half, Cavill portrays a Clark Kent expressing loneliness, heroism, determination, and - yes - wit and humor as he wanders the country, struggling with a personal crisis - who am I, and what should I do? Once he discovers his Kryptonian heritage, and identity as Kal-El, he `suits-up' as Superman. Tragically, he must immediately face General Zod and his troops. Cavill is a Superman who has yet to be anointed with that name by the people of earth. Worse, he has yet to gain their trust. For the balance of the film, we witness a Superman learning how to use his powers, protect the people of earth, and realizing you must have faith in people first before trust can be established. It is a lesson he instills on the US military - those who most doubt his insistence he is a loyal American, through and through. By the end of the film, Cavill delivers audiences' expectations of seeing the fully formed Superman and Clark Kent.

Amy Adam's Lois Lane is the exact embodiment of what we'd expect from an aggressive, Pulitzer Prize winning reporter. She expresses hard-edged yet beautiful humanity when she stumbles onto the story of the century, only to realize she can't run it as it means ruining a man's life. Michael Shannon brings to Zod a level of depth beyond just rage and vengeance. A key revelation in his character is a tragic one. We learn that he faces fulfilling a destiny he did not choose for himself. As Clark's mother, Diane Lane balances showing concern and fear for her son as his powers emerge and he begins questioning why God made him this way. Lane treats her Kryptonian adopted son as she would any child, hiding her fear and learning how to help her son control his powers. Her goal is that of all mothers - teaching her son that childhood is just a phase of life, not its end.

In the Superman saga, the most important parental figures have always been the fathers - Jor-El and Jonathan Kent. It's the casting of Russell Crowe as Jor-El and Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent that illustrate to audiences who Clark is when we meet him, and how he becomes Superman by the end of the film. In Snyder's MAN OF STEEL, it is done better than in any previous cinematic version of the character.

Costner's Jonathan Kent is a complex man. Upon learning young Clark has saved a school bus full of his classmates from sinking into a river, Costner is angered. Insisting Clark must keep his powers a secret, when young Clark asks him if he should have let them die, Costner honestly responds, ""Maybe."" He is a father desperate to protect his son from a world he knows is not ready to accept him. A world he fears will turn its mightiest weapons against his son to kill him.

Yet, with each flashback featuring Costner's Jonathan Kent, the wisdom he departs deepens, as does the love he has for his son. And Costner's Jonathan Kent imparts unto his son the ultimate example any father who truly believes in principles can - showing your son that you stand behind them at all cost. It's the film's most moving sequence.

Russell Crowe's Jor-El is equally full of dimension. His role in the film is not limited to his scenes on Krypton. When Kal-El finally discovers a way to download his father's `consciousness,' Crowe plays the scenes with kindness, reason and - above all - a powerful conviction of faith in his son. Crowe is able to balance acknowledging the burden his son will face as he reveals Kal-El's Kryptonian origins to him, and the awesome responsibility Jor-El as a father is asking of Kal-El as a son to use his powers in becoming an inspiration and symbol of hope for the human race. Like Costner's Jonathan Kent, Crowe inspires confidence in his son by reinforcing principles.

There is a sense of consistency in the values of Jonathan Kent and Jor-El as played by Costner and Crowe - a bridged gap that seems almost cosmic. As if the two fathers are at once separate, yet part of a whole.

This is not a Superman for those clinging to the Fleischer animated shorts, the Reeves TV series, or the Richard Donner film. And it doesn't need to be. For those longing for those depictions of Superman, they will always exist - wonderfully preserved on Blu-Ray and DVD. MAN OF STEEL does not negate these past incarnations, and it shouldn't. Audiences should always treasure these previous versions of Superman.

Yet, the vitriol and anger expressed by critics and some Superman fans against MAN OF STEEL mystifies. The accusation that the last hour of the film is just an over-the-top, empty, bombastic, visual effects laden disaster movie? Not true. There's as much drama, character development and emotion to be found in these scenes as there is in the rest of the film. Furthermore, the film's climax is a `toned down' version of many modern Superman PG-13 animated films, graphic novels and comic book sagas, including the classic 1993 ""The Death of Superman"" story.

In 2007, the DC Animated Universe division released a direct-to-video film of this story entitled ""Superman: Doomsday."" Rated PG-13, it contained more killings, violence, brutal action sequences, destroyed cities and adult content than MAN OF STEEL - and its running time was only 75 minutes. I can only imagine what critics and many Superman fans would be saying this weekend had Warner Bros. chosen to release that 5 year old animated film instead of MAN OF STEEL.",1372464000,33,8173,4.836909871244635

However, with the prevailing opinion that Superman Returns was not a good movie and did not do as well as it should have financially because Superman doesn't punch someone, we were given this ""Man of Steel"" reboot.  Given my disappointment of a studio doing yet another reboot (on the heels' of last year's too-soon [IMHO]&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Amazing-Spider-Man/dp/B009B0JSD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Amazing Spider-Man</a>&nbsp;reboot), this movie had two strikes against it in my mind when I went to see it.  However, color me ""pleasantly surprised.""

Okay, if you're on the fence as to whether to go to see ""Man of Steel"" (or buy it on DVD/Blu-Ray), I'll keep this simple.  If you enjoyed the fight scenes between Superman and the Phantom Zone villains in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-II/dp/B000059XUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman II</a>, and would like to see them played out over the course of 40 minutes in a CGI slugfest of punches, explosions, and buildings being demolished ""Transformers""/Michael Bay style, you will love Man of Steel.

*Spoilers ahead*  In short, Man of Steel combines the plotlines of the original Superman and Superman II - giving us, once again, the destruction of Krypton to begin the film.  Then the movie proceeds in a non-linear manner, showing us Clark Kent's upbringing, eventually leading to his donning of the iconic Superman suit.  The non-sequential manner of the initial scenes- beginning with Clark as an adult, then as a young child, then as an adult again, then as a teenager, etc.- was initially confusing, but I came to appreciate their merit as the movie progressed.  Eventually General Zod and his henchmen arrive on Earth and the battle royal is on, with Superman fighting the Phantom Zone villains in Smallville and eventually in Metropolis in an epic clash featuring excellent CGI effects that I found thrilling (even if they go on a bit too long- more on this later).

*Casting* Everyone is perfectly cast in this film.  Henry Cavill is excellent as Clark and Superman; I look forward to seeing more of him in the (presumably) inevitable sequel, when hopefully he is given some lighter material to work with instead of constantly having to wear a grim expression as he goes about saving the world.  Amy Adams (as Lois Lane) is excellent as always, as is Russell Crowe (Jor-El), Kevin Costner (Jonathan Kent), and Diane Lane (Martha Kent).  Michael Shannon is also good as General Zod, but perhaps falls a bit short of Terence Stamp's almost regal villainy as the original cinematic Zod.  A special word of praise has to be directed to Antje Traue's performance as the Phantom Zone criminal Faora.  Channeling Sarah Douglas' Ursa from Superman I/II, Traue's Faora dishes out death without hesitation or remorse; moving and fighting in a vaguely serpentine manner, she takes pleasure in her killings and destruction, making her a delicious villain to watch.

*Soundtrack* I consider John Williams' soundtrack from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-The-Movie/dp/B0012QVJXS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman: The Movie</a>&nbsp;to be not only classic, but iconic; thus, I would have preferred that director Zack Snyder and composer Hans Zimmer retain the Williams theme.  Alas, this was not to be.  The talented Zimmer gives it his best shot and swings for the fences, hitting a solid double with his Man of Steel soundtrack.  It probably won't make you forget the Williams theme (or have you absent-mindedly humming it to yourself, as many Superman fans- myself included- have done with the Williams theme), but it is appropriately epic and even memorable in its main theme.

I would have given this movie five stars but for two reasons (again *Spoilers Ahead*):

1.  *The movie's length*  At 143 minutes, this movie is probably 30 minutes too long.  In particular, I think the final battle between Superman and Zod could have been trimmed down.  This Superman-Zod fight sequence comes on the heels of an extended battle sequence between Superman, the Phantom Zone villains, and the U.S. military- as a viewer I felt a bit spent.  I love the final battle itself, leading to the brilliant scene depicting  Superman's first choice as to whether to take a life in order to save innocent lives, but I didn't need to see another 10 CGI buildings destroyed with the accompanying explosions.  I'm sorry but eventually endless CGI mayhem gets a bit numbing, and loses its punch (no pun intended).

2.  *Where's the joy?*  One of my favorite scenes in the movie is when Superman learns to fly.  In a manner reminiscent of Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man learning to web-sling in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Man/dp/B000O19EWK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider-Man</a>, Superman gets the hang of flying and you can see the joy and wonder on his face as he zooms across the world, and eventually into space and back to Earth.  This sequence was one of the few where we see Superman actually experiencing some fun of being a God-like superhuman (as I'm sure we all would feel in his place), and I just wish there were more scenes like that.  Richard Donner really captured this whimsical aspect of the Superman character in his iconic 1978 film, and I think it is regrettable that writer David S. Goyer didn't heed the advice of one of his iconic Batman characters in writing the Man of Steel screenplay: ""Why so serious?!""

In summary, Superman is back and I look forward to the next movie installment and hopefully a Justice League movie.  If the next film retains the epic nature/scope of Man of Steel, while upping the ""fun"" factor of Superman's character and not going overboard on the CGI, we may have the ultimate Superman movie to look forward to.

In the meantime, Man of Steel is a dandy film, and well worth your time if you are a Superman fan or a fan of action/superhero films in general.  To borrow the catchphrase from the original 1978 movie, you will believe - again - that a man can fly.",1372464000,4,6684,5.401734104046243
5783907,1,B00D91GRA4,"This film is caught up in a whole set of rather odd philosophical ideas that are somewhat pervasive in modern culture. The primary one being the religion of the alien.

The religion of the alien presupposes the coming of the ""alien"" savior who will banish all human ideology and religion by only their presence. Reason and ""science"" will conquer all and the aliens will guide humanity to its rightful place as gods. Strength is the ultimate morality and what is to be worshipped. The unworthy, clinging to the failed past, will attempt to kill the alien savior but will fail.

David S. Goyer takes it a step further by grafting a sort of philosophical darwinism on the top of. A philosophical darwinism where there are ""winners"" and ""losers"". There are those who follow the path upward and there are who do not. Those who do not follow the path upward don't simply make themselves extinct, but must (apparently) be made extinct by their betters.

Krypton deserved extinction for turning its back on genetic evolution as well as the battle for Lebensraum out in the universe. But under the careful protection of Superman, that mistake will not be made on Earth.

The is an odd basis for a superman film. But this is where we are in 2013.

The film starts out with a dying planet (Krypton) which is dying seemingly for turning its back on progress, expansion and genetic evolution. The politicians do nothing. The military tries to preserve the status quo. But the father of little superman seems to see their destruction as a moral judgement. They must all die so that the path upward can begin again but only through HIS son of course. No small irony in Jor-El attacking Zod over choosing bloodlines when he decides that only HIS son should survive.

Young superman comes to earth. Then the survivors of his people come after him. After a whole lot of pointless overly destructive fighting, Superman makes an active decision to carry out the genocide of his own people. The film doesn't dwell on the awful moral nature of that decision or the questionable reasoning behind it. Humanity will be led forward by its new shephard and the fate of those not moving forward is to be made extinct. Though each side has what the other needs, there can be no negotiation or second thoughts. Its a pure darwinian struggle between those who will survive and those who will be made extinct.

The film then degenerates into a pointless excess of destructive violence. The excess makes it all very uninteresting. Its a very boring fight that ends in a very predictable way. Superman fights without a second thought to the consequences of his actions. He destroys his home town. He destroys the city center of Metropolis. He never even makes an attempt to take the fighting away from places where many, many people will die. If someone in front of him is to be killed, it somehow matters. But the deaths of thousands of people who can't be seen in front of him are not worth a second thought.

The film could have been rather emotional had Zod actually made the accusation of Genocide and talked of bringing Superman to justice before their final fight. But the film always repairs its moral shortcomings by making Zod irrationally homicidal toward humans. Even when he supposed to be angry beyond words at Superman, killing a few humans always seems the higher priority.

In terms of disguisting ideas, the only thing I can compare it to is ""300"" which is not exactly ironic considering that they share the same director. Oddly enough, many of ideas are also a ""blowing up"" of the ideas of the Dark Knight from the scale of a city to the scale of a world: the lone orphan sacrificing himself to become a sort of civilizational avatar. The overtly fascist undercurrent in all these ideas is somewhat disturbing.

Michael Shannon gives by far the best performance in the film. He escapes from the shadow of Terence Stamp and makes the character his own. Kevin Costner plays his predictable character actor role. Russell Crowe appears to have prepared by watching Star Wars Films.

Henry Cavill looks the part but is given almost nothing to do as an actor. I cant think of a single memorable scene with him. Laurence Fishburne was trying to be Ed Bradley rather than do a fictional character role and is in far too many scenes in which he was not needed.

Its not a bad film technically. But its philosophy is horrible and the whole urban alien invasion thing has been done to death in films. Raising the level of action up didn't make it seem any more fresh.",1372464000,28,4541,4.683814303638645
5783908,3,B00D91GRA4,"Parties giddy with delight, parties up in arms. MAN OF STEEL's reaped enough box office duckets that they can for sure green light that Justice League movie. But MAN OF STEEL was always going to make money, even if it had sucked copious bat guana. If you loved the movie, I envy the he11 out of you. I wanted to love it. Instead, I'm ambivalent. I liked it okay, did not love it. I think Mark Waid's scathing review has merit. MAN OF STEEL falls short of my expectations. Mostly, it's the adaptation I'd dreaded Christopher Nolan and Zach Snyder would produce: overly somber and ponderous and absent of that twinkle in the eye with which Richard Donner's 1978 version has charmed generations.

The narrative unfolds in non-linear fashion. It occasionally skips back to Clark's childhood past but not in sequential order. I was cool with that approach. If anything, I wish there'd been more flashback moments with young Clark and his parents. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane are solid in fleshing out Ma and Pa Kent, with Diane Lane providing the film's emotional linchpin. Russell Crowe's take on Jor-El is the most kickasss incarnation of Clark's biological dad yet. I thought he was fantastic, before and after he died. I love Amy Adams so I won't discuss her Lois Lane. I did like that sequence in which she proves her mettle as a Pulitzer Prize reporter by back-tracking the trail of good deeds done by that mysterious good samaritan.

Speaking of whom, Henry Cavill is tremendously buff and earnest and humorless as Clark Kent. It's weird but there were moments in which he resembled Tom Welling. I don't know how to feel about that. I thought, overall, Cavill does a fine job with what he's given to work with. It's almost as impressive as his dating Gina Carano.

The sometimes iffy trajectory of plot and character shortchanges the film. Equally debilitating, Cavill and Adams have minimal chemistry. I guess I'm crying out for that classic Lois & Clark banter. A huge positive is Antje Traue who as Zod's Sub-Commander, Faora-Ul, is attractive in a ruthless, genocidal kind of way. On the field of battle, Faora impresses as someone even more lethal than Zod. The film showcases her application of super-speed much better than it does Superman's.

It's a Nolan and Snyder joint, and we should've predicted the dark and incredibly serious tone. There are some good bits, even some great bits. It is visually stunning. For the most part, it's an exhilarating spectacle. But while the film focuses on the majesty of the Man of Steel, it's missing that sense of joy. One of the few times that the film really captures the spirit of Superman was during Clark's learning-how-to-fly sequence, which, by the way, trumps John Carter's learning-how-to-jump-really-high sequence. Clark's gleeful grin when he finally stabilizes himself in the air is pretty awesome. I anticipated more joyful scenes like that. There's a crap1oad of epic CG-generated action set pieces - and, yay, we should celebrate a big screen Superman who goes ba11s out in exhibiting his otherworldly skills set - but the final 40 minutes are so overwhelming and unrelenting that there eventually is this desensitizing effect.

The ""You are not alone"" broadcast inspires a genuine frisson of disquiet. Sucks then that it's undermined by the sheer lack of suspense as to who's transmitting the message. For a film loaded with the actiony stuff, too much exposition goes down in which things are told to the viewer rather than shown. Paraphrasing a conversation between a scientist and some grunt who should've known better:

- Scientist: ""They're terraforming!""
- Grunt, on cue: ""What's that?""
- Scientist: ""Well, terraforming is a process in which yada yada yada..."" (You get the picture.)

Further stuff to ponder and also this ***SPOILER*** tag (you've been warned):

- MAN OF STEEL is still miles ahead of SUPERMAN RETURNS. The one cool scene in SUPERMAN RETURNS? Bullet bouncing off the eyeball.
- Jenny Olson spends a huge chunk of her screen time in need of rescuing, so thanks to whoever thought up the gender swapping for a long-established character. What was the point? Somewhere, Katee Sackhoff is laughing her a-- off.
- It's baffling that Clark isn't stronger than these Kryptonians newly exposed to yellow sun. Clark had only been soaking up the sun's rays for, like, all his life.
- What's up with Clark's finding his spiffy Superman suit on a ship that's supposedly been buried in ice for over 18,000 years?
- When Clark steps into the suit, it doesn't feel like he'd earned it.
- As a tornado descends on the highway and everyone flees, but the Kents' dog gets left behind in the car, it's ridiculous that it's Pa Kent who goes back to fetch the dog, instead of his son who, spoiler alert, is friggin' superhuman.
- I don't buy Pa Kent's sacrifice. You can't convince me Clark was willing to just stand there and watch his dad die because the world isn't ready yet for what he is. Bu11crap!
- In one flashback Pa Kent advises boy Clark that he was wrong to save the bus full of drowning children because it might have exposed him. WTF? Which leads to this next one...
- Pa Kent needs to have a beer and a chat with Spider-Man's Uncle Ben.
- What does it say when a film either plays it so coy or is so embarassed of its source material that it shies away from calling our guy ""Superman""?
- For a hero who's supposed to be so concerned about saving lives, Superman seems awfully oblivious to all the folks in danger while he was punching and getting punched thru the cityscape. The casualties must've numbered in the hundreds of thousands, easy.
- That was an awkward, unearned and uncomfortably extended kissing scene between Clark and Lois, given that in the backdrop you can see the smoking ruins of Metropolis and its people trying to pick themselves up.
- I miss Teri Hatcher and Margot Kidder. And Dana Delaney.
- Michael Shannon's Zod kneels before Terence Stamp's Zod.
- And, yes, the most controversial element is Superman snapping General Zod's neck, thanks to Snyder and script doctor David S. Goyer's need to explain Superman's aversion to killing. Why must you explain why someone doesn't want to kill? Isn't it enough that he doesn't want to kill? I don't at all buy that Superman had no other recourse but to kill Zod. This act absolutely jettisons what he stands for. It redefines Superman. It lowers him to Wolverine's level. Superman's killed before in the comics, so it's not like it's unprecedented. But this just smacks of being incredibly contrived, with Snyder and Goyer intent on making their mark on the Superman mythos.
- The Clark Kent (finally with glasses) that we see in the last two minutes or so is pretty great. This is the Clark Kent I was waiting for, warm and awkward and human and not vigorously waving that messianic flag.

Okay, finally, (and, again, SPOILERS!!!!) here are a few things Clark could've done besides celery stalking Zod's neck:

- Tell that endangered family to MOVE, dammit.
- Cover Zod's eyes.
- Distract Zod by telling him Terence Stamp is talking smack behind his back.
- Using a raspy voice, whisper in Zod's ear: ""I'm the g0ddamned Batman!""
- Ticklefest.",1372464000,7,7196,4.7912973408541495
5783909,5,B00D91GRA4,"MAN OF STEEL delivers one of the most visual and dramatically rich films of the year.  Brilliantly crafted and realized by director Zach Snyder, the film wastes not a moment in weaving a complex tapestry that redefines the greatest superhero in history on an unheard of epic scale.

And make no mistake, this is the Superman of the 21st Century.  Director Zach Snyder and writer David S. Goyer have combined elements and touches of the most definitive Superman comics and graphic novels of the character's last 27 years to insure MAN OF STEEL is a faithful reboot, unlike Bryan Singer's failed ""Superman Returns.""  References and scenes abound from `Man of Steel,' `Earth One,' `Secret Origin,' `Battle of the Supermen,' `Birthright,' `Last Son of Krypton,' `Secret Identity,' and `New Krypton,' along with the New 52 re-launches of `Action Comics' and `Superman.'  Snyder and Goyer also courageously mix in new mythological elements that address our own world's controversial geo-political issues, all of which are grounded in the character's high morals and science-fiction mythos.

Those with pacemakers, heart conditions or in walkers better get out of the way - this is also 21st Filmmaking at its best.  Snyder has become one of the leading stylists in a new breed of directors who mix film stocks, exposure speeds, camera movement styles, visual effects and processing textures for narrative purposes - and he's never been more in tune with his gifts than he is here.

At times, the tone and drama of the dialogue and performances fly at you just as fast as his visuals, with each line and intonation as vital as his visual effects.  The extended opening on Krypton is layered with as much philosophy, religious contemplation, and environmental debates as it is with stunning renderings of technology and creatures.

Yet, Snyder takes time to slow down when emotion, performances, earthbound reality, and narrative tone demand it.  Writer David S. Goyer has structured his screenplay in a fashion similar to ""Batman Begins,"" which he co-authored with MAN OF STEEL co-producer and co-story author Christopher Nolan.  While Nolan maintained a consistent pace and stylistic approach in ""Batman Begins,"" while cross-cutting `timelines' in that film, Snyder utilizes stylistic shifts to allow his visuals to become a visceral extension of Goyer's screenplay structure and dialogue.

With regard to the film's performances, the casting could not be more perfect.  Henry Cavill embodies his triple roles as Kal-El, Clark Kent and Superman with levels of subtlety, regret, humanity, humor, compassion and - above all - humility.  He paces himself in each scene as `evolution' is the key demand of the role.  This is really a Clark Kent story, as film reveals to Clark just who he is and who he is destined to be.  In the first half, Cavill portrays a Clark Kent expressing loneliness, heroism, determination, and - yes - wit and humor as he wanders the country, struggling with a personal crisis - who am I, and what should I do?  Once he discovers his Kryptonian heritage, and identity as Kal-El, he `suits-up' as Superman.  Tragically, he must immediately face General Zod and his troops.  Cavill is a Superman who has yet to be anointed with that name by the people of earth.  Worse, he has yet to gain their trust.  For the balance of the film, we witness a Superman learning how to use his powers, protect the people of earth, and realizing you must have faith in people first before trust can be established.  It is a lesson he instills on the US military - those who most doubt his insistence he is a loyal American, through and through.  By the end of the film, Cavill delivers audiences' expectations of seeing the fully formed Superman and Clark Kent.

Amy Adam's Lois Lane is the exact embodiment of what we'd expect from an aggressive, Pulitzer Prize winning reporter.  She expresses hard-edged yet beautiful humanity when she stumbles onto the story of the century, only to realize she can't run it as it means ruining a man's life.  Michael Shannon brings to Zod a level of depth beyond just rage and vengeance.  A key revelation in his character is a tragic one.  We learn that he faces fulfilling a destiny he did not choose for himself.  As Clark's mother, Diane Lane balances showing concern and fear for her son as his powers emerge and he begins questioning why God made him this way.  Lane treats her Kryptonian adopted son as she would any child, hiding her fear and learning how to help her son control his powers.  Her goal is that of all mothers - teaching her son that childhood is just a phase of life, not its end.

In the Superman saga, the most important parental figures have always been the fathers - Jor-El and Jonathan Kent.  It's the casting of Russell Crowe as Jor-El and Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent that illustrate to audiences who Clark is when we meet him, and how he becomes Superman by the end of the film.  In Snyder's MAN OF STEEL, it is done better than in any previous cinematic version of the character.

Costner's Jonathan Kent is a complex man.  Upon learning young Clark has saved a school bus full of his classmates from sinking into a river, Costner is angered.  Insisting Clark must keep his powers a secret, when young Clark asks him if he should have let them die, Costner honestly responds, ""Maybe.""  He is a father desperate to protect his son from a world he knows is not ready to accept him.  A world he fears will turn its mightiest weapons against his son to kill him.

Yet, with each flashback featuring Costner's Jonathan Kent, the wisdom he departs deepens, as does the love he has for his son.  And Costner's Jonathan Kent imparts unto his son the ultimate example any father who truly believes in principles can - showing your son that you stand behind them at all cost. It's the film's most moving sequence.

Russell Crowe's Jor-El is equally full of dimension.  His role in the film is not limited to his scenes on Krypton.  When Kal-El finally discovers a way to download his father's `consciousness,' Crowe plays the scenes with kindness, reason and - above all - a powerful conviction of faith in his son.  Crowe is able to balance acknowledging the burden his son will face as he reveals Kal-El's Kryptonian origins to him, and the awesome responsibility Jor-El as a father is asking of Kal-El as a son to use his powers in becoming an inspiration and symbol of hope for the human race.  Like Costner's Jonathan Kent, Crowe inspires confidence in his son by reinforcing principles.

There is a sense of consistency in the values of Jonathan Kent and Jor-El as played by Costner and Crowe - a bridged gap that seems almost cosmic.  As if the two fathers are at once separate, yet part of a whole.

This is not a Superman for those clinging to the Fleischer animated shorts, the Reeves TV series, or the Richard Donner film.  And it doesn't need to be.  For those longing for those depictions of Superman, they will always exist - wonderfully preserved on Blu-Ray and DVD.  MAN OF STEEL does not negate these past incarnations, and it shouldn't.  Audiences should always treasure these previous versions of Superman.

Yet, the vitriol and anger expressed by critics and some Superman fans against MAN OF STEEL mystifies.  The accusation that the last hour of the film is just an over-the-top, empty, bombastic, visual effects laden disaster movie?  Not true.  There's as much drama, character development and emotion to be found in these scenes as there is in the rest of the film.  Furthermore, the film's climax is a `toned down' version of many modern Superman PG-13 animated films, graphic novels and comic book sagas, including the classic 1993 ""The Death of Superman"" story.

In 2007, the DC Animated Universe division released a direct-to-video film of this story entitled ""Superman: Doomsday.""  Rated PG-13, it contained more killings, violence, brutal action sequences, destroyed cities and adult content than MAN OF STEEL - and its running time was only 75 minutes.  I can only imagine what critics and many Superman fans would be saying this weekend had Warner Bros. chosen to release that 5 year old animated film instead of MAN OF STEEL.",1372377600,13,8221,4.836909871244635
5783910,5,B00D91GRA4,"It's hard to remake Superman these days. Batman taps into the deep psyche of vigilantism that has always haunted America, but Superman has come to embody a 1950s-style ideal of innocence  that many feel no longer applies in a cynical modern world.  Christopher Nolan and David S. Goyer came up with a simple solution. Just show Superman the way we would see him today.

And the reality of ""Man of Steel"" is that Superman is terrifying.  He is all-powerful, all-knowing, and he lives among us.  He is, in essence, the ultimate terrorist.  Is it any wonder America doesn't accept him at first?

With that perspective in mind, ""Man of Steel"" does what other superhero movies have failed to do (I'm looking at you, ""Green Lantern""), and that's present a superhero in a realistic fashion.  Kal-El AKA Superman AKA Clark Kent (Heny Cavill) is literally Krypton's last hope, but he's also a wanderer, a cipher, and yes a hero.  Sprinkled throughout ""Man of Steel"" is flashbacks to the difficulty of growing up as an alien pretending to be a human, shepherded by Martha (Diane Lane) and Jonathan (Kevin Costner) Kent. Both of Superman's father figures haunt him figuratively and literally to shape who Superman was, is, and will be. It's compelling stuff.

But this is a Superman movie, not a Batman movie, so the potential for world-shaking destruction is never far away. In fact, the level of destruction reaches uncomfortable levels -- those of us affected by 9/11 will find those wounds reopened in the face of superheroes blithely ignoring the massive casualties around them.  It's all filmed with a shaky-cam (tinged by the occasional faux lens flare), demonstrating just what Superman would look like exceeding the speed of sound.

""Man of Steel"" takes the Superman story and makes logical connections. Lois Lane (plucky Amy Adams) is the logical person to track down the alien -- not because of her sassy attitude but because she's a good reporter tracking down a lead.  Superman doesn't just decide to put on a cape -- he wears a mantle of leadership he willingly embraces. And when Superman comes face-to-face with Zod (Michael Shannon), he's staring down the regimented hierarchy of his past.

Goyer and Nolan have pulled of a believable Superman by making him a scary possibility to face.  And yet Superman is woefully unprepared for his role as world savior -- as Zod is fond of pointing out, he's just a farm boy -- or is he? Superman's reintroduced to the DC film universe leaves Metropolis and Smallville irrevocably changed.  And if the other movies planned in the shared universe are any indication, hopefully for the better.",1372377600,8,2635,4.900900900900901
5783911,5,B00D91GRA4,Man of Steel is an A+ quality movie. From start to finish is an engrossing movie experience that has a wonderful balance of story and action. Christopher Nolan's hand in this movie is very evident. Like Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy Man of Steel is a dark and serious movie start to finish. The movie is driven by story and action and there are very few comedic moments in this movie. And thankfully there's very little romance in this movie. Like Batman Begins and the 2009 Star Trek Man of Steel ignores prior movies in the series and is portrayed as a beginning story. The tension between Jor-el and Zod and Later Superman and Zod is palpable. The acting in this film was wonderful and the characters well performed and convincing. Then there's the story itself. The struggle for self identity story Clark Kent goes through once on earth is very human and very well written. The human element is much more present in this film than in Superman Returns. The more notable presence of the human element and a much better story make this film soar above Superman Returns. Nolan's plot has brought some of the brilliance the Dark Knight trilogy gave the Batman series and brought it to the Superman series. And Zack Snyder's directing gave us a wonderful action movie. The action in this movie is flat out awesome and far superior to the action in Superman Returns. The special effects and visuals are right on. Intense and realistic but not overdone. Man of Steel's wonderful balance of story and action and lack of romance make it an extremely satisfying movie. Both Superman fans and general audiences should love Man of Steel. This is everything you'd want in a great summer blockbuster. Great movie. 5 out of 5 stars easily. :),1372291200,8,1728,4.706270627062707
5783912,4,B00D91GRA4,"As for aesthetics, Man of Steel boasts a star-studded cast, a hunky new S man, plus imaginative sets and wardrobe. My teenager thought this film was the best superhero movie he has seen - to offer a different demographical viewpoint. There is more action and less romance than previous shows on Superman for sure. Overall, I thought it was pretty good, though a number of scenes felt contrived, awkward, and even a little hokey.

5783913,3,B00D91GRA4,"Let me first say that I've always believed that Superman as a whole is somewhat dull.  Supes is bogged down by the fact that he ignited the Golden Age of Comics.  He's an almighty being with few, if any, flaws, and that makes him boring to me.  There have been many attempts over the years to ""humanize"" him and give him flaws on the printed page (all to varying degrees of success) and even an attempt on the big screen with ""Superman Returns,"" whenever he was given a son born out of wedlock to Lois Lane.  He's the perfect hero for youngsters, as his super powers make him a wonderful being to dream about and pretend to be while playing.  When puberty or another harsh reality of life hits and things become complicated, children turn to darker heroes such as Batman, Daredevil, etc.

Now for my review.

The film opens with the token destruction of Krypton, albeit with a slight twist in the relationship of the main antagonist, General Zod, and Jor-El.  Kal-El is sent to Earth with hope for the future entrusted to him by his father and mother.  Zod and his comrades are imprisoned, but not before they promise to find Kal-El.  Once they find him, their intentions are fairly obvious.  From there, we witness the development of Superman in real time and flashbacks.  I enjoyed this aspect of the film, as we got to see Kal-El experience and deal with things like heat vision, x-ray vision, super hearing, and super strength for the first time.  We also get to see him struggle with the urge to use his powers when certain situations call for them.

Eventually fate catches up with Kal-El, and Zod and his pleasant pals find Superman on Earth.  Zod is on a mission to start a new Krypton and will stop at nothing to make this mission come to fruition.  The only thing standing in his way is the boy who fell from the sky in Kansas and an all-out slugfest ensues.

***POTENTIAL SPOILER WARNING***

The results, despite being very loud and destructive, are fairly by-the-book.  At no time in the film did I have any doubt that Superman would stop Zod.  While the battles were taking place, all I could think about were the jumbled, blurry battles of the ""Transformers"" films.  I knew that action was taking place, but I really couldn't see it.  The 3-D factor didn't help the situation either.  In fact, if you are reading this review while ""Man of Steel"" is still in theaters, save your money and do not watch it in 3-D.  It adds nothing to the film.

As many have already alluded to, Superman does quite a few un-Supermanly things.  While I understand the argument that some use for a few of his actions in the film (He was still developing his powers and/or had not realized how much danger those powers would put himself or others in), I also know that from the beginning, even within this film, Kal-El was ingrained with the ideals of protecting humanity at all costs and doing what is right.  I don't even mind the fact that in this film he kills someone.  What bothers me is the fact that he endangers the lives of innocents, which is something Superman ALWAYS tries to avoid.

***END POTENTIAL SPOILERS***

""Man of Steel"" attempts to make Superman grittier, and for that, I do applaud writers David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan.  Nolan did a brilliant job with his take on Batman on the big screen, making a grim character even darker.  Goyer has had his ups and downs over the years.  In my opinion he either knocks a story out of the park (""Blade"" and ""Blade II"") or fails miserably (""Blade: Trinity"" and ""Jumper"").  Somehow he and Nolan managed to make Superman grittier but still dull at the same time with ""Man of Steel.""

Of course, having Zack Snyder guide the entire project is hit and miss as well.  I have really enjoyed some of Snyder's work (""Watchmen"") but often find myself shaking my head at his projects like ""300"" and ""Sucker Punch.""  He relies very, very heavily on a stylized look for his films.  This worked brilliantly for ""Watchmen,"" but the story suffered in ""300"" and ""Sucker Punch.""

Ironically, Snyder seems to have held back a bit on the style this go 'round, losing a lot of the polish his films usually come with, and amped up the action to near-Michael Bay levels.  This, in my opinion, hurt ""Man of Steel"" more than it helped.  For those of you who skipped the ""spoiler"" section, know that 3-D adds nothing to the film.

I also believe that Snyder's guidance of the actors lead to a few wooden performances.  Henry Cavill is okay as Superman/Clark Kent/Kal-El, but there are moments in the film where he seems to be attempting to channel Christopher Reeve (something I believe Brandon Routh managed to do brilliantly in ""Superman Returns""), that actually hurt his performance.  This isn't Reeve's version of Superman, apparently, so why attempt to bring some of that character to the table?  I also felt that Diane Lane (Martha Kent) delivered a less-than-stellar performance.  I enjoy watching Lane in other films, but something just didn't click with me in her portrayal of Martha.  Ayelet Zurer portrays Lara, Superman's mother, and while her role is quite small in the film, I felt that her performance overall was average at best.

Amy Adams was decent as Lois Lane.  When first introduced to her character, Adams brought the fearlessness of Lois to the forefront.  As the film wore on, however, the character seems to lose a step.  Michael Shannon (General Zod) chewed up any and every scene he was in.  His Zod was burly, barking, and one-track minded.  I never could really find any attachment to his character though and in the end, I was glad when his barking stopped.

Despite these bumps in the road, there were quite a few bright spots in this film, however.  Kevin Costner nailed his brief turn as Jonathan Kent.  Costner is starting to show his age, and was perfect for the role.  Another bright spot was Russell Crowe as Jor-El.  Even though I knew what was going to happen to him, I cheered him on in the beginning of the film.  He seemed genuinely concerned for his people and for his son's life.  He was quite possibly the best performer in the entire film.  One other performance worthy of special mention is that of Antje Traue, who portrayed Zod's right hand man...er..woman, Faora-Ul.  While she didn't have many lines in the film, she was excellent with the few she had.  I actually hope to see her return in the next film, as I felt she was more imposing than Zod.

Other performances worth noting are those of Michael Kelly (Lombard), Rebecca Buller (Jenny), Laurence Fishburne (Perry White), and Mackenzie Gray (Jax-Ur).  While all of these actors had small roles, they did solid jobs with them.

Overall, I'd have to say that ""Man of Steel"" is a mediocre flick.  I went in hoping to see a new spin on an old hero and I got that, but so much of the core character was peeled away that the film ended up somewhat hollow.  I do believe that Henry Cavill has the goods when it comes to portraying Superman, I just believe that a better director and better story would have helped him greatly.  Much like Brandon Routh, he was weighed down by good intentions that eventually killed the film overall.

Mildly recommended, as it was nice to see Supes on the big screen again.  Just skip the 3-D.",1372291200,7,7261,4.600467289719626
5783914,5,B00D91GRA4,So far the best movie of the year for me! Seen it multiple times already and still counting. This is a must have,1372291200,6,112,3.9130434782608696
5783915,4,B00D91GRA4,"DC Comics has rivaled and preceded Marvel Comics for many decades with its roster of super heroes and is now attempting to reestablish their greatest character, Superman. Having been previously depicted in movies and television, Man of Steel is the biggest production to date.  Is it any good, and is it better than Superman Returns?  Yes and yes.  Despite a darker tone, (courtesy of the creative tandem of producer Christopher Nolan and writer David Goyer from The Dark Knight films and director Zach Snyder of Watchmen), this adventure is an entertaining action piece with a deep psychological subtext.

The planet Krypton is dying, and scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and his wife Lara launch a spacecraft to send their newborn son, Kal-El, to a promising world, Earth.  General Zod (Michael Shannon), whose attempted coup is thwarted, is banished into a wormhole.  When Krypton is destroyed, Kal-El lands on earth, and through a series of flashback vignettes, we see the school boy named Clark struggling with growing pains and the values instilled by his adoptive human parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane)  who try to hide his superhuman strength and abilities.  As an adult, Clark (Henry Cavill) takes a series of jobs and remains anonymous, off the grid until odd reports begin to circulate of a mysterious man who saves lives with remarkable powers which brings reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) hot on his trail.  The setting shifts from the cornfields of Midwest America to Metropolis.  As General Zod reappears to claim earth for his race, the stage is set for a grand battle with the fate of the world in the hands of a true blue hero.

There are some fine moments such as the young Clark befriending a former bully and being repaid in kind.  There is the tornado scene that brings Clark's non-use of his powers to a turning point.  Later, when the military first meet Superman and question his intentions, he responds by rescuing scores of people and is vindicated in a touching moment.

This Superman (with more than a passing parallel with Jesus) is depicted as an emotionally vulnerable soul, and although he possesses great powers and invincibility, he does feel pain especially when meted out by his own kind.  The whole film is ultimately a moral struggle and contrast between two fathers and whether their son's powers are meant for good or to be kept hidden no matter what the cost.  It's also about his personal journey to find his purpose amid a normal life and search for his origins.  Can he embody the best of both worlds, and to what lengths will Superman go to save humanity?

Cavill is quite convincing as Superman, certainly an improvement on Brandon Routh's turn in Superman Returns.  Adams shows a thoroughly capable yet vulnerable Lane, a strong reporter and Pulitzer Prize winner to boot!  Her scenes with Superman work quite well especially in the quieter, intimate moments which one hopes will lead to much more in future installments.

The supporting cast excels.  Crowe lends gravitas to a subordinate role, and he registers every time he appears. Diane Lane is good as the compassionate Momma Kent.  (Ironically Lane starred in Hollywoodland about TV's Superman, George Reeves).  Costner makes a strong impression as the resolute, adoptive dad who is willing to risk his life for a principal.  Laurence Fishburne is a more three-dimensional Perry White, and Christopher Meloni is effective as a hardnosed military commander.

Special visual effects have come a long way since 1978's Superman when the slogan was, ""You'll Believe a Man Can Fly!"" Some of the effects show incredibly fast motion which makes you wonder how cool it would be to realize such DC Comic characters as The Flash.  While Hans Zimmer has the appropriate, heroic musical score in place here, John Williams truly memorable theme song is a hard act to follow.

The action is not the cartoon variety; people do get hurt and some perish.  Regarding that final battle in the streets of Metropolis (previously depicted in Superman II), enough already!  We've seen The Avengers decimate New York City and The Transformers wreak havoc on a massive scale.  These scenes are becoming old hat (even in a post 9/11 world), and are starting to seem repetitive overkill.  Don't get me started on the obvious product placement; when it begins to be noticeable, it becomes annoying.

Perhaps the only disappointment here is the lack of much humor or lightheartedness. There are a couple funny moments; the film could have used a few more.  One hopes a lighter tone is in store for the next chapter. Maybe we will see Lex Luthor and Jimmy Olsen who are both missing here. You barely see Clark Kent get his gig at The Daily Planet before the credits roll.  Oh, and contrary to the Marvel films, do not bother staying through the credits in hope of a post credit tease.  The film's greatest accomplishment is setting a strong foundation for the next Superman adventure and possibly the beginnings of a Justice League of America (emulating Marvel's The Avengers).  Wouldn't that be cool?",1372204800,5,5105,4.928654970760234
5783916,5,B00D91GRA4,"I found Man of Steel to be an inspirational movie for our time. It is an epic in the highest sense in that regard with actors who were made to play the parts and a magnificent soundtrack that conveys the urgency of the combat between good and consummate evil with a portrayal of a humble Superman who proved beyond a shadow of a doubt the ""He who humbles himself shall be exalted"".  The spiritual parallels are unmistakable with the most glaring being the sub-commander of General Zod telling Superman that he was too weak because he had morals, and that she would overcome because she had none with evolution always winning out in the end, which it didn't in this movie mirroring real life. Man of Steel is the heroic exaltation of freedom over tyranny against impossible odds, and if ever there was a moment in history where that message of hope is needed, it is now where tyranny is having its way with the world to include our own country. This movie is a masterpiece which I highly recommend.",1372118400,7,997,4.538888888888889
5783917,5,B00D91GRA4,"First off, I just want to say that Henry Cavill's performance was unmatched by any other actor who's ever played Superman. George, Christopher, Dean, Brandon and Tom can all go suck it. I like Tom and Christopher in their own respective Superman universes, but neither of them, and ESPECIALLY not Routh, can compare to Cavill's performance. He brought a very human perspective to the character of Superman.

The action in this movie is unparalleled, this is the one Superman movie we get to see where he gets to fully unleash his powers. You really feel like these are gods from Olympus who have come down to Earth to duke it out. I do think that a little less action could have been more, but as it is I love it.",1372118400,7,713,4.484615384615385
5783918,5,B00D91GRA4,"Ok so I loved the movie, I think for the most part the acting was great and the story was well done. Henry Cavill was amazing as Superman and most of the other actors were played well. The action in this movie is sick! I loved the fight scenes and how there was a ton of action.this is definitely a must see. Now I do have some things that I didn't like, but they weren't terrible enough to give a lesser rating and here it goes: SPOILER ALERT!!
Cons: I think Michael Shannon played Zod a bit weak. I expected a bit more of that tightly wound character that he plays so well. I almost felt bad that he was trying to ""save his people"" We are supposed to hate Zod not sympathize with him?
They way Jonathan Kent dies was a little too much, I mean it seemed to me like that was the slowest tornado EVER! Like really? It was like watching spongebob ""3 hours later"" for all my parents out there lol and then by the time the tornado actually engulfs him it's like No No son don't save me everyone will see?! Heck half the town already knew he was special ""my son was in the bus""!!! Why not just save your dad? Seemed to me like they should've just let the tornado take him and cut out the whole not saving his father thing? Most of us wouldn't care who saw I think not if it meant saving a loved one?
And the final thing was as much as I loved the fight scenes it seemed like Metropolis was a barren wasteland after this and it was like absolutely destroyed,  and in my opinion it seems to me a lot of people would be pissed off a supes being that he was sorta the reason this all happened? Just saying... Besides that though its a fun comic book movie and deserves the five stars",1372118400,6,1674,4.088145896656535
5783919,1,B00D91GRA4,"Superman is considered the first and the greatest Super hero ever created. The Man of Steel is a horrible movie and is nothing like the comic character we all know and love. At the begging when Russell Crowe was flying around on a dragon it was so stupid. Come on this is a superman movie, not some stupid harry potter avatar fantasy crap. The planet krypton in this movie was awful and looked like red planet from a star wars movie. What happened to the beautiful place with crystals? The Kryptonian council looked incredibly stupid wearing gold and looking like Egyptian pharaohs instead of the traditional white robes with their family crest on them. If there were spaceships and dragons only in this new version on Krypton, why didn't the kryptonians just fly away on there ships when the planet started to rumble and explode? They should have also never had zod stab and kill jor-el at the beginning, it changed the greatness of seeing Jorel and Lara together as the only survivor of krypton took off in the sky in his rocket. In the movie they then skipped the whole story of Kal-el landing on earth and the Kent's finding him in a field. This film has tons of flash backs when he was a kid that are really short and you don't get that much information, they were ok, but since there were so much of them it drives you a little crazy. They should have done some sequences in order. The Kent parents did not really show at all any love an compassion like they were meant to do. I hated how instead of having the dramatic sad event when Johnathan has a heart attack, they had him disappear in the twister because he didn't want Clark to save him and expose himself in front of the other people. Come on Clark exposed his secret 1 or 2 times before that. Anyone who had the ability would reveal there powers in order to save their father. Having Lois find out that this person with powers is Clark Kent even before he was superman ruined the whole movie. This is not how it should have been done. During the scene when a hologram Jor-el kept popping up and opening and closing doors on the spaceship was totally lame. I thought that the kryptonian suites were ridiculously stupid and they looked like mini transformers.
As he became superman the character wasn't special, and he didn't portray who superman really is. The Last hour of the movie was really terrible and full of a bunch of crazy s***! Boom boom! Fighting, and they totally wrecked the whole city. For a long time they are standing and fighting in front of a Sear's building, and it just seems like we got nothing going here let's advertise Sear's so we can get some customers to our stores. In this film it is all dark and gloomy like they were trying to make a dark knight movie which was a total disaster. Pretty much everyone except his parents hated him whether he was Clark Kent or Superman. Even Lois lane didn't like him as either Clark or as superman. She and Supes had a big lame kiss at the end that didn't really fit because she shows no liking of him. The Lois lane in the comics and movies goes crazy over superman and is madly attracted but not in this one Oh did I mention they only called him Superman once or twice! I found the new suite to be okay but I didn't love it. If you compare the suite with the ones in the Spider man movies, it is the same thing with the colors and scaly fabric, take off the spider and put on an S. I am not hung up on the original superman movies and do think that some parts are boring, but the first two were good examples of what superman stands for. What they should have done with the Man of Steel was recreated the original superman movie up to the point were he becomes superman and than created what ever movie they wanted but no crap. They could have even still used the same suit and the same actors but actually made a wonderful memorable movie like they did a long time for the older generation. What can you expect about the movie is that this is not the beloved superman we have always known, the story is mostly completely told backwards and there is no kryptonite, fortress of solitude, lex luthor, and jimmy olsen. There is also is no love, passion, and or some one to look up too. Finally this is just not a good movie. Man of steel is essentially so jam-packed and busy that it's an origin story, a coming-of-age story, a science fiction film, a superhero movie, an alien invasion, a war movie, and a disaster movie all bumping into each other. This is a really messed up superhero movie using the superman characters, but this is not Superman we have known for 75 years. Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster the creators of superman have watched this movie from heaven and are completely ashamed of what has become of their 75 year old superhero that they had created.",1372118400,3,4795,4.394825646794151
5783920,5,B00D91GRA4,"I know some critics gave less than glowing reviews of this film, but of the critical reviews I've read it seems to me that most of the problems people had with the movie boiled down to it not being the same Superman that we all knew and loved from the Richard Donner/Christoper Reeve era. Don't get me wrong I loved the and still love Superman I and II from ""back in the day"", but I also really loved this new take on the character and his origins and the films more complex and serious themes. The Donner/Reeves movies were wonderful, but they were set very much in a comic book world and limited by the special effects of their day. This movie is set in a world meant to be very much like our own - less black and white with more shades of gray. Superman is not the ""big blue boyscout"" that some reviewers feel he must be, but the character wants to be that and is striving toward that and is learning as he goes. I expect in a Man of Steel II we'll see a Superman much more sure of himself and much more certain of who he his and what he wants to be to the world. As for this movie, it's full of great performances all around, with the obvious standouts, being Michael Shannon as Zod, Amy Adams as Lois and Henry Cavill in the title role. All three bring something impressive and new to the characters they're portraying. Zod is the bad guy of course, but his motivations are ones you can understand if not agree with and Lois is much more than a mere love interest or damsel in distress. Superman himself - well, he's not Superman yet really - this is his journey to become that and Cavill portrays that conflict, doubt, pain and triumph so very well. My favorite surprise of the film was Jor-El played by Russel Crow. His Jor-El is so much more active and a driver of the plot, I won't give anything away, but he was a real hero in his own right. The action in ths movie is incredible, simply the best superpowered combat ever seen on screen and, while fairly bloodless, is nontheless sometimes brutal in its intensity. As to the music, I alwasy loved the John Wiliams theme from the old movies and I did miss a big, distinctive theme at the opening of this movie, but Hans Zimmer's score for Man of Steel is simply brilliant. It's at times quiet, at times brooding and at times relentless in it's power. The use of percussion is incredible. Overall, I would call this a great movie, a visually stunning re-birth of an iconic character and an experience not to be missed by fans of superhero, action and sci-fi. All this great stuff being said this movie is not for little kids, it's rated PG-13 for a reason, and while all kids are different, I think parents should hold off on letting kids under 10 watch this and even 10 and older kids should watch it only w/ a parent present to answer questions and explain the context of events.",1372118400,14,2839,4.318352059925093
5783921,3,B00D91GRA4,"Super Overdose

The Man of Steel was the man of over-do. This movie was filled with SUPER Action, SUPER noise and SUPER Side effects.  It's obvious we all know how it ends, good verses evil and Superman saving the world, so with that said,  I will share my  thoughts on what those who haven't seen the movie may not know. We have a movie that is filled with loads of action, trips to space, galaxy's, mixed with earthy surroundings, and lots of flashbacks through out the movie.  The space ships to me, looked like the Cicad's bugs that have been hiding for the past 17 years and just recently  have been circulating amongst us. Who knows, maybe Michael Shannon who played the truly believable villain,""General Zod"" brought them with him after he resurfaced to earth after 33 years of living in some type of cocoon. Shannon did a excellent job as portraying a villain. He was forceful, uncompassionate, tuff, strong and powerful. His facial expressions were even  convincing to  be the cold hearted character he played.  Lets face it, everyone likes a Super Hero, but Shannon was a Super Villain and I enjoyed his role and acting immensely.  Then we have Russell Crow who played the biological  father of superman. He made me Super happy when he didn't belt out a song ""singing"" a Super lullaby to baby Superman before sending the small wonder off into space to save the world.  The booms and the crashes through out the movie were bit much. The constant jumping  from one point to another, zig zagging  was as if there was a tennis match going on, and the dialogue did not always gel at times. Speaking of gel, Henry Cavill did a excellent job  in playing the part as Superman. While we watched him bounce off walls, crash into buildings, fly in the ski, I couldn't help but to notice how Super wonderful Superman's hair looked through out the movie, no doubt Super Gel, it never moved. The flashback during the movie showing superman childhood were my favorite parts of the movie, that's where you saw and felt  the true heart of the show.  All in All, if your  into  super action, your going to like it. What I felt it lacked was being able to reach the young viewers. I don't think young viewers would understand the ""talk""  the dialogue is to mature for children to follow. A super hero should be able to touch the hearts of the young,  and the vulnerable, but in my opinion it didn't do that.  An overdose of unnecessary action.",1372032000,7,2434,4.559907834101383
5783922,4,B00D91GRA4,"There is much to like in MAN OF STEEL, the latest effort to re-make the one-time comic book icon into a national hero. Nowadays, it's not enough to have an action movie; in order to humanize a comic book icon it's important but to give the hero a strong sense of introspection, a psychological neediness. MAN OF STEEL lands somewhere in between: it's the story of a man who is not quite a superstar, and a hero who is not quite ready for prime time.

Directed by Zack Snyder, MoS achieves its greatest successes in the first half of the film, having wisely decided to condense our hero's upbringing into only those certain new elements. Most already know the overall story: born on a crumbling Krypton doomed by overzealous energy demands, the infant Kal-El is sent to Earth by his scientist parents, Jor-El and Lara (Russell Crowe and Ayelet Zurer). Whereas other films have concentrated on our super tadpole's upbringing by Kansan farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane), who instill in him humble middle-American values, MAN OF STEEL chooses not to relate any more of his story than is necessary to develop the plot. It's a wise move that makes the movie less top heavy, leaving us to glean only those elements necessary to this incarnation - it's only a shame they didn't follow this practice at the end, too.  More on that later.

Henry Cavill is an interesting choice for Superman - the first non-American to play the part, he projects almost the opposite image in each of his personages. While I found him to be a virile, bold Clark - as comfortable holding up collapsing derricks as he is lifting buses - he projected a smiling calm as Superman, fitting in the suit as if his highly pumped pecs and abs were born to it...which, as it turns out, they were.  He's certainly credible as Superman, but I found him to be more interesting as Clark; that is, the pre-Superman Clark, when there was no disguise to dilute him. As Clark he was troubled, searching, and three-dimensional, and not only in the pay-four-extra-dollars-for-your-ticket kind. He seemed to lose that dimension when he divided himself: like a lobotomized patient, he was only half as interesting anymore.

Yet still, the movie is compelling and enjoyable...certainly more enjoyable than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-Returns/dp/B000LB4DWO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman Returns</a>, the Bryan Singer-directed movie starring Brandon Routh, I found myself liking MAN OF STEEL even while it tried to wow us with action scenes at the end that were a little too dependent upon the same stunts done endlessly: I mean, how many times do we have to see them knock each other through buildings?

I don't know if the problem with the movie's third act was solely Superman's; I liked the concept behind a world having to come to term with this new alien in their midst. But there was simply something missing once they did so: having accepted Superman, it seemed the drama was replaced by bad guys, super-fisticuffs and exploding buildings.

You see, our bad guys this time around are General Zod (Michael Shannon) and his fellow renegades, who led a revolt against Jor-El and the council because of their foolish raping of the planet's natural resources (sound familiar, anyone?). Banished to the Phantom Zone until Krypton's explosion frees them, they spend the next three decades searching for Kal-El, whom they believed to carry enough coded genetic information to re-animate their race. They decide to use Earth as a giant nursery upon which to recreate their species, wiping out all existing humans in the process.

Part of the problem was that their conclusion chose the weakest elements of their story to promote. For instance, right from the beginning I thought General Zod's rebellion had legs; certainly, the council's actions DID destroy their planet...but now that Krypton was no more, his plan to destroy our race was simply too easy to dislike; their hope to recruit Kal-El/Clark could have have been interesting if they hadn't made Shannon's Zod so one-dimensional and unlikeable. Kal/Clark had spent the whole early film trying to find out why he was, in effect, a freak...couldn't Zod and his ilk have given him a more compelling choice to make in this regard? Shannon's a terrific actor - see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Take-Shelter/dp/B006HGXGWU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Take Shelter</a>&nbsp;if you have any doubt. He would have quite ably handled a better script.

Another problem for me - a BIG one - concerned a late-movie decision Superman was forced to make; it should have been more psychologically difficult for him, and other than a mighty shout the issue was over. Nothing more. This should have been another area of EXTREME importance to the myth, yet it was passed over like toppings on a pizza.

These things said, I enjoyed the movie overall. Snyder has directed his movie capably, lending itself a proper air of fresh excitement. Indeed, there was even a sense of discovery here, and a palpable feeling of true franchise value. There were several Easter Eggs for the observant: LexCorp was written on the side of several trucks, and there was at least one mention of Wayne Enterprises. And the movie always kept a sense of fun: as Superman is sent crashing into a just-constructed wall, the OSHA sign there drops the 1 and 6 from ""106 Days Without an Accident,"" leaving just the 0. And there's a sign in a soda shop proclaiming ""Go Smallville Spartans."" The tie-in? One of Zack Snyder's previous films was...<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/300/dp/B000V39KDO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">300</a>. Go Spartans, indeed.

While there were a few weak choices in writing, there were some particularly interesting ones concerning Lois. Ably acted by Amy Adams (check that alliteration!), she was no femme fatale, but a capable and loyal partner of not only Superman but also Clark the Reporter. While she needed a rescue now and then, she is the most capable Lois I've seen since Noel Neill, back in the days of black and white television of my youth. She not only gives the series a smart compass, but she will also likely serve as a ""sidekick,"" given this movie's script. I do believe that the core of this enterprise is a solid one, capable of leading the franchise onward. Other than those misplaced early steps, it looks like the movie is on solid footing.",1372032000,2,6520,5.1415094339622645
5783923,4,B00D91GRA4,Man of Steel is a awesome film to watch. Henry Cavill as Superman / Clark Kent was good also Amy Adams Lois Lane was good as well. And also the Story was fun and the special effects where good and did not take you out of the movie. Hans Zimmer's score was good but I still perfer John Williams Superman The Movie score over Man of Steel. And aside from some pacing issues the film works. So overall Man of Steel is off to a great start to re start Superman as a film series. I look forward to seeing this again on Blu-Ray Disc soon. And I can't wait for the sequel of Man of Steel in 2 to 3 years. Man of Steel is awesome!!!!,1372032000,5,625,3.9291338582677167
5783924,4,B00D91GRA4,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

The more I think about my experience with Man of Steel the more I realize how indifferent I feel towards the film. Nothing about it was inherently bad, but I kind of left the theater feeling like I didn't really get anything out of the movie. It should be noted that I've never been Superman's number one fan. Personally, I always enjoyed the cartoon that aired when I was a child over any of the films, but I expected this to be different. I think part of my indifference stems from me expecting one thing based on the trailers, but ending up receiving something slightly different. Now this has been a somewhat common occurrence as of late (Iron Man 3 & Now You See Me come to mind), but it never ceases to be annoying.

By now it's common knowledge that the last attempt to reboot the Superman franchise was a total disaster. I have yet to meet someone who has anything nice to say about Superman Returns, but I think audiences will be singing a different tune about Man of Steel. While Returns was boring, predictable, and, to be honest, a little stupid, Man of Steel is strong, heartfelt, and confident in what it sets out to do. With that said, there was just something about its execution that didn't sit right with me.

Man of Steel begins with the origin story; providing some slight deviations from the source material, but that's not what threw me off. While we were going through the events on Krypton I couldn't help but feel like I was watching a Star Wars movie. The environments, the color scheme, the weird lizard/dragon thing that Jor-El (Russell Crowe) kept riding around; it all looked like something ripped out of the prequel films. Not only that, but these environments aren't completely believable. Obvious CGI is obvious and I found it hard to focus on what was going on because everything just looked so fake. The worst part of it is that they spent at least a good 15-20 minutes (estimation, didn't time it) wasting time going over something that everyone knows about. I don't mind retelling an origin story, but make it snappy.

Once we get off Krypton and find ourselves on Earth things start to smooth out a bit. From there we follow a confused Clark Kent aka Kal-El (Henry Cavill) as he tries to figure out who he is and where he came from. As the story progresses we get glimpses of Clark's upbringing through flashbacks. Usually these flashbacks occur after he passes out from doing some great feat like saving a ship crew. He soon meets Lois Lane (Amy Adams) and saves her life as she's doing a news report up in the mountains. We're given more details into his past as he explains his story to her and why he tries to keep himself hidden.

To be honest, the connection being made between Clark and Lois is one of the best things about Man of Steel. It's very honest and pure and both parties know that neither of them are capable of understanding what the other is going through because they're two completely different people. Yet they know that there's some weird connection between the two of them and they're not sure what the appropriate action should be. All of this is excelled even further because Cavill and Adams have a beautiful chemistry onscreen that makes the whole thing just feel right.

While I loved the introduction to these characters, I wasn't too fond of the predictability of the story. The antagonist in the film is General Zod (Michael Shannon), an ex-rebel on Krypton who gets sent to the Phantom Zone after killing Jor-El. Our time on Krypton comes to a close shortly after these events, but what got to me is the fact that Krypton exploded right after Zod was exiled. Not only that, but Lara Lor-Van (Ayeket Zurer) acted as if this were expected. If that's the case why send Zod to the Phantom Zone in the first place? Just let him blow up with everyone else. I knew that after they sent him off the planet he was going to eventually find his way to Earth. I knew this as someone who's only read a handful of the comics. Unfortunately, in movies like this, being able to predict the story 20 minutes in winds up taking some of the fun out of the experience.

The other thing I really loved, aside from the perfectly cast Clark and Lois, was the fight sequences. This is how you make fight scenes in a comic book movie, or at least a Superman movie. Because these individuals aren't human their punches need to look powerful. Not only that, but the audience needs to be able to feel the force of the blows just by watching them on screen. Well Zack Snyder nailed it. Not all movie goers will understand the reference, but I found that the fight sequences reminded me of the fighting mechanics in the recently released Injustice: Gods Among Us (a fighting game featuring an extensive cast of DC characters.) The action is fast, it's powerful, and you can see just how hard they're hitting each other based on the destruction around the city. It was everything it needed to be and then some.

Overall I felt the casting was very well done. I already mentioned my love for Cavill and Adams, but they're not the only ones who delivered with their performances. Kevin Costner and Diana Lane appear as Jonathan and Martha Kent, respectively. Both of them were perfectly cast for their roles and Diana Lane absolutely nailed her performance. Oh, that reminds me, the way Cavill was able to bring out the love that Clark has for Martha was outstanding. There's a scene where Zod goes to his house and Clark goes on a mini-rampage. Everything from his dialogue to his actions was beyond perfect. Michael Shannon gave another solid performance as Zod and Laurence Fishburn, a perfect choice by the way, was spot on as Perry White.

Finally, the score, composed by Hans Zimmer, was a little underwhelming. I've grown very fond of Zimmer over the years, but most of the compositions just didn't seem to fit with their corresponding scenes. It seemed as if every single piece was this grand, larger-than-life composition and not every scene calls for that sort of thing. The occasional somber composition usually worked out, but there wasn't enough of it. Definitely not his strongest score, but I've heard worse.

Overall Score: 7.75/10 - Man of Steel isn't one of those films that's perfect from start to finish. It's kind of a bumpy ride, but it more than makes up for it with the wonderful casting and the gripping action sequences. There's definitely room for improvement, and there's obviously going to be a sequel, so I look forward to seeing where they take this rebooted series in the future.",1372032000,3,6600,4.618925831202046
5783925,2,B00D91GRA4,"With the sheer dozens of Superhero films being thrown at us in the past years, starting with Sam Raimi's Spider-Man, another iteration of Superman was just a matter of time, especially considering Brian Singer's Superman Returns was anything but a success, both financially and artistically. So, there was definitely a considerable audience for Man Of Steel, one that was longing for a proper Superman movie. At the same time, though, with all the superhero franchises out there that have already been successful, and already have satisfied many needs for great comic book adaptions, you really have to knock one out of the park to be considered in the same league as Batman, Spider-Man, Iron Man or The Avengers. Especially since the Superman origin story already was told a few years ago. With Christopher Nolan and Zack Snyder, whose Watchmen was a good piece of film making, one would think the right people were in place.

So, does it hold up? In a word, no.
If you want to save yourself the hassle of reading this lengthy review to its bitter end, let me sum it up for you quickly: Man Of Steel is the result of taking Superman The Movie and Superman 2, making the lead actor seem uncharismatic, removing the sense for delight and adventure, replacing the poignant dialogue with pseudo-drama, and unleashing ridiculously long Transformers-like CGI action sequences upon the unsuspecting audience.
Condensing this down even further, I would pick three words to describe this film: stupid, tedious and superficial. ""Stupid"" sounds, well, stupid, but is in its simplicity a great word to describe the intangible feeling hanging over this entire thing.
The prologue already alienated me from the entire Superman universe. It looks like a combo of a George Lucas directed Star Wars prequel and Transformers, complete with silly flying pteranodons. In the council scenes, I almost expected Yoda to come forth and say ""Evacuate Krypton, we will not!"" Had this prologue not key scenes of the Superman mythology, you would surely mistake it for a second-grade sci-fi flick.
The CGI mumbo-jumbo goes completely over board here (and later on), and showcases perfectly the difference between well-designed thought through sets, and the misleading notion ""more and bigger is better"". It is quite the achievement on part of the design team to make a 2013 movie look more ridiculous than Superman The Movie from 30 years ago. I usually don't nitpick on things like this, but when Zod and his accomplices were taken into the Phantom Zone in what looked exactly like big black rubber penises, I sunk just a tiny bit lower in my seat.
The story is nothing revolutionary, but I lost complete faith in the credibility of the film when it was revealed that Jor-El hid the DNA of every single Kryptonian in Superman's cells. That's when I knew someone on this project had to have lost his mind.

There was some doubt and fear that Christopher Nolan's involvement could mean a Dark Knight treatment for a character that is, and should be, arguably almost the polar opposite of Batman in tone. And gues what? These fears were justified. No movie to this day managed to suck the life and heart out of a superhero as thoroughly as Man Of Steel.

What makes this movie so absolutely tiresome is two things: the story, which is atrociously told, and the action sequences that are overlong and tedious in their visual and sonic overkill.
You have here the origin story of Superman, which has already been told twice before. You would think that, as a film maker, you want to really make it work, you want to make it exciting and fresh, with good dialogue and so on. Instead, what we have here is a Clark Kent/Superman that could as well be Bruce Wayne, or Peter Parker, with all the incessant self-doubts and thoughtful and sorrowful looks. It is truly annoying and frustrating, not to mention overdone, that producers/directors of superhero flicks apparently think lots of superficial drama and a hero with self-doubts and worried eyes can replace a well-written story and well-portrayed and fleshed out characters.
If these inner conflicts were at least portrayed well and believable, but they are not. It works on a very basic level, but everything beyond appears to be just pure superficial drama. And this is simply due to the fact that Superman/Clark Kent is not, and never was, such a deeply troubled individual such as Bruce Wayne or Peter Parker. The whole world knows it, and you simply don't buy it.
Ironically, when the writer/director does have the opportunity to create something worthwhile and heartfelt, it feels half-assed and rushed, like the exposition of his space capsule to young Clark.
Looking at Man Of Steel, it doesn't get any more superficial, especially in the last hour of the movie, where basically nothing happens except loads of explosions and CGI wizardry. There is no sense of heroism in this film, no sense of adventure or romance, just superficial drama and mind-numbing action sequences. If you want to know how bad it is, let me just say that the film makers managed to suck the life out of the characters and the story to such an extent that the first kiss between Superman and Lois Lane, probably one of the most iconic love couples in cinema, feels wierd and out of place. Speaking of Lois Lane, Amy Adams does her best, but falls victim to the overused marketing ploy of squeezing a female character into the story, or in this case taking an existing character and blowing it out of proportions, in order to capture female demographics. Not to mention that the decision to make her meet Clark and his superpowers early on is one of the worse decisions in this film.

Indeed, one could rightfully say that out of all the major superhero films in the last 10 years, Man Of Steel is the one that comes closest to compromising the entire heart and soul of its title character. Superman Returns was way more enjoyable than Man Of Steel, on many levels.
Just as an example, Superman Returns had a focus, and you knew what the film makers were trying to do, and they did it, no matter how clumsily you think they did it. But in Man Of Steel, there is literally not a single thing the movie focuses on for a prolonged time except that Zod wants to turn earth into Krypton. There is a lot of jammering about finding your place, finding yourself, finding destiny, but there is no effort done by the writers or the director to show me, the audience, how the main character develops. That feeling of development is never there, so I stopped caring halfway through.
It also doesn't help the entertainment value of the film that the producers decided to turn this into an alien invasion movie, when alien invasion movies seem to reproduce themselves like rabbits these days.

The picture also has enormous pacing problems. From the very first scenes on, you get the impression nobody did a test screening, not even for the director.
Man Of Steel is in its first half extremely slow and tedious because of the uninteresting dialogues and bad chracterisations, to the point were the ongoing flashbacks stop the movie dead in its tracks, and in its second half, it is just mind-numbing in its over the top action, which almost reaches Transformers' level of absurdity, albeit thankfully without the pre-school humour. Speaking of humour, it doesn't exist in this film. I don't know, maybe Snyder and Nolan talk about their own director's cut when they speak of the fun aspects of this film, but the cut that was shown at my theatre didn't have any of that. Instead, everything is teinted with this aforementioned, theatrical drama, which puts an enormous distance between the film and the audience.
To make clear how bad this movie needs some light moments and good-natured dialogue, the only time I genuinely smiled in this movie was at the very end, when a young female soldier made a remark about Superman being hot. Can you imagine how dry this film is sucked from everything fun when the only laugh it gets comes from an unoriginal sex joke?

A major factor in this exhausting film experience that is Man Of Steel is one trick p(h)ony Hans Zimmer, who is so subtle in his approach that he hammers away huge minor harmonies every 3 minutes, to signify this is most epic thing we have seen since, well, since three minutes ago. His music not only severely lacks understanding for the subject, it also lacks the ability to feel, embrace or enhance cinematic pace, or indeed on screen action, and fails to infuse the movie with anything except horribly overbearing melodrama, stone old synth sounds and repeating drum loops around every corner. While this is certainly true of many of Zimmer's scores, I feel with Man Of Steel, he has reached the absolute peak. In my wildest nightmares I didn't imagine Superman flying to hammy ""High Noon at Daisy Town"" guitar figures and fake sounding drum loops. If you look at scenes like Kal-El's capsule flying to earth or his first appearance in his suit, and imagine Williams' music, you should break out in tears.
The score wanders through Zimmer's opus like a ""Best of 2000s"" album: from DaVinci Code over Dark Knight all the way to ""Mermaids"" from Pirates 4, all quoted near verbatim.
This is lazily conceived, badly spotted, worse orchestrated, mind-numbingly mixed wallpaper that also happens to be laughably simplistic in composition and absolutely interchangable in style. I won't even begin to discuss the lack of anything remotely resembling heroism, which is inherent in the Superman character, no matter how hard Snyder and Nolan try to remove it.
Man Of Steel has some of the worst mismatches between picture and music I have ever seen. And you don't have to compare it to John Williams to realise this.

Man of Steel, all together, is creepily reminiscent of Matrix Revolutions. A saviour is forced to accept his role and deal with his powers in a different world, a lot of pseudo-deep stuff is thrown in seemingly randomly and doesn't come together in the end, there are silly, gigantic robots fighting in overlong sequences, the female protagonist tries to destroy the hero's doubts and drives him forward, and at the end, the two main antagonists have a cartoony fight between rooftops - two gods pitched against each other. You even have Laurence Fishburn in a wise-cracking role and Harry Lennix in the exact same role as the iron balls, asshole commander. To be fair though, Matrix Revolutions had good music.
The acting is thoroughly competent, even though it is terribly sad to watch so much talent being wasted in such a mundane movie. It is especially bad for Henry Cavill, who makes for a great Superman, or would make for a great one were he not asked to constantly act like he forgot to take his anti-depression medication, and forced to wear a dull costume better suited for Bizarro than Superman.

The biggest sin of all however is that Christopher Nolan and Zack Snyder failed to make Man Of Steel unique and recognisable. It is a copy of The Dark Knight and Spider-Man at the best, and just another noisy sci-fi flick at the worst of times. I want to watch this film again as much as I want to hear the soundtrack album for a second time.
As much as I love Superman, this movie barely makes it to the 2 out of 5 stars mark.",1372032000,34,11298,4.781362007168458
5783926,4,B00D91GRA4,"""Man of Steel"" is a story about more than just good guys and bad guys, like most superhero films. In fact, it's very different from Superman stories of the past. Yes, Superman is still trying to save Earth, but ""Man of Steel"" also tells the story behind the hero. This addition of a more personal storyline adds a more human touch to the superhero we have come to know and love through the years. ""Man of Steel"" is rated PG-13 for intense and violent scenes.

KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Gerry O., age 11, says, ""the events, the story line and amazing effects will blow your mind"" and Anthony A., 10-year-old KIDS FIRST! Film Critic also likes the special effects saying that Superman, ""has cool powers such as superhuman strength, x-ray vision, ability to shoot lasers from his eyes and of course, he can fly!"" You won't want to miss this new film after reading and watching Gerry's review below.

""If you have seen the Superman films and read the comics, you will hear about this film and think to yourself - another Superman movie?! My moms are big fans of Superman so I was positive I knew what to expect. Well, I was in for a huge surprise.

This movie is not at all like other movies about famous superheroes. It starts by showing where Superman is born on another planet and what happens to his home. It touches your heart to see what sacrifice his real parents go through in order to save his life.

The movie shows Superman's life from a little kid to a grown man; how he has to adjust to Earth's atmosphere and learn to control his powers. Other kids think he is weird and pick on him, but his earth parents teach him to be patient and not to attract too much attention so he can grow up and fulfill his destiny. You probably would like to know what his destiny is, but you have to watch the movie to find out. The events, the storyline and amazing effects will blow your mind, especially if you get chance to see it in 3D.

I like this film for number of reasons. The graphics and storyline are very engaging. I also think they couldn't have done a better job with the cast. The funny and courageous reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams), proud warrior and real father of our famous superhero Jor-El (Russell Crowe), Clark's earth father (Kevin Costner) and a new face on the Hollywood horizon, Henry Cavill, who plays Superman.

My favorite scene is when Clark surrenders to FBI so he can save the Earth and while he is there, FBI agents observe him through a one-way mirror window. Superman has super powers so he can see through the glass. He starts making funny comments and shocks the FBI agents with his skills. But best of all is the reaction of the agents on the other side of the glass. You can see that they struggle to believe that this is real and they are also amazed and fascinated by Superman.

I recommend this great movie to ages 10 and up. It has elements of violence and a bit of harsh language. The graphic depiction may be too intense for a younger audience. I love the film and would definitely enjoy watching it again, though it does get a little predictable in the last 15-20 minutes.""

5783927,4,B00D91GRA4,"First off when dealing with such an iconic character a director has no chance at making everyone happy...stay too true to the source material (especially when it's been done before) and the director has simply made another unnecessary reboot; stray too far from the material or change things radically and the director is a hack, a savage who doesn't understand the character or what he's doing.  In many ways Snyder, with hopes riding so high, was a damned man the moment he sat in the director's seat.  Some fans will drool and many more will say, ""Not cool.""

My wife and I, people who enjoy action/ fantasy movies (and superhero movies in particular), were somewhere in the middle.  The trailer for this feature film got us excited and the movie delivered overall, it was enjoyable and had action spread throughout (mind you not all of the action was the beat-'em-up type).  We would easily recommend it for a variety of reasons.

Perhaps first and foremost, for me at least, is that this movie portrays ideas that the characters live out; in many ways it's about metaphysics and philosophy, beliefs and attachments that come to define a person.  The movie doesn't shy away from embracing this either.  Superman the icon in this film is an embodiment of a man's ability to choose who he will be and how he will define himself over and above a deterministic, naturalistic path of evolution; he is the man who is able to value integrity, goodness, and be a respector of life as inherently valuable (something we are fast losing in our culture--and something that causes him emotional anguish when he is forced to take life to save life); he is the man who can rise above it all, take a leap of faith, because he can see and has been taught that there is a spark of divinity in all of us.  It comes as no surprise that Superman is regarded as savior and in one scene he is in a church talking to a priest with two stained-glass windows behind him, one depicting Jesus Christ sacrificing himself and another showing Jesus as the good shepherd caring for his sheep; and in another scene he adopts the iconic arms outstretched pose of the cricified savior of mankind.  All of this is very deliberate and so is the drawing links of these beliefs to what has been considered distinctly American ideology in past decades.  Supes also wrestles with his interpersonal connections; he is a man of two worlds, but he is encouraged to embrace the best wisdom of both.  He receives and values guidance both from his heavenly...er, Kryptonian father as well as his earthly father.  He yearns for connection, and he's given the chance to be connected to the human race but is also given the opportunity to reconnect and align himself with his Kryptonian heritage; but he has to make a bitter choice (the film doesn't really dwell on this though) as to whom he will ultimately align with and he makes his decision based on belief, on ideology...some might even say on love (but not of an erotic or romantic sort).

This film invites discussion and even reflection.  It's more than standard superhero fare for those who have ears to hear.  But many people will miss this and they will see it more than hear it.  The film isn't a visual powerhouse though it is visually stimulating.  It actually goes more for an emotional tone visually; one of nostalgic memory, lingering and longing and at other times resolution, strength, and power.  The tone is about what has happened before and how that is affecting Superman's ""now"".  Visually the film is slightly and intentionally grainy, or filtered to increase shadow.  One thing that I didn't like about the film is that it could have used a lot more steadicam.  Sometimes I want to see my money shots crisply and clearly, not as if I'm standing near ground zero with my vision having to adjust to all of the shaking movement.  The fight scenes aren't really anything sci-fi and fantasy fans haven't seen before and, this is important, the real reason that they work is because they are usually given the emotional weight of Supes caring about the outcomes of the fight, and the participants of the fight.  But there are some things that we thought didn't work that well.

Amy Adams as Lois Lane.  No.  Nothing against her, she's a fine actress, but Lane simply needs to be a strong-willed, raven-haired woman with not just feisty determination as portrayed by Adams but someone with more grit and sass.  And there was virtually no chemistry between her and Cavill!  Personally I also had problems with Michael Shannon.  There was something about him that just, for me at least, didn't seem to be able to carry or convey the weight of this brutal and determined Kryptonian.  Shannon seemed like he was trying to play General Zod in an imperialist fashion but it just didn't quite convincingly carry.  Many of the other secondary characters were also a bit flat.

Countering this, though, is Henry Cavill.  Great, great job.  Great bit of casting.  He nailed it.  We didn't get to see him as the Clark Kent of the Daily Planet (except for a snippet) so we didn't get to see him trying on a nebbishy affect; I don't know how he'll do with that and we shall see in the sequel.  But as the young man finding his way, as the young man quietly taking in the sun's rays and recalling his fathers' talks, as Superman in tights and cape, he nailed it.  He possessed a strong, assured, and determined presence that still managed to exude concern and humility.  Did I say great job, Henry Cavill?  Yes?  Well, I mean it.  Major reason to see the movie.

Russell Crowe as Jor-El, Kal-El's Kryptonian father, also gave an understated but clear performance that felt like it was spot on.

But in summing up (watch out for that Lex-Corp truck Superman!) director Zak Snyder gives audiences a Superman origin story that is fleshed out with a sense of history, introduces a variety of important characters within the Superman mythology, and (most importantly) presents us with a Superman we can and will care about in a story that slowly builds its excitement but develops plenty of heart and throws at us some important thoughts.

Oh, and isn't it refreshing that we don't have any Lex Luthor or kryptonite to throw at Superman in this film?  Thank heavens.

5783928,1,B00D91GRA4,"What a strange time for Hollywood of late, wherein history is turned into comic book and comic book is turned into history: thus we have Lincoln as a vampire hunter and the new Superman as leaden and lugubrious as so much history is made out to be.  Superman was born, not on Krypton, but in the pages of a comic book - yet this new take has naught of comic book charm, color, character or charisma.  One four minute Fleischer cartoon from the forties has more excitement and enchantment than this entire two and a half hour cinematic computer game.  Any one of those seventeen animated masterpieces is more artistic, better scripted, better scored, better acted and better directed than the whole of this CGI dominated disaster.

This movie is like a baked potato overloaded with cheese, bacon bits, chives, more cheese, onions, some more bacon bits, loads of sour cream, a bit more bacon bits, another glob of sour cream....so overloaded in fact that the taste of the baked potato is completely lost!  All that is left of the meal is...overload! Which is to say that special effects submerge whatever story there is herein.  And that is a pity, because Henry Cavill is a super-looking Superman.  But he says next to nothing.  His dialogue could fit on one page.  General Zod and Jor-El seem to never zip it.  Yet the Man of Steel, well, I guess he is the literal strong and silent type.  But...it is a silence that squanders. And so much is squandered here and totally enslaved by...special effects.  How many explosions can one watch?  How many toppling buildings must one endure?  How many totally unbelievable alien landscapes must one navigate?  How many Superhero fisticuffs that seem more like WrestleManias on super-steroids can one watch?  How many cars and buses and planes spinning out of control and crashing all over Creation must there be?  When does the audience ever say 'Enough'?  When will the film-makers ever use some directorial discretion and say 'Cut'?  When will stories matter more again than special effects???

But this is no longer a matter of taste.  Not really.  It is a matter of unasked for addiction.  A twig grows the way it is bent.  Recent generations have known little else.  For one, speed is essential in this technologically dominated time leading to rapidity of movement and thought and deed. No seeming time to smell the roses anymore. And it seems the daily diet of our days anymore is...disaster. All disasters, man-made and acts of God, are in our backyards anymore thanks to our technological tools. Last but nowhere near least are the unimaginable horrors of the forever caught-on-film, cinematic-seeming exploding, collapsing Twin Towers and the nightmares of future ones that have impacted EVERYTHING: mind, mortality, morality...and movies.  Our movies, our entertainments are now packed with even worse visions of total immolation seemingly to subconsciously prepare our precarious world for tomorrow's cataclysms - and also to act as a catharsis to what has already been lived and witnessed and forever seared into our collective conscious, the sub as well.  In the movies, no matter how many skyscrapers collapse and bombs go off, there will be the hero to set things right.  ""It was like a movie"" say so many when interviewed after whatever disaster has been witnessed.  So it would seem then that many (if not most) movies are not simply about entertainment any longer - but moreso on an unspecified, unstated mission to inoculate us all against the coming Armageddon, the next Holocaust.  Yet movies of the sort I am speaking of do not simply assist viewers in dealing with the chaos and calamity of Life.  Addiction leads, alas, too often to actualization. 3-D is an attempt to actualize - but it falls short.  Almost being able to reach out and touch the 3-D CGI bomb is close...but no cigar.  And that is but one of the dangers inherent in a majority of the action-addictive movies of today.

We are all addictive personalities in a world that passes away faster and faster, that is much more disposable anymore than enduring. Perhaps the only way to end an addiction is to introduce a new one. Our humanity is truly being lost to the technologic. So a movie such as MAN OF STEEL could and should have used much more story, more character development, more humanity, more humor, more fun, more delight, more awe and, yes, more love - and way less CGI action by far!  Alas, as it is, it merely feeds the addiction for mind-numbing, sense-deadening, emotionless, brainless action.  Action at all costs. ALL costs. So despite its having ten minutes of value, this is not a movie.  It is madness.",1371945600,34,4652,4.850443599493029
5783929,5,B00D91GRA4,"I saw this movie in the theater in 3D and thought it was the best Superman movie out of all the others.  It starts at the beginning, with SuperBaby being born on the planet Krypton to the mother and father Jorell(Russell Crowe).  (Please forgive name mispellings) The core of Krypton is collapsing.  War has broken out as General Zod fights for control.  He kills one of the high muckity mucks and attempts to take Jorell.  Just in the nick of time, Mom and Dad catapult SuperBaby to Planet Earth, so that he may live, along with a metal object for his later use.  Back on Krypton, General Zod and his henchpersons are banished to the Phantom Zone but swears he will find the son of Jorell one day and take revenge.  (You know all this anyway from the former versions of Superman.)

We fast-forward about 30 years where we meet a grown up Superguy Clark Kent (Henry Cavill, who also played in the Immortals).  Superguy is working on a ship.  We flip back and forth for awhile to Clark at different ages and learn about how he got to Earth, how he was found by his Earth Mom and Dad Kevin Costner.  We also look at how Clark grew up and the wisdom his dad taught him.  Now Clark is about age 30 and he moves around a lot, to keep from being identified for his unique skills.

In Antartica, he meets reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams from the Disney musical Enchanted), and Lois realizes there is something real special about Super Dude.  As with any nosey reporter, and against the wishes of her editor (Lawrence Fishburn), she begins to snoop.  Meanwhile General Zod is out and about and looking for Cal-El (aka Superman) to get the Codex and bring it back to what's left of the people of Krypton.

This is a high-action movie.  Once the action starts, it will blow you away.  The CGI is awesome and so much gets blown and blasted and smashed.  The CGI people did one fantastic job.  BTW - Christopher Meloni (Law and Order SVU) is also in the film and my son recognized lots of other folks that I didn't remember, other than they looked familiar.

This was a great movie to see on the big screen and I think you will probably want to own it when it comes out too.  The 3D was great too.",1371945600,10,2183,4.338271604938272

I truly couldn't be happier with this. What's  really great here is that this movie is unlike any Superman flick we've seen before with it's smartly grounded & modern approach that's a clear influence from Nolan & Goyer's successful Batman Trilogy yet their both very different movies. That said, Henry Cavill IS Superman & Amy Adams' Lois Lane is wonderfully re-imagined. Like Clarke's computer program father, this Lois Lane is more like an anchor for Superman throughout the movie as he battles Zod & his cold blooded militant minions who are also excellent in their H.R. Giger armor. In the opening scene, Krypton is wonderfully brought to life as it resembles some sort of primordial dark age meets Flash Gordon, & this was personally one of the real highlights of this movie. The action & awesome battles scenes are dazzling with special effects that are awesome to behold, & a real treat for fans. Zack Snyder's ""Man of Steel"" sets out to modernize Superman for a new movie going generation & the legions of comic book fans the world over. Personally, they've done just that. Maybe some purists will hate it but I would think most comic book fans would be most pleased with this latest take. This movie deserves all it's current success.",1371945600,5,1458,4.855421686746988
5783931,3,B00D91GRA4,"At this point in its seventy five years of existence, ""Superman"" has really become more of a concept than a character. As one of the progenitors of the superhero comic book genre, and a automatic staple for religious allegory and minorities, the character known as Superman is a recipe for success when done right. It's just too bad that most really can't seem to perfect the ""done right"" part.

I went into ""Man of Steel"" with no expectations outside of a good movie. At this point of my life, ""Superman"" as licensed product either delivers or he doesn't. The discussions you can have with diehard fans usually ends up being the most interesting part of ""Superman"" itself (sometimes). The worst I could say about Bryan Singer's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-Returns/dp/B000J10ERO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman Returns</a>&nbsp;(2006)"" is that it was as offensively boring as Tarsem Singh's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Immortals/dp/B007H7XJD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Immortals</a>&nbsp;(2011)"". Unlike the latter (which is as shallow as it gets), it was full of good intentions, but nothing remotely decent to support those intentions. (If you were fan of the Super-stalker and scorned women Lois, then ""Superman Returns"" was probably the movie for you.) Zack Snyder's biggest challenge was simply making an engaging film. Something he is not incapable of. However, his biggest Achilles heel in this regard was the same weakness that director's Stephen Norrington, Guillermo del Toro and Christopher Nolan had to deal with. David S. Goyer and his own affinity for visual, but not detail.

THE SET UP:

""Man of Steel"" aims to be what ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smallville/dp/B004XWLN20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smallville</a>"" was in the bumpy span of ten years. The story of Clark ""Kal-El"" Kent; the son of two worlds, searching for purpose and stability in a world that he actively hides himself from because of his literal status as an [humanoid] alien from another planet. From his birth, through his adolescence to his adulthood, Clark Kent goes through the motions of heartache, wondering if he'll ever be accepted for what he is, should he decide to show him. If he'll ever know his parentage. That is, until a tip leads him to 20,000 year old ship that connects him to the world he never knew ...And leads a group of exiled Kryptonians to Earth. Their sole purpose is to recreate the planet they lost as a result of their species' hubris, even if that means it's at the expense of the present occupants of Earth.

WHAT THEY GOT RIGHT:

CONCEPT:
Krypton has experienced as much iteration as the character of Superman himself has; but somewhere down the line, the affinity and mythos that Richard Donner injected into the license really brought iteration to a stagnate halt. Here, there was clearly an effort made to inject a different kind of culture and lifestyle into Krypton, even under the stipulation that it still had to be blown to smithereens. And it's not that the previous incarnations of ""Superman"" and Krypton never had a culture or a way of life, no. It's that the biggest thing about Krypton was how Superman left the planet to come to ours.

Here, the film gives you a proactive glimpse into said culture, either through expository dialog, a billion things racing at the screen, or the implication that Krypton is so sterile and self-controlled that they breed children for a specific duty and that duty alone. Everything on the planet is coded, cataloged and processed, much like every industry that provides its services to the public here on Earth. Their clothing, however ""World of Warcraft"" and ""generic sci-fi concept art""-ish much of it comes off, intrigues you at the very least with the idea of how their lives operated on the dying planet. There is a concrete reason for the existence of the ""S"" and oddly shaped symbols on the shields on their chests. It's an extension of their language and the clique mentality of the planet itself.

The concept of Clark Kent becoming some nomad because he either draws too much attention to himself or is proactively searching for whatever that makes him who he is, outside the influence of humankind, is also an interesting idea. I like the idea of Clark not immediately knowing what the heck to do with himself as an adult; either being too enamored in his quarter-life-crisis waywardness that any job is never too lowly for him take, or he's really scared of interacting with people in general. It also implies that the people he meets, all of them of varying walks of life and personalities, would at the very least inspire him to become a superhero, if that's his intention to begin with.

Carrying over ""Smallville"" Lois Lane's ability to connect the dots herself between Clark Kent and whatever guise of heroism he happens to take the mantle of was also a great idea. I've heard it argued that Lois deducing his identity ruins the ""love triangle"" between herself, Superman and Clark (basically Clark) and diminishes their relationship, but I don't see it that way. I'd argue the mere suggestion of throwing them into a romantic relationship, without pretense of setting up a foundation of friendship it can grow from, is the bigger crime as far as their relationship goes. It like, Superman as a character, is integral to what makes the franchise what it is. To move directly into romance because it's expected of Lois/Clark, is not only insulting, but an affront to both characters and anyone who appreciates their rapport.

Villains with marginally sympathetic motives that drive them is another concept I enjoyed. Zod, Jor-El, Faora and the Kryptonians whom survived the destruction of Krypton, all of them are motivated to restore the lives of their lost civilization and that is something anyone can sympathize or relate to --- even if that was never the intention of the writer or director. You connect with Zod's mission: A man who is bred for war decides to do something about the degenerating state of his society because of the complete apathy of his culture. You sympathize with what he wants to do, even if you disagree with his methods. It's just a shame he's made out to be a complete idiot because he's never aware of the planet's destruction. It's all in the name of painting him as the antagonist against Jor-El who's content with dying but wants to save what's caused the problem for his culture altogether.

ACTION:
Hands down, ""Man of Steel"" contains the best Superman fight scenes and choreography in a live action ""Superman"" adaptation, period. Outside of the composition for the score, this is where the movie both excels and stumbles. The sense of speed and strength that's translated to the screen through the actions of the Kryptonians speaks in volumes and is delivered to the viewing audience perfectly in the second half of the film (Smallville brawl). The first half's action is almost incomprehensible with how much camera blur is used. Elsewhere, the film at least steady enough to focus on a particular event. Faora's and her giant Non-type friend, Nam-Ek, fight scenes with Superman are arguably the best the film had to offer. Zod and Superman's battle near the end of the while, while great for merely showing off Zod's prowess in battle, really can't be appreciated because of the fatigue from almost endless battle sequences that run on for nearly the length of a ""Smallville"" episode.

PERFORMANCE:
Performances range from great to stilted. In the end, it really depends on the amount of time given to an actor and how they deal with the material in the given time. Laurence Fishburne's performance as Perry White is probably the only performance from the minor human characters I enjoyed outside of Christopher Meloni as Colonel Hardy. He was barely on the screen, but Fishburne never fails to deliver an otherwise great performance. He embodies the hardnosed Perry White without ever breaking a sweat, and Meloni? Dude continued to surprise me with the little things he did as the skeptic Hardy who finds antagonistic kinship with Faora.

CHARACTER:
Starting off with the best character: Faora is ultimately the brightest and strongest elements of ""Man of Steel"" by the virtue of her actress, Antje Traue (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pandorum/dp/B0038P80CO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pandorum</a>""). How she handles what little is given to her speaks to her talent. The mere fact that this character is allowed to be as vicious and as powerful as her commander, Zod, without the sexist stigmatization that follows her gender is amazing. Faora is defined by what she does in the name of her planet and the role she was given in that society. She lives for war, she is a warrior and the film never judges her for that. Instead they meet her head on with respect and as a result, you've got a standout character and a standout performance.

Similarly, Michael Shannon's Zod is probably my favorite take on the character. For the all the Aryan nation and Eugenic driven ideals that this character is motivated by, for all the crap he ends up handicapped by as a result of shoddy storytelling, Shannon chews the scenery in a way that is both self-aware and dedicated to the essence of the character. Zod is literally driven mad and to the extremes because of what his society programmed him to do and to watch him attempt to justify his genocidal ideas under the helm of Shannon's performance is incredible.

Henry Cavil, like Brandon Routh, is severely limited by what he is allowed to do with the character of Superman/Clark Kent. He has charisma, but he's never really allowed to use any of it. This is largely as a result of the screenwriter never having a firm concept of what he wanted Clark Kent or Superman to be. Cavil and Goyer get the little tidbits that make Superman/Clark who he is (the need to save people because he has that power, the need to know where he's from; his determination), but when it comes to a solid characterization, the most that ever merges from both parties is ""brooding"" and ""aimless"". Also, glasses do not work with his face. At least, not the ones they chose.

Russell Crowe as Jor-El is another good performance in the movie, but it isn't until the character's dead that he appears to actually get a feel for Jor-El. This makes his death a pointless endeavor to begin with. This isn't to say he's bad in the first act, but he is by no means as entertaining as he was as a hologram designed solely for expository dialog about things you already know about. He has a particularly great chemistry with Michael Shannon. The two do more to sell that Zod and Jor-El are estranged friends than the dialog really does through their actions and that's pretty amazing, considering what they're given to work with.

MUSIC:
I'll be upfront, I think Zimmer's score is better than ""Man of Steel"" itself. It's certainly better than his ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Knight-Rises/dp/B008645YEE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Knight Rises</a>"" score (the only good thing about that was Catwoman's theme). Most the things that occurred in the film never felt like they earned the grandiose personality of the score, which felt out of place in a lot of scenes. Other times it didn't and that was usually in the action sequences that hinged on ""Zod's Theme"" (""Arcade"", ""You Die or I do"", ""Terraforming""). With the exception of ""What are you going to do when you're not saving the world?"" and ""Flight"" the score itself really doesn't work on its own until you're given some kind of context, which is a weakness for a lot of Zimmer's scores. That said, Zimmer created a solid theme for reboot Superman and its one I hope he's given the chance to expand upon.

WHAT THEY DIDN'T GET RIGHT:

PERFORMANCE:
Jenny Olsen is a character I would've liked to have seen more of. She's a genderbent Jimmy Olsen and that's fantastic (it certainly upped the number of female characters present onscreen), but Rebecca Buller never gets to do anything to warrant the necessity of her character's existence. She walks about in the background, states the obvious and unfortunately becomes a damsel in distress (obviously because Lois isn't fulfilling that role). The only time she's allowed shine as an actress is that one single scene between herself Fishburne that sells a particular moment of peril, but it never really resonates completely because you know they're not allowed to die in the narrative anyway. It feels unnecessary to cut back to Buller and Fishburne outside of reminding us that they're still in the movie, a movie where they haven't done much of anything. Harry Lennix is particularly underwhelming as a gruff General Swanwick, whose sole purpose in the film appears to merely give reaction shots, state the obvious in tense situations (""whatever they want, it's not good"") and frown at insubordinate soldiers under his command. He is really not given anything to work with, even as a character minimally ingrained in the action of the film.

I went into ""Man of Steel"" with no expectations for Lois Lane, but Amy Adams was pretty underwhelming to be honest: The most I could say is that she outdid Kate Bosworth, but that's not a difficult task at all. At the very least, the character was honored enough to be allowed to participate in the film's narrative itself (what little there was), but there's so much it does to put her into a position that never feels earned. Other than that, she was just ""there"". There were far too many instances in the movie where her presence never felt necessary but she ended up in key moments (via teleportation or some other contrivance) because she was Lois and this is a ""Superman"" movie. She didn't have much to contribute to plot beyond a brief exposition that would've had her running from buildings like Perry and Jenny. If they really wanted Lois to be in the middle of the action, Goyer should've fell back on her history as military brat/daughter with connections to the military via her father, General Sam Lane (which means they should've used him). At the very least that would've facilitated a plausible excuse for her being in places where civilians are actively excluded.

More to the point, her chemistry with Cavil as Superman never quite took off. As associates or friends, this carnation of Superman and Lois works, because that's all there is between them. Friendship based on gratitude for keeping his secret, saving her life and, well, a shared goal (save Earth). And I was seriously digging this because I thought they were going to handle this like ""Smallville"" did. Friendship first, romance way, way later. But the moment they even tried to inject the romantic angle into their dynamic it was like watching Brandon Routh and Kate Bosworth all over again. It was just awkward as heck and never earned by the film itself. You could really see it in the actor's faces when they had to execute the kissing scene (they were not into it). Superman and Lois in ""Man of Steel"" make great Bros, but love interests? That is a galactic ""How about No"".

David Goyer --- as per his usual methods --- has no real conceptual or concrete understanding of the characters he's dealing with. Really, I don't think Synder's direction helped all that much either, but he does not have the same impact on the character of Lois like Goyer does. This guy is a poor screenwriter who happens to understand the basic idea of a great concept for a movie, but cannot for the life of him execute it. I mean, he is just mediocre and continues to produce mediocre screenplays. I'm sorry Adams had to work with what was a bland interpretation of an otherwise passionate character. I'd hope she'll end up with better material, but seeing as I doubt they'll be rid of Goyer, I expect nothing more except a blander Goyer Lane.

Diane Lane and Kevin Costner are really miscast as Jonathan and Martha Kent. Disregarding the ten years Annette O'Toole and John Schneider had as Clark's adoptive parents in ""Smallville"", Lane and Costner were not only limited in what they could do with the characters, they never truly felt as though they embodied them either despite their efforts. Lane as Martha is pedestrian. There's nothing remarkable about her performance, the film treats her like Rosemary Harris in ""Spider-Man 3"". It ignores her contributions to the film outside of a few moments and continues to hold the father figure up as the crux of importance despite her survival over the latter. She's not horrible (heck she's got a nice chemistry with Cavil), but I don't think she was great either. Costner phones in a performance that is perhaps crippled by more ""trailer quotes"" than even Russell Crowe was as Jor-El. I understand the intention was to merely depict Jonathan as concerned for his son's safety in the face of mankind's xenophobia, but the manner in which this concern is delivered is awful. His dialog is full of mixed signals. He insulates that he wants Clark to wait until the right time to reveal himself (meaning waiting until CLARK feels the time is right), but is actively against any decisions Clark makes for himself in regards to his own fate and that is by no means an intentional result of the narrative. It comes off both confusing and overly paranoid as opposed to a protective father who wants the best for his son. And worse, in a desperate need to differentiate itself from other Supermen origin tales, Jonathan is killed off in a manner that harkens back to Snyder's directorial debut, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dawn-of-the-Dead/dp/B002NWOI0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dawn of the Dead</a>&nbsp;(2004)"".

It's literally a ""Went to save my dog. If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, everyone drop everything and come save me*"" moment. Except no one goes save him because it's supposed to be a heartbreaking and dramatic moment. The entire scenario is a plot contrivance that you could literally counter with a thousand different scenarios and come out with a better result. The moment comes off like a scene from a parody and I had to stop myself from laughing at the scene in the theater because it was so earnest in its intentions. The setup and execution was atrocious. To say the least, nothing was lost when Costner was removed from the film and I'm beginning to think it would've been less flawed if he wasn't in it to begin with.

EXECUTION: NARRATIVE and PACING:
The pacing and editing in ""Man of Steel"" is truly awful. For all the ideas that ""Man of Steel"" has, where it fails is the execution of these ideas. ""Man of Steel"" wants to be a film about moral quandaries, xenophobia, and acceptance of the different alongside a coming of age story. Instead what we get is a near-three hour film that feels more like a coming attractions reel for a movie that never came to fruition. Most of the important things, like how mankind reacts to Clark during his outing and afterward (like when half the city is nuked on ""Dragon Ball Z"" and ""Gundam"" proportions that makes both look tame), are glossed over in a painful show of a lack of attention to the world around the characters.

Despite strengths lie within the visual and not so much the technical, Zack Snyder has proven he can and is able to focus on the finer details of characters in a film, particularly when the film has not been written by him. ""Man of Steel"", however, is just another instance when his collaboration with weaker elements and too many hands in the pot. This has him falling back on his visual eye. The film focuses more on the visual instead of the technical (what is happening instead of how it its happening) and as a result none of the characters really feel all that important verses the environment that surrounds them.

The biggest problem with ""Man of Steel"" is that it's a three part story squashed into a two hour and a half film. And this is where I think, as a franchise, ""Superman"" has always fared better as a written and televised format. Bruce Timm, progenitor of the DC Animated Universe, proved that a ""Superman"" origin story can be told and be told well with ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-The-Animated-Series/dp/B0002ZMHX6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman: The Animated Series</a>"". The problem is that it has to be treated as separate from Clark Kent's life, because the biggest part of Superman's origin has little to do with him. It's about his parents and what they do that allows him to become the protagonist of what is essentially his story. ""Smallville"" sacrificed showing Krypton altogether and instead peppered its series with bits of Krypton the older Clark got and it was usually how it related to Clark and not the other way around.

""Superman: The Movie"" managed to allow its audience to get a feel for Krypton and how it related to Clark's story in probably less time than ""Man of Steel"". All three previous ""Superman""-related media got across the necessity of Krypton in a manner that worked for its format and Clark Kent. The problem with the opening for ""Man of Steel"" is that it's wants to be more than about getting Superman to earth and while that is not bad it muddles the point of the film. The difference in Jor-El and Zod is appreciated, but the film strays from its objective: Superman's origin story, which is less about Krypton and more about getting him off Krypton.

Here, it's more about Krypton, and Jor-El's relationship with Zod, their differing opinions on the same thing (Krypton is doomed; Krypton needs better leadership and less of what they've built their society as). It's twenty minutes of far too many things going on at too quick a pace. You're introduced to several characters at once, a conflict that you really don't have a great grip on or allowed to understand and the end of the world all at once. Why are these people at war? What led Zod to think his leadership would be better than the present leadership (besides hubris)? Goyer and co. really wanted to make an epic film about Krypton and for all intents and purposes, maybe that's what they should've done.

But if they were really adamant about getting this into a film about Clark Kent and not Jor-El and Zod, then the entire Krypton sequence should have been moved to the second act of the film where Clark discovers the ship. Start the movie either with Young Clark Kent or Clark Kent on the fisherman's boat for ""The Deadliest Catch"". Get into his turmoil first. That way, the holographic version of his father isn't telling US, the AUDIENCE, everything we already know about in a show of really poor screenplay structure through expository dialog. As interesting as the CONCEPTS of Krypton was, the entirety of the events themselves don't resonate with me, no matter how much is TOLD to me as opposed to SHOWN through the actions of the characters about to bite it. And this continues to happen over and over in the movie. We and the characters are told a lot of things, but we're never shown them. Clark even tells how Zod to use his powers on Earth (""Focus on one thing"") just to justify the ending.

Clark's childhood and young adulthood is sacrificed in the name of choppy ""in medias res"" editing. I'm not against non-linear storytelling, but they don't do it well at all here. The editing is just really, really sloppy. Christopher Nolan managed to make it work in a film like ""Batman Begins"". He knows how to pace a film and show us what was necessary to Bruce Wayne's character arc after his parent's death. Snyder and Goyer? Everything that happens to Clark in his youth feels like ""A series of unfortunate events"" that are meant to tease something greater but never come to full fruition. These are the moments where we're supposed to be getting to know Clark Kent as a character, why he is the way he is. But on top of some poorly set up plot points that are meant to be stirring and dramatic (Jonathan's death and the Oil Rig sequence), everything that occurs before the third act has nothing to predicate them.

The pilot for ""Smallville"" shows us why Lex Luthor crashed his car and ran Clark over (it even sets up a great relationship). ""Man of Steel"" is perfectly content with the bus' wheel exploding for no reason and the bus going over the edge with nothing to show us why. ""Smallville"" shows us why Clark's powers are manifesting and how he learns to control them. ""Man of Steel"" is content to show us one really great instance of the how, but never the why and never how he learns to adjust after the first try. And this really makes the flying sequence come off as incredibly flat and without the sense of awe it should've had. If he isn't used to flying, how does he even know he can do it well? I'm not asking for three hours of a young Clark Kent story, but I am asking for some kind of attention to detail, some sign they cared about young Clark Kent as something other than a plot device to get them to adult Clark Kent.

There is very little care taken into Clark Kent as a character, almost none, because they're more interested in getting him into the suit than they are developing him as a character. Show us how he interacts with the people before he ends up saving them. Show us why'd he chose the jobs he did. Does he even want to become a ""superhero"", is that even his reasons for searching for his origins? Why he is totally okay with revealing his identity to almost everyone he meets (defeating the purpose of ""Glasses"") and why is Lois calling him ""Clark"" in front of everyone instead of ""Superman""? Basically, it's another case of the writer dismissing Clark Kent as a valid character in his own right over his ""alter ego"" Superman, instead of treating them like one and the same.

The antagonism between Clark and Zod's men is poorly set up. The crux of the story lives and dies on Zod's need to recreate Krypton on Earth and the Codex thingy and without compromise. There's an opportunity wherein Clark and Zod could've had a dialog with each other, maybe not have Zod come off as completely hostile from the word go. Plant some doubt in Clark who has nothing but the word of a hologram to go off of. It's basically one of the most avoidable conflicts in the world, either by Jor-El never telling Zod where he sent his son or sending the Codex in something else besides his son's blood (which literally made me laugh when that was revealed). But because it's ""Earth"" and this is ""Superman"", the narrative has Zod attack the planet without thought or consideration of other or adjacent planets.

There's not even a moment where Superman attempts to dissuade Zod from Earth to someplace else (like Mars), no real argument whatsoever. The moment he finds out this is what Zod wants to do (in a dream interrogation because reasons and skulls), he's full on antagonistic. I also don't know why a general, a guy who looks for the best possible solutions through tactics and or strength alone, is against the idea of taking over a planet where he is literally stronger than his worst enemies. The reasoning provided is flimsy and at best something a petty child could come up with and Zod is anything but. Worst of all, excluding Nam-Ek, Jax-Ur and Faora, most of Zod's men aren't even used. Here we have a literal army of Supermen and none of them are used to their fullest abilities in a manner that would've benefited the film. Instead they all hang out in their ship and don't do anything. Superman's basic compassion for mankind is rather null and void. For all ""Red Rookie""-isms in this film, the basic concept of leading your enemy away from populated areas is a given for anyone who's even privy to the definition of collateral damage or risk management.

""Man of Steel"" instead leads the combat straight into the heart of Smallville and Metropolis without ever showing Clark considering that maybe he should move his rear end elsewhere, instead of telling the populace to run into buildings that are about to be demolished by his very being. The massive levels of destruction really fly into the face what Superman is actually fighting to accomplish (as little death as possible) and is, in the end, all for a large special effects extravaganza that will either excite or bore you to death. There are more dead people from the combined efforts of Zod and Superman than there are people saved. It's probably one of the things that make the ending so horrendously awkward because there should be attention to detail. Superman should be held accountable for everything that happened and there should've been some sign that the destruction would hold repercussions. Instead we get an ending like Superman ended a hostage situation, the city presumably back to normal again.

The religious parallels that extend beyond positioning Henry Cavil before a painted glass window of Jesus praying to his father or flying backward out of a ship like he's been crucified for our sins, bother me more than anything. For all the ""goodness"" that supposedly exudes from Jor-El, he really comes off like a man with a bigger superiority complex than Zod. He assumes that mankind needs an Uberman like Clark Kent without ever assessing that the planet was probably better off without him (because, for all intents and purposes, he's reason they end up needing him anyway. Clark's a self-fulfilling prophecy).

He assumes Earth needs a guardian and continues to boost his son up as one, even in death. There's never an instance where Clark rejects the idea of the ""Godhood"" Jor-El preaches about, he just accepts it. That's troubling because it suggests that Clark believes, on some level, he is God-like and not someone who just wants to help. Whether or not that was Goyer's intent becomes irrelevant as I doubt he could properly address the issue anyway.

TO SUM IT ALL UP:
The problem with ""Man of Steel"" is that, despite all its good intentions, its acute lack of attention to detail and poor execution cuts its legs out from under it. If could I say anything about the movie it's that everyone who wasn't Clark Kent/Superman, Martha, Jonathan and Lois Lane made this movie half as enjoyable as it was when things weren't exploding and fists weren't being exchanged. Michael Shannon and Antje Traue really made the villains of this film. Superman, when it comes down to it, feels like a character that reacted to a series of events but was never truly affected by them. And that's not to say Cavil was bad --- he, like every other Superman so far, works what he's given and makes the best of a limited situation. That's about it.

Or maybe I just can't get over, how, for a movie that's almost three hours, they were in such a hurry to get Krypton, Clark's past and the reintroduction of his heritage out of the way so they could blow stuff up. And if I didn't know any better, they worked on the latter part of the film far more than they did the earliest parts of it. There were some great ideas in the movie and for what its worth, I really enjoyed it. But, its problems are just glaringly obvious and the ideas weren't executed well at all. [a 3 out of 5]

5783932,4,B00D91GRA4,"I'll make this short and get to only the important things, everything else is a waste of time to talk about. Remember just as many women saw this movie as men. The movies was 2 hours 23 minutes. The first hour was by far the best sci-fi, alien, extreme technology, krypton, superman piece of cinematography, and realism with compelling twist and turns (they thought of everything) I ever seen ever in any movie, at this point in the movie I turned to my wife and said, ""this is the best movie I've ever seen to this point"" and she said yeah me too"". Then 5 minutes later the fighting started between Clark and Zod, and his peeps. Oh, my God it wouldn't stop!! The fighting went on non-stop for an hour and 10 minutes, it was absolute torture and the women who went to see this movie for the romance, some light action and fantasizing about the super hero hunk, were likely vomiting in the aisles like my wife was after the first 40 minutes of non-stop blown gasket complete destruction of what appeared to be a city the size of new York, it was 911 30 times over and over, and over. After 40 minute you were sick and still had to endure 30 more minutes of extremely loud destruction. Why they couldn't have shown Clark passing a physics test so that at some point during this 70 minute fight someone couldn't have outsmarted the other and put this superfight and city destruction to rest. Anti-climactic and stupid, he snaps his neck, sorry just don't buy the retarded ending to ZOD. Wow, the stupidity. In their defense if there is one, which there is not, the storyline where Clark meets Zod and defeats him is always the more negative and less inspiring of all the storylines, with too much fighting where no one seems to win. Wow, I'm tired just thinking about this.

I may still buy the movie, not sure, but what I am sure about is I will fast forward through at least 40 minutes of fighting and destruction, so I'm not pissed off again watching a movie that previously had the best hour and 5 minutes of movie I have ever witnessed. Special effects in this movie are off the charts like no previous superman movie. Anyone who was not conscious of this hour plus of pointless destruction without anyone winning for 70 minutes and not being aware and fully aggravated by this continuous waste of time using computer special effects for all of it is an idiot. Those who loved the movie and didn't point this out are an idiot. It ruined a perfectly good movie that could have for the first time for a superman movie won a number of awards. The superman actor is by far the best actor for this character ever, who has the convincing thickness of a fully competing body builder with perfect proportions and chiseled facial construction like those superman faces in the comic books, who by the way don't look real because they are too perfect. They should make many superman films with him.
The Storylines, the cinematography, the special effects combined with the story were fully unimaginable, yet they did create them, many of them, fantastically so, and continually surprising you with the newest ideas for the story, that kept you entranced for the 1st hour . .  I want to buy the movie just to watch the 1st hour. My advice, hold you breath and you ears for at least 30 minutes of the hour plus fight or you'll leave pissed off like we did. 4 stars.",1371859200,3,3354,4.48772504091653
5783933,1,B00D91GRA4,"What a shame such a great story turned into something so boring, tedious and annoying! Unfortunately for the Man of Steel, every story has a beginning, middle and end. Something the average person learns when they are in kindergarten or First Grade! All three parts of a story need to be done well or else it's no fun! A great beginning does not make-up for a mediocre middle or a disastrous ending!

The Man of Steel starts with a fantastic back story. For the very first time we really get to observe Krypton in all it's technological glory! Only to see the story slowly degenerate into camp with cardboard characters from the military that you could find in any comic books story. And, then like a car with a stuck accelerator, the story rapidly turns into another brainless war porn and 9/11-type flick (Chicago gets trashed instead of New York.  When your story is so rotten you distract your audience by wrecking another major city! Wow! That was imaginative!)

Man Of Steel is also the ultimate product placement film. In fact, you could randomly choose a half-dozen movies that have been shown on the big screen this past year - and I'll bet you the Man of Steel has more product placement then all of them COMBINED! It was so obnoxious it was distracting! In the 45 years of watching movies I can only think of a handful of times that product placement has been this aggressive!! It's also symptomatic of an incredibly weak story!

The Man of Steel is so bad I was dying to walk out; but, I went to see the film with a friend so I felt obligated to stay. At least I had the sense to close my eyes and tune-out the last half hour of explosions, grunting and screaming in order to put my meditation skills to the test! I'm happy to report that even though I was totally sober I was able to completely tune-out the last 30 minutes of the Man of Steel and I could care less about what happened to any of the story's characters!

5783935,5,B00D91GRA4,"Good movie. It's not only about comic book heroes anymore. It's just like with Batman Begins. How would the real world deal to if aliens might finally be among us. Man of Steel is not about spandex heroes with superpowers any more. It's about humanity, power, responsibilty and how to deal with all of it. There is a lot to think and discuss about after watching this movie, and that's exactly what you do after you saw any good film that is not just a popcorn movie.

Now,  how are the filmmakers  going to up the ante for a sequel. Well, it is not about upping it anymore. To understand why, you must read this review from a clear perspective. This film, just like all of Nolan's previous ones, is not only about flashy visuals but more bout it's content and how we react to that content. That's why the Nolan - Snyder team up is the perfect marriage to present the new Man of Steel.

Clark Kent is what he is because of his alien heritage AND his parents rising. He's Clark Kent all along the movie. From beginning to end. We're introduced to both his kriptonian and terran parents. And we got fond to all of them. I love how the movie shows us Clark from the beginning, right after the Kripton sequences. I've always hated when movies begin with some kid played by an unknown actor and we're forced to assume and accept this kid as if he's our hero.

Because Clark is practically human by how he was raised, and also because he's the only one with this powers around for nearly thirty years, It's clear that although he's definitely willing to help and protect everybody, he just don't know how to properly react when Zod and the other kryptonians appears on Earth, threatening the whole planet.

Take for example, what happens when you get involved in a horrific car crash accident? it won't  matter what an excellent and conscious driver you truly are. If you're in the middle of it, you won't be able to do much to avoid it. I think is the same for Superman.

And because of this, we all get the long awaited punch to punch action. But it's not senseless anymore. Action-ReAction. As the action secuences progressed, we change from moviegoers to spectators. We're not only watching the cool action but we're beginning to notice all the devastation generated from the fight, and we begin to worry and care for all the casualties that are for instance very high. And then, we're not mere Superman fans anymore, but suddenly began to question the menace this and any alien threat could be. If you emphatize with what I just wrote, well, I guess the movie is spot on.

The next chapter will, without a doubt, not try to up the ante by a mile. The filmmakers have clearly planted the foundations to give us now a movie that will undoubtedly deal with why Superman is kind of dangerous. And this will be the trigger for the Man of Steel to reach his next level of wisdom.

Also, just picture this. Although all of Superman efforts, if this kind of threat ever shows again, it won't matter what Superman does. He can't handle it alone. This is the perfect background for the Justice League to enter the picture.

To end this review, let me add. I do like Man of Steel. At last we're presented to a Clark Kent that is what he is not only because of his heritage, but of his rising. And how he constantly keeps trying to honor that. And like any of us, will fail at some points. How we deal with this failings is how we really grow in the end.

ABOUT iMAX and 3D:

Although you can enjoy this film on standard cinemas, this movie is one of those few where iMAX screenings do add to the experience. What a difference! And to watch the final battle on 3D, Just wow!

everything said here is exactly what I think I how I feel about Man of Steel. I don't rant about Zod being killed at the end. and I don't think Superman killed him to save just a family of four. What he did was because is right there and there when Superman realizes how many people have been put at perile and how many more would be because Zod won't simply stop.

Henry Cavill was just as perfect a Superman as Christopher Reeves!  Prologue vignettes of Clark saving people before donning the suit were magnificent as well as his heroic self discipline not to abuse his powers akin to the newest (ie best) rendition of Amazing Spider-Man 2012.  However, the 20 minutes of wasted time during the fight scene to simply demonstrate special effects was a tedious waste of time akin to derailment that constituted Transformers 3 and Inception.  Hollywood still does not realize that action is fine if it fits the story as with Eagle Eye.  A believable Superman would have diverted Zod to the ocean or desert away from the urban populace to minimize risks to life and infrastructure assets.  We want a story, not crap action if action is pointless and noncontributory.

Also, America consists of whites, blacks, Asians, latinos...  Normal Americans embrace that all law abiding citizens are equal.  Akin to Brad Pitt's boss in World Wide Z being black, Avengers re-written to make Nick Fury black, President and 2nd in command in 2012 being black, making the general black and colonel white while simultaneously rewriting comic lore for 70+ years to make Perry White a black is insulting as Hollywood pushes their agenda without cause.  We are all equal and if Hollywood truly believed this then they would not pander to solicit approval.  All of the black actors were fantastic and incredibly skilled but I tire of the unsolicited Hollywood repetative agenda.

Finally, I encourage all viewers to embrace a one year boycott of all distracting advertising during movies that WE PAY TO VIEW as paying for advertising in the midst of our movies is insulting to the viewer and detracts from the continuity of enjoying the film.  IHOP was advertised no less than 3 times during the movie and Sears was distinctly advertised once with the camera fixated on the Sears logo. For one year from my 6/22/13 viewing I will refuse to enter IHOP or Sears such that companies realize that by submitting to maximizing Hollywood profits they will minimize their own profits by consensus public boycott.  We can teach Hollywood not to sacrifice the story line by intrusive inappropriate advertising.

In conclusion, Man of Steel, if one ignores the wasteful protracted action fight scene, contrived ""need"" to terraform Earth despite the infinite planets accessible via the movie's hyperspace drive (see: contrived conflict between Zod and Kal El simply to justify combat action protracted event), redundant and unnecessary racial messaging, and inappropriate money hungry advertising, was great!

If Director Snyder learns from his mistakes and keeps same actors for Clark and Lois with greater attention to the human component (the essence of science fiction) then I cannot wait for the sequel(s)!!!

Henry Cavill and Amy Adams were so truly fantastic, however, that I have to grant 4 stars despite Snyder's questionable skills.",1371859200,5,2955,5.125
5783937,4,B00D91GRA4,"""Man of Steel"" is an entertaining reboot of the Superman franchise. Like ""Batman Begins"", it focuses on the journey of the future superhero, investing in a serious way in the origins of Clark Kent, including the challenges of growing up different.

The movie begins with the birth of Kal-El, the future Superman, on the dying planet of Krypton. A deadly feud between his father Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and arch-enemy General Zod (Michael Shannon) leads to the launch of the infant Kal-El to earth. Clark Kent's difficult childhood is told grainy flashbacks as the conflicted adult Clark (Henry Cavill) wanders from job to job, performing guardian angel good deeds while seeking answers about his identity. The discovery of an ancient spacecraft in an Arctic glacier leads Clark to some of his answers, while putting him in the path of investigative reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams). Lois tracks Clark and the story of the century back to Kansas, just about the time General Zod arrives on earth. Zod will make life-changing demands of Clark; Smallville and Metropolis will become battlefields, and the Man of Steel will face tough choices.

Diane Lane and Kevin Costner are wonderfully convincing as Ma and Pa Kent, teaching life lessons to the young Clark Amy Adams is a different Lois Lane, a plucky collaborator willing to give up her big story to help Clark save the world. Laurence Fishburne as Perry White, editor of the Daily Planet, is part of a solid supporting cast.

The movie runs a little long, but it is good entertainment and the ending is wide open for a sequel; recommended.",1371859200,,1588,4.917910447761194
5783938,4,B00D91GRA4,"It wasn't a bad movie, however it was a bit darker than I expected. Plenty of recognizable elements... just different. Some things do fall short. Nice attempt to reboot, but if you like Christopher Reeve's portrayal of character wait until this one comes out on DVD/Blu-Ray. The IMAX experience non 3D is very overrated, I was not impressed with IMAX. It was so loud I almost left but had no where to go. If I had to grade the movie I'd give it a middle B. If it says anything, I will add Superman Man of Steel to my DVD collection.",1371859200,10,532,4.2772277227722775
5783939,3,B00D91GRA4,"Arguably, the best pedigree for a superhero/comic book film comes from having the involvement of either Joss Whedon (who gave us last summer's brilliant AVENGERS) or Christopher Nolan (who gave us the epic, extraordinary DARK KNIGHT trilogy). Marvel Studios will continue to benefit from the involvement of Whedon, but Warner Bros, and its DC Entertainment subsidiary, is continuing to benefit from the involvement of Nolan, whose more grounded and realistic take on Batman was sought out to bring DC's preeminent superhero, Superman, to big-budget film once again. Of the five theatrical releases that preceded this summer, it's still the first one, Richard Donner's 1978 SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE that was held for years as the gold standard of how to make a great superhero film. It was filled with solid performances, imagery that was breathtaking for the time, and really framed the character of Kal-El/Clark Kent/Superman in a way that would come to define him for three decades. But now, it's time for a new take, and that comes via the mind of Nolan, his co-creator of the DARK KNIGHT trilogy David S. Goyer, and ""visionary"" director Zack Snyder to reboot the character of Kal-El and bring him down to Earth once again in the visceral yet heavy MAN OF STEEL.

From its opening somber notes on Krypton, as Jor-El (a terrific Russell Crowe) continues to be the lone voice in the wilderness predicting the imminent implosion of the planet, and General Zod (a strong Michael Shannon) looks to protect Krypton's heritage that may or may not involve the destruction of some of Krypton's most influential houses (to tell the truth, I'm still a little fuzzy on that plot point), Jor-El risks everything to send his infant son to Earth, along with something called The Codex, which seems to mean everything to the planet's history and heritage. Once the rocket is launched, the audience is immediately whisked into the present, where we see the 33-year-old Clark Kent (a fine Henry Cavill with very big shoes to fill) working odd jobs and trying to find his way in the world. Strange twists of fate begin to weave together as Clark eventually comes face-to-face with Pulitzer Prize-Winning journalist Lois Lane (Amy Adams, doing a lot of good work as per usual) as they both end up investigating a 20,000 year-old Kryptonian ship buried in the ice in the Great White North. As the present goes on, we get glimpses of Clark's life as a young man and of his adoptive parents Jonathan (Kevin Costner, doing some of his best work in years) and Martha Kent (a strong Diane Lane) back in Smallville. He strives for identity and purpose and his parents look to give that to him, but still he feels utterly alone. So when the presence of General Zod arrives on Earth, Kal starts to become even more torn between his Kryptonian and Human sides. As Zod reveals himself to be more of a monster, though, Kal-El uses his very super powers and fights his own kind to save Earth and along the way, he picks up the nickname ""Superman"".

First, the good things about this film. By and large, the performances are very good, with the standouts being both the fathers of Kal/Clark, Crowe and Costner respectively. Lane, Shannon, and supporting players like Christopher Meloni, Harry Lennix, Laurence Fishburne and Richard Schiff are all strong in their roles. Adams is very solid, and I appreciated the efforts that Snyder and company take to give Lois more to do other than being the damsel-in-distress that her representation has so often shown in the films. Cavill seems kind of tailor-made to play the adult Kal/Clark; he has perfectly chiseled good looks and is built perfectly, but time will tell if they end up going in the direction of the more bumbling and cowardly Clark Kent persona, since we don't get around to that, but that leads us to another strong note: This reboot has enough surprises to keep you on your toes, particularly when it comes to the physicality of Jor-El (who frankly after being played by Marlon Brando, just about anyone would be more physical), and especially the beginnings of the relationship between Lois and Clark. I won't spoil it here, but it plays out much differently than in any incarnation we've seen of this couple before. The special effects and also the art direction by Alex McDowell are extraordinary. Also this film gives us something we've never really seen in a Superman film, which brings us to a mix of great and not-so-great: it shows us Superman FIGHTING. Now, fans of the series and of the character have seen this to some extent before during SUPERMAN II, and also during SUPERMAN IV: THE QUEST FOR PEACE. Other than those fun but ultimately unsatisfying fights, we have seen Superman lift impossibly heavy things and fly so fast, he could reverse time... but in MAN OF STEEL, we see him let loose with all of his power in fights that plow combatants miles away or demolish towns.

This is part of the problem as I stated earlier, because the final act of this film is a long orgiastic eruption of fighting, violence and rampant destruction which veers a little too far into the area of what people have termed ""Disaster Porn"". We see a pretty large portion of Smallville and especially Metropolis being reduced to complete rubble in a way that feels uncomfortably reminiscent of images from 9/11. To add even further injury, Kal doesn't really seem to care about all the people he's apparently trying to save, with maybe the exception of Lois. As he and his foes pound each other through skyscrapers and businesses (some of which are certain to have people in them), he doesn't show the concern that the long-established characterization of Superman has shown. He always puts the safety of people first unless he simply has no choice, and that is something that is really shown in the finale of the confrontation between Kal and Zod, and Kal makes a choice there that will likely upset a great many true Superman fans. Also, the film does seem a little too heavy at times for a Superman film, and many times, just seems tonally inconsistent. Goyer's script is smart more often than it's dumb, but this seems like a very average effort for his talents. Snyder thankfully does away with all of his slow-fast-slow combat sequences that he practiced VERY heavily in 300, WATCHMEN and SUCKER PUNCH, but this still doesn't make him the ""visionary"" director that he's hyped as. Some of the camera work also is a little jarring as it seems to switch from steady to shaky at any given moment.

However, there are more good moments than bad in this film, which leads me to give this latest effort of bringing the mythology of Superman to the big screen again a positive review. I can only hope that better things lie ahead for the Man of Steel in the future on the big screen.

3.5 out of 5 stars.",1371772800,5,6821,4.762468300929839
5783940,3,B00D91GRA4,"Ive always loved the first Chris Reeve Superman film from the 70's and the second one wasn't half bad either.  This new film ""Man of Steel"" has a lot of good things going for it but most of the movie deals with an alien invasion that steals the show.  Zod and his cronies from Krypton attempt to take over the planet earth with their scary technology much like the martians did in ""War of the Worlds"".

We don't even get to see Clark in his glasses working with Louis at the Daily Planet!  Very little time is spent on Clark and his relationship with his earth parents or his life on the farm.  It seems most of the movie is devoted to Superman and his attempts to win this battle against Zod.  Lots of stuff is destroyed in the process, and it gets very tedious quickly.

Perhaps Im getting too old for all the over the top crap that seems so popular these days, but I know a good movie when I see one and this aint one for sure, its just ok.",1371772800,4,943,4.120218579234972
5783941,3,B00D91GRA4,"Man of Steel, like all films from Zack Snyder, is far above average in some aspects, and far below average in others. In fact, it's about typical of his work. It's flashy and punchy and zingy, but it glosses over character and plot developments. Unlike 300, though, this film does manage to get characters into the final product, even if they aren't fully fleshed out. It's an okay film, and definitely a visual triumph, but if you're looking for a gripping time, you might want to look elsewhere. It's the perfect popcorn blockbuster.

Snyder, who cut his teeth on television commercials for automobile companies and Reebok, has always been fantastic at visuals. The opening credits for Watchmen, a series of alternate universe vignettes that play out over Bob Dylan's ""The Times They Are A-changing,"" and most of the fights in 300, despite the overuse of slo-mo, are great examples. As a result, Man of Steel looks great. The fight scenes are action-packed, even for moviegoers already overdosed on packs of action, and certain visual spectacles, like a huge building collapsing as our heroes run for cover, and, notably, the 70s-sci-fi-influenced planet of Krypton, with its dragons, underwater nurseries, and scarlet-skinned suns in the backdrop. No one can make a film look as good as Snyder, James Cameron exempted.

But the characters are given no time to develop: the most we get is Clark's parents telling him what a good person he is, and Clark in turn telling everyone how good America and Earth are. It's all telling, no showing, because the `showing' is too busy wowing us with how epic everything is.

One character does get developed, and is easily the best part of the film: General Zod. The guy is the only one with a clear idea of what he hopes to accomplish, he's the only one who gets screen time from the first ten minutes to the final ten minutes, and he's even the only person who really makes a worth-while effort to save Krypton in the prologue. He's a powerhouse. He essentially saves the movie by serving as its spine. With a sequel and the Justice League movie in the works, we'll see a lot more of Superman, but without Zod, we won't really know any of the characters.",1371772800,16,2197,4.7460732984293195
5783942,3,B00D91GRA4,"Having seen the film nearly a week ago, I wanted to take a few days to let it all soak in. I wanted to be able to highlight what was done right and what was done wrong as objectively as possible. Despite the fact that I know many of the folks here gave it a stellar five-star review, I simply couldn't. I wanted to love this film so much and, while I enjoyed it, I couldn't help but feel something was missing. Upon much deliberation and thought on the matter, the most nagging question that came to mind was...""Where is the JOY??"".

I was nine years old when my father took my brothers and I to see Richard Donner's Superman film the day after Christmas in 78. As a kid, it was a mind-blowing experience. From the opening credits to the iconic shot of Chris Reeve as he smiles passing over Earth, it was enchanting and beyond what I thought Superman could be. Granted, I was NINE at the time. However, to this day, it still holds up as a fun and visually breathtaking film. For my money, I still maintain it's the best ""superhero movie"" ever made. Now...I know what many of you are going to say. The typical argument against those critics who took issue with Man Of Steel is that they are too set in their ways and vision, as if living in the past and kneeling at the altar of Donner's classic interpretation. I would certainly concede that is valid to a degree. However, I went into it expecting something different and more ""today"". I'll admit that, while I love the Donner film, it is certainly dated in terms of special effects and had a rather silly plot at times. That said, despite what would now be seen as shortcomings to the film, it had something that Man Of Steel was lacking in spades. It's an element that should be at the very center of a character that has remained a symbol of hope and goodness for seventy-five years. Quite simply, it lacked ""heart"".

Having been absolutely ""gutted"" when I saw Superman Returns seven years ago, I was absolutely thrilled when it was announced that Christopher Nolan and David Goyer (the team that brought Batman back from the cinematic dead after Joel Schumacher's horrid take on the character in the mid-to-late nineties) would be taking on Superman for a new generation. Moreso, I was positively stoked that Zack Snyder, the man that brought ""Watchmen"" to the screen, would be at the helm as director. I knew Snyder had a penchant for visually stunning action sequences and very comic-styled scenery. I figured if anyone could bring Supes back from Bryan Singer's abysmal ""Returns"", it would be them. Of course, after some thought on the matter, it occured to me that maybe Nolan and Goyer, who grounded Batman in a quasi realistic world, might not be the right people to handle Superman. Let's be honest. Superman and Batman are polar opposites. Batman is, by his very nature, a troubled and dark vigilante. ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"" were befitting for that character (although Nolan ""nuked the fridge"" with ""Dark Knight Rises""). Superman, on the other hand, is Earth's favorite adopted son. The character is grounded in religious iconography (more Moses than Jesus in my opinion), classic mythological archetypes (think Hercules), and raised by ""salt of the earth"" midwestern farmers to give him an absolute moral center. Batman is ""grey"" and Superman is ""black and white"" or ""right and wrong"". This is why their shared stories have a great dichotomy. As a team, they're great foils for each other...but separately, their stories should be as different as ""Citizen Kane"" and ""The Wizard Of Oz"".

Now, with all that in mind, let me give my opinion on what they got RIGHT.

Krypton was fantastic!! This was the only area where I thought this film surpassed Donner's crystaline world. There was a hierarchy involved. You had the counsel, the scientists, and the military. I thought the notion of a world with genetically engineered offspring was fascinating and the notion of Kal-El being the first ""natural"" birth in centuries was intriguing. Russell Crowe, as Jor-El, hit it out of the park. Crowe brought a bit of Gladiator's Maximus to the table. He carried himself with nobility and fearlessness as the father of Earth's mightiest hero and prophet of Krypton's doom. Michael Shannon's Zod was stoic and convincing as Krypton's military leader who sought to preserve their culture and heritage. This is another plot point I thought was well done. Zod was not a clear-cut villain who only sought revenge. Like most military leaders throughout history, he carried out his machinations with the best of intentions for his people. Those are usually the best kind of antagonists, the ones that truly feel they are on the side of right. If there's a true villain (in the ""love to hate"" sense) in this movie, it's Zod's right-hand Faora. Played with delicious coldness by Antje Traue, Faora is really fun to watch. Her motives aren't as noble as Zod's in that she seems to relish the violence she inflicts.

When the film moves to Earth, it immediately cuts to an adult Clark Kent. Unlike the traditional origin story, the film tells Clark's story through multiple flashbacks. It's an interesting device that works in the sense that we don't have to wait a full hour to see Superman come into the picture. It's not unlike Mark Waid's brilliant ""Superman: Birthright"" mini series, where Clark, before taking on the mantle of Superman, goes on a soul-searching trek to find his place in the world.

Kevin Costner takes on the role of Jonathan Kent with his usual earnestness and Diane Lane was an inspired choice to play Martha. They convincingly play their roles as Clark's earthbound parental role models.

Henry Cavill was a great casting choice. He certainly looks the part and, let's face it, he did as well as he could with what he had to work with. He's certainly a fine actor (The Tudors) and didn't try to be a Reeve clone (like Routh in ""Returns""). However, by saying ""what he had to work with"", it allows me to segue into what I believe the film got wrong. Before I do, I please ask that, should your opinion differ from mine, please maintain some civility in your comments. We all have opinions and these are merely my own.

Christopher Nolan and David Goyer were clearly the wrong people to tell Superman's story. As I mentioned earlier in this already lengthy review, Superman and Batman are polar opposites. It would seem that they really wanted to give this film a ""realistic"" take on how the world and humanity would react to an alien presense with god-like powers. Naturally, he would be met with cynicism, fear, and distrust. While this is an intriguing premise, by doing so they have erased Superman's sense of wonder, hope, and goodwill. While we all know Superman/Kal-El is an alien, Superman is also Clark Kent. As a matter of fact, and please go back and look through the history of the character over seventy-five years, Superman is more Clark Kent than he is Kal-El. Despite his alien birth and phenomenal powers, Clark Kent is one of us. His humanity and midwestern upbringing gives him the moral fiber to use his powers responsibly. In other words, he knows when and where to pull his punches. It's not only about saving the people of Earth, it's about protecting them and striving to keep them from harms way. So...where was THIS Superman in the latter half of the film???

One of the biggest complaints most had with ""Superman Returns"" was the lack of action. We all wanted to see Supes throw a punch and kick a little butt. I was certainly one of those who longed for a real global threat as opposed to yet another Lex Luthor feeble real estate scam. However, while this film certainly delivers the action many of us wanted to see, they took it to levels of mayhem and destruction that was (for lack of a better term) in poor taste. Poor taste for Superman, anyhow. As a sci-fi epic, it works. As a Superman movie, it fails on many levels. It's as if they were trying to make up for ""Returns"" lack of action by over compensating and saying ""this is not your father's Superman"". The collateral damage in this film is nearly unforgivable. There comes a point where I, as a movie buff, stop suspending disbelief and start paying attention to the staggering loss of life that has to be occurring in the midst of all the ""action"". When action gives way to absolute mayhem and wanton destruction, I find myself detached and disillusioned. I wanted to root for Superman. I wanted to root for Smallville's favorite son. I wanted to root for Clark. However, the last third of the film had me asking myself "" Why isn't he taking this fight AWAY from the already decimated Metropolis???"". My son and I often joke, being comic book fans, about how much insurance premiums must cost for the average citizen of Metropolis. As I was watching the climactic final battle, I found myself thinking of the escalating body count with each punch landed by either Superman or Zod. ""Ooops...there goes Zod through another building...that's probably two or three hundred people dead right there"", and et cetera. Have film makers become so jaded that they don't think people will notice or care? What does that say about us as a movie going public??

Now, I'm taking into consideration the Kryptonian threat. Naturally, there are high stakes in this story (maybe too high because I'm not sure how they will up the ante for a sequel or subsequent films), but the failure here is that the crash-bang-wallop happens before you're genuinely in a position to care about any of these people. Superman, in this story, is more Kal-El than Clark. He's somewhat detached and unsympatheic most of the time. He's grown up in Kansas, yet seems all too eager to be more Kryptonian than Earthling. Instead of being uplifted and optimistic, as should have been my sense when watching Superman, I was unsettled and cynical after a while. All the great special effects and CGI in the world mean absolutely nothing without a solid and engaging story to tell. However, I think the greatest sin inherent in Man Of Steel is that it takes itself WAY too seriously. I can't recall a single point in the film where I laughed (save for the moment outside the bar where Clark was bullied by a drunken patron). As a matter of fact, I don't think I even smiled a whole lot either. My point is this...shouldn't we be smiling when watching Superman? Shouldn't we come out of a Superman movie longing to take to the skies and fight the good fight? That sensation was lost on me here. Granted, I wasn't as livid and angry as I was coming out of ""Superman Returns"", I simply was left feeling uninspired. A great movie has me coming out talking about it for days on end. Man Of Steel simply left me stupified. It's like watching a big fireworks display on the Fourth Of July that goes on much longer than it should. After about fifteen minutes of big bangs and spectacle, at some point you just want to go home as if to say ""enough already""... Too much of anything is not a good thing, and Man Of Steel gets to be too much after a while.

Great Scott!! Superman shouldn't be THIS difficult to get right! We live in a cynical age. We don't trust our government. We don't trust our media. Sensationalism and exploitation mire the airwaves, films, books, and music. Shouldn't a Superman movie be a welcome distraction from all of this cynicsm? Again, this is my humble opinion, but shouldn't Superman be inspiring? To me, Superman should be the best of ALL of us. No matter what race, creed, or philosophical background you have, Superman should encapsulate all that strive for and not just some comic book with unrealistic powers and oversimplified morality. Is being the ""big blue boy scout"" such a bad thing???

I didn't hate the movie. It was enjoyable at times and provided some ""geek out"" moments for me as a comic book fan. Unfortunately, it wasn't a very good Superman movie. Yes...there is a difference between a good eye candy flick and a Superman movie. Namely....having respect and reverence for a character that has been a global beacon of good for seventy-five years.

5783944,3,B00D91GRA4,"""Yes, it's Superman, strange visitor from another planet, who came to Earth with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men. Superman, who can change the course of mighty rivers, bend steel in his bare hands, and who, disguised as Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper, fights a never-ending battle for truth, justice and the American way..."" But what lead to all of this? That's the question director, Zack Snyder attempts to answer in the latest treatment of ""the last son of Krypton,"" Man of Steel.

It has been 75 years since Superman first appeared in 1938's Action Comics' premier issue. Since then, the character has starred in countless comics, TV shows, and movies. Yet, with Man of Steel, Superman's sixth cinematic appearance, most of the buzz revolved around Christopher Nolan's involvement with the project. Nolan, most known as the director of the remarkable Dark Knight trilogy, teamed up with his Dark Knight series co-writer, David S. Goyer to write the screenplay for Man of Steel. Nolan and Goyer successfully revitalized the Batman franchise by making it edgy, making it smart, and taking a fresh take on a familiar story. Thus, the hopes are that they were able to do the same to DC Comic's most popular hero, Superman. Man of Steel, unfortunately, does not quite deliver the goods.

The film opens on Krypton as the doomed planet is self-destructing after its inhabitants have mined the nutrients of its core, causing a full on apocalypse. Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and his wife Laura decide to place their newborn son, Kal-El in a capsule headed for Earth in the hopes that he will know a better life and continue a form of the Kryptonian line of people. Kal-El is, of course discovered and raised by Kansas farmers, The Kents where he is famously renamed ""Clark."" Conflict arrives when Kryptonian General Zod (Michael Shannon) arrives on Earth searching for Kal-El as part of his mission to obliterate man-kind in a genocidal plot to repopulate Earth with pure Kryptonians.

Man of Steel sets out to offer a different tone than is usually found in a Superman film. Henry Cavill's performance as the title character is far more serious, insightful, and raw than any previous Superman. Additionally, this is the most violent Superman film to date, proliferated with tragedy and destruction. Director, Snyder does offer a fresh take on the well-known origin story with a non-linear timeline that bounces back and forth through Superman's first 33 years on Earth. He also, gives audiences a lengthier glimpse at Krypton than found in previous films. The non-traditional timeline works very well, preventing the film from hitting snags as the character grows. Instead, audiences are able to see Superman earlier with a peppering of flashbacks to add context to his story. With all of this being said, the film lacks the edge and intelligence necessary to allow it to, well, soar. The opening sequence on Krypton is a welcomed change, but the planet is already experiencing so much unrest that it is hard to believe these alien people are anything but flawed and miserable. In fact, this scene introduces a sort of Brave New World motif where choice has been bred out of Krypton, and society chooses the fate of all inhabitants. The screenplay opts for simplicity over complexity, which forces the film into a brainless extended action scene for the final hour; a scene that puts the ""never-ending"" in the ""never-ending battle for truth, justice, and the American way."" Coupled with these extended action scenes is Snyder's shooting technique. He uses a lot of shaky, hand-held camera shots, which do become strenuous at times.

Perhaps the most major missed opportunity is the weak exploration of young Kal-El's/Clark Kent's struggles as an alien in a strange world. While Snyder does explore this, he does so in a fashion that merely glosses over the surface. Scene's involving Superman's youth are far too underdeveloped and border on stereotypical. Furthermore, the fun and the romance that are expected from a Superman story are in short supply in Man of Steel. Instead, this reboot attempts to ground a movie about alien superpeople living and battling on Earth in some sort of reality, which is a bit preposterous.

The casting is certainly the film's major strength. Cavill is, of course, an excellent choice for Superman. He looks the part and has great presence on the screen. Amy Adams gives a performance as Lois Lane that veers far from her just being a silly girl getting into trouble all of the time, and Michael Shannon gives another full-tilt-crazy performance as Zod. Other familiar minor characters are also well cast including Laurance Fishburne as Perry White and Kevin Costner and Diane Lane as Ma and Pa Kent.

All together, Man of Steel shows promise, but mostly for what is yet to come. Warner Brothers has already green-lit a sequel that will be fast-tracked to release before 2015's Justice League. Man of Steel feels like a bloated set-up piece to what promises to be a far more superior sequel. B-

Man of Steel is rated PG-13 and has a running time of 2 hours and 28 minutes. The film was post-converted to 3-D, however there are some exciting sequences that are enhanced by the conversion. Nonetheless, 2-D is recommended and there is no stinger after the credits, so feel free to go home if you're not interested in who the 2nd assistant sound editor was.",1371686400,5,5443,4.955093099671413
5783945,3,B00D91GRA4,"Back in the summer of 1989, I was walking out of the most ginormous superhero movie ever made. Actually, it was the most ginormous movie release ever, at the time, bringing in $40 million its opening weekend. All of my friends were ecstatic and cheering, and my cousin wouldn't shut up about how the Joker had pulled that three feet long pistol out of his pants and shot down the Batwing, a moment I'd thought was especially stupid, and I wasn't really happy.

Yeah, I know. I hear all of you out there being oh so shocked.

But, see, the thing I kept thinking, the thing I still think today, was, ""Maybe, if Burton had just been honest and called the movie The Joker, I would have liked it."" [And I could go into a whole thing of all of the things wrong with having Burton make that movie to begin with and how the Joker was the only character he found interesting and how he didn't (and doesn't) like the movie nor, even, the idea of making it--he just wanted to be a part of what he expected to be a vast pop culture phenomenon. But all of that is for some other time.]

And that's how I feel about Man of Steel. If Nolan wanted to make a movie about General Zod, he should have just called it General Zod. As it is, I'm left with feelings of dissatisfaction because Superman was only included as what amounts to an afterthought. He's the guy that's going to defeat Zod, and there's only just enough information in the movie to let us know who he is.

Which brings me to what I think is the biggest issue with Man of Steel, which includes Nolan's abuse of the title (and let's not fool ourselves into thinking that this was not Nolan's movie, even if Snyder directed it. The story and style was Nolan's, which makes it his). Nolan exploits our outside knowledge of who and what Superman is to skimp on the origin, which he then changes. It's sloppy storytelling. Worse than sloppy. And I don't like feeling exploited. The truth is, if I didn't already know Superman's background, I would have had a difficult time with the movie.

For instance, my sister-in-law is a Marvel girl, so she doesn't really know about Superman, not the details, anyway. Her entire exposure to Superman was the godawful Superman Returns, so there were parts of Man of Steel that she didn't get. Like why we should care about Perry White. Within the context of the movie, the fact that we spend so much time watching Perry and friends run away from falling buildings makes no sense. We have no reason to care about that character UNLESS we already know about who he is from the comics (or previous movies or whatever). And she didn't feel any real connection to Clark because the whole reason we care about Clark is we know the Kents took him in and raised him as their own. They accepted him. But what we get from the movie is Jonathan Kent constantly telling Clark what an outsider he is. And don't get me started on the ridiculousness of Jonathan sacrificing himself to the tornado to ""protect"" Clark's secret. All of this includes the lack of context for calling the movie Man of Steel, which does not come from the movie. Unless you know that Superman is called the man of steel, there's no reason to understand the title, so, again, outside knowledge. Also, the name the ""Man of Steel"" was given to Superman when humans thought Superman was actually human. They never think that in the movie, so that particular moniker becomes inappropriate, so, in effect, it's a stupid title for the movie and something only chosen to distinguish it from the other Superman movies. He should have just gone with Superman or, even better, General Zod.

So, with all of that in mind, no, I did not like the middle of the movie. I thought the origin part of the origin story of Superman was very poorly handled. We have no idea of who this new guy is, no idea of the strength of his character, no idea of why we should trust him. Other than, well, he says we should, and that after trashing Metropolis (at least, I suppose it's Metropolis--the movie wasn't explicit with that). What we do know is that, when he was a kid, he saved a busload of kids and got in trouble for it. Later, after having a fight with his dad, he allowed his dad to be killed by a tornado.

Also, the idea of Clark having spent 15 years as a drifter while looking for his origins is... well, it's dumb. Why didn't he ever stick that key into the spaceship in the barn? The technology should have been exactly the same. Or is it that the spaceship was ""broken""? I'm just not buying that explanation. And why would he even expect to find anything else on Earth from wherever it was he was from? There's no good logic for any of that. It's just a contrived way to bring Lois into contact with Clark and not a very good one at that. And I have nothing to say about the ""symbolism"" of having Clark be 33 when Zod comes to Earth. That, also, was just dumb. As was Clark learning to fly, basically, because daddy left him a super suit. For which, by the way, there is no good reason for it to have been on a spaceship buried under arctic ice for 20,000 years.

The beginning of the movie, though, I liked. Mostly. It was good to have a back story for Zod beyond ""space criminal."" The swimming scene and the codex being a skull, though, was, again, dumb. As was depositing the codex within the body of baby Kal-El. The rest was pretty cool, even if it was rather like watching Star Wars what with the big battleships while Jor-El flew around on some kind of giant insect. Yes, I'm overlooking the part where, basically, the entire population of Krypton chooses to stay on Krypton and die rather than evacuate despite having the technology to do so. [I'm also overlooking the fact that, evidently, every single Kryptonian colony failed despite having huge world engine terraforming machines.]

So... we open the move with Zod, and we end the movie with Zod. It was a movie about Zod. And the end of the movie just went on and on and the destruction was beyond my ability to accept. See, here's the thing, we, as viewers, accept that Superman is a good guy, because, well, we know he's a good guy. We have 75 years of prior knowledge that tells us he's a good guy. But the people of Earth in the movie have no such prior knowledge. They don't know who Superman is any more than they know who Zod is. What they do know is that two aliens showed up and destroyed a major city and tried to destroy the world. But, yet, they just accept that Superman is a ""good guy,"" and Nolan gets away with it because he bases that on our knowledge of the character, not what's revealed of the character in the movie (who, remember, allowed his human father to die because of an argument).

But how was Zod? So much of the focus is on him, so how was he? Michael Shannon was, actually, very excellent as Zod. If you've seen him in Boardwalk Empire, it's apparent why he was chose, and it was a good call. He brings just the right amount of zeal to the role to make it believable.

Russel Crowe, whom I generally dislike, was pretty good in his role as Jor-El. Well, except for the hide-and-seek bit in the spaceship, but that was hardly his fault. Seriously? The virtual Jor-El is going to play hide-and-seek with his son upon being uploaded? Another bit of contrivance to get Clark out of the way so that Lois could injured. [And, um, just why didn't Clark hear her coming down  the tunnel? It's not like she was being quiet. Or that that should have mattered at all.]

Henry Cavill was adequate as Superman, although I think he really got the part due to his resemblance to Tom Welling from Smallville. They have the same ""farm-boyish"" grin. I liked Costner as Jonathan, even if I didn't like the part, much, as it was written. I don't have, however, have strong positive feelings for Diane Lane as Martha. I also thought Amy Adams was good in her role. The rest were non-spectacular.

The final result is that I have a lot of mixed feelings about this newest Superman, which is a far cry better than how I felt about the last Superman. This new one is just too much Nolan for me, who seems to be more concerned on an ongoing basis with what seems cool rather than what makes a good story. Seriously, I didn't need more of the Inception-type building collapses. I am interested to see where Nolan is going to take the story, unless this just ends up being a setup for the JLA movie that DC and Warner Brothers are still trying to get off the ground, at which point, I will decide that DC needs to scrap all the previous movie history it's developed and start over, just like they keep doing with their comic book world. Maybe, someday, they'll get it right.",1371686400,8,8673,4.395638629283489

And, it's not afraid to shake up the myth a bit: Lois discovers his secret identity before he joins the Plant, nary a scrap of kryptonite to be seen (which would have been inconvenient with all that Kryptonian matter in the various spacecraft), and so on.

Things fall pretty clearly into monochrome - evil Zod and crew, saintly JorEl and Ma and Pa Kent, Lois earnestly trying to Do The Right Thing, and the U.S. military in a flatly neutral shade of gray. The plot comes across as predictable, mostly: Invader wants Earth, irrespective of current residents, and Superman's kind of fond of Earth. (You know how that one comes out.) So, to make it watchable, they pile on the action and effects, both with very good effect. The oil-rig scene was great, but the injury to urban property values was as good as any disaster flick anywhere.

It's a popcorn movie, a good one of its sort, with an ending that begs for a sequel (or two, or more). If you're minded to poke hole in it, you'll have a field day - I'll constrain myself to the observation that Lois's spiky heels and that sandy soil probably wouldn't play well together. It's a comic book movie, though, with all the suspension of disbelief that implies. I enjoyed it despite its one-dimensional characters, and I'm sure I'll enjoy the very probable sequel[s].

And overall, their effort, ""Man of Steel,"" delivers on the promise of making Superman accessible to a modern audience.

The major problem the film has is, unlike ""Superman Returns,"" where the focus was on character and story, at the expense of action and spectacle, ""Man of Steel"" is the exact opposite, focusing on action and spectacle, at the expense of character and story. The filmmakers seemed to be working hard at making a ""Batman Begins"" version of a Superman film, which sadly does not entirely work. While the action and visual effects are awesome to behold, it turns out that there are just too many action sequences. And as a result, there is a good lack of character development and story. For me, I'm still trying to decide if I like actors in certain roles. Henry Cavill as Kal-el/Clark Kent/Superman is one of those I'm still trying to figure out. I'll admit, he does great with what character moments he has. But when we are thrust into action sequence after action sequence, it becomes hard to focus squarely on the characters. This movie could definitely have used either ten minutes less action and spectacle, or ten minutes more character and story, to help balance out the epic story that Nolan, Goyer and Snyder were attempting to tell.

Despite these flaws, the movie still comes out as good. Although there are too many of them, the action is definitely exciting and, in some cases, unlike anything seen so far on film. And there are a number of good performances in the bunch. Michael Shannon surprisingly does a great job as General Zod, the main villain of the piece. While nobody could match Terence Stamp from the first two films, he does a great job of making Zod both villainous, but also understandable. Amy Adams is really good as Lois Lane. And although they are not in it all that long, Kevin Costner and Diane Lane do a fine job as Jonathan and Martha Kent, the human parents of Superman, who instill their adopted son with a strong moral core. But to me, the highlight of the cast was Russell Crowe as Jor-el, Superman's Kryptonian father. He gives the film a truly iconic screen presence, similar to what Marlon Brando did with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-The-Movie/dp/B0012QVJXS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman: The Movie</a>. His gravitas gives the film a good emotional jolt, and his scenes are truly memorable. Christopher Meloni, Laurence Fishburne, Harry Lennix and Richard Schiff also turn in great performances.

Another fantastic element of the film is Hans Zimmer's remarkable score. While not as memorable as John Williams' classic, it is still a truly remarkable addition to the film, adding additional excitement and emotion to the story. Zimmer is definitely a force to be reckoned with when it comes to film scores, and his work for ""Man of Steel"" is definitely destined to be another classic work of his. In particular, the scene where Clark flies for the first time in the suit is truly exciting and awe-inspiring, even more so with Zimmer's music playing over it. This helped to make that scene the best in the film.

Overall, ""Man of Steel"" is a good-but-not-great return for Superman to the big screen. Despite having too much action and spectacle, some strong performances and a great Hans Zimmer score make up for the weaknesses in the story. If you are a fan of Superman and comic book/superhero/action-adventure films, then ""Man of Steel"" is one you're sure to enjoy.

5783953,5,B00D91GRA4,"First off, I have to say that this was an excellent film. The actors were phenomenal, the direction was on point and the action was intense. Being that many of my friends saw the movie before me and raved about how good it was, I walked into the theater expecting a great movie. Thankfully, Man Of Steel didn't disappoint.

They changed quite a bit of Superman's backstory, but they didn't stray too far from the beaten path. They just enhanced it and added little twists here and there. I particularly liked the storyline's direction and the flashes of Clark Kent's childhood during the story. Most of us already know the tale of his childhood, from the past Superman movies and of course the old CW series Smallville. However, the way they laid it out in `Man of Steel' made me feel like I was introduced to Clark Kent/Superman for the first time.

Oh, and I absolutely love the new suit!

Now there were some parts of it that gave me a little deja vu. I noticed elements were taken from other movies for the development of the planet Krypton and the creatures that resided there. That fact didn't take away from the whole experience of the movie though.

Henry Cavill as Superman/Clark Kent/Kal-El ~ Not only was Cavill stupid freaking hot in this movie, he embodied a more emotional Superman. He took this role and modernized it, made it fit the world we live in now. Even the way he spoke registered as a Superman of this day. When I first found out Cavill was going to be the new Superman, I was doused with excitement. I've followed his career ever since he was a young buck.

I remember him as Albert Mondego in one of my favorite flicks, The Count of Monte Cristo, Charles Brandon in the series The Tudors and Theseus in the movie, Immortals. And now he's Superman! I'm almost sure he won't live this role down any time soon, because so far he is the best Superman.

Yeah, that's right. I said it!

Don't get me wrong. Reeves will always be Superman in our hearts, but in this new day and age, Cavill has owned this character and taken him to a-whole-nother level. I think he deserves the Superman cape.

Amy Adams as Lois Lane ~ Finally! A Lois Lane that isn't annoying as hell. Thank you writers of Man of Steel! I've never been a Lois Lane fan, even though Superman loved her to death. In my opinion, every Lois Lane before this one expressed her annoying demeanor and personality, more so, the Lois Lane from Smallville. Ugh, I could not stand her. That aside, I loved the way Amy portrayed this character. Of course, she was nosey and curious like any reporter, but she was likeable, to me at least. She did some things in this movie that the old Lois Lane would've never done, like the right thing for the sake of mankind for instance. The old LL was selfish, all about getting her story out and didn't care who she had to exploit to do it, but this new LL had a fairly sizeable conscious and actually listened to reason. Yeah, I was shocked too.

Russell Crow as Jor-El ~ OH MY GOD! Best Jor-El EVER! Russell Crow owned that role! We all know he's an exceptional actor. Well he reminded us of that fact in this movie. Jor-El was a badass. When General Zod accosted him like he was merely some defenseless scientist, he put Zod on his backside. *grin* Loved that scene! What I liked most about his character was that he was more dangerous in death than alive. Sure, he showed his physical strength when he went up against Zod and his army, but he displayed his brilliance and never-ending power in the afterlife when his son needed him. He was a soul that never died. I was awestruck while watching him.
Someone needs to give him an award for that role. Seriously.

Michael Shannon as General Zod ~ Michael first caught my attention in the movie Jonah Hex, then again in the series Boardwalk Empire, and recently in the movie Premium Rush. I think he has a crazed disposition in real life and it shows in the characters he plays. Don't get mad at me for saying that. Just remember, it takes one to know one. ;)

General Zod had a deep-seeded cause for his madness and his passion to see it through was relentless. I feel Michael expressed that passion beautifully. Yeah, he was the bad guy and pretty damn crazy, but his goal had merit. No, I don't agree with wiping out the human race to achieve this goal. Genocide is never the answer. *grin* But his will and determination to rebuild his world on earth could be felt through the screen. He would stop at nothing, not even Superman, to get it done.

In my opinion, Michael delivered an applause-worthy performance.

The fight scenes between General Zod and Superman had me about to jump out of my seat. They were epic, and probably the longest battle scenes I have ever seen. And the graphics... wow. Outstanding! The whole movie was awesome, but the Superman vs Zod scenes were memorable. It was so fast and intense, I was afraid to blink. I might've missed something.

For the record, I will be going to see the Man of Steel a second time at the theater, just for the action scenes, and I will also be purchasing it for my Superman collection. :D",1371600000,7,5115,4.45668449197861

5783955,4,B00D91GRA4,"This is a theatrical review of ""Man of Steel"" and may contain spoilers.

Like Spider-Man and Batman, Superman gets a reboot as director Zack Snyder, with a big assist from producer Christopher Nolan, conjure a darker setting for the Krypton immigrant.  The film opens on the doomed planet Krypton where Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and Lara Lor-Van (Ayelet Zurer) have borne a child, conceived the old fashion way which is illegal based on  the government's genetically manipulative mandate.  Consistent with Superman lore, the planet will soon self-destruct mostly due poor management by the government.

In actuality both Jor-El and Gen. Zod (Michael Shannon) have beefs with the government, but Zod acts on his own authority which gets him sentenced to a lifetime of floating in space.  Jor-El and Lara manage to send baby Kal-El into the void destined for Earth along with some magical codex which will allow Jor-El to materialize later and provide fatherly advice.  I was quite impressed with this original act.  The artwork is excellent and there is a nice mixture of advanced science mixed in with rides on flying dragon-like creatures.

As the scene changes quickly to Clark Kent working on a fishing boat then a young Clark having to ""save"" a school bus that plunges into a lake, I'm wondering where all those earlier years went.  We do get to fill in the gaps as the film occasionally goes into flashback.  What makes this second act compelling is that we understand Clark/Kal-El's dilemma.  His adoptive parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent (nicely played by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane), believe Clark (a bulked up Henry Cavill) should keep his super powers a secret.  They are rightly concerned that this ""difference"" will ultimately be detrimental to his growth.  Mankind has a history of not always accepting others who may be different.

Clark eventually leaves Kansas searching for the right answers.  This leads him to the Arctic where he finds his biological father in the form of a codex hologram.  Jor-El suggests that Clark was sent to Earth to improve human existence where they failed on Krypton.  Lois Lane (Amy Adams) has entered the picture by now.  She's a prize winning reporter who is searching for the mysterious man who has saved many lives.

""Man of Steel"" does depart from familiar legend in several ways.  First, Superman is only spoken once that I recall.  The ""S"" on the eventual suit is a Krypton symbol, not an ""S.""  While Superman can indeed be weakened, it isn't by some glowing green rock.  Most interesting of all is that, there are few secrets between Clark and Lois.  We don't have to ask ourselves why Lois doesn't recognize that ""Sup"" is Clark with horned-rimmed glasses.

So where does this movie begin to falter.  In the final act, as Superman must deal with Zod who was freed when Krypton exploded.  Zod, and his hot lieutenant and man hater Faora-Ul (Antje Traue), want the illegally conceived Kal-El destroyed and wants to take over Earth for his own species.  The movie goes into full out ""Transformer""-styled destructive mode.  While some will feel this adrenaline rush is needed after the cerebral middle section, I found it tedious, loud and frankly, pretty boring.  We've all seen it before in ""Thor,"" ""The Avengers"" and many other movies.  It goes on forever.  It's as if the producers said, ""Hey, we've still got some budget left, let's get the computerized wreckage in high gear.""  Those looking for romance and humor will find little of it here.  I suspect we may see more of that in the next episode.  A final note.  I saw this movie on a big screen (not IMAX) and in 3-D.  I found the 3-D to be very good if conservative.

If you can get to a 3D or Imax showing see it there because there are some very impressive shots that are just a lot of fun in 3D and I can't imagine how good they would look in Imax,this is the must see movie of the summer. Word of warning to old school Superman fans,don't go in expecting this to have the same feel as Superman the movie(1978),because this film is a completely different animal and that is what makes it so great. Now don't get me wrong Superman the movie is number 5 on my list of all time favorite films so I am not putting it down but this film has nothing to do with that film and is the better for it. There is no denying that Superman Returns was a failure in part because it was so slavish to the 78 film and because of that it really didn't bring anything new to the table. This film creates it's own superman universe and that is what makes it so good.

I don't want to get into the plot because that will spoil it but I will say that Warner Brothers seems to have listened to an addressed every complaint about that movie with Man of Steel. It is origin story but it is one that is pretty much packed with action from the first minute and doesn't let up yet it still takes the time needed to let you get to know the characters.  It is very good looking film and as always Zack Synder brings energy and just a great eye for what looks good on camera. In the past I have have always enjoyed the look of Synder's movies but have found them lacking in the story and character department,well teaming him up with Goyer and Nolen seems to be the best thing that could have happened.  They have come up with a great script that gives all the characters something to do and with Nolen as producer Synder seems to have grown up and this film has a maturity and brains too it that his over movies don't have and I hope he continues to work with this team because his images teamed with a script this good produces something that is just a joy to see on the big screen.

I would just like to say that this movie also features the most mature version of Superman and Lois Lane I have ever seen. They both act like adults,have brains,work well together,and just get along in such a way that they both feel like strong characters who are more complete together. In other words this movie made me care about the love story between the Superhero and his girlfriend and that is something most movies of this type fail to do. So I take my hats off to everyone.

The whole cast is great but I will single out Henry Calvin and Amy Adams for praise since the movie rests on their shoulders and if they didn't work the whole thing would fall apart.

Calvin is great. He plays Superman his own way but feel just like Superman. He is not Reeves but he doesn't have to be because every time he was on screen I believed he was Superman. Superman is one of the hardest characters to play because an actor has to projected a commanding presence,compassion,a sense of joy,and the idea that Superman know how much is riding on him all at once. Then in the scenes with Lois he has to convey that despite being so close to perfect he really does love and need her and Calvin does all of this.

I have to admit I was dead set against Amy Adams as Lois Lane. She seemed wrong for the part to me and I was sure it was stunt casting but let me tell you crow has never tasted so good. She brings everything to the role. She is a hard ass when she needs to be with out becoming unlikable. She clearly cares about people and she has chemistry with Calvin and she never is just standing by and doing nothing or just getting into trouble. You really believe that she is a smart caring woman who Superman could fall in love with but the great thing is she doesn't play it as so many others have as a schoolgirl crush. Both Adams and Calvin play it very real and the movie is all the stronger for it. Even when she wasn't directly involved with Superman's life I found myself caring about her part of the story and that is all down to how well the character was written and just what a great job Adams did playing it so I take my hat off to her.

The action is of course amazing and as I said this is well directed and it is a fun film,you really feel like you have been on a ride at the end. Is it perfect? No but no film can be and this is about as perfect as a super hero film gets so if you can get over the fact that this doesn't continue the Reeves series I say go out and see it now as far as summer blockbusters go this is so much better then what we normally get. 10/10.",1371513600,6,4730,4.073039742212675
5783957,4,B00D91GRA4,"I remember this because I broke out laughing, then realized nobody else was laughing.  Sorry.  At least I didn't text through the whole movie.

This new Superman gets off to slow start, spending a fairly long time on Krypton.  It's an interesting Krypton though, with a sort of Dark City wardrobe.  A lot of gadgets that look like jellyfish with snow crab claws for legs.  Nice!  Jor-El uses a giant bird-like critter as a taxi, pretty much straight out of the Taarna sequence in Heavy Metal.  Suffice to say, this is not the type of Krypton where they have achieved peace and everyone walks around wearing a toga.

Once Cal gets to earth, it's a different movie.  Instead of mapping things out the way they did on Krypton, on earth there are just a few flashbacks and (I guess) the assumption that maybe you've already heard Superman's story.  The rest is 90 minutes of special effect battle scenes.  While not much is new, they will be hard to top.  I particularly enjoyed the incredibly good looking Antje Traue.  The effects are academy award level and if they give an award for product placement, Nikon and iHop are a shoe-in.  There is also a religious vibe as Superman gets his strength from the sun and you can literally hear the angels singing.  By the way, we are also blessed with an atmosphere that's better than Krypton's which is surprising but nice to know.  For the type of movie it is, it's very good.",1371513600,3,1418,4.563492063492063
5783958,5,B00D91GRA4,"""Man Of Steel""
(Warner-DC, 2013)

I went to see this one in the theater, with full-bore, big, loud 3D-IMAX, and it was pretty impressive.  I'd read a couple of harsh reviews slamming the film as a pile of slag, and I've never been that into the previous Superman movies, but I was ready to give it a chance: the trailer I saw months ago looked cool.

So, yeah, it's pretty good.  The script is definitely on the serious side, tilting towards tragedy, and it grinds a little bit as they make absolutely sure we understand how tough Clark Kent's life has been. There are precious few light moments in the drama, certainly none of the slapstick seen in Joss Whedon's (excellent) ""Avengers"" and some of the plot points seemed excessively harsh -- the fate of Pa Kent, for example -- but all the grim realism effectively set the tone for the massive battle sequences, and that's where the heart of this film lies.

This is a stunningly violent, amazingly kinetic film. I had thought Whedon nailed super-FX in ""The Avengers,"" but ""Man Of Steel"" takes superhero movies to a plateau several levels above anything we've seen so far. The on-screen destruction is massive, from the near-nuking of Smallville to the mega-9/11-ing of Metropolis, the digitally-produced havoc is truly epic -- at some point I realized I'd been immersed in nonstop chaos for about twenty minutes and I was still riveted and awed by what was onscreen. Very few moments looked awkward or dorky, the stiffness of motion that we've come to accept in high-tech action films was almost entirely smoothed away, and the impression of being there in the moment, keeping up with the speed and power of these thunderous metahumans was very convincing. The closest thing we've seen elsewhere was the forest battle scene between Iron Man and Thor, but this was that scene, cubed.

In terms of translating the imaginative scope of comics-in-print into film, this was amazingly successful. They may have trouble living up to this film if a franchise begins, but they certainly don't need to re-re-reboot Superman again: they nailed it. Plus, Henry Cavill is a great Clark Kent.  Hopefully the Warner studio can resist the temptation to make the next film into an overwrought epic that brings Superman's story to a grand, premature conclusion (the curse of Hollywood superfilm scripts) and just have Superman have one adventure after another, and shed some of the darker psychological overtones. If they can sustain this level of impact and excitement, I'll go to as many of these films as they can make. I suspect I'm not the only person who feels this way.  In print media, superheros have endless adventures: why not in film?

Anyway, if you've read negative reviews from professional film critics, take 'em with a grain of salt. I think this is a genre that a lot of cinema snobs just don't get... and the studios are only now starting to get a handle on. But ""Man Of Steel"" is definitely a big step in the right direction.

5783959,5,B00D91GRA4,"Henry Cavill is Superman and Superman is going to catapult Henry Cavill into mega stardom. This latest rendition of superman is nothing short of superb. A colossal visual extravaganza of modern day technology, artistry and very strong story telling. The film begins very syfy, I was thinking ""Star Wars for several moments"" while watching the set up, but quickly turns into the comic hero, action adventure with lots of heart. The action sequences were bombastic and goosebump inducing. The fans who have been following the many editions and evolution of this superheroe saga will find this film a bit darker, more serious than previous versions.

Unlike the final two renditions from the early eighties starring Christopher Reeve, thankfully there are no signs of this superhero ever going the comedic route. You may find that this Superman is pose to break many expectations specially from skeptics. Carrying the film with great elegance, character and charm and as a perfect fit is Henry Cavill. He conveys enough sensitivities to swoon the viewer yet he has all the powers it takes to crash through many buildings as he fights his nemesis General Zod and his bad guys from Krypton.

The clever part of this story is that the bad guys are not the usual bad guys we have come expect, because they too have their purpose and noble agenda as well, so its not too difficult to empathize with their plight of survival. Their arrival onto earth is understandable. The stellar cast who accompany Cavill on this latest journey will leave you wanting an additional two to five hours more of ""Man of Steel"". But fear not, clocking in at almost two hours and a half you are sure to leave the theatre with your expectations fulfilled and you may very well treat yourself to repeated viewings if only to revisit the magnificence and scale of this spectacle. It is safe to say, this latest superman is so far the event film of 2013. The film you are not soon to forget. It's hair raising emotional content in conjunction with some very real and well done action sequences will keep both men and women coming back for more. The ending does a great job setting the tone for the upcoming sequels. Without question, this latest version of Superman brands Cavill into the hall of fame of superheroes and cements ""Man of Steel"" into a new, fresh longstanding franchise. 10/10

5783960,5,B00D91GRA4,"I don't know where the critics are coming from.  I am a Superman fan so I would embrace any Superman movie.  But this one is different.  They finally listened to the fans and gave us a movie full of action and story.  They couldn't have picked a better cast.  Absolutely a fabulous job from each cast member!  There were parts that made this grown man cry.. and there were parts that made you want to cheer.  This movie flowed well and fast.  When the ending came I wanted MORE!  And I am hoping this is the start of many movies to come.  This movie didn't even seem like a 2+ hour movie.  An outstanding movie and well worth the wait.  I can't tell you how happy I am to see Hollywood do justice to the Superman universe and story.  As a matter fact, I will be going twice on this.  The only dissapointment I had was the theater was packed and I was forced to sit close to the screen.  Not the best experience but that is not ""Man Of Steel's"" fault.  There was only one movie I paid to see twice in the theater and that was the original Spiderman back in 2002.  Man Of Steel will be the next.  I will be going back once the hype dies down.  I will be buying this movie when it is released.  I would pay 30-100 dollars just to rent and watch it in the comfort of my home if I could (streaming through the internet).  Take my money!  I am so glad they are making a fortune on this movie.  I hope they can make two fortunes because it is well deserved!  Thank you to the movie studio for bringing my favorite childhood super hero back to life!

5783961,3,B00D91GRA4,"Okay folks... come down to EARTH. This is not the best superhero movie ever and if it is, than that means no other superhero movies had a story. The story is basic as it comes, we have Australian Kryptonians, a Superman who kills, the Air Force opening fire upon a Kansas town with civilians, boring delivery and 9.11 x 15 destruction at the end of the movie just because the creators found a new effect to use. Now... my review.

My first and still lingering thought about watching ""Man of Steel"" for all of twenty minutes was the overwhelming excitement of watching the capabilities of today's technology. Regardless of what you think of big over the top action movies, when they are done properly, they are breathtaking. We are presently walking into and through a new generation of film that has taken movie experiences to a brand new level. With the addition of 3D, high definition and improvements in sound technology, movies such as ""Man of Steel"" can be realized at a level that previous Superman movies could not.

That being said, there is also a fine line with that technology that movie makers are still fleshing out; still trying to figure out what is too much and what is not enough. For instance, the effect that showed Superman attacking villains or visa/versa into buildings was pretty cool and it were as if the creators thought so too; so much that they used it too much. Way too much. The ridiculous building destruction at the end of the film was cool once, maybe even twice, but to the extent they took it was not done with common sense or thought of HOW MANY PEOPLE DIED, but ""this is cool, lets keep doing it"". The destruction in the finale was laughable. Even if it can be explained, humans would not be so happy about the total desolation of nearly an entire city and catastrophic body count caused by this alien, regardless if he were good or not.

I would also like to make one very important suggestion to future movie makers who are filming in 3D; shaky cam and 3D don't mix. Shaky camera is 95% of the time awful anyway.

Despite the obvious praises and dissatisfaction with ""Man of Steel"" in a technological aspect, its greatest asset may just be its humanity. For once, an action or superhero movie did that part of their movie correctly. Yes, the film is drenched in explosions and destruction, but while they were introducing us to the `Super' of Clark Kent, aka Kal-El, they also introduce us to the man. This was the movies greatest asset. It wasn't the visuals or the ridiculous chaos that ensues toward the end that left a lasting impression on me, it was the connection that Clark Kent has with his parents, played by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane.

""Man of Steel"" is a good movie that was not without fault. The story arch that we are all familiar with moves quickly. Yet, while it succeeded mightily in realizing and portraying the powers of Superman and the personality of Superman, it took many liberties with the story and dragged boringly along with a somber delivery; as if this movie were a tragedy. Throw in dozens of illogical occurrences that I listed earlier and this movie can easily leave you with a bad taste in your mouth. The most unforgiving of those is hands down... an inexplicable boredom, despite everything going on.",1371513600,6,3278,4.625429553264605
5783962,5,B00D91GRA4,This movie is awesome. I had my doubts about this film and boy it took me for a loop. I thought that they did a great job. I will always love the original superman movies. but I think this reboot is going to be great zack Snyder did the original movies justice and did mr. Christopher revves justice as well. I loved the actor who played superman he was really good he got the character down very well. we all know that we can not replace Christopher reeves as superman but he comes pretty close. I thought he was better than Brandon Roth. this movie had so many intense fight scenes espicialy the ones between general zod and superman. I was glad they put a different villain besides lex luthor in the movie. I thought Michael Shannon did a great job as general zod. and I loved what they did with krypton they made it an actual planet with plants and animals it was very imaginative. this series is going to be great. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do.

5783963,4,B00D91GRA4,"Some spoilers:  Clark Kent (Henry Carvill) discovers his destiny while recalling how he was brought up by his human parents (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane). While reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) wants to tell the whole world what she learned in the artic and the Kent farm about Clark Kent.
  But just as she's deciding to expose his secret of not, enemies from his home planet arrive led by General Zod (Michael Shannon) and demand that Kal-El/Clark go to them or they'll hurt humans. Kal-El has DNA sacred to their race that Zod is pissed about it being given to him by Jor-El (Russel Crowe). So Kal-El must fight for the planet and people he learned to love.
  The film is picked on by critics that know nothing due to the dark tone, being too serious and Cavill hardly ever smiling. Richard Roeper even said the film lacks joy when the action we do get is a lot of fun and the very end is kind of cutesy but in a good way.
  Cavill shines and shouldn't be compared to Christopher Reeves since he does have plenty of charm when the script by the Nolan's actually allows it. Their Batman Begins like script with all the flashbacks to Clark's childhood didn't work as well for Superman and slowed the film down too much. While Clark actually having to be pushed out of the way by fisherman so a cage wouldn't fall on him didn't work since wouldn't Clark heard it falling ? He does have super hearing.
  While we still think of Terrence Stamp when Michael Shannon doesn't get to do much but yell and look angry as Zod. And Amy Adams plays a tough Lois but didn't really become the role the way Erica Durance did in Smallville. Laurence Fishburne is a great actor but so far him being cast as Perry White seems to just be for the hell of it and not because he was perfect for the part.
  I am a fan of the Nolan's but they need to realize that Superman films need to be a little whimsical and have some humor. Director Zach Snyder (Watchmen) and the Nolan's did a good job giving us the human side of Superman but they also over did that in a way. I enjoyed the film a lot but it also didn't make me excited about a future of DC films with Christopher Nolan is charge. He needs to lighten up, we don't need a Wonder Woman film with flashbacks of her with a beard in Alaska arm wrestling big muscular dudes, while she also recalls how she found the invisible jet.",1371427200,5,2359,4.29054054054054
5783964,5,B00D91GRA4,"Now I enjoy X-Men, Spider-Man, Iron Man and all of the Avengers, but for me they don't compare to Batman and Superman. In fact, after Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, I would rank Man of Steel as the second best of all the recent comic book turned movies. I knew going in that the critics were nearly 50/50 on the good and bad side of the fence, so my expectations might have been lowered enough to prepare for the worst and surprised when it didn't happen.

The story begins with the same old origin of Superman, but there are enough little changes in the script and nice visual touches to make it seem fresh. As expected, the CGI FX and Hans Zimmer's score are stunning throughout.

Henry Cavill makes for a good and believable Superman and Michael Shannon plays a memorable villain in General Zod. Russell Crowe really surprised me with a strong emotional turn as Jor-El. He is a good actor, but his work of late has been rather weak. I normally can't stand the character of Lois Lane, but I like her here, so that is saying something about Amy Adams.

It's not perfect of course. The narrative did not always gel, jumping around too often, and it ran for maybe 15 minutes too long.

I saw it in digital 2-D due to all the bad IMAX and 3-D reviews. It cut my ticket price in half and I didn't feel like I missed out. Also, my full theater clapped and cheered loudly when it was over. I had not heard a reaction like that in a long time.

With the 129 million dollar opening weekend, I feel this is but the first film of a trilogy that will probably get even better now that the foundation has been laid down.

I was going go into a huge review/rant but I'll keep it simple. Henry Cavill was perfect as Superman so was Russell Crowe as Jor-El and Michael Shannon owned as Zod. This was Zack Snyder's best movie of his career. He definitely made up for Sucker Punch. The origin story was done just right and the fight scenes were amazing! It didn't feel like it was almost 2 1/2 hours. Many complain there was lack of humor in it. There was some humor in it but at the right moments. You'll get your humor in the sequel.

There has never been an actual good live-action Superman movie until now. If you liked those old Christopher Reeve movies or Superman Returns, then I'm sorry, but you know nothing about Superman. In all the Comics and cartoon, Superman always had very Sci-Fi stuff involved with a lot taking place on other planets with different technology and had a lot of action and destruction. None of this awesomeness happened in those older movies. Instead, a bunch of stupid crap happened, like Superman flying around the world to turn back time and him sleeping with Lois, which he would never do. The series should've been rebooted a long time ago, and finally it has been. This movie is just as good of a reboot as, if not better than, Batman Begins, The Incredible Hulk, and The Amazing Spider-Man.

Unfortunately the few moments that shined were overpowered by haphazard storytelling and a script with little joy. Henry C. was never given enough to really take charge of the movie and put his stamp on it. CG action seemed to be the main focus and a solid story that flowed took a backseat. I enjoyed most of the changes they made, that's not what bothered me, it was they way it was given to us. Any given scene with Clark/Lois/Perry etc. seemed to last about a minute maybe, very hard to get involved in the characters when scenes fly by like that. Again, I thought the movie was decent but they could've utilized these great actors so much more. It seemed they were a means to get to the Star Wars style effects/action scenes. And the movie was really void of any great Superman flying scenes that the 1978 Superman had. I know the creators wanted a fresh take on the genre, but it's Superman, show us a little bit of humanity with the character.

Let me start by saying this. I can't stand ""professional"" critics. They act like they're sooo super smart. No pun. I don't think they know what good and bad movies are. 90% of the time we totally disagree. Don't listen to them. Judge for yourself.

This was awesome. Best Superman movie I've seen. And yes, I grew up in the Christopher Reeves era. I still enjoy Superman 2(the first was always just ok to me). But never has Superman reached his potential on film. Not like other superheroes have. Until now. There's no comparison. I don't feed on nostalgia. I still love my old classics but some newer interpretations are simply better. This had a good story and nicely paced origin retelling, great comicbook style action(about time) and I love the smart way of how Clark Kent can maintain his secret identity. They did it also in Smallville. Makes more sense. For the critics and few other naysayers, I don't think they are or ever will be ready for a true Superman movie like we just got. Want to live in the past, live in the past, the 70s/80s. I prefer this version.

No one has to agree with me. This is my firm opinion and I will continue to stand by mine. Very pleased. That is all. No description needed. See it for yourself.",1371427200,11,1243,4.495575221238938
5783970,5,B00D91GRA4,"After a mediocre Iron Man 3 and a good-but-not-great Star Trek: Into Darkness - both films being nothing more than entertaining roller coaster rides, which is fine for some viewers but not for me - Man Of Steel delivers, not just the requisite ride, which is expected of all summer blockbuster movies, but a good story and a Christian message to boot. Henry Cavill (Immortals, The Tudors) gives us a version of Superman that is naturalistic and emotional, as opposed to Christopher Reeves' take from the 1980s that was stiff and two-dimensional. With the script, David S. Goyer (Batman Begins, Dark Knight, Dark Knight Rises) introduces us to a darkly realistic Superman: one full of introspection and doubts, full of past hurts and pain, and yet determinedly hopeful.

Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins, Dark Knight, Dark Knight Rises) started production on the film, and then turned it over to Zack Snyder (300) to direct. I had my doubts about this triumvirate - Nolan-Snyder-Goyer - simply because Superman is not Batman, and these guys had Batman in their blood. (300 has that same ""Dark Knight"" kind of feel.) DC Comics' Superman is a character very much like Marvel Comics' Captain America - you could almost add him to the list of baseball, hot dogs and Mom's apple pie. He's all-American and he's uncomplicated. Batman, on the other hand, is darkly complex, a psychological roadmap of twists and turns. I was afraid they would turn this simple, refreshing character into a Dark Knight clone.

But, delightedly, they did not. What they did do, surprisingly, is give us Superman as a Christ figure - the Son of Man as the Man of Steel. Man Of Steel is fraught with Christian symbols. Where this came from, I do not know, because, while there is a lot of spirituality in comics and graphic novels - and much of it Christian - I don't think it's this blatant. I know that Superman is the most righteous of all the superheroes - again, like Captain America, who is also full of virtue and a model for boys to follow. But to think of him as a Christ figure is to take him to a new level. Yet, there it is, throughout the film: Superman is Christ. Substitute Superman's muscles for Christ's spirit, Kansas for Galilee and Metropolis for Jerusalem and you have, in essence, the same story - the salvation of mankind by a dual-nature being - fully God and fully man.

Superman is a savior. The first thing that tipped me off was the scene where Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and his wife are putting the baby Kal-El into a spaceship destined for Earth in order to save him from the destruction of the planet Krypton. I thought, ""That is Moses being placed in the reed basket and sent down the River Nile."" Think about it. He's being sent away from destruction to a people with which he has nothing in common in order to save them. That was not only the calling of Moses, it was the calling of Christ. Notice that both Kal-El's name, and that of his father Jor-El, end in El. El in Hebrew means God. I doubt if that was an accident.

Like Jesus, Kal-El (Clark) was raised by an adopted father - in his case, Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner). Kent instills in his son the idea of always being a force for good, and of always doing the right thing. He warns Clark that people may not accept him, and that they'll probably be afraid of him because of his powers; and so he needs to keep his identity a secret. This is not unlike Christ's warning to his disciples not to make His identity known.

Superman begins his ""career"" of saving people at the age of 30. So did Jesus. He begins as an itinerant worker. Jesus began as an itinerant preacher. Both men did so, partly to conceal their identities, and partly to avoid their enemies.

Superman discovers his origins and purpose from his father's facsimile in an arctic outpost. Moses did the same thing from a burning bush, and it could be argued that Jesus discovered these things during his 40 days and 40 nights in the wilderness. Such a""briefing"" could be said to be a rite of passage - a spiritual rite of passage. Every believer, and every great character in literature and film, has one. It is what defines them. Superman is such a character.

I really like the fact that the story of Superman has a ""grunge"" phase, which is what his time as an itinerant worker is. It makes his story more real. I also like how the filmmakers tell his backstory using flashbacks. It's far more effective than if they had just told a straight chronological story, because it relates those events to his present sufferings. When Clark finally becomes Superman, he's spectacular, as you would imagine. He's got the hair, the muscles and the cape. But he has more than that. One of the things we discover in his conversations with Lois Lane is the meaning of the ""S"" on his chest: it isn't an ""S"" for Superman; rather, it's the symbol for hope on the planet Krypton. Superman represents hope. That's what Christ represents as well.

As Superman, Henry Cavill has it over Christopher Reeve hands down. Not only is he more comfortable with his muscles - Reeve was stiff and bulky - but he's a far better actor. He has some very emotional scenes, and is very believable in them. His relationship with Lois Lane (Amy Adams) works well, as far as chemistry. In the analogy with Christ, we are Lois Lane - the one he loves, the one he saves time and time again, the one he would die for. The best part of Clark Kent is his struggle with himself - his attempt to reconcile his two natures - and thereby decide where his allegiances lie - with the remnant of Krypton, who are basically the bad guys; or with residents of his new home, Earth. Of course, he chooses the latter.

Trust is a prime motif in Man Of Steel. I already mentioned Clark's father's advice about not trusting people with his identity. In one scene, Clark is in a church, seeking answers to the question of who he is and what he should be. As he's leaving, the pastor, in a desperate attempt to help, blurts out something to the effect of, ""Trust people."" Later, when Superman is finally recognized by Colonel Nathan Hardy (Christopher Meloni) as a friend, not an enemy, he says something to the effect of, ""I trust you."" Trust is the foundation in any relationship, and certainly with both the Man of Steel and the Son of Man.

In Man Of Steel, there's the obligatory violence, as Superman fights against the bad guys - the only other survivors from the destroyed planet Krypton, who are traitors, exiled from the planet for insurrection. The leader of this group, General Zod (Michael Shanno), is not my favorite villain of all time. There is nothing compelling about him. And the final showdown with Superman is over-kill, in my opinion. It would have been just as effective - and the movie could have been brought in at 2 hours run time instead of 2:23 - by having him die with his compatriots. Must every action-adventure movie end with a final showdown? In this case, I don't think it was needed.

One of my favorite scenes is the last one. I won't be giving anything away if I say that it is when Clark Kent shows up at the Daily Planet for the first time wearing his glasses, obviously promising a sequel. I thought, ""Now that is Clark Kent."" At last: an actor who can pull off both Superman and Clark Kent without one of them seeming ridiculous. Bravo!

Final Note: I've mentioned before how Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan is a cultural Christ figure (http://www.waitsel.com/classic_literature/Tarzan.html). Well, so is Superman. As such, I think he's also a symbol of Righteousness (http://www.christianknighthood.com/Righteousness.html). Both of these characters came out of the early part of the 20th Century, reflecting the values of Americans at that time. Can we recapture those? We need to, and this film definitely gives promise to that hope.",1371427200,11,7841,4.633093525179856
5783971,4,B00D91GRA4,"Those of you who remember Christopher Reeve's ""campy"" Superman films of the 1970's can forget anything you saw in those films.  There is nothing ""campy"" in this film and that is ok by me.  The film opens with the birth of Kal-el on Krypton.  His father has hidden Ka-el's birth because he is the first natural birth to happen in a few hundred years.  Like the book Brave New World all babies are born in a laboratory and conditioned to have specific careers.  As Krypton is in its last days Kal-el's parents want him to start Krypton over with ""free choice"" on the Earth.

General Zod learns what the els have done and comes to steal Kal-el.  He and his forces arrive a minute too late as Lara has sent her son to the heavens in a ship bound for Earth.  Zod kills El and gets ready to intercept Kal-el's ship but he and his forces are caught and are exiled to the Phantom Zone.  Shortly after Krypton self destructs.

We see an adult Kal-el on Earth using varous identies and going from place to place (like David Banner in the old Incredible Hulk tv series) each time someone suspects something about him.  He has several flashbacks to growing up under the tutelage of Jonathan Kent who kept telling him that nobody must know of his special abilites because he will be feared.

He will later learn of his Krypton birth and will discover an ancient outpost where he can insert a special key that was sent with him in the ship by his Krypton father.  This key activiates the ancient outpost with a holographic image of his father complete with his father's memories.  He will also be provided the costume that we have come ot know.

Of course the baddies led by Zod will escape the Phantom Zone and learn where Kal-el is living and come to threaten Earth.  It will be up to Kal-el to make some serious decisions.  Does he defend his Earth identity and the only planet that he knows or should he go with Zod and further his plans for a new Krypton.

This movie is filled with a lot of inner turmoil and like Bruce Wayne in the Nolan Dark Knight films, Kal-el must dig deep down and figure out who he is and what he wants to be.  Lois Lane is also in the film and she tries to help Kal-el with solving his identity.  She is on thin ice with her newspaper and her editor (played brilliantly by Larry Fisbourne).  I thoroughly enjoyed the film from start to finish.  Some people complained that the special effects and fight scenes were overdone.  I did not get that but maybe because I only saw the 2D version.

My only complaint is that Lois Lane seemed to be able to get to places quickly that maybe she shouldn't have been able to get to.  As weveral people have mentioned, we do so a fuel truck with ""LexCorp"" on it so maybe a sequel is in the works with a very familiar Superman foe.",1371427200,5,2784,4.328185328185328
5783972,2,B00D91GRA4,"Zack Snyder (300, Watchman) did an honest job in trying to reinvent the franchise, however he fell short in the most important area, the story.  Man of Steel had no real plot that develops. I don't mind adjusting the lore (SPOILER: Jonathan Kent dies in a twister?), but above all else you need a story that engages me into the characters.  David S. Goyer (Threshold, Flashforward) story that was penned by himself and Synder lacked any real depth or for that matter originality.

I am a huge Superman fan (from Kirk Allen to Dean Cain), and I could even appreciate the better points of Superman Returns a few years back with Brandon Routh as the alien from Krypton which also had major issues, but this film had no ""WOW"" Superman moments. It was like watching 300 (nothing but fighting) meets Transformers (hard to follow who was hitting who) meets Cloverfield (the camera shook even on the most intimate close-ups) meets the remake of Godzilla (what's the point?).

Now, the good things I saw were actually for once Russell Crowe (Gladiator, Les Miserables) was properly cast as the father of Kal El (Superman), Jor El. Although a short part, his pushy nature of guiding his son as well as the earthlings seem every sincere and more so on the scenes where he puts his baby son in the spaceship that takes him to a strange new world.

Okay, Henry Cavill (The Immortals, Stardust) does an honest attempt at playing the American Icon even though he is British. He seems sincere in his convictions and honest to the character. Defiantly a good looking man, but again he as an actor and as a character had very little to stretch his acting muscles on.

Amy Adams (Enchanted, Monster) as Lois Lane, although small in part is always a delight to watch. Once again, she didn't have a lot to work with, but what she did with what she had was good. Amy is a far more talented performer than what they gave her to do here in the movie. Another good, short but memorable performance came from Christopher Maloni (Oz, Law & Order) who plays a military sergeant who is the first one to believe and trust in Superman besides Lois of course, weirdly enough.

Kevin Costner (Dances With Wolves, The Untouchables) as Jonathan Kent and Diane Lane (Perfect Storm, Jumper) as Martha Kent were perfectly cast if not for the re-inventing of the famed Superman lore. Diane was amazing sincere and real while Costner was the most fatherly I have ever seen him perform.

General Zod played like a punked up with steroids version of Adam Ant was performed by Michael Shannon (Take Shelter, The Iceman). Although he looked menacing and shouted well, he didn't have the gravitas as an actor to play the broadly proud and menacing personality that is the character. He just came off like a big bully with special powers. Weak of spirit of conviction  if strong in his efforts of pointless violence.

The film is too dark to be a Superman film. It is not triumphant and proud and downplays the grandeur of what the American Icon has always represented. I hope Synder does not direct the sequel if there is one and coupled with the gloomy cinematography Amir Mokri (Pacific Heights, Queen's Logic), the not so interesting redesigning of the costumes by Michael Wilkinson (Sucker Punch, 300) and the bold and broad but un-heroic score of Hans Zimmer (The Lion king, Pirates of the Caribbean ), I really hope it doesn't destroy the DC Line of super heroes. Although The dark Knight series did okay (Heath Leadger in the second was my favorite even without Batman in it), I just wish that kids could walk out of Superhero movies these days feeling like a superhero themselves and having fun. Like the Avengers film! There were no claps, cheers, boos or applauds during this film. Superman Return's had that and I won't begin to mention the standing cheers of crowds at Christopher Reeve's Superman: The Movie directed by Richard Donner.  I was more than disappointed and I was really looking forward to this one! Go see Star Trek: Into Darkness - it is a far far far far better film (thick with story)!",1371427200,15,4069,4.668994413407821
5783973,5,B00D91GRA4,"Just wow, I went to the movie's twice already to see this Superman, just early on today when the movie ended the crowd erupted in applause!!!! My 36 year old brother gave it a solid 8 out of 10, while my buddy I was with kept saying ""wow I cant believe how amazing that movie was"". My father must have said to me 10 different times ""That movie was excellent excellent excellent!"".  First thing my sis said to me leaving the theater is ""That movie was really good!"".

 I have took 17 people to see this movie at the theater already with 100% positive feedback!  This Superman is emotional, lost, and on a mission to find out who he is. Once he does though he is a MAJOR ASSKICKER!!!!

  The director Zack Snyder stated that the final cut of the movie was 3 hours 20min long, he had to cut a full hour of scenes from this movie for its theatrical release. That would be my only complaint,  you can tell there was originally more to this movie as some scenes seem rushed through, like how Superman finds the fortress of solitude, it happens so quick you know there was much more to these scenes in the original directors cut.  I'm just praying that they include all this extra footage on the BluRay once released, I'd be the happiest man on earth!

All in all 5 Stars!  It really is a ride you do not want to miss!!!!

5783974,5,B00D91GRA4,"one of the best movies of this and all times, it is difficult to make a superhero movie that has serious tone and not just romp and jokes. It shows the human side of Kar-El, in trying to be just one of us, but his fate will prepare something bigger ""The ultimate hero of humanity"".

It shows a Clark who suffer the consequences of being different, their emotions, their feelings. Facing decisions between who he is or who he should be.

The cast was amazing, everything fit to perfection: Henry Cavill, Michael Shannon, Russell Crowe, Amy Adams, Antje Traue, Kevin Costner, Laurence Fishburne ..

The music is beautiful and powerful

Indisputably 10/10 Movie",1371340800,6,658,4.79646017699115
5783975,5,B00D91GRA4,"""Man Of Steel"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: A young boy learns that he has extraordinary powers and is not of this Earth. As a young man, he journeys to discover where he came from and what he was sent here to do. But the hero in him must emerge if he is to save the world from annihilation and become the symbol of hope for all mankind.

The cast led by Henry Cavill (as Clark Kent / Kal-El / Superman), Amy Adams (as Lois Lane), Michael Shannon (as General Zod), Kevin Costner (as Jonathan Kent), Diane Lane (as Martha Kent), Laurence Fishburne (as Perry White) & Russell Crowe (as Jor-El) is excellent. The directing by Zack Snyder is excellent. The story (based on the comic books created by Jerry Siegel & Joe Shuster) by David S. Goyer (also did the screenplay) & Christopher Nolan (who also produced), the screenplay by Goyer is excellent.

The music by Hans Zimmer is excellent. The cinematography by Amir Mokri is excellent. The film editing by David Brenner is excellent. The casting by Kristy Carlson & Lora Kennedy is excellent. The production design by Alex McDowell is excellent. The art direction by Chris Farmer & Kim Sinclair is excellent. The set decoration by Anne Kuljian, set dressings by Paul Allen, Danial A. Miller Jr., Guy Roland, David Soukup & Patrick Kearns, set designs by Stevo Bedford, Mike Barton, Aric Cheng, David Clarke, Scott Herbertson, David W. Krummel, Tammy S. Lee, Thomas Machan, David Moreau, Sarah Nolan, Margot Ready, Kerry Sanders & Bryan Sutton is excellent. The costume design by James Acheson & Michael Wilkinson is excellent. The special effects supervised by Allen Hall & Scott Kodrik, coordinated by Joel Whist & John D. Milinac is excellent. The visual effects supervised by David Wallace Allen, John 'D.J.' Des Jardin, Joe Letteri, Keith Miller, Guillaume Rocheron, Chad Wiebe & Ged Wright, coordinated by Valdone Cerniute, Ana Marie Cruz, Isabelle Fleck, Jack George, Sofus Graae, James Greig, Rachel Faith Hanson, Danny Huerta, Ashley Irving-Scott, Zafar Janjua, Woojo Jeon, Abigail Mendoza, Sarah Middleton, Sara Moore, Marlene Nehls, Max Rees & Rebecca Scott is excellent. The stunts coordinated by Damon Caro & fights coordinated by Ryan Watson is excellent.

This is an excellent and well-done, well-made reboot of the Superman saga that is entertaining and impressive. This is also an impressive film, visually and thematically. Zack Snyder has directed an excellent film, which is possibly his best film of his career, thus far. Christopher Nolan has also done an excellent job in helping revive the Superman saga. Henry Cavill is an excellent Superman / Clark Kent / Kal-El & Amy Adams is an excellent Lois Lane, with an excellent cast backing them up. This is one of the best movies of the summer season and of the year.",1371340800,12,2796,4.919491525423729
5783976,5,B00D91GRA4,"Amazing movie filled with great effects, action and acting, along with a great story. I'm a Superman comic fan, and I enjoyed the way Kal-El was portrayed. Best superhero action in a movie yet as well, I loved the fight between Kal-El and Zod, it was very intense. The actors all fit their roles very good, and did a very good job in the film.",1371340800,7,343,4.292307692307692
5783977,5,B00D91GRA4,"If you are a comic book fan or just enjoy summer blockbusters, you should enjoy this movie.  The average movie fan should ignore the negative critics.  Is it a perfect film?  No.  But what these (most critics) negative critics are forgetting is it is a summer movie, not Hamlet.  More importantly, it is Superman, not Batman!

It is not too long.  It has a fast enough pace.  It has a story (Remember its not Faulkner, but a comic story).  A compelling story.  The acting is good.  Some performances were very good (Costner, Crowe, Fishburne).  The soundtrack modern, yet moving.

Don't worry about Christian overtones or symbolism.  The religious connection was always there with Superman (Jewish and Christian), but it is a movie about the perils and rewards of humanity.  I know that many critics who disliked this film either read too much into the religious elements that are subtly there, or they hate uplifting movies, or for many critics they hate the film because they feel Snyder ruined the Watchman film.  They will deny all of this, but if you search there review histories most of them love movies that are dark, or believe in moral equivocation.  Many of these haters do not like up lifting movies.

There is a lot of science fiction elements in the film: the beginning of the film is the destruction of Krypton with a lot of incredible CGI scenes.  There are many flashbacks at the beginning which I loved.  Especially the bus scene and bully scene in front of his dad.  The last half is none stop action with an awesome and long fight that ends with something very very different than any other Superman story.  And lots of Easter eggs throughout the film.

This movie is inspiring.  It is uplifting.  It is about taking charge of your own destiny and doing the right thing!  Most  importantly its about hope!  But at the end of the day, it's just an exciting movie about a man who can fly.",1371340800,12,1906,4.625748502994012
5783978,5,B00D91GRA4,"Undoubtedly ""Man of Steel"" is the best movie of super heroes produced until today. The story is very familar and the action scenes are the best made ever. Is incredble see Superman as a man who can make smart decisions, without neglecting the emotions that make it more human than anyone around him. The casting is also spectacular, from Russell Crowe to the same Clark Kent / Superman makes the most awesome history of Superman until today.",1371340800,6,441,4.740259740259741
5783979,5,B00D91GRA4,"I usually love Hans Zimmer's soundtracks (Gladiator, Pirates of the Caribbean), but ""Man of Steel"" fell several octaves short of John Williams' Gustav Holst-isque fanfares.  We have been surrounded with the ""Superman: The Movie"" soundtrack. It gets played many times a day and we don't even notice, but we do pause and listen.  This is the missing piece for ""Man of Steel.""  It's the music that drives the movie into your blood and stirs the emotions.  The movie is great...the music let me down. Oh, yeah.  Henry Cavill and Amy Adams were awesome together, great chemistry. And, Russell Crowe delivered a solid performance. I think Kevin Costner must have been left on the cutting room floor, but he had a few intense scenes.  Diane Lane tried too hard to be a farmer's wife, but they did give her a few lines containing down-home wisdoms. The young Clark, Dylan Sprayberry, was very good.  He was able to deliver his lines with strong emotions and has beautiful eyes! Finally, don't believe the professional critics.  They never like anything that's powerful and imaginative.",1371340800,4,1077,4.944444444444445
5783980,5,B00D91GRA4,"Man Of Steel is receiving mixed reviews from critics, and I always say you cant really listen to a critic. I usually listen to what actual people have to say. I went and saw Man of Steel for myself and let me tell you just wow! It was a great film. Henry Cavill is the best Superman since Christopher Reeve, Tim Daly, George Newbern. Michael Shannon although not as good as Terrence Stamp still did a great job playing General Zod. Russell Crowe is a badass Jor-EL he kicked alot of butt in this film even as a hologram! Amy Adams is gorgeous and great as usual although she didn't have much screen time she still had pretty awesome chemistry with all the actors. Diane Lane and Kevin Costner were amazing playing their two characters. Kevin Costner had a great performance when he is about to die, you will see. Laurence Fishburne I felt was underused severly but he was still awesome when he was on the screen. I think that like it did for Chris Hemsworth and Robert Downey Jr. this will show the world what Henry Cavill and Michael Shannon can do and it will make them huge stars.

The Script-I felt the script was great and the changes the made were pretty badass and very interesting. Now some of the things I disliked about the film as Perry White was black and he refused to run something about aliens because it would cause mass panic. Perry White would never not run that story. Another thing I disliked is a tad bit of plot induced stupidity and that is Superman not knowing or having developed his freeze breath yet. He would of easily have won the fight against the machines and his fellow Kryptonians. Another thing I disliked is Jenny Olsen not being Jimmy Olsen. That is just plain freaking stupid and the actress who played Jenny Olsen was just awful and hurt the film when she was on screen. I hope they bring Jenny Olsens brother Jimmy Olsen into Man of Steel 2, etc.

Special Effects- This film had the greatest special effects I have ever seen since Terminator 2 and Avatar.

Visual Effects- I felt were very rarely done and it was nice.

Locations-I like the locations they used in this film I felt it fit the mood and tone of the film very nicely.

Direction-I have never liked a single one of Zack Snyder's films they have always been awful and same with Christopher Nolan except for Prestige, Batman Begins, Dark Knight, David Goyer, Jonathan Nolan. They all wrote a great script being honest to the source material for once and delivered the best film so far this year.

Choreography- The battles and the fight scenes in this movie are going to be hard pressed to surpass they were simply unbelievable and crazy as hell wait til you see it.

Musical Score- I felt the musical score was god awful except for some parts. They need to bring in another composer like patrick Doyle for future films.

The Future for Superman-I feel this film is going to make about 1 billion and 100 million dollars and will be used as a template to how all superhero films should be made in the future. Justice League is going to be amazing as long as Zack Snyder and company continue to stay on board for at least 6 Man of Steel films and a Justice League film.",1371340800,9,3166,4.446551724137931
5783981,5,B00D91GRA4,"First and foremost I respect the Reeve films and I even respect Singer's ""Returns"" nonetheless they were far from perfect. And now that Man Of Steel has been made I can never see myself going back to any other Superman film. Here is why:

The Cast:

Whether it be Costner or Crowe, Adams or Lane the cast was top notch and treated this Superman with respect. Did I leave out Cavill? Cavill had many doubters asking themselves ""why"" when he was cast. Though after this film's release I couldn't imagine anyone doubting him anymore. Cavill was top notch and above and beyond what I expected, he is the Man Of Steel. One could nitpick this film like many others (Star Wars, 2001, etc) but not I and in my eyes Man Of Steel is a perfect Superman film and it deserves a perfect score.

The Director:

Say what you will about Zack Snyder but he does know action and very much knows how to treat an audience visually. And despite some claiming he cannot develop character well he can. He really had a strong vision as to what David Goyer and Nolan had come up with and despite speculation well this is Snyder's baby and it was as soon as the script was in his hands. If you watched 300 or Watchmen and then Man Of Steel and still feel you must doubt him then that is to bad as he is one of Hollywood's best blockbuster directors.

The Writers:

While the screenplay was written by David Goyer, Christopher Nolan helped with the story. Both whom worked as writer/director respectively in the 'Dark Knight Trilogy"" having said that I need not say anything more. They are top notch and have proven it many times.

My review was not intended to state the obvious about the plot or give spoilers. Instead I will say that if you think you were a Superman fan before watching this just wait because once Man Of Steel is over you'll feel like a kid again. Everyone from the cast, writers, director all gave it their all and IMO made the best Superman to date.

5/5 Stars.",1371340800,10,1956,4.3988919667590025
5783982,3,B00D91GRA4,"I went to see Man of Steel. The producers had everything they needed to make a GREAT Superman movie. The guy playing him (Henry Cavill) was a great choice, and it had a really good backstory. They just forgot to have a MAIN story. There was no plot beyond the character's backstory, which the producers decided to weaken. There was a lot of senseless destruction, by means of hokey-looking computer animated special effects during the overkill of fight scenes. (I'm getting tired of these movies where they destroy everything so quickly that you can't even tell what's going on.) There was no comic relief at all, which was MUCH needed...and actually, now that I think about it, there was not a lot of dialogue throughout most of the movie, with exception of the backstory scenes.  The first half hour I was thinking to myself, ""Ok.  Good backstory.""  Then the rest of the movie I was thinking, ""Ok, we get it!  They fight!  Where's the plot that they were building up to?""

 Another gripe that I have is that they had to go and change the characters. I never get it when they do that in the movies. I mean, do they sit down and say, we have a successful franchise, so let's change everything that made it successful and ruin it. For example: let's make a Superman movie, but Lois Lane won't be anything like she has been in any previous Superman storyline, we'll make Perry White a black man with an earring, and let's not even have a Jimmy Olson. Then, Superman will just emerge on the scene with no secret identity, so there's basically no Clark Kent. (Everyone knows that much of the Superman story is how Clark struggles with wanting to be himself, but feels an obligation to be Superman to help people.) In this movie, Clark was just a name they slapped on this Super kid until he became a super man. I felt that the bond between he and his parents was very weak.

  I guess you should stop reading here if you don't want to know about any spoilers.

  The whole concept of Clark's dad dying from a heart attack has always been that he was not able to save him despite having super powers. He could save everyone else, but he couldn't save his dad.  What a waste of a great actor.  Come on, directors!  You've got Kevin Costner, and you choose NOT to have the famous ""Clark's dad dying in his arms and there's nothing he can do to save him"" scene?  Kevin Costner could have rocked that scene.  (I would have loved to know what final bit of advice he would have given Clark about him being sent here for a reason, and how he should go about doing it.)  Nah!  Let's just have him stand there and stretch his hand out towards Clark while he watches and CHOOSES not to save him.  Arrggh!  I think that is where the movie started losing me as a die-hard Superman fan.

 My biggest gripe, as a LOIS & CLARK: THE NEW ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN fan, is that they totally killed the competitive chemistry that is supposed to exist between Lois and Clark, and the humor that always resulted from Lois not knowing Clark and Superman were the same person...and he's always having to run off somewhere and try to make up a story about why he stood her up, ditched her, etc. That's the best part about the Lois and Clark romance.

 I guess I'm just disappointed. When I heard that it was being made by the same people who made the last three Batman movies (which were great and FULL of story and plot) I was excited. The previews for Man of Steel didn't look so interesting, but I figured they might just be holding back so not to spoil anything, as they had done with the Batman movies. I don't know what happened.

 The guy who played the part was a GREAT choice, so we can't blame him. And we got to see a more fleshed out Krypton for the first time, complete with alien beasts, which was really cool. It had so much potential, and I am such a Superman fan that I actually feel dirty inside by speaking badly about it, but I was let down. The movie producers who are handed a tried and true story need to be more responsible. They shouldn't have the right to put their artistic spin on it. It's an American icon, and it belongs to us, the fans. They should have an obligation to not ruin our stories that have helped to make us who we are. Go be artsy with something else, don't mess up our classics.

 I'm not saying to avoid seeing it, and maybe it's going to get better with the next movie (that it seemed to be building towards) but I don't know how they can fix the Lois and Clark thing unless she bumps her head and gets amnesia forgetting that he is Superman. But I wish I had waited for it to come out on DVD.",1371340800,10,4608,4.324418604651163
5783983,5,B00D91GRA4,"Growing up on superman comic books and being surrounded by the superman mythos i was skeptical going in to see this movie... with that being said...i couldn't have of been more wrong. I thought this iteration on superman was intriguing, interesting and exciting. It told a great story from top to bottom, the acting was superb. The scenes between Johnathen and young clark were among the stand outs and crowe as Jor-El had such a commanding presence even when off screen it was felt. Michael shannon as Zod brought mutliple demensions to the character but it was Antje traue as Faora who was the standout villain in this reboot. Henry Cavill was born to play this iconic role as the next boy in blue, he had it down to smallest nuances of the superman/clark character. The action in here was absolutely mind blowing, intense, and a roller coaster ride of excitement a bit exuasting at times however. Overall it was a solid Man of Steel despite critics and there excessive nitpicking. It is the best superman film in years since Donners 1978 classic and a gold standard for the superhero movie renaissance.",1371340800,11,1105,4.760416666666667
5783984,3,B00D91GRA4,"The curious thing about movie action is that too much of it can be boring. Such is the case with the second half of ""Man of Steel."" The first half is a decent origin story for the hero, but the second half devolves into so much mindless action that I found myself bored despite all the ""exciting"" things going on. Say what you want about 2006's ""Superman Returns,"" but it didn't make this mistake. ""Superman Returns"" had great character development and was engrossing, and more so as the story progressed. ""Man of Steel"" is the exact opposite: The more the story progressed the more detached I became.

""Man of Steel"" has a lot going for it. For one, the cast is superb. Henry Cavill is the best actor to play Superman yet, and Amy Adams (Lois), Michael Shannon (General Zod), Russell Crowe (Supe's dad) and Kevin Costner (Clark's stepdad) are all fine here, not to mention Zod's female assistant, played by Antje Traue, who steals the show!

Like the original 1978 ""Superman"" with Christopher Reeve, the sci-fi in ""Man of Steel"" is stellar, only more so. Despite this, the first half's origin tale isn't as engrossing or entertaining as the first half of the '78 version. Still, it's not bad. Things go wrong in the second half, however, where one action scene is lumped on another with top-of-the-line F/X. It's similar to the Terminator films where two or more invincible inhumans pummel each other through walls and buildings, and humans shoot billions of ineffective rounds into them, except that the first three Terminator films keep your interest (especially the first two).

FINAL WORD: So my feelings are mixed on ""Man of Steel."" In many ways it's great filmmaking, but they fumble the ball in the most important department -- an interesting story and characters you care about. They somewhat succeed in the first half, but the second half is an overload of ""exciting"" action scenes that quickly wear out their welcome and bore the viewer.

The film runs 143 minutes but seems longer.

Want to see how it detracts from a shot and ruins a movie because you are thinking more about the herky-jerky view rather than the scene, see this movie.
PLEASE GET A CLUE and stop ruining what could have been a very fun movie.
Script and characters very good for what it is, unfortunately they couldn't overcome the pathetically amateur work of the director and production staff (it looks like something my mom shot). Don't agree, then explain how when the dog is running out to greet Clark in the driveway, we need a shaky camera that takes the emphasis away from the Americana moment and places it onto the production method.

5783987,5,B00D91GRA4,"A sole survivor of the doomed planet Krypton grows up on Earth and discovers he has abilities far beyond those of mortal men. Once grown, he sets off to find out who he is and where he comes from. The answer is discovered in a spaceship in the arctic and Krypton's last son, Kal-El--Clark Kent--meets a hologram of his long-dead father, Jor-El, who reveals to him his destiny: a beacon of hope for humanity, and also one who could one day restore the doomed Kryptonian race.

Enter Zod, a harsh general and one who has fought his whole life to protect Krypton and its people. During an altercation with Jor-El he finds out that Jor-El has sent his newborn son off world and along with the child plans for Kryptonian's future. A battle ensues and Zod is sent off planet, too, him and his cohorts banished to the Phantom Zone for rehabilitation. When Krypton explodes, the containment units holding Zod and his followers release them and he spends the next thirty-three years combing the stars, searching for Jor-El's son.

Locating Kal-El on Earth, Zod sends an ultimatum to the planet, forcing Kal-El to reveal himself to the humans and to stop Zod from using Earth as ground zero for a new Krypton. Zod, like Kal-El, is now powered by the Earth's yellow sun and is empowered with superabilities. An enormous battle ensues between Krypton's general and Kal-El, the fate of the Earth hanging in the balance.

What can I say? This movie is mind blowing! It's epic, it's incredible. So much was riding on this film to deliver a Superman movie that would captivate audiences and restore the Man of Steel to his rightful place as king of the superheroes. Man of Steel does just that and then some, bringing with it the awesome sci-fi factors of Star Wars to the dense storytelling of The Dark Knight Trilogy.

There has never, ever been a superhero movie like this before. Henry Cavill as Superman nailed the part. He's a nice guy, a caring guy, but he's dead serious about doing the right thing and exudes the confidence that only one who has sold himself out for the good of all can portray. He did something that was never done before by any other Superman actor: showing Clark Kent before he was Superman or even the bumbling reporter of the Daily Planet. (I'm referring to the movies, not Smallville). In fact, he's this version of Clark Kent for nearly the whole movie. You can see him making the big decisions, weighing his upbringing against this new task of saving the world that was suddenly dropped on his lap. You journey along with him as he wrestles with his being different and how those differences apply to not just his life, but the lives of others. As Superman, he's the Superman. I never thought Christopher Reeve's performance could be outdone, but Henry Cavill matches, if not exceeds, what Mr. Reeve brought to the character. Cavill's Superman is one hundred percent devoted to staying true to who he is, his abilities, his upbringing, his quest for truth and justice, and for putting his foot down both with men and rebel Kryptonians when needed. I can't really comment on his reporter Clark persona because that's not a big role in this movie. I hope, however, it will be in the sequel and we'll see plenty of Lois and Clark interaction in the next one, especially after the way the Lois and Clark relationship is portrayed in this movie. You'll have to see for yourself to see what I mean.

Michael Shannon as Zod was crazy good. The guy can act and his Zod is much different than Terrence Stamp's. Yes, both are ruthless, but whereas Stamp's Zod was more about power grabbing and his desire to rule, Shannon's is about giving it his all to restore the former glory of Krypton at any cost, even if that means eradicating all of Earth's population to do it. The best villain is always the villain you accidently find yourself rooting for, and that happened to me throughout this movie. Every so often I felt for Zod and understood what he was trying to accomplish. It made sense and made me consider that maybe if I was in his shoes I would've done the same thing or something similar.

Amy Adams as Lois Lane was a good choice. I wasn't sure at first, as I know Amy Adams as more of a happy-go-lucky girl from other movies far removed from the superhero genre--though she was in one episode of Smallville during its first season--but she sold me on the part and she reminded of the Lois Lanes from the old cartoons: warm, but cut and dry. Funny, but serious about what she does and her desire to go the distance to get a story.

The action in this movie was crazy huge. The bar has been set so high in terms of superhero cinema in recent years and Man of Steel makes every superhero movie that's come before it look like a puppet show in comparison. The wide-scale destruction wrought by Superman and Zod--never mind Zod's right-hand-woman Faora and the other rebel Kryptonians--is what you'd expect if people with god-like powers let loose in an all-out brawl across a city. And the speed, man, the speed! Normally super speed is shown as either a big blur or done in slo-mo, with the super speedsters moving quickly while everyone else is frozen. In this one, you see Superman et al. zipping around, pausing, breaking sound barriers, and bringing the viewer along as if we're in his shoes the whole time and experiencing the thrill of super speed ourselves. The way Superman flies in this is unlike any other portrayal before, and while I loved how he flies in the other movies and TV shows, in this one he seems to hurl himself through the air at times, while at others flies with precision and care. The heat vision effect in this was stellar. The glow beneath the skin around the eyes and to see the veins beneath its surface made it all the more menacing. The super hearing and X-ray vision were familiar territory to those who've watched Smallville, but there was no all-out X-ray vision where everything is dark blue and white.

The fighting between Superman and Zod was serious business and was truly a portrayal of two warriors going toe-to-toe and not just wrestling or tapping each other. It was one crazy hard blow after another, some slow, some rapid, even some in the sky! Insane! So many times I was blown away and just going wow, wow, wow! Zod fought the skill of a trainer warrior, whereas Superman fought with brute force.

Man of Steel is a crazy good movie with a strong story, an incredible cast, and superhero action that has now become the benchmark for anything to follow. To be honest, I don't know if it can be followed. Hopefully in Man of Steel 2.

5783989,5,B00D91GRA4,"I've been at a loss to understand people before, but never more so than after watching this film.  Why RT only gives it a 57% is a question I cannot even begin to answer.

Man of Steel is the first Superman movie that's worthy of the character it portrays.  Everything about it, including the story line, the scenes, the action, the character development, and everything else is truly epic in scale.  Forget Gene Hackman in a toupee trying to drive up real estate prices.  This time the enemy is an invader from the stars who wants to wipe out humanity - and he can do it.

This time Clark is so overwhelmed by the power within him that he spends years trying to figure out what to do with it. This time we have a noble yet tormented soul, who struggles with the voices calling him in a thousand different directions all at once.

In short, this time we have an epic, which is exactly what the life story of an ultra-powerful messianic figure should be.  No corniness, no silliness, no flying around the earth to make time go backwards.  Oh, and no supposedly intelligent people fooled about his identity by a pair of glasses (I always hated that in the comic books).

And Superman is no naive boy scout.  He has what musicians call ""mileage.""  That makes him all the more believable, sympathetic, and human.  Simply put, this movie is outstanding on all levels, and I will never understand why anyone would disagree with that analysis.",1371254400,11,1436,4.5408560311284045
5783990,4,B00D91GRA4,"10 years ago a movie by the name of Hulk came out and I being just a young boy was ecstatic. But once I saw the movie, I was disappointed. Similarily, in 2006 a movie called Superman Returns came out; however, once I viewed it, I again found myself disappointed. Alas, came the year 2008 a movie called The Incredible Hulk was released and finally it was everything I wanted (and more) the first time. Then on June 14th, 2013 came a day like no other. A movie entitled: Man Of Steel was released and after watching it, I was emotionally/extremely satisfied.

(November 17,2013 Update after blu-ray purchase)

When I wrote the review for Man of Steel back in June, I was excited, and admittedly overwhelmed. I was also determined to give a perfect review; but in having those feelings, I now realize made me rush my review. And that was not my intention. After watching the blu-ray, I felt the need to re-write and give a new score and apologize for giving a rushed review. To those of you who have followed my reviews from the start, I do apologize. And for your consideration, here are my thoughts on Man of Steel.

Actor Henry Cavill stars as Superman. I have seen Henry Cavill in an episode or two of The Tudors and also remember seeing him in the movie Immortals. He does possess a rather diverse, yet sensible acting ability so he is a great choice for Superman.

The Story in this movie: to describe it or rather compare it to other great comic book movies: It shares common traits found in the movie Thor, but with a darker and more serious tone, combined with some elements of Batman Begins. That being said, This movie undeniably flies with style.

There have been complaints made about there being TOO much action in Man of Steel; but that was one of my main issues with Superman Returns, there not being enough, if ANY action in the movie. I don't feel it was that big of an issue. One of the many good things that you will notice in Man of Steel is the music. For every punch, every scene of Superman taking flight the music that plays fits perfectly with those scenes. Zack Snyder, well what can i say. The minute I heard he would be the director of this film, I knew I would get two things: great visuals, and detailed action sequences. And you do get both in Man of Steel. And with that, we get a Superman movie that digs deep into the mythos. I was actually shocked at how deep the story is in this movie. I am also happy that Christopher Nolan had a helping hand as the producer of this movie. As a whole once the movie was over, I felt relieved. The same feeling I felt after watching the 2008 reboot The Incredible Hulk, is the same feeling I had after viewing this movie. DC has not had the best filmography as of late (except for the Nolan Batman movies), but Man of Steel is definitely an excellent way to give DC fans hope excitement/anticipation for more heroes like Aquaman, Flash, etc. to get their own movies. Man Of Steel did not exceed my expectations, but it met them by a big margin. GO SEE/BUY MAN OF STEEL.

This long awaited movie gets a score of:

4 Stars

Henry Cavill: Clark Kent/Superman
Russell Crowe: Jor-El
Kevin Costner: Jonathan Kent
Amy Adams: Lois Lane
Laurence Fishburne: Perry White

5783991,1,B00D91GRA4,"Now growing up there's a popular lesson that i grew up with and that is ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"", there are so many things that are wrong with this movie but before that i'll start with the good thing's. In this re-imagining or remake they seem to have finally outdone them themselves by changing the look of the ""S"" which i liked so much better than the previous routh ""S"" of 2006 and they also added in a few alterations to the sides and waist of the cavill suite which gives it a little alien touch which was awesome. Although i'm not too bothered by the case of the missing iconic red pants giving director snyder reasons for not having them in this release so guess i'll let him have this one but that was it, that was the only good thing about this movie period.
Now for the bad things wrong with this movie when a new film struggles to be a blockbuster you should already know by now that there's a problem and the problem was that this movie completely screwed up and basically pulled a ""smallville"" by changing everything and messing up some major superman canon, it was NOT the dc universe or for that matter have any true superman mythology implicated in this garbage flick. There is a reason that certain things are put in place and when that's out of the window all is lost, and why all of a sudden do they have to darken the colors of superman's cloth to fit this ""dark knight"" image persona superman after all he is a force for good and is the reason why he's clothes are bright and what also happened to ""truth and justice in the american way"". All through out the time when cavill becomes superman let's not forget they also have him do a lot of collateral damage when in actuality superman refrains from doing such things knowing people could get hurt which i recall is part of superman's fighting technique ""preserve life at all cost"". Superman i'm afraid is no longer an american hero and instead is trying to be turned into this anti cult hero like spawn, guyver, batman or even deathstroke and has been botched by the masses and the idiotic entertainment industry - R.I.P Superman
In the end when it comes down to it, i wouldn't recommend this movie to any REAL superman fans especially those who have read the comics let alone those who know very little and would like to expand their knowledge on the character. To those who wanna learn more about superman i would recommend the first 2 ""alexander & illya salkind"" movies with christopher reeve or if you want to see a much more updated version of a superman movie then watch ""superman returns"" of 2006 it fared much better...even though that movie doesn't offer a whole lot it still is the latest movie that is canon to the superman mythology.",1371254400,20,2726,4.454
5783992,2,B00D91GRA4,"Someone on IMDB said that those who read the Superman comics tend to like this film and those who don't are the ones who don't like it. I'd say that's very accurate in my case, as I've never read a comic in my life, and I don't care for this movie at all. I am much more a fan of the Reeve movies, which this has absolutely nothing in common with, making it much like the Star Trek series reboot.

Some think that those of us who liked the older movies more just wanted a lot of camp in the new one. But for me, that couldn't be further from the truth. In fact, I hated the camp in the older movies. But the superman of old had a charisma about him that is completely missing here. In Superman (1978), we get a chance to get to know the character a little before the plot shifts into full gear.  In MoS, he puts on the cape, barely has time to learn how to fly, and then Zod shows up. From that point on (about halfway through), the movie basically becomes a non-interactive video game that pretty much doesn't stop until the end. You can tell that he's not yet comfortable in the suit, and the humans don't even know if he means to do them harm.

When the fight between superman and the bad guys starts, you will see them get thrown about and plow right through buildings and completely rip up the streets until they finally skid to a halt. And I was actually impressed the first couple of times this happens. But after it happens a couple more dozen times, I found myself glancing at my watch, wondering when it was going to end, and getting a headache because the soundtrack is LOUD, and they had dragged it on entirely too long. There is a point where you can have too much of a good thing in this regard. (Oh, and of course you're going to see the military get involved, who are virtually useless.)

Probably the most disturbing thing about it is all the destruction that happens as a result of these fights. You'd think superman would try to draw the fight away from the city in order to avoid as much loss of life as possible, but nope. This version of superman doesn't appear to care one way or the other.  Fans of MoS would say that 'this is the comic book version of superman, not the Reeve version.' Well, apparently then, the comic book superman is kind of a jerk with little regard for human life, whom I really don't care to root for. But the biggest problem is at the end, when he appears overly concerned with the fate of one family, we're supposed to feel his anguish over the decision he has to make, but the filmmakers apparently want us to forget that this comes right after the fight he just had with the villains probably killed thousands of people.

In the end, if you went to see the Star Trek reboot in 2009 and ended up angry that you got Star Wars instead, you might have a similar reaction to this film. It isn't Star Wars, but it isn't Superman either. It's more like Independence Day. So, you have been warned :P",1371254400,10,2942,4.244642857142857
5783993,5,B00D91GRA4,"Let me begin by saying I am a Superfan. I've read as many Superman comics as I can get my hands on, seen all the cartoons and sat through the ups and downs of ten seasons of Smallville. So I have very specific expectations of Superman on film, and a have a very specific idea of what the character is supposed to be like.

This movie delivered.

Any who have read Superman: Earth One by J. Michael Strazynski will notice some similarities in the approach this movie takes with the character and the storytelling. Superman is forced to come out of hiding thanks to an ill-timed alien invasion, and the propulsive action and the reflective soul-searching play nicely beside one another. The movie has an edge and moves quickly.

Henry Cavill is perfect as Superman, his anger and frustration and confusion at being alone on earth is deliciously underplayed. Some have stated that he is humorless. This is far from the truth. Lois is around to bring that humor out of him, and help him on his journey, just as it is in the comics. The movie does well to jettison the dated notion that Clark's glasses fool Lois, and the movie is all the better for it.

As for the villains, Faora and Zod, while both very different from one another, are amazing. Faora is a vicious warrior, Zod a calculating tactician, and both are played well by their respective actors. It is amazing to finally see Superman come up against villains that are able to hold their own against him.

*SPOILER ALERT*
The fanboy in me was also given quite the treat when Lois meets Jor-el, and the two wreak havoc on an alien vessel in order to rescue Superman. It's nice to finally see Lois be something more than a distraction to the Man of Steel.
*END SPOILER ALERT*

The thing that really sold the film for me, though, was the shocking moment in the film's finale (people who have seen this will know exactly what I'm talking about). While it IS truly shocking and never before seen in a Superman film, there is precedence for it in the comic book, specifically in John Byrne's run on Superman during the 80's. Said moment is climactic, unavoidable, heartbreaking and tragic. I was floored.

If you are a longtime fan of Big Blue, and want to see a movie about him taken seriously, with heavy emotional weight and stunning action, then SEE THIS FILM. You will not be disappointed.",1371254400,9,2344,4.566666666666666
5783994,2,B00D91GRA4,"If I disliked certain things about the movie, I absolutely hated the Blu Ray. What destroyed any chance of me enjoying it is that the image is stretched horizontally, so everything is distorted. Everyone has a fat face. Lois's nose is five feet long. Add to that, it is horrendously grainy, shaky, and dark. Everyone has dark patches on their faces as if suffering from some skin disease. Everyone has gigantic pores on their faces.

And people are right, this guy is not superman. He is mean-spirited, moody, he is a cold-blooded killing machine. If you can fly and nothing can hurt you, wouldn't you be a bit more chilled and relaxed? The guy in the movie does not bring joy and hope to people, I would be frightened of this guy. He lacks the essence of Superman, he is NOT Superman.

To Zack Snyder: no one wants to be tortured by your shaky cam. I will never see another Zack Snyder movie as long as I live. That's a promise.",1371254400,7,929,4.426900584795321

One of my concerns before going in was the casting. However, soon after the film started, those concerns were put to rest. Another aspect I was impressed by was the dialogue. Flawless, IMO. Lastly, the action is the best I have ever seen. Definitely the icing on the Superman cake! This film made me feel like a kid again and 24-hours after seeing this film, I am still beaming with joy! This is easily a Day-One buy for me and I will thoroughly enjoy it for years to come.",1371254400,9,614,4.491071428571429
5783996,4,B00D91GRA4,"So, let's get this out of the way. (Insert knee-jerk ""not helpful"" vote here.) Is Superman a Christ-figure? The answer is, yes, of course. But it's not the fault of the movie - it's always been that way. Alien sent to earth by father, takes on the nature of a human being, but he's still much more than that, etc. etc. ... that's part of the Superman mythos. Sure, there's the cross-pose in space, and he ""descends into Hades"", and so on, in this movie. But just because it retells themes of The Greatest Story, doesn't mean it can't be fun. And, generally, it is.

On the flip side, it also exposes the dark side of Darwinism - the conclusion that the strong should rule the weak. That's exactly what Hitler based his holocaust upon, and the historical records show it. Hitler sought to exterminate the Church because the Nazis considered her care for the weak ""effete"" and ""anti-evolutionistic"". Darwin himself lamented that ""We civilized men, on the other hand, do our utmost to check the process of elimination. We build asylums for the imbecile, the maimed and the sick; we institute poor-laws; and our medical men exert their utmost skill to save the life of every one to the last moment. ... Thus the weak members of civilized societies propagate their kind. No one who has attended to the breeding of domestic animals will doubt that this must be highly injurious to the race of man."" This is a sentiment echoed aloud by the bad guys here.

Well, I think they erred on making Clark so buffed. It takes away from his ""ordinariness"" on the human side. But the other parts and ideas of the reboot are interesting. His weakness is no longer Kryptonite, for example, but something that makes a bit more sense. Couldn't explain the flying, but then again, no one can.

Interesting questions are posed. Should he let a bus of kids drown? His dad gives us an answer that makes us uneasy. Krypton has abandoned ""natural"" birth, opting for programmed traits a al ""Brave New World"" where everyone's job is determined. This is contrasted to our own vision of individual choice. Zod's anguish at the end when his life-purpose is destroyed is also disquieting. And raises questions regarding what it means to be human and the nature of idolatry - centering your life around something that will, in the end, betray you.

This film is epic in the way ""Thor"" should have been, instead of being played out in some dinky town. But in the last part of the movie, there were WAAAAAAY too many explosions and general destruction. I understand why they did it - it had to be a big battle - but after a while it just became numbing (boom boom boom crash etc.). And the final act with Zod was strangely muted.

There are great visuals and effects, and Jor-El is much more prominent here, in a welcome way. The Krypton tech seems a bit klunky to us viewers used to looking at colorful displays, but that's aliens for you.

The logic of the hapless Krypton council also seems hokey. Surely they could have seen their destruction coming and escaped. And surely some of their outposts could have begun supporting themselves. But that's the setup. Just go with it.

Some critics complained that Lois and Clark didn't click. It didn't seem that way to me.

The last line was pretty good.

All in all, enjoyable and spectacular, but for the mind-numbing destruction marathon, which could have been 20 minutes shorter. 3.5 stars would be more accurate.",1371254400,4,3427,4.6512396694214875
5783997,2,B00D91GRA4,"We seem to be living in an age where writers/producers/directors of big summer movies, especially superhero movies, want so badly to jump on the ""super gritty, realistic, real world"" fad of the last several years, that they make movies that the audiences have to endure until the end, instead of being entertained by and filled with joy and excitement by the end. This being the 2010s (or whatever you want to call it), it seems uncool for these movies (and other things) to have that sense of awe and wonder and pure popcorn joy that going to these movies used to have. Now, it has to be super realistic, gritty, angsty, etc. To be in the real world. Well, I live in the real world, and I want to go to these movies, especially a ""Superman"" movie, to get away from reality for 2 hours. Needless to say, I was not a fan of the movie, despite some excellent work. When I first heard of the movie and the people involved, I feared for what it might be. And that's what it turned out to be.

The story, such as it is, deals with a lot of the backstory/origin of Kal-El/Clark Kent/Superman. I don't want to say too much or go into anything at length here about the movie, but we all get the gist. There is a battle on Krypton and Jor-El (Russell Crowe) sends his only son, Kal-El, on a ship to earth. We see through flashbacks (in a jarring and out of touch style) how Clark was raised by the Kents ( the strong Kevin Costner and Diane Lane, in the only parts of the movie that seem to have anything resembling heart and warmth) in Smallville. About an hour in, Clark dons the famous suit (but don't you dare utter the name 'Superman'), and General Zod (Michael Shannon) comes a calling, looking for something that Jor-El had shipped with Kal-El to earth. It then boils down to a battle royale that, at first impressive, becomes repetitive and as hollow and clinical as the worst ""Transformers"" movie. I don't want to say much more than the basics. Leave the rest to you actually seeing it.

Henry Cavill certainly looks good in the part and can fill out the suit nicely, but that's about it. His Super-, uh, I mean, his Kal-El is pretty robotic and one note, not showing much of any emotion other than sour and seriousness. None of the appealing charm or wit is here. Out of all the actors to play the role on film or TV ( I have personally been through 5 previously), Cavill's is the least likeable and relatable, with a cold distachment to boot. Writer David Goyer says he wanted to make Superman more realistic and in the real world. So, that means cold and joyless? Everything that is Superman, that has made him the character for all these years, is stripped away. They want to make him relatable, but I found it more relatable in any given episode of ""Smallville"". There isn't much to say about the rest of the cast either. They all do what they can with the material, but really, this movie belongs to the action and CGI. There isn't enough material for Amy Adams' Lois Lane for her to bring anything to the role other than just showing up. The chemistry between the two is also non-existent. Hopefully, the expected sequel will atually give this wonderful actress a real part, and amp up the romance and chemistry, which is pretty much a cold fish here. Shannon as Zod is insane, but also way over the top.  I guess shouting makes you real evil. The only ones here I thought did a real portrayal were Kevin Costner and Diane Lane as the Kents. Those are the best moments of the movie, and one would of wished the whole movie was with them in Smallville.

There is action a plenty in the massive destruction/overly CGI way that it gets to the point of being ""been there, done that"". It just becomes two super powerful guys slamming into each other and buildings. It gets old fast and loses any and all impact. Sublety and nuance is not something Zack Snyder seems to strive for here....or ever, really. It's a noisy movie that is noisy for the sake of being noisy. The loud music doesn't help. Composer Hans Zimmer is a wonderful artist. He has done a lot of good work, but there is nothing here. It's just typical action movie music to go along with the noise on screen. Honestly, I am having a hard time even remembering the music now.

In the end, ""The Man Of Steel"" is a very modern superhero movie in the Christopher Nolan mold. Super serious and dark because, as you know, life is serious and dark with no joy or happiness, at least according to Nolan and Goyer. It's a style that has grown rapidly old. It's gotten to the point where it doesn't seem much fun to be the hero anymore or to watch them. Can't we have a Superman movie that is relatable and fun but without all the seriousness? Is that really too much to ask? Can't we have fun? Oh, that's right. I forgot. It's the modern age where that kind of thing is frowned upon. A soulless, joyless, noise machine that Michael Bay could direct in his sleep. It truly appears that the party is over.",1371254400,15,4961,4.393906420021763
5783998,5,B00D91GRA4,"After hearing numerous bad reviews of this film, from Rotten Tomatoes to channels on my Sirius radio, I was flabbergasted. The trailers looked so cool. But I knew that I've seen many a movie where the trailer looked so good, but the film wasn't.

Was it possible that Man of Steel was going to be the same?

I loved Zak Snyder's 300, and his previous zombie movie remake of Dawn of the Dead. But his Sucker Punch left me high and dry. (Even though the numerous dream action sequences were awesome!)

So, with hopeful and high expectations, I went to see Zak's re-imagining of Superman last night - and I was blown away! (As was my wife and son, as well as the other four people we went with, ranging in age from kid, teen and adults, both male and female. All of them loved it, too!

So there ya go film critics. Again, you got it all wrong.

This is quite easily director Zak Snyder's most ambitious and biggest film of his career - and his best!

Take note Hollywood! Even though your industry is banking on teens and tweens to go to the movies to make you your money - us adults still go to the movies too! Especially when you make them like this.",1371254400,22,1150,4.276497695852535
5783999,5,B00D91GRA4,"Seventy five years ago this month, Jerry Siegel and Joe Schuster brought The Man of Steel into the world through DC Comics. Today (appropriately) on Flag Day, the first, the best imagined superhero of all time has been reintroduced to the world by director Zack Snyder, writer David Goyer, producer Christopher Nolan and personified in the perfect embodiment of Henry Cavill. ...For those wary of long reviews, here's the condensed version: WOW!!

Upon watching ""Captain America the First Avenger"" two years ago, I declared it to be the best superhero movie ever made. That sentiment remained a year later after watching ""The Avengers."" No question it was FUN - magnificently made sheer escapist fantasy but it wasn't more than that. It lacked its predecessor's heart. Well, ""Man of Steel"" combines the nonstop action and state of the art special effects of The Avengers with the soul and spirit of The First Avenger (which Captain America borrowed from Superman). Here's how:

- It doesn't pull any punches... Almost every aspect of this film is Academy Award worthy. While I agree that Christopher Nolan is a very competent and interesting film maker, I've always found his work muddled where the special effects take over the storytelling resulting in minimal depth and often confusing the story told. His talents were better served here in a hands off approach. I commend him for his decision to turn over creative control to Zack Snyder who clearly owns this film together with Cavill. These two men carried the initial premise of a one of a kind child born to an extraordinary couple from a race of extraordinary beings to its logical conclusion without ever flinching. There's one particular scene toward the end that made me cry like a baby for a good five minutes. It's a powerful scene in a film full of powerful scenes. I read a preliminary review a few days ago criticizing this film for lacking humanity. Now that I've seen it for myself, I couldn't disagree more. In that one scene, not only did I feel Superman's humanity but I think I understand now what it must be like for an American soldier when he/she takes up arms to defend all they love from those who promise to destroy it. The extraordinary price they pay for their patriotism and commitment is heartbreaking.

- This film answers the question of which is the real man and which is the disguise... The truth is that there is no disguise. Kal-El, Clark Kent, Superman - they're all facets of the same man - all real in the context of different aspects of his life and experience. And for those who roll their eyes at the idea of a simple pair of glasses serving as a ""disguise"" ... you try it some time. You'd be surprised at how many people are willing to dismiss someone from extraordinary contention if they consistently keep themselves to behind the scenes work, don't behave in a flamboyant or even assertive manner, they don't announce everything they do and say and don't make themselves the story on social media or anywhere else. Yes. There are still people who value their privacy. Thankfully, as long as they don't show off anything that might be coveted by others, most people are very much willing to let them continue in anonymity.

- Henry Cavill's performance is Perfect... I don't use this word lightly. Before today, George Reeves from the 1950's ""Adventures of Superman"" was my favorite Clark Kent and Christopher Reeve from the late 70's/80's movies was my favorite Superman. Cavill not only matches them in caliber but surpasses them in presence and personification. He is STRONG in every way. The love he oozes throughout the film makes him that much more powerful. With Snyder's guidance (similarly like Gerard Butler in ""300"") he walks the fine line of being vulnerable without ever seeming corny or weak. Besides having Kirk Alyn's earnestness, George Reeves' intelligence, Christopher Reeve's strength, Dean Cain's charm, Brandon Routh's charisma and Tom Welling's delectable handsomeness, Henry Cavill brings passion to the role -something that was sorely lacking all these years. (Welling did exude passion in Smallville  season 9 but in season 10 he was only able to sustain passion in his scenes with Lois Lane.) Cavill seems to try hard but it's difficult to accept he'd ever fall in love with a version of Lois who is so unattractive. So, as I predicted after watching the final two minutes of ""Smallville"" two years ago, no couple will ever surpass the perfect combustible on screen chemistry of Tom Welling and his partner in their combined portrayal of Lois and Clark. Durance stated that she'll never again play Lois Lane without Welling in the lead and I suspect Welling has privately made the same decision. Their commitment to each other is admirable but it is a shame we'll never see Cavill's Clark with Durance's Lois. Honestly though, the ultimate dream team up would be Cavill and Phyllis Coates (from Adventures of Superman) who remains my favorite Lois Lane.

I wasn't much of a fan of any of the supporting players before this. I particularly didn't care for Russell Crowe or Kevin Costner but by their second and third scenes, respectively, I actually forgot their previous work and accepted them as Superman's two fathers. Laurence Fishburne was really good as Perry White. I didn't mind the actress who played Ma Kent as much as I thought I might and all the Krypton and armed forces actors were excellent. Hans Zimmer music was inspired - it fit Cavill's portrayal. Surprisingly, I didn't miss John Williams' signature piece. And by the way, there are countless ""Easter eggs"" paying homage to previous Superman renditions. For example, one of the times Superman saves Lois, they land in a Kansas corn field - exactly where Lois first meets Kal-El in ""Smallville"" - only she was saving him in that version. Also, the way Jor-El and Lara launch their baby to Earth is very similar to ""Superman the Animated Series"" and the 1948 ""Superman"" theatrical serial.

July 4, 2013 UPDATE: Saw this film again yesterday but in IMAX. It was really loud(!) but most everything else was as I remembered except ... This time I found myself annoyed by the actress who played Superman's Girl Friday ... she's almost as bad as the one in ""Superman Returns"" (but at least that one sort of looked the part after they put that long, dark, curly wig on her). Perhaps I didn't really pick up on it the first time because I was so focused on the main character but she was seriously miscast. Clark's partner needs to be his mortal female mirror image: tall, dark and beautiful with a temperament and physicality to match her traditional upbringing by a four star general to make her action scenes believable. Here, she just looked like a short, red-head little kid (with wrinkles) playing in her mom's high heels and holding a toy ray gun. She's a full nine years older than Cavill and looks it, too! Zack Snyder made a huge mistake when he hired her. It's too bad Snyder's taste in women has taken a nose dive much like Christopher Nolan's in the ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy. You'd think they're both now allergic to beautiful women! Regardless, I found myself inspired by Henry Cavill even more this second time around.

For Henry Cavill in particular, Congratulations. ... And for The Man of Steel, himself ... Happy Birthday! Three quarters of a century and counting ... he still stands for Truth, Justice and the American Way. Thank God for it.",1371168000,20,7447,4.826155050900548

I don't know why people are looking so hard into this movie to the point that many folks are ripping on it or disappointed.  First Henry Cavill is the perfect Superman, I don't care what anyone else wants to say about Christopher Reever.  Reever was great for his time...but Cavill is the man when you compare them both.  His physique alone is Superman.  No other actor has ever looked the part like him.  Second---Superman is the first and greatest.  He's the most powerful.  Shouldn't the threat to him also be of a large magnitude....instead of some crazy dude that wants more real estate (Previous Superman Films)?  Superman deserves an Epic threat, epic battles, epic scenery.....epic everything.  It makes no sense to watch a Superman movie where he is not shown in his full glory.  All the previous versions did not really show him unleashed.  They were somewhat comical as well.  When you see this movie...you have to watch it and think ""How would people react if this dude actually appeared today"".  Superman finally gets to show his stuff in this movie...and some people are upset because he is not cracking lame public safety messages like ""Use your seatbelt..and flying is still the safest form of transportation"", or saving a cute little cat from a tree, etc. etc.  Really bad people with his same powers come to earth to reform it into Krypton.  What would you do to them if you had superman's powers?  Would you talk them to death....or if you had to..would you unleash and do what you had to do?  This movie ROCKS.  It does not stop it's momentum and you are glued to your seat.  When yo watch this movie, you can't think of any other version of it like the Christopher Reeve Superman.  You can't compare it to anything else because this is the beginning, just like Batman begins.  Think of how the Batman movies where so well explainned as to how it could happen.  Well again...think of how people would react if he appeared in today's society...and given the threat represented towards earth...what would you do in order to save your family and the whole planet?

Man Of Steel, Warner Brothers last attempt at putting superman on the big screen and doing it right. With alot riding on this movie including the DC franchise this movie tries to bring superman to the 21st century as they are beginning to fall behind of Marvel in their successes. Did it deliver? There is very little to not love about this movie.

all I can say is that Henry Cavil delivered big time. I am not going to say anything that takes place in the movie but I will say that It is visually stunning, crisp and packed full of action that is needed for a superman movie. The backstory of clark is done very well and the action is superb. For those who complained and felt that superman returns was terrible, don't worry this is nothing like it. This takes superman to all new heights and delivers with a bang. A must watch and must own for any superman lover. Cannot wait for the sequel which is already underway. The only complains that I have heard is that it has changed superman too much from the Christopher Reeves superman we have all seen. I was never a fan of those superman movies as I found them to be too cheesy for my taste but I read the comics and watched the cartoons so I had no issues with this movie in any way.

Excellent movie 10/10",1371168000,18,1314,4.269076305220883

  The movie begins on the planet Krypton. Jor-El (Russell Crowe) is awaiting his wife, Lara Lor-Van (Ayelet Zurer), to give birth to their newborn baby. It is a son and he is named ""Kal-El"".
  Later, General Zod (Michael Shannon), kills the Kryptonian Council. Jor-El swims into the Genesis Chamber and obtains a skull that has the codex to continue the Kryptonian race. This is exactly what the evil, General Zod is after because he wants the power.
  Knowing himself and his wife will not survive the destruction of Krypton, he puts his newborn son in a spaceship with the codex. The spaceship lands in Smallville, Kansas. Kal-El is found by Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner) and Martha Kent (Diane Lane).
  That is all I'm going to tell you. You will have to buy this DVD to find out the rest.

 After you see this movie, you will want to be Superman too.

May be the first time we see Superman with chest hair poking over his suit.

 Some people think they see a very subtle image of Christopher Reeve's face in a few frames of film. Henry Cavill morphs into Reeve done by CGI-effects. It is too quick to be inconclusive. We will have to wait until the DVD release to see it better.

5784004,5,B00D91GRA4,"Let me say right away that I am fan, so if you imagine that there may be some bias about this film, you'll be right.  As much as I enjoy the work done by Zack Snyder and Christopher Nolan I am, first and foremost, a fan of Superman the character.  Beyond the super powers and god like awe that surrounds the character, he is inherently a symbol for the potential good of the human race.  He represents the best of both his worlds and acts as a guide for others.  Superman is often referred to as the ""constant boy scout"".  It's easier to understand when you truly see the kind of temperament and control he exhibits on a nearly constant basis.  When faced with adversity how easy would it be for him to destroy his opponent in the blink of an eye, and yet he refrains from doing so.  He is a symbol for all that we can achieve, good and bad.  In some ways he is the embodiment of hope; hope for the future, hope for the world, and hope in our own personal lives.  So, when I say that I am a fan I mean to say that this film held high expectations for me and I am glad to say that this film not only met my expectations but exceeded them.

It's difficult to compare comics and movies to one another.  They are different animals, and because of that, require different things.  For those of you who are fans of the comics it may be best to show that this film has an extremely similar vibe to the ""Earth One"" story presented a few years back.  It is a reboot that while fresh and rewarding for the casual viewer truly gives back to the fans.  It's worth mentioning that I believe a movie based on a comic book should remain faithful to its original material it also needs to separate itself and be its own thing.  Thankfully that is the case with the ""Man of Steel"".  The Nolan brothers' screenplay brought to life by Zack Snyder is a wonderful homage to past material while remaining original in its own way.  The very human aspect brought to the character removes some of the awe that may separate us from him and  witnessing the struggle he deals with in understanding his two sides is the needed heart thread that grounds the film.  The characters, most of which, are easily picked out by fans of the comics are played by some rather extraordinary actors and actresses.  You can tell by the quality of actors how serious Warner Bros. was about making this a legitimate project.  I could mention each one in particular and yet somehow I feel as though it doesn't do justice to the ensemble as a whole.  Each person fits their character in a natural way and one of the things that I found myself enjoying about the film is that not one person overshadows another, they are each a piece of the puzzle that fits well into the mold.

Another important facet to any Zack Snyder film is the look and feel of the film.  While the film itself is grounded in many ways due to the wonderful cast it is hard to forget just how magnificent this movie looks at times.  While each shot is truly worthy of a movie still the action scenes are the stuff of legend.  Remember that awe I spoke of surrounding the character of Superman?  This is where it shines.  Snyder is able to envision Superman and his battles in a way that captures the eyes and truly keeps us glued to the screen.  The movie has a somber low tone visually, with most of the colors subdued, but when given the opportunity to for action the screen suddenly shines and explodes.  For much of the movie I had pure goosebumps traveling up and down my spine.  So, if there are any reservations you have about buying this film on blu-ray, get rid of those right now.  You'd be doing yourself a disservice buying it on another format. Thankfully, like the ""Batman"" trilogy Nolan is so well known for, there are a few moments among the drama and action for humor, so it's not a horribly dry film without levity.  Also, the amazing Hans Zimmer has lent his talents to this film and truly created a soundtrack befitting the movie.  I'd like to point out that any time Hans Zimmer is part of a film I get a bit excited but when it was officially announced that he would do the score for this film I was eager to hear how he would pull it.  The movie moves seamlessly with each passing score and Zimmer's soundtrack only enhances the experience.

In this day and age I know the idea of having two options available to customers is nice, in terms of DVD and blu-ray format, but in the case of ""Man of Steel"" I'd recommend that you buy the bundle pack.  Yes, you may not have a blu-ray player but if you ever decide to get it then you'll already have the blu-ray copy along with the DVD one.  Truth be told, I have a hard time recommending that this movie be bought solely on DVD cause it's simply too visual a movie to experience any other way than blu-ray.

One of the best indicators I have for a film are the feelings I have the day afterwards.  I left my local theater following the midnight premiere and I had a hard time sleeping.  Almost a full day later I still have a sense of excitement over the movie.  This film has that something truly special.  It's not often I sit in a theater and feel like I'm taken back to being that same young kid who had aspirations of saving the world while wearing a cape (I'm pretty sure I'm not alone in this).  It filled me with the awe and wonder of my childhood and left me inspired.  It's hard to imagine a better way to pay homage to the dreams of my past than letting them breath a little bit once more in the form of a movie.  I can easily say that this is one of my favorite movies of the year.",1371168000,479,5585,4.251184834123222
5784005,5,B00D91GRA4,"I loved this movie from its brilliant start to startling climax and amazing conclusion. Never before has such a fantastic character seemed so... plausible. The extended opening sequence on Krypton lends a solid foundation to this highly character driven story. The first big screen adaptation of the most iconic superhero of all time claimed ""You'll believe a man can fly."" In this stunning piece of artistry and masterful storytelling (with plentiful explosions :) laced throughout) you will believe once again. His power of flight, heat vision, physical strength, and speed are all seamlessly a part of who he is. Yet for all of his ""powers"" his greatest strength is his very human spirit, and this marvelous strength is shared by those he strives to protect.

As a comic book fan I found this adaptation richly satisfying. Nearly every element that I was looking for was present, but with a twist that made the story more coherent. And many highly implausible things from the comics and previous movies/TV shows that always made me roll my eyes with a ""yeah, right"" were not shied away from but rather redressed in a way that made me respond, ""ah, that makes more sense.""  We've been waiting for this Superman to show up for a long time. Well done guys, well done.",1371168000,10,1267,4.8341013824884795

5784007,4,B00D91GRA4,"Getting to the theatre an hour early, I was ready. Its too bad I had to wait an extra fifteen minutes for the midnight premier to start. So, being a little restless, I was disappointed when the movie started with no exciting opening credits. The film jumps right into the origin story and the visuals are arresting. As the movie progressed I felt it slipped into some overly long moments, moments that the audience is smart enough to figure out without a rehash. Once the major action scenes kick in, about an hour into the film, Superman is poised to tear up the place, and he does just that. Henry Cavill plays Superman with a ton of humility. But he's a humble guy that has been restraining the usage of his powers that once released brings out two Hulks in one. Most of the effects are great. Some are only good because I've seen the blotchy and bubbly silver stuff a hundred times over in Terminator 2.

  Also needed and done to good effect are more than a few genuine moments of sentiment. Clark's childhood tells you why he is the man he is. All the big actors turn on their talents which definitely gives a credible gelling feel to it all. There are also some rightly timed chuckle inducing pieces of verbiage aimed at the name ""Superman"". Those moments are quickly and willingly sucked up due to the generally sullen nature of the characters.

Lets talk FAORA (the incredible Antje Traue). She's a scene stealer, and can steal as many scenes as she wants as far as I'm concerned. Her presence pushed ""Man Of Steel"" into the statosphere. With her scary otherworldly vocals, unrestrained brutality and pure sex appeal, the sci fi lover gets a true villainess to be blown away by. I think she could hold a film of her own and would love to see her somehow brought back in future installments of the franchise. Her evil far exceeded Zods (Michael Shannon)with his slow-burn approach.

 Amy Adams (Lois Lane) by contrast embodies the most accurate portrayal of a professional woman for a change. The action between Faora and Lane is tremendous and well thought out. Two females from different worlds colliding without all the beauty and affection type banter. I loved that angle. I feel this film was simply an ""establish who Superman is"" film, only waiting for the real everyday occurrences of Earth and a friendly alien, Kal El, to unfold. Toward the close as a lighter tone emerges, I saw exactly what was happening as the Daily Planet becomes a focal point. A nice transition and very welcomed after a mostly somber Clark/Superman did what he had to do. You will see a few easter eggs. It's a ride that takes you through a very interesting and introspective tale about the greatest superhero ever. Multiple viewings may be required and is recommended at least at this stage for full absorption.

5784009,1,B00D91GRA4,"Over the years, the Superman franchise has had its share of hits and misses - both on the big screen and the little screen.  Depending on who was wearing the cape, Superman has soared to the amazement of viewers, and also crashed and burned, falling out of favor with fans and ending with cancellation.  George Reeves was nearly every child's idol in the 1950s.  In the late 1970s and 80s, Christopher Reeve did such a tremendous job with the iconic red and blue character that it's quite possible no one will ever wear the cape quite as well again.  Through the 1990s and 2000s, Dean Cain and Tom Welling kept Superman alive on TV, while the Superman film franchise lay in ruins, desperate for someone to return the character to prominence.  In 2006, Bryan Singer did an admirable job, casting Brandon Routh as the lead, yet the film never quite clicked with Superman fans.  Now, seven years later - director Zach Snyder and the man responsible for Batman's return to fame, Christopher Nolan, have completely re-imagined a modern Superman.  Will the summer of 2013 belong to the Man of Steel, or is this just another poorly executed effort that fails to find the essence of the greatest comic book character of all-time?

Directed by Zack Snyder (300, Watchmen), Man of Steel stars Henry Cavill as Superman/Clark Kent/Kal-El, an alien sent to earth from a dying world.  As a child, Clark Kent desperately tries to fit in, even though he has extraordinary super powers.  As an adult, he must either embrace the idea that he's humanity's protector, or risk watching the earth be destroyed by the arrival of General Zod (Michael Shannon) - a Kryptonian criminal hell-bent on repopulating his race on earth.  Amy Adams, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Laurence Fishburne, Antje Traue, and Russell Crowe also star in supporting roles.

It's a travesty to watch a character so engrained in American culture treated in such a poor, careless manner.  Man of Steel is an absolute mess and you can place the blame squarely on the writer and director.  Christopher Nolan and David Goyer may have had a pulse on Batman in The Dark Knight trilogy, but as far as Superman goes - they should be ashamed of themselves and never be allowed to touch this character ever again.  Director Zack Snyder completely misses the mark, spending the majority of his time focused on uninteresting spaceships and the endless amount of buildings falling down.  Snyder completely sacrifices screen time that would have been much better spent establishing characters, including but not limited to Lois Lane, Martha Kent, Perry White, and the completely absent Jimmy Olson.  And, don't even both with that ""we were saving him until the sequel"" crap because Jimmy Olson is just as important to Superman lore as Lois Lane, Smallville, and Krypton.  Superman Returns was a flawed film, but at least that film took the time to incorporate the important aspects of the Superman universe.

Who is this Superman in Man of Steel?  He's certainly nobody you'll recognize from the comic books, previous films, or basically any other variation of the character.  For instance, someone needs to explain the logic behind the most powerful superhero on the planet being forced to hitchhike.  It defies comprehension how in the snap of a finger this character can be on the other side of the world, yet when a bar rat half his size gets under his skin, his first reaction is to quit his job and hitchhike to the next town (and no, it doesn't make up for such a ridiculous idea even if the truck says LexCorp on it).  While we're on the subject, why is Superman working in a bar?  You have to be kidding with this stuff.  Not only has Superman worked in a bar, he's also tried his hand at being a sea fisherman, too.  Feel free to drop your jaw and say, ""huh?""  These are just the small, tiny nuances that will make you want to scratch your head.  We haven't even got to the completely flawed decision that Superman makes at the end of the film, which completely goes against every single standard set for the character since his creation.  Suddenly, the decision to make Superman a parent (Superman Returns) doesn't seem like the dumbest decision ever made.

Superman is a character with near limitless power at his disposal, yet he fails to use half of his abilities in the film for more than mere instances.  Several attributes, like his x-ray vision, heat vision, and superhuman hearing are briefly displayed, while one of his most prominent powers, super breath, is nonexistent.  This superhero is supposed to be invulnerable, but somehow manages to spend the majority of this film getting beat up and knocked down, not just by his fellow Kryptonians, but also by bullies at school.  For a reboot film that is meant to establish Superman as a character to be feared, he certainly doesn't stand out above any of the other countless Kryptonians that manage to find their way to earth.  Superman is a character of standards, standing prominently in the defense of humanity, but his human side appears to dominate his thoughts, showing little interest in preserving the future of his native people.  Sadly, it's hard to call him anything other than slightly above average in Man of Steel.

Even though the plot is complete trash and does absolutely nothing for the advancement of the DC Cinematic Universe, the film is not devoid of a few shining stars.  Did you ever imagine Russell Crowe or Kevin Costner wouldn't bring their A-game for this film?  As the fathers of Kal-El/Clark Kent, these two masterful actors display a complete understanding of their characters, quickly establishing that they are out to nudge their son in the right direction, ultimately leaving Clark to decide the man he wants to be.  Michael Shannon is no Terence Stamp, but he does mold the role of the vengeful, angry General Zod into his own, creating a grander villain as opposed to the character Stamp displayed in Superman and Superman II.  And, while we're on the subject of Zod - sadly, there's no classic ""kneel before Zod"" quote to look forward to in this disappointing film.

As far as the rest of the cast goes, they are basically average at best.  Henry Cavill brings the attractive features to the role of Superman, but he suffers from the same fate as his predecessor (Brandon Routh) - a proper dialogue for the character.  He's a far cry Christopher Reeve, not to mention Tom Welling.  Superman's romance interest, Lois Lane, ineloquently follows the gigantic breadcrumbs right to the front door of the Kent farm, eliminating any possibility of future quirky exchanges between Lois and Clark at the Daily Planet with Superman (disguised) staring her right in the face.  Speaking of the Planet, Laurence Fishburne showed such great potential in the role of the Planet's editor, Perry White, but is left to flounder around for more than half of the film due to yet another nauseating and destructive alien invasion.  This all just goes to show you that no matter how many high profile names are in your film, they all look foolish without an interesting story and progressive dialogue.

With an array of villains in Superman's rough gallery, it's unfortunate that the writers and filmmakers choose to go with another General Zod story.  Man of Steel feels much more like a Brainiac story than a Kryptonian origin story, leaving far too many questions unanswered.  The countless blunders of this film compared to previous comic book failures, like Ang Lee's Hulk and Green Lantern.  Speaking of the green guardian, there is no mention of him or any other major characters from the DC Universe - meaning there's absolutely no lead-in to a potential Justice League film or a Batman/Superman team-up.  Allegedly, there's a Wayne Enterprises logo on a satellite during the film, but if that's the best they can do for a reference, that's just sad and bothersome - which is basically the overlying theme of this film anyway.

Overall, Man of Steel is one of the worst comic book films to date.  Not only did they do away with John Williams' famous theme music, the filmmakers completely failed to make Superman interesting and frankly, they obviously don't understand the character at all.  This all comes as a bit of a shock, but there it is in all of its CGI-abusive glory.  Granted, Superman's costume looks great and his origin remains intact, but that doesn't change the fact that this film is too long, bumbling from the get-go, and a complete misrepresentation of the Superman character.  In any event, a Man of Steel sequel has apparently been fast-tracked, so we're apparently stuck with Zack Snyder and his poor re-imagining of Superman.  Hopefully a sequel can right the ship before we're forced to go another seven years without a Superman flick.

5784010,5,B00D91GRA4,"WOW! What a film, the finest film of the summer so far.  I enjoyed Man of Steel so much I really did not know where to start with my review, I had to rewrite the first paragraph a couple of times.  Should I begin with the astonishing action and effects or the characters that come alive on the screen?  Maybe I should talk first about Zack Snyder, and with his direction of Man of Steel he solidifies as one of the best modern day directors along with the likes of Christopher Nolan and David O. Russell.  I thought about first talking about the characters and how they came alive on screen giving emotional depth and impact to the film, but I have decided to first talk about my knowledge and opinion of Superman, in that way you can understand how surprising it is for me to love Man of Steel.

In all honesty my attitude toward Superman and the Superman comics is one of indifference.  Clark Kent or Superman was just never a compelling character to me.  I mean come on he is essentially a god, and was so invincible that the writers of the comics had to find some kind of weakness for Superman and came up with the lame excuse of Kryptonite.  It just seemed ridiculous to me.  My only contact with Superman in the comics was with the whole Death of Superman saga when the Death of Superman storyline came out in 1992 it captivated me.  The comics were brilliantly written, and the story was emotionally compelling, but then DC writers decided to make clones or whatever of Superman, and what was even more of a middle finger to the fans was that the fans brought Superman back to life and so quickly.  It just came of as an insult to fans, and I do not understand how fans of the comics and the character could forgive that slight so easily.  Needlessly to say that turned me off to the comics.  I still watched the cartoons along with the old Christopher Reeve films and the regrettable Superman Returns.  My favorite adaptation of Superman was in the Lois & Clark television show staring Dean Kane as Clark Kent/Superman, and Teri Hatcher as Lois Lane.  It was well crafted and Kane and Hatcher had chemistry on screen, but still I was never that impressed with the character and my opinion over the years has turned to indifference until the Man of Steel.  DC comics along with the heavily underrated Zach Snyder and Christopher Nolan have created a near masterpiece in Man of Steel that pulled me into Superman's universe making me emotionally invested in Superman, and the rest of the characters creating the best film of the summer so far, and one of the best films of the year.

I cannot speak on accurate the storyline is compared to the comics, so I will not discuss or try and compare the two.  The script was written by David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan, and together they do a superb job of creating a realistic world for Superman and what would it be like if Superman really appeared on Earth along with our reactions toward him and the reality if someone like Superman got involve in a battle in a major city like New York.  The two writers along with Snyder bring to life Krypton like I have never seen before.  I do not know if what happens in the film actually happened in the comics, and honestly I do not care if it did, because I loved the world Goyer and Nolan wrote, and that Snyder brought to life.  On Earth Clark struggles to find his place in the world where he grew up, yet is an alien to it.  Clark becomes a wanderer traveling from place to place helping people along the way, and in doing so he finds a friend and confidant in Lois Lane.  Clark is forced to make a decision about the direction of his life when General Zod appears demanding that Earth hand over Superman to him.  Does Clark keep his identity hidden because he does not know if he can trust the humans or not, or does he turn himself over to Zod even though he knows without a doubt that General Zod cannot be trusted?  The depth of the writing is as I said outstanding giving everything you could want from a terrific film.

Who do DC and Snyder cast to play Superman?  It is an important question, because without the right actor for the role a Superman film will fail, and I believe you need an actor with both the acting ability along with the physical presence to play the iconic character.  Reeves did an admirable job in the role through four films while Kane lacked the acting ability to pull off the emotional depth I think the character should have, and Brandon Routh was just a plain terrible choice to play Superman.  Henry Cavill I believe was the perfect choice as he has both the physical presence and acting ability to pull off playing a god on Earth, and Cavil performance splendidly showing viewers how conflicted Clark is about whom he is where he comes from, and who he supposed to become.  Amy Adams is gives a great performance as Lois Lane the investigative journalist for the Daily Planet.  Along with having great chemistry with Cavill she shows that Lois is more than just a pretty face, and a damsel in distress.  Russell Crowe gives a memorable performance as Jor-El, Clark's biological father giving an emotional performance especially in the beginning of the film on Krypton.  Michael Shannon has already given a great performance earlier this year in Mud, that I believe he should be nominated for his role as a supporting actor.  Shannon's performance in Mud was more subdued than in the Man of Steel, but playing General Zod you should expect that.  I have read criticism of his performance in his performance as Zod, but I thought he did a wonderful job playing the flawed character.  Zod is a man whose job it to protect and ensure the survival of the people of Krypton at all costs even if it means damning his own soul in the process.  Zod I do not believe is a truly evil character, he is doing what he believes he has to do to ensure the survival of his race and Shannon does a good job displaying that especially one scene in the film when all hope is lost for him and his people.  The rest of the supporting cast does a good job.  Diane Lane does a good job as Martha Kent as does Laurence Fishburne who gives a good performance in his limited role as Perry White, and Christopher Meloni is does a decent job as Colonel Nathan Hardy.  The only casting choice I had a problem with was Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent or maybe it had to do more with the how the character was written than Costner's performance.  It just seemed like Goyer and Nolan did not know exactly what to do with the character and his relationship with Clark.

For all the criticism Zach Snyder gets he is without question on of the best visual directors around, and has proven so with 300 and Watchmen.  Snyder finds a way to bring his films to life for his audience pulling them into his films like no other director can, and he does it again with the help of Warner Brothers, DC and a large budget.  The effects are breathtaking from the war on Krypton to Superman battling two other Krytonians in Smallville are mesmerizing, and I do not believe any other director could bring to life Superman like Snyder had.  His visual expertise along with the CGI bring to life the action making to real, and that what you are seeing is actually happing, and is that not the point of great CGI in that you cannot tell the difference in what is real and what is fake, or that the CGI and action is so good that the viewer does not care, and that is what you get with Man of Steel that Superman action film fans have always wanted as well as showing the devastating impact of gods fighting on Earth.

I really do not understand why people bash Zach Snyder.  The man is a really good film director with an outstanding visual eye.  I am not a big fan of 300, but the film was visually wonderful.  With Watchmen Snyder beautifully brought to life one of the best comic graphic novels ever, and created one of the best comic films to date.  Here in Man of Steel he continues his journey in becoming one of the better directors in Hollywood.  With the help of Nolan and Goyer, Snyder creates a beautiful film and a memorable world of Superman that no director has done before.  The only problem with the production of the film is with the score that was done by Hans Zimmer which is surprising because I usually love his film scores, but with Man of Steel the music was a little too bombastic in tone, which I thought took away from the film.

What are the critics thinking I do not know, because I loved Man of Steel.  Maybe it is because I am not a fan of the Superman comics or the character.  Who knows, but I thought the Man of Steel was an excellent film with great direction, a well-crafted screenplay, well written characters that were wonderfully performed along with simply amazing visuals and effects that make Man of Steel the best film of the summer, one of the best films of the year and a must for comic and non-comic fans alike.  I think DC has finally realized what they do to continue their longevity of the comic properties and though I am definitely not a DC fan I am surprisingly looking forward to a sequel and what DC does next with its properties.  I highly recommend Man of Steel and I do not think anyone should be disappointed with the film.",1371168000,12,9267,4.41186839012926
