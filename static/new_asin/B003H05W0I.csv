8396654,5,B003H05W0I,"This film has the best story line I have seen in awhile!
Although the production quality at times was less than normal, the story line quickly brings you in to the story.
I cried at the end of this film and will never forget it!
Now in my top 5 best films!
It is also good to know that some of the proceeds from the sales of this film are donated to Veterans!
Wonderful! Definitely reccomend!",1282780800,,392,4.171052631578948
8396655,1,B003H05W0I,"It was like watching a high school student's video class project. Quality was like it was shot with a cell phone. Watched it with 3 others and we had to turn it off after 20 minutes. Complete waste of money. This movie will be ""Fourth on a Match"", as I plan on burning it.",1282003200,,272,4.055555555555555
