8005728,4,B00012QMIQ,"The story occurs in a undefined english speaking country.  Has a mix of modern and nineteenth century technology in it that is deliberately confusing.  A religious detective investigating a bizarre murder laden with cryptic clues.  A political revolution in the background that underlies the story.  Appears to be somewhat anti-clerical, but not much else, and yet is enough to motivate some of the characters.  Artsy camera work, hard to fathom characters, air of impending doom - love it. Comparing it to ""Brazil"" is apt in the sense that it is not anchored to a particular time period, which is what makes these kind of movies intriguing.  Although it is less ambitious in its scope, it suceeds by focusing on only the necessary elements to move the story.  A small movie but well crafted nonetheless. One that I will continue to watch from time to time.",1325462400,,857,4.86896551724138
8005729,3,B00012QMIQ,"I checked this out from my local library, now I am thinking of adding it to my collection. I personally quite like the use of ""modern technology"" mixed with the older clothing. The industrial office type scenes brought Winston Smith's office in 1984 to my mind. The styling of the costumes and sets were well done and I felt like it added a lot to the story.

The mystery of the film is interesting, although I wasn't quite satisfied with the ending. I wanted just a bit more for Donovan's character. There is a bit of humor laced into the film as well - the desk on the track scene. My husband and I still laugh about that now and then, and whenever I hear a snappy saxophone playing something similar to the music in the film at that point, I see the scene in my minds eye, what a hoot!

This film is definitely not for everyone, but if you enjoy seeing something different, with an artistic approach as opposed to the cliche Hollywood model, I think you would appreciate this film.",1306281600,,984,4.371584699453552
8005730,4,B00012QMIQ,"This interesting feature is set in a strange future.  It is reminiscent of Terry Gilliam's Brazil, as it tells the story of John Abbot, a religious detective who has to investigate a young woman's murder.  He discovers various codes, messages, cryptograms, and odd elements as he goes to solve this intriguing story.",1094947200,4,316,5.0576923076923075
