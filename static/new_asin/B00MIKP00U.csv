6583310,4,B00MIKP00U,"Back in 2006 Michelle Monaghan, who we've grown so accustomed to in cheery girlfriend roles, gave a career-making turn in Trucker, a small but emotionally powerful film about a mother forced to juggle motherhood with an inconvenient job she loves. Monaghan was barely recognizable from an emotional standpoint, playing harder and edgier than we've ever seen her, but it showed the full scope of her talents. She's even better in Claudia Myers' tough and resonant Fort Bliss, a film which connects on similar themes of motherhood and duty, but from the perspective of a returning soldier.

Maggie Swann (Monaghan) is a top notch Army medic returned home after a 15-month deployment in Afghanistan. There she knew who she was and what to do. She could count on the men and women beside her, and the adrenaline rush of war was easy to get addicted to. Things aren't so certain back home, though. Her five-year-old son barely recognizes her, preferring Maggie's ex-husband (Ron Livingston) and new girlfriend (Emmanuelle Chriqui). She's not used to the lack of structure the outside world holds, and certainly can't deal with her screaming son or his sleepwalking. Emotional vulnerability is tucked away as if to show it would be an admission of weakness. Not the best quality for a mother to have, nor does it make her budding relationship with a car mechanic easier.

Myers puts Maggie through the paces in showing her disconnect with the civilian world. She's torn between motherhood and her patriotic duty; struggles with the death of a fellow soldier; and quietly resents her son and ex-husband for moving on. The military wants her skills but doesn't seem to respect her as a woman, and that's before an attempted sexual assault complicates her feelings further. Where do her priorities lie? Are they with her family, or with the Army? Is it possible for a soldier, whether they be male or female, to have a military career without sacrificing everything else? If there's one false note it's Myers' neatly-packaged answer to that question.

With an authoritative presence Monaghan demands your attention. She's the sole focus here and carries the full weight on her shoulders, capturing the unique difficulties faced by women in the armed services. It's a lot to chew on, and Myers keeps Maggie's story truthful and grounded, a testament to the real men and women who deal with these issues each day. It's a familiar story but an honest one that Myers, who worked closely with the military on this and other projects, clearly feels a personal responsibility to get right. There aren't a lot of fireworks or surprises in Fort Bliss, but it's a well-told story that pays respect to our men and women in uniform.",1411603200,22,2711,4.940789473684211

6583315,4,B00MIKP00U,"Sgt. Maggie Swan (Michelle Monaghan) is an army medic in Afghanistan. She is daring and confident. People live because of her. She is good at what she does. When she returns home to Fort Bliss, her life is in disarray. Her ex-husband is engaged to a woman her son calls ""mommy."" Her son runs from her like a feral cat. She must force her son to stay with her as their life gets back on track.

The film examines the double standards of the new norms. A man can be a weekend, part time dad and be called a brave patriot making the ultimate sacrifice for his country. For a woman...

The script had the approval of the US Army. The theme not only examines the gender issue, but that of balancing a career she loves with a son she loves. The soldier leaves home and then must play catch-up upon return.

This is not a war film, but more akin to a Lifetime drama.

6583316,4,B00MIKP00U,"This is a long complex movie about a female medic deployed to Iraq who reenlists for years or months at a time. The conflict or the ""suspense"" is in the backstory: She has a five-year old son whom she wants in her life but who doesn't remember her when she returns to the States, who in fact has bonded with her x-husband's new pregnant wife. The most disturbing scenes occur not with bloodshed in Iraq but in the scenes with her son whom she rips from his home with his father and stepmother. She brings him to an under-furnished Army apartment, then leaves him alone to go grocery shopping, while he screams and cries his heart out for his ""real"" family. The theme here seems to be that women who work are treated differently than men who work and society (and children and families) have to change and adapt to suit the absent mother. The lead female character makes heroic attempts to become the loving present mother but her true calling is as a medic and that career comes first. The movie is well-acted, scripted, and produced, although the female lead affects a hardness and self-sufficiency that modern society seems to expect of women solders. As she leaves her son again he finally breaks down and begs her to stay--which is what he can expect for the rest of his life--the trauma of being wrenched from a part-time mother.",1410825600,5,1334,4.585774058577406

The explicit sex scene where this conflicted 'mommy' hero screws her first date ,"" begging' F*** me"" as they start tearing off their clothes with her little son in the other room, doesn't qualify for a rating?. I can only assume I am a backwards, provincial prude because no other reviewer even commented on this scene or wrote a warning about it. . Yeah. I have so much respect for a woman like that being an exemplary role model  for our women in uniform, upholding our highest standards of military conduct.  I WAS at first going to send this to my daughter who is serving honorably in the AF. I know Hollywood loves to glorify our lower natures, calling it 'reality'.

6583341,5,B00MIKP00U,"Fort Bliss is an American drama film directed and written by Claudia Myers, a military-based drama where Staff Sergeant (SSG,E6) Swann was in the Afghanistan conflict as a combat medic, and she was exposed to an insurgent encounter, under horrific circumstances that no human- that has not been in combat could understand. The film gives viewers a taste of what the simplest encounters out there could be like. This is a narrative, which does a great job of exploring, what at times; you can never ever talk about with your family or friends. This is about a person's combat experience and concerns the `thorny' prospect of maybe having to face judgement from them because of it. It also shows that at times the only people who can relate to you are your fellow comrades in arms. Add into the mix that you have a 5-year-old son, who only seems to know your former partners' girlfriend as Mom adds in a whole other dimension to the story.

This is a well-crafted poignant drama with some very well moulded characters dealing with a whole spectrum issues, regardless of your position on women in frontline operations. Monaghan's performance is top notch. Her character of Maggie is tough and formidable, yet is also hands-on, impartial and willing to give others the benefit of the doubt; her final scenes with her young son are lump in your throat experience. This is a movie that is worth seeing.",1422662400,7,1396,4.768595041322314
6583342,4,B00MIKP00U,"As this movie points out: It's tough going to war and not much less so coming home.

Here's the scoop. Maggie Swann (Michelle Monaghan)  is back from a 14 month tour in Afghanistan. She needs to reconnect with her 5 year old son who has been living with her divorced husband (Ron Livingston) and his New wife (Emmanuelle Chriqui). It's a tough go as he barely remembers her. She also starts up a relationship with a local auto mechanic. As the going gets rougher for her on the home front she makes a decision that puts all her efforts in jeopardy.

This is a decent, steady movie. I can't say it's earth-shattering being that many of the problems experienced by those coming back from the mid-east have been covered extensively by the media, and have become part of our consciousness. That being said, writer/director Claudia Myers does a good job of fleshing it out and putting it in a form most will be able to appreciate and take to heart. Part of this is the acting. I like Michelle Monaghan a lot and she handles her role well. Ron Livingston is that likeable American guy to begin with. Here he does well as her divorced husband who is pretty much plugged into the wall. He doesn't make a great living but owns a home and seems dedicated to making his new marriage work. Manola Cardona is Michelle's love interest and he also does a decent job. His part might have been a bit too pat. He likes her and gets on well with her son. Seems to me I've seen this same thing in a fair number of other movies involving women trying to get back on track.

As in other indy endeavors, this is mostly writing and acting. A few of the scenes set in the mid-east look as though they cost a few bucks but the budget looked pretty manageable.

As I said:This is a very decent flick. You might not want it at the top of your 'to watch' list but it's well worth seeing.",1421193600,,1858,4.327586206896552

The attachment issues with the son, and the mother-child relationship and the havoc the mom's job wreaks on it are things I've often wondered about with women in the military.  It must be so hard on both sides.  Monaghan does a good job with the ""soldier"" side of the character, but I thought she ran a little cold to unconvincing on the ""mom"" side, though it was a good movie overall.  Loved the complexity of this issue explored here, and the reality that there are no easy answers or solutions for the women and children and families involved.",1417219200,,567,4.529411764705882

The whole film felt truthful to the choices and decisions people have to make all the time, especially I imagine in the military. We may have seen movies that had some of this type of personal conflict but never from a woman's point of view. I felt like there was a real respect by everyone involved in this film for people that serve the country. I loved it and honestly think Michelle Monaghan should win as many awards as possible for this.",1415318400,3,647,4.626086956521739
6583354,5,B00MIKP00U,"Very powerful film, with an unforgettable performance by Michelle Monaghan, certainly the best I've ever seen from this actor. Even weeks after viewing Fort Bliss, I found it impossible to put the story out of my mind, a sure sign that, for whatever reason, I'll be returning to watch it again and again.

I admire tremendously the dialogue, the pacing, the rich, character-driven story, and the honest portrayals of tbe protagonist's fellow soldiers, family and friends during her deployment in Afghanistan, and following her return home to El Paso.

Highly recommended. Well worth at least one viewing, not only for its insightful presentation of multiple issues confronting women soldiers/parents in today's military, but also as a look into the plight of one very courageous and extraordinary young woman.

6583359,4,B00MIKP00U,"As a film, in a technical sense (acting, directing, editing), it was very respectable, if somewhat mediocre. But as a concept... that is, the premise and understanding of the subject by the writers, the movie was superb.  The competing responsibilities toward that of fellow soldiers and that of family is something unique to service members.  Two relationships which each has an expectation, by society and by law, of complete fidelity and total commitment... and they are in conflict.  There is no easy answer, though the flippant one I often heard was; ""If the Army wanted you to have a family, they would have issued you one.""  I retired at 20 years just after Desert Storm and never had a soldier in a similar situation; only in recent conflicts in which service members are required to deploy repeatedly to combat zones has this become very real and common.  Of course, the problem of lost time and disconnect from family has always been difficult, but close, repeated non-accompanied deployments must only make it worse.  In a military movie there always has to be, it seems, a psycho sergeant and some combat-event guilt. But within its central theme, this movie does a very good job of portraying the difficulties and the emotions.",1413763200,10,1240,4.909090909090909
