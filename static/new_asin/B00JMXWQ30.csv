6381694,4,B00JMXWQ30,"I had purchased all of these movies for digital download at half the price.  I didn't think I had downloaded all the Star Wars Lego movies so bought this. Well, turns out there aren't many and I already had them.  They are even better for adults than kids as most of the subtle jokes are aimed at the mature crowd.  I just wish I hadn't purchased these given I already ""owned"" them in digital form.",1407283200,,398,4.28

6381700,1,B00JMXWQ30,I was thinking of purchasing this. However the image shows a mix of blu ray and DVD. Shows 1 disk in the product description and format DVD. So I went looking for the original versions on blu ray on amazon.  If you want blu ray it's about the same price to buy them individually on that format as compared to this DVD single disk bundle.,1399161600,45,337,4.184615384615385
