7329760,3,B0118S723U,The stories and retelling of them is good. It gave a lot of history into the crimes themselves but the re-enactment scenes were not of the best quality.,1456963200,,152,4.464285714285714

The scenes they show have nothing to do with what they are talking about.  The artwork was cool at first then it becomes unnecessary. Then it becomes a waste of your money.

But convoluted. And your narrators were too subtle. If you want a narrator with a british accent, they need to own it or be a historian for the BBC. But, if you go with historian, then we want to follow them on the journey. Martina Cole, the crime novelist, also does a great job of mixing horror, entertainment, and education.
