8589912,5,B00D6I7GC8,Antonio Campos' second directorial film explores privilege and a lack of decency and respect in this tale of a young man fresh out of college and a torn relationship who is looking to recover and retool in Paris.

8589916,4,B00D6I7GC8,"Americans in Paris,film-makers who are returning to their inspirational source,like writers once did in the twenties. However, this is not the Paris of French film-makers,it is a foreshortened version, bodies decapitated by the screen cut. Campos is a product of Borderline,the talented film-maker collective behind last year's Sundance hit Martha Marcy May Marlene. Simon Killer is his follow-up to Afterschool. Technically advanced,strange angles,oppressive,close-up character study,moving pans,drenched in colour screens,abrupt musical intros,the unreliable narrator with sociopathic tendencies. Playing a creepy character as in Funny Games.

Simon (Brady Corbet) claims to be a graduate in neuroscience,concerned with how the brain processes peripheral vision,yet he doesn't know what `nystagmus' is,a condition of Marianne,one of his pick-ups. He is a compulsive liar. His emails to his ex are all in his voiceovers, even hers to him. He also towards the end tells the passport control officer he's studying French literature, like the last girl he met. In truth Simon is alone in Paris looking for sex,full of deadly cunning,cut adrift from empathy or values. Ripley comes to mind,but even he would never stoop so low as to get his prostitute girl friend to film and blackmail customers.

Chronicling the downward spiral of this inept protagonist,Campos subverts noir expectations,he is ably abetted by Mati Diop, touching as Victoria,who Simon moves in with and battens onto. He believes his lies until Mati peels away at them towards the end as he has gorged his confidence to launch into a new relationship as her spark dims. The sex is true to life. Simon treats women as objects to his own narcissim. There are languorous camera movements and surprising focal points in many scenes e.g.when he's picked her up in the bar and they've gone to a private area to talk as the camera pans away from them as if to widen the perspective.

Simon is portrayed as both pathetic and vulnerable,his mother's `fox'and violently unstable,emotionally immature,'I always saw myself as more of a lion'.Simon is set in his ways,hiding darker impulses. Colours are drab,cameras set at waist level,cutting off torsos. Beneath the frail exterior,manic behaviour is prone to burst forth. The tourist manipulator,adapting to very person he meets, trying to bring a new self into identity, but full of motiveless malignity,deriving his drive for manliness by wrenching emotion from others. Simon grows into a monster as foretold in the title. Corbet quits himself well of this American psycho in Paris. Enjoyable film with urgent soundtrack.",1395014400,,2627,5.4338235294117645
8589917,3,B00D6I7GC8,"This is a well-made and often audacious film.  Its prickly willingness to make everything sordid and ugly -- while fleshing this out with exhilarating editing, music and camerawork -- carried me through several enthralling watches, along with Brady Corbet's uncanny performance.  But, though I still can't stop watching Corbet work his rancid spell (no one is doing ""sexy young creep"" better right now), I have begun to see him and the film as rather self-indulgent and a bit flailingly pointless.  It's sort of fin-de-siecle art fifteen years too late, it doesn't need the unwieldy meta-subject of how visual culture deludes and tricks the brain (duh), and it should be less in awe of the tawdry sex which it loves to be aghast at.  In other words, Ulrich Seidl among others has given sharper and more challenging films about some of these same subjects.  In other other words, it panders to a high-minded viewership who can take comfort in calling its desperate characters ""sociopaths"" when that's not really what they are at all -- just young, sad, lonely, down and out, and speaking two different languages ... er, three, counting the universal one.  In other other other words, not being able to trust a film's good reviews has become for me an indication not to fully trust a film.  But I wouldn't bet against myself watching it several more times over the next few months.  It's just that kind of spicy noodle -- empty calories maybe, but tasty as all get out.",1389052800,,1467,4.816733067729084
8589918,5,B00D6I7GC8,"Story of a young man who is a totally amoral bastard.  But he's a mamas boy which doesn't fit the type.  FrenchSenegalese director Mati Diop in a major acting role is a real find.  She added a couple of stars to my rating,",1380240000,,222,4.116279069767442
8589919,5,B00D6I7GC8,"Told almost as a modern-day version of the novel In a Lonely Place, Simon Killer places us with a young American man fresh upon arrival in Paris (or so he says). He is struggling with getting over his ex, and falls in love with a French prostitute, also with (literal) scars. As seen in the trailer (so no spoilers), the two devise a scheme to blackmail her clients for cash. This doesn't quite work out.

The narrative, though, is secondary to the extraordinary and wholly disturbing vision that is presented to us. The sex scenes, while erotic, are almost joyless, with Simon's lovers' heads often out of the shot, giving us a view of Simon leering at their nude bodies, or forcing them to turn around and face the opposite way, further dehumanizing his sexual partners.

The unique experience of this film is further developed through the contrast of highly cinematic, ""fake""-feeling camera work with exceptionally neorealistic dialogue and acting. The very long shots feel as if we could be there watching live, but with the slight disconnect of a perfectly framed angle, or smooth turns bridging opposite characters or ends of the room.

The focal point of the film, of course, is Simon himself, delivered in a fantastic performance by Brady Corbet (who you may recognize from Thirteen). He is nearly impossible to take your eyes off of, and gives a remarkably rich and believable portrayal of a womanizer, criminal, and yes, killer.

Simon Killer is also extraordinary in how much it takes us by surprise - we rarely get films, either studio or independent, which places us with your everyday man who has the potential to kill. Recalling earlier events, I can now look back and see how we were given clues that Simon could be a criminal all along, but an audience is often unwilling to accept that our narrator, our door to this experience, is capable of such terrible acts. We share in his experience but don't want to bear the guilt of his actions. The film lets off a chilling conclusion and a sense of fluidity, that these events have likely happened before and will probably happen again.

Simon Killer is a shining (?) dark spot in a year of film that was largely optimistic and happy-go-lucky. It offers a very fresh take on the traditional narrative and gives us an unforgettable cinematic experience.",1370908800,9,2315,4.791979949874687
