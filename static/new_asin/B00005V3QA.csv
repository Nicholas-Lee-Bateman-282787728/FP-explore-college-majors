1671699,2,B00005V3QA,"We watched this video when our baby was 6 months old. There was virtually nothing here that we hadn't learned before the baby's birth by taking classes or reading books. Only mildly interesting and helpful thing was advice on burping a baby. I found her EASY and SLOW acronyms simplistic and not very useful, as were her classifications of the ""five types of babies."" What good does it to do call your baby ""spirited,"" ""grumpy"" or an ""angel baby""? Her advice for a parent asking about a baby who cries a lot: it doesn't hurt him, it opens up his tear ducts. Sheesh. Finally, one would think with all her celebrity clients she could've gotten a few people who could act to be on this video. Even though they're ""real people,"" the acting is painful.",1018915200,7,747,4.54074074074074
1671700,1,B00005V3QA,"I thought this video would give me tips on how calm a baby and help them fall to sleep.  I was wrong.....I guess you have to buy the next video to get that.  This video shared very, very little that I did not already know and I am a first time twin mother.  I think that Tracy needs to put more meat in ONE video instead of releasing multiple short videos to make money.  I really feel like I wasted my money.",1017532800,6,409,3.951219512195122
1671701,5,B00005V3QA,"This video is a ""must have"" for first-time parents. My husband and I are expecting our first child in June 2002. Everywhere we go we get advice from people--sometimes conflicting advice. This video contained the most sound advice we've received so far. The video was engrossing. We enjoyed it, and we plan to buy Hogg's series of books and tapes. We will probably watch this video again when we get closer to our due date. Even experienced parents may garner an ""a ha"" moment from this tape. The value we gained from this tape is worth every cent we invested to buy it.",1015372800,4,569,4.533980582524272
1671702,4,B00005V3QA,"I have a 5 month old and this video would've been great to see in my 8th or 9th month of pregnancy. I am going to buy one for my friend's baby shower. But, to watch it at the stage I am at now didn't offer anything that helpful. I am looking forward to Volume 2 - hopefully it will help me out more with the 6+ month stage. Overall, the video highlighted some good points from the book.",1015286400,4,386,3.8987341772151898
1671712,5,B00005V3QA,"I wish I had this 11 years ago since my first child was born. I was given advices here and there when they didn't really work for me and my babies.  Tracy Hogg was really intuned with the babies. She opened up my eyes and clearly explained the baby's world after birth and so on like how relatives and friends should properly meet the  baby for the first time. Plus, when moms and dads are sleep deprived, we only see our own view of how things should be with the baby, when we should take a step back and hear what the baby is really saying to us. The more we get intuned with our baby, the better. It also talked about what's healthy and what's right for you and your baby.  It's not a one size fits all, all babies are unique and it's up to us parents to find out the characteristics of our own baby...so it's a must see DVD for parents along with everyone who wants to be part of the baby's life, grandparents, aunts and uncles, friends.... really everyone! If the babies were to write a book, this is it! Have fun with your baby!",1253836800,2,1034,4.16
1671713,2,B00005V3QA,Another mislabled product. The description gave the impression that this was a Saunders movie. Got it. Tossed it.,1217635200,,113,5.333333333333333
1671714,1,B00005V3QA,"This video was a waste of time. I had read a little bit about The Baby Whisperer on their forum and had heard from several friends that The Baby Whisperer gave some good tips on baby body language.

The video was VERY superficial about Tracy's key acronyms (EASY and SLOW).  Tracy would start off talking about something and then would be interrupted by a very random 'Parents Questions and Answers' segment.  The questions/answers had no sense of order or focus.

I did not learn anything from watching this video and would like my hour+ of time back from watching it!",1205020800,,569,4.66
1671715,5,B00005V3QA,"If you want to sleep, this is the way to go. Bought it for the wife but both reaping the benefits.",1202428800,,98,3.7142857142857144
1671716,3,B00005V3QA,"In preparation for our child's arrival we read too many books and didn't watch enough videos. This one and the Harvey Karp video would have saved us a few extra nights of lost sleep if we had seen them before the baby was born. If you've already been around babies a lot, this DVD probably won't teach you much. I really like Hogg's general approach and manner. That said, the script and production on this video are a bit too hokey.",1199404800,,433,4.3580246913580245
1671717,3,B00005V3QA,I thought it was too rigid and I was a little disappointed.,1174694400,,59,4.0
1671718,3,B00005V3QA,"When I purchased this video, I thought Tracy Hogg would go into more detail about her EASY schedule and how to get littles ones to sleep like she does in her book.  The Q & A session with ""real parents"" was pretty much common sense knowledge.  There were a few things I learned but I was pretty much left wondering where the rest of the video was.",1171670400,,347,4.164179104477612
1671719,2,B00005V3QA,"While Tracey Hogg has some wonderful advice in her book - of the same title - about how to interact with your newborn, the video seems to gloss right over it. It seemed like whole chapters were presented in mere minutes and important sections were left out. Plus, the sections that featured questions from real parents seemed canned and corny. All this being said, the book is terrific. Skip the video - read the book instead.",1039132800,18,426,4.618421052631579
1671720,4,B00005V3QA,"I wish this had existed when my baby was on her way because she was a few months old by the time this DVD came out. Great help for parents wanting to know how to calm their baby, change their baby, and other basic care. Not so great for parents of slightly older babies who have already been doing these things for quite a while. Good baby shower gift for someone.",1027036800,7,364,4.140845070422535
7956065,2,B00005V3QA,Not worked for my baby except some general knowledge tips.,1478131200,,58,4.9

7956067,5,B00005V3QA,"My blood boils to see a parent or guardian pull the hair if a child because he/she ""does not listen"".  Well, who I wants to hear a shrieks, shouting voice.  A child would get closer to you to hear what you're whispering...",1394755200,,222,4.261904761904762
7956068,5,B00005V3QA,"I finally got to see the shuuhhss method! But you still need to read the whole book, too many parts are missing. Too bad there are no more sequels...",1374019200,,149,4.172413793103448
7956069,1,B00005V3QA,"This video was super-cheesy, the acting was HORRIBLE and cringe-worthy.

I am now dumber for having watched this video.

Not much information was shared, things weren't gone into in any detail, the questions were obviously canned, it was filmed on a set, seemed fake, and was not good.",1328313600,,285,4.916666666666667
7956070,1,B00005V3QA,"I sat down to watch the DVD with high hopes...which were dashed within 60 seconds of hitting the play button.

The whole set up was fake and distracting.  All the lines were scripted, including the ones where they are just sitting and having a casual chat, there was no feeling of reality in the whole DVD, there were several scenes that had me downright cringing, including the beginning scene where she makes the (fake?) grandparents re-do their welcoming of their new grandchild.  There is also a scene where a baby is completely undressed for a diaper change which takes so long that the baby is shivering by the end of it.  The baby bath scene also showed a cold and shivering baby (did they not have any heating on the set I wonder...?).  Also there are a few scenes where babies are shown being placed in their cribs with their heads almost touching the top end of the crib...what happened to the feet to foot principle so the babies can't wriggle too far down into their covers?  There was very litle content and wheat there was was useless.  Dont buy this DVD, save your money!",1296864000,,1086,4.538461538461538
7956071,1,B00005V3QA,"My husband and I thought the DVD would be a great ""Cliff's Notes"" version of the books...wrong. Terribly short and not really informative. Guess we just have to do it the old way and actually read the books!",1282003200,,207,4.473684210526316
7956072,2,B00005V3QA,"I'll join in with the other reviewers who recommend the book over the dvd.

Very rudimentary information and hardly complements the books.  I watched a portion of it before the cheesy acting and simplistic advice wore me down!  It went to the thrift store about two days after we received it!

If you have ZERO experience with babies, then you may find this dvd of some value... still, the book is sooo much better!

Avoid it.",1275177600,,426,4.552631578947368
7956073,1,B00005V3QA,"We found this DVD to be a waste of time...it might have been better for us if we had watched it before we had our baby. Much of the content focuses on changing diapers, and other basic baby things. We were looking for help with sleep training and the baby routine (which is included in Tracy Hoggs book), not how to give a baby a bath.",1268524800,,335,4.090909090909091
7956074,1,B00005V3QA,"My husband and I just tried to watch this DVD.  Luckily we only borrowed the DVD from the library.  Save your money.  This was easily the worst DVD I've seen on infant care to date.  What's up with all the horrible acting and the useless tips and facts? We could barely get through the first 10 mins.  This was in utter contrast to The Happiest Baby on the Block DVD that we just watched.  That was an excellent DVD.  If you want to spend money on a DVD re infant care, spend your money on the Happiest Baby on the Block DVD and don't waste time with this one.",1264550400,2,560,4.08256880733945
