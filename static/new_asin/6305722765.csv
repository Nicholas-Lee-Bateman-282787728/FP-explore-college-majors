1061509,3,6305722765,"Kill Cruise is a Dead Calm type thriller, the drama and suspense happening on board a yacht sailing from Gibraltar to Barbados. Jurgen Prochnow plays a washed out sailor. His best friend died at sea under suspicious circumstances and his wife left him soon after. He spends his days in the bars on Gibraltar, muttering his intention to sail away but never doing so. Elizabeth Hurley and Patsy Kensit play two English trollops idling their days away on the island till they decide to go to Barbados. Prochnow is reluctant to be recruited for this trip till provoked to prove he can still sail.

The strength of this movie lies in the very realistic irritations played out among three people in close quarters who don't quite trust each other. Patsy Kensit is the painfully self-centered one, vying for the skipper's attention and becoming increasingly jealous and vindictive when he favors Hurley's character. Hurley is submissive and vacuous. There seems to be some lesbian tension between the two girls that further complicates matters. Kensit's snipes at the skipper and paranoid discussions with Hurley escalate into life-threatening behavior. Just when we think things have settled down again there is an inexplicable horrific act.

Prochnow and Kensit are the better actors here, and the young Liz Hurley seems to be around as window dressing. I was still surprised that she was the one who went naked, however, in several love scenes with Prochnow. Both of the girls are very pretty, even if their characters are grating. The main problem of this movie is the ""twist"" at the end for which there was no motive.

There seem to be a hundred different editions of this movie out there, all released by different distributors. Either the studio sold the rights again and again to make a quick buck, or there's some bootlegging going on.",1104192000,4,1837,4.938511326860842
1061510,3,6305722765,"Despite the fact that my initial interest in this DVD was the opportunity to see Patsy Kensit, I actually found Jurgen Prochnow and Elizabeth Hurley to be far more entertaining as (respectfully) the skipper of a private yacht and a passenger desperately trying to reach the Bahama's.

Although her role is pivotal to the plot, Kensit plays her part as a whiney, insecure sidekick to Hurley's. Her character really only seems to serve as a catalyst to engender a bond between Prochnow's skipper and Hurley's flamboyant passenger in addition to adding some sense of reason to a twist at the end that has me still scratching my head.

This movie was marketed as another trip into ""Deep Calm"" waters but in actual fact the expected confrontation that the movie seems to be inevitably  steering towards never occurs, this probably greatly contributed to the lackluster performance of the movie but for me the picture took more interesting turns into examining some really warped human behavior and building distrust between the three people stuck on a small boat together for four weeks.

Prochnow plays a washed out sailor who, after a tragic event at sea, has not had the courage to leave port for months. Following an intoxicated meeting with two female entertainers (Kensit and Hurley) he subsequently finds out that he has agreed to take the two carefree women on a four week sail to the Bahama's.

What follows is a roller coaster of human emotion, suspense, sex (nudity from Hurley) and confusion. The movie however never seems to find its niche though and its twist is underwhelming and unsatisfying. So much more should have been delivered, especially with such an attractive cast, but the screen time and talent seems wasted.

Perhaps this is the reason this movie has been marketed under so many titles. Its original German title was `Der Skipper', but its also been named `The Storm.'",1102896000,11,1891,4.930817610062893
1061511,2,6305722765,"Jurgen Prochnow, best known for playing the captain of a German submarine in the classic DAS BOAT, once more demonstrates his prowess in fulfilling the role of a sailor.  This time, however, he portrays a washed-up sailor, and the dangers that lurk are far more insidious than the depth charges hurled at him in DAS BOAT.
This time around, he is an average-Joe who is hired by two gorgeous women to give them a ride on his schooner.  It's quite a long ride - about a month or more.  The 2 women are played by Elizabeth Hurley & Patsy Kensit.
So, you say, sounds like every man's fantasy, right?  To be out to sea with two lovely women all to himself - seems like a pretty good deal.  Only one catch:  both of them turn out to be borderline crazy.
Ultimately, there is but one reason to see this movie, and that's to see Kensit & Hurley sport an assortment of bikinis, halter tops, evening gowns & other sexy summmer clothes.  If you're disinterested in these things, you'll likely be disinterested in watching this film.  [The storyline isn't very good, nor is it particularly intriguing]
The film would have been better had it been saturated with nudity, but sadly it's not.  It appeared a few times that it was going in that direction, but the movie always seemed to pull back from the threshold at the last moment.
  Hence, if the fantasy of 2 women on a boat without land in sight is enough to keep your attention for a few hours, this one might be worth a look.  If not, you're better of staying on shore.",1077321600,32,1510,4.411552346570397
1061512,3,6305722765,"Okay, I won't kid you that this is a classic by any means, but it is one of a kind. Watch it only if you are a strict Liz Hurley Patsy Kensit fan, or a fan of watching otherwise good German actor Jurgen prochnow desperately trying to look convincing playing a German having fun.
Two English trollops convince sea captain Prochnow to take them on his boat to the West Indies, after a scene in a dance hall where they sing a song. It should be noted that one of the other customers in the bar bears a suspiciously striking resemblance to ex president Bill Clinton, so I guess it's that sort of bar.
Anyway, on board everyone goes stir crazy, there's twosome's, threesome's and onesome's (I assume that's what Captain prochnow is alluding to when he says that he is off to reset the sail).
There's sharks, Patsy covered in suntan oil, crossbows, needles and all sorts of intrigue, but for me the justify your existence as a filmaker scene is the lingering shot of the dog doing a big job on deck. The most painful scene is watching Jurgen pretending to be a party animal by dancing a little jig and singing ""hula hoo,hula hoo"".
There's a dopey surprise ending that doesn't make sense, but by then you really just want the film to end so you can rewind back to the scenes of Pats rubbing that suntan oil in.
Look, borrow this with a few mates who are into ironic viewing of dismal movies, otherwise give it a wide ""berth"".",1050105600,8,1418,4.395437262357414
1061513,1,6305722765,"Watching this, you just KNOW that important bits were edited out to protect the current reputation of Ms. Hurley.  The ending just comes out of left field - adding to the impression that something was taken out.  There are hints of a more than sisterly relationship between the two female leads but not enough to shore up the finale.  The only saving grace is the price is right!",1049673600,2,379,4.544117647058823
1061514,2,6305722765,"This one doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but it's still somewhat fun.  Hurley and Kensit, on a larth, go off on a boat with drunken sailor Prochnow.  Prochnow has a sort of shady past so there is a little bit of tension as sexual tension begins to develop between he and Hurley.  Kensit seems jealous, although whether it's for Prochnow or Hurley we're never really sure.
I don't mind not knowing what's going on, but I wish the filmmakers did.  Twists seem to come out of nowhere with no rhyme or reason.  At first, both women seem to view the skipper as a lesser being, a plaything for their amusement.  Then Kensit acts like a spoiled brat for no adequately explained reason.  The final twist comes out of left field.  Sure, I was surprised, but if a big squid would have popped up in the last scene and ate the ship I would be surprised too.  It doesn't mean it's a good ending.  The mysterious coda is the only reason to recommend this other than T & A.  Days later I found myself wondering exactly what did happen.  I guess they deserve points for that.
The DVD is pretty rare and cheap (in presentation).  If you like Dead Calm, but are sick of watching it, get this.  You might be pleasantly surprised.",1018483200,8,1213,4.357142857142857
1061515,1,6305722765,"This was not a very good movie. I had to sheepishly explain to my wife why we had just wasted two hours of our valuable time. I had read some reviews that indicated that this movie was actually worth watching.
Nothing could be farther from the truth! This movie was dry and boring the entire way through. And the suprise twist? An alien encounter would have made more sense.
And the ending... If a story has to finish with a paragraph explaining or expounding the ending, then there is definitely something wrong. Unless a story is a true story or added for humor, beware of movies that end with a paragraph on the screen. It means that even the writer didn't like the screenplay.
The only redeeming factor in this movie is that you get to see Elizabeth Hurley's chest, albeit from the side only.

1061516,3,6305722765,"The thing that strikes one about this film, when you first watch it, is whom is in it. Elizibeth Hurley, and patsy Kensit, are 2 dancers in a small sea-side town. They meet a sailor (jurgen) who offers to take them away, on  his sailing vessel.  One odd thing is that Jurgen is a Diabetic (something  which is made a large deal of later, when Patsy gets upset), and that the  film is intentionally misleading.  I'll not give away to much, but suffice  it to say, there's a suprise ending; and the film is over all, very creepy,  mostly for it's seeming realism at times.  All told, not a bad flick.",961804800,7,598,4.324324324324325

1061647,2,6305722765,"Not the worst movie I have ever seen yet definitely doesn't rise to a sufficient level of entertaining. What I had hopped for is a 'survival' themed movie with some level of suspenseful. What it was is '3 people forced together in a small space, some of them having a darker side than what's on the surface, and ultimately we know something bad is going to happen'. Being at sea is really just the way the movie forces them to remain together in a small space (they could have been in a mountain cabin snowed in and the story could have almost remained the same).
--The characters--
The Captain, a middle aged man, stoic to semi brooding, appears to be escaping (mentally and physically) from a failed relationship (he is heart broken over it I believe).
Passenger 1, approx 20 year old, very attractive female. Mostly care free and playful but seemingly level headed (at least for her age).
Passenger 2, approx 20 year old, very attractive female. Neurotic and impulsive, sometimes harmless, sometimes reckless
--Movie description--
Captain is taking his sail boat across the Atlantic, the two young female friends are catching a ride to a Caribbean island with the captain (they don't know the captain well, seemingly). Captain is serious acting, the female friends are looking for fun/vacation (the captain is trying to run a serious boat while the passengers are suntanning and being playful). Then, ultimately, issues/conflicts arise most especially between the neurotic female and the serious captain. All is not as it exactly seems though (any more would be a spoiler).

--Summary Points--
_The movie is older and lower budget so the a/v quality is lacking.
_At multiple points you will be saying ""that doesn't make sense"" due to a script that is written with too many moments of unrealistic actions/behaviors.(a certain act almost at the very end is so phony it isn't high school drama club worthy).
_2 of the 3 characters are hard to like and/or connect with (not good when you start saying ""just throw this character over the side to improve the movie"".
_It does have a small span of the story that is an interesting plot twist - definitely surprised me. Also, in general, the premise (and visuals) of being at sea on a nice boat for an extended period with dissimilar characters has a certain appeal. And from a sex appeal/sexual tension angle, Patsy Kensit and Elizabeth Hurly do provide it on several occasions. There's even one or two points where the boat is in a bit of peril, not much, to provide a little suspense. But it just isn't enough to save this movie from its script and production values. too bad, IMHO it had a decent premise to work with, actors of decent quality and characters that needed only a few tweaks to become interesting.",1431129600,3,2760,4.786163522012578

1061764,3,6305722765,"A trans-Atlantic voyage turns deadly in Kill Cruise (1990), a drama that mostly takes place on a small boat bound for Barbados.  Creatively shot, and featuring some solid acting performances, by Jurgen Prochnow, Patsy Kensit, and Elizabeth Hurley, the movie is an interesting character study, with some dramatic and emotional twists.

In a bar in the port of Gibraltar, English entertainers Su (Kensit) and Lou (Hurley), hook up with ""the Skipper"", a washed up mariner, who plans to take his boat the Bella Donna to Barbados.  The four week voyage with the two women aboard, is undertaken after a night of drinking, with virtually no thought or advance planning.

With little sailing experience, and mostly interested in having fun, the girls have brought along their dog, who fearlessly roams the deck without falling overboard.  The Skipper hasn't done much sailing, since a man died on his boat, and his wife left him.  Things start out fairly well, with the Skipper seemingly taking things in stride, but things begin to deteriorate, as Su begins acting up, while conversely, Lou becomes closer to the Skipper.

Things reach a critical point, when Su suspects that the Skipper may have killed his wife, and takes action that puts his life at risk.  The Skipper retaliates by tossing Su into the ocean, and dragging her behind the boat.  Just when things seem to have settled down, madness strikes, sealing the fate of all those aboard.

While not very realistic, the lively acting performances make Kill Cruise (aka Der Skipper) an interesting watch.

The first time I saw it, I was bored out of my mind; yet, I knew something was brewing underneath the surface. So, I watched until the end. Then I watched it a second time just to figure out what the heck I saw the first time. I was probably around 12 or so.

Anyway, the first time I viewed the film, I kept saying to myself: ""this is called Kill Cruise but nobody's dying on this cruise."" And that might be the biggest downfall of Kill Cruise: there's not much ACTION for the majority of the film. But there is something: a lingering tension and a couple of sex scenes.

What's funny is, I had no idea who Liz Hurley or Patsy Kensit were when I saw the movie. I knew their characters' names were Sue and Lou but by the end credits I got the names confused and thought Liz Hurley's name was actually Patsy Kensit and vice versa. It's humorous trying to get someone to recall an actress when you're giving them the wrong name.
