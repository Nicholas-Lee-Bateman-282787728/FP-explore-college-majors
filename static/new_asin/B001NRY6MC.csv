3722943,5,B001NRY6MC,I got the video super fast. Within a matter of a few days! The dvd arrived in pristine condition. My daughter absolutely loves her new dvd! Thanks so much for the easy transaction and I will do more business with this seller in the future!,1247961600,,239,4.333333333333333
3722944,5,B001NRY6MC,"If your too uptight to be 3 then go back to your Jacks Big Music Show. Yes JBMS is ok for you cerebral kid show watchers, but its no Bunnytown. The subplots for BT are hilarious for the young at heart, and not the phonies who portent they are young at heart... truly the JBMS people have their reward.
This show was one of the greatest losses to young peoples TV, and for that matter TV in its entirety. Personally I hope some evil is visited upon the bureaucratic fatcats who looked at one seasons ratings. Surly if BT had hacked ""know celebrities"" to boost its ratings, it would not be in cancellationland. Perhaps like Futurama, Firefly, or Star Trek the swelling of grassroot support will get a movie contract going. In conclusion to you nay sayers, in the words of the immortal Bender, ""bite my shiny metal ..."".",1247097600,,817,4.489932885906041

3722946,5,B001NRY6MC,My 20 month old adores Bunnytown and after Disney took it off he was lost. He just got the DVD for Easter and WOW was he happy to see it again. Hopefully they will do a 2nd DVD with other episodes. Especially the one's with Melvin he loves him!!!,1240185600,4,246,4.040816326530612
3722947,5,B001NRY6MC,Both my daughter and husband enjoyed this show when it was on on Disney.  It was a great gift for both of them.  They enjoy dancing and singing to the music.,1240099200,4,157,4.032258064516129
3722948,5,B001NRY6MC,"We have been waiting over a year for this - since Disney took it off the cable.  It is outstanding and our 2 year old and even our 6 year old likes it.  Hopefully, there will be more!",1239580800,6,183,3.789473684210526
3722979,5,B001NRY6MC,"My kids were having to get on the internet to find these older videos. It is not only easier, but I feel more comfortable with them watching the DVD than the unpredictable internet. I do wish there were more episodes, but the kids don't seem to mind watching the same ones over and over.",1403827200,,287,4.333333333333333
3722980,5,B001NRY6MC,"My kids are huge fans, this is the second time we buy this Bunnytown DVD, the first copy we bought a few years ago is beyond scratched now. I just hope Amazon doesn't run out of these 'cause I can already see myself buying another copy in 2 years!",1398124800,,247,4.061224489795919
3722981,5,B001NRY6MC,Bunnytown is a fun DVD to watch!  The bunnies are so cute and it has a lot of catchy tunes.  It's a wonderful and colorful place.  My 2 year old loves it and so do I.  I would love to get a different DVD if they have one.  I highly recommend it!,1391126400,,245,3.6346153846153846
3722982,5,B001NRY6MC,"My granddaughter (2 1/2) has recently fallen in love with Bunnytown! Since it is only available on Disney Jr occasionally between scheduled programing, I decided to get her a DVD that we can play for her anytime! She was so excited Christmas morning when she opened it! We took it with us in the car for the hour ride to our big family celebration and she watched it on her DVD player in the car,,,she giggled the whole way on the car ride!!",1388102400,,441,4.325301204819277
3722983,5,B001NRY6MC,"The kids love this show.  I disagree that it is not educational.  It presents illogical situations which children notice, then finish up a series of these through the show with the correct and logical conclusion.  My little one loved those scenes.  Silly, zany humor for kids.",1384387200,,276,4.934782608695652
3722984,5,B001NRY6MC,"My son loves this DVD!  He plays games on Disney and told me all about the game. So when he saw this movie, he kept asking if he could have it.  He watched this for hours!!!!",1369699200,,174,3.8055555555555554
3722985,5,B001NRY6MC,"I originally saw this series in Disney Playhouse.  My kids were watching it and I thought that the bunnies were awfully funny.  The music is very witty and the jokes are very funny.  I always end up laughing my heart out.

So where's the next DVD?  I wish there were more episodes of this available..",1365033600,,300,4.381818181818182
3722986,5,B001NRY6MC,"Bunnytown was the cutest show on earth!!! I don't know why it was cancelled but I wish they would bring it back. It had adorable characters, cute little stories and one little bunny would make trips into the human world and watch wither Red and Fred in a sort of Charlie Chaplin sketch, or watch Pinky Pinkerton host Super Silly Sports. It's a totally harmless show that's great for children. I adore Bunnytown!!",1329264000,4,412,4.657534246575342
3722987,4,B001NRY6MC,"Our daughters love the TV show, so we decided to get this DVD. As to the quality of the video/audio, 5 stars. Now we thought it would be a 96-minute movie, but it was actually ""just"" four episodes from the TV, which they had already seen. The chapters are great, but not enough. We'd like to see more episodes coming, even better if it was in a single DVD.",1304812800,,356,4.173913043478261
3722988,5,B001NRY6MC,"this was an easter present for my 3 1/2 year old.  he loves it, and being Disney I don't have to worry about bad language or behavior.  I find myself singing along to the songs, there are lots of them and for the most part they are really cute, not annoying.  My fave is disco pirate bunnies.",1272499200,2,292,4.087719298245614
