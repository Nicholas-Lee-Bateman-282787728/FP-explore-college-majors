8584619,2,B00CPPFEWM,"Its difficult to find these types of moves. It did say movies made from 1970. 1980, etc. But I expected the quality to be up to 2013, or at least not like somebody actually took an old VCR tape and copied it. Poor quality. Not worth 9.95, let alone 39.95. Quality really poor. Shipping was bad, cheap padded envelope. Two DVD cases were broke. DVD was okay, but really for the price its not worth it. Sorry I even bought it. will be thrown away.",1389571200,4,445,4.247058823529412
