2014654,1,B0001ME5GW,"[...]. That dude either has some personal interest in this stinkfest, or he doesn't know horror (possibly both).
I could compose an endless tirade on how incredibly awful this piece of dung is, but, even that could not prepare the viewer adequately.
Leave this one alone, and if you happen to see it in your local video store, point and laugh hysterically at the package as you walk by.
A couple of decent boob shots is not worth the cost of the time you'll waste screaming at your television over this one, trust me. It really doesn't even rate the one star that I gave it, but, that's the lowest grade I was allowed to give.",1132963200,,626,4.405172413793103
2014655,1,B0001ME5GW,"This is such a crap. These camcorder-shots are not realistic but ridiculous. Group talk is simple and annoying, the ghosts are old fashioned with their halloween-contactlenses. The invitation-mailing takes so much time that at the end valerie has to be killed very quickly (and very uninspired). So this is one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. It's at least just a nice piece for a 13 year old boy to see some breastesses (if he hasn't any other choice) - but this has nothing to do with horror. Forget it and save your money!!!",1121904000,2,538,4.614583333333333
2014656,1,B0001ME5GW,"I bought this movie because of the first review written.  I just about want to kick my own butt.  This movie is lower than a B-rated movie.  It's an F rated one!  Someone shot it with a camcorder and thought it would be fun to film people from below their chins, angled upward.  I got so tired of looking up people's noses.  I started to think I was watching Blair Witch, but snot never flowed.  Anyway, if I had it to do all over again, I would've spent that 90 minutes pulling out my toenails.  Seriously.  Don't bother with this one, unless you are completely drunk and want to watch a stupid comedy.",1119571200,4,603,4.265486725663717
2014657,4,B0001ME5GW,"I ordered that movie not knowing a thing about it. I just knew that it was a BRAIN DAMAGE release and that it was cheap enough to give it a try.

 Now let me tell you something... That flick is awesome !! I was expecting a low budget gorefest instead I got a REAL SCARY movie : the type that makes your girlfriend grab your arm and that makes you jump in your seat. I mean, the beginners who only know SCREAM and such are going to wet their pants, for real.

The plot is simple. A group of old school friends, who all share the guilt of having "" accidently "" caused the death of a nerdy kid during their childhood, are invited to a country hotel. They all meet there, start to party and there you go... weird things start to happen. It soon becomes clear that DEAD CHILDREN are in the house.

 I've said too much already. It is beautifully shot, most of the actors are allright and even mannage to add some depth to their characters. You care for them and, of course, it makes the whole thing more believable and scary. Now being MR GORYSSIMO I can't give that movie 5 stars because of the gore being too low. But don't get me wrong, INVITATION rules and will, like I said, give enough scares as it is.

That movie shouldn't be ignored any longer. Take MR GORYSSIMO's word and accept the INVITATION.",1107388800,,1299,4.238866396761134

2014720,1,B0001ME5GW,"Thought this looked interesting for a Prime pick, and a few moments in I realized I'd watched it before. But I could remember nothing about it at all. I flipped forward several times all the way to the end to remind myself what it had been about. Vaguely remembered watching it, dimly remembered the ending, realized what a pointless movie it had had been, and decided I must have purged it from my memory banks. I suggest you not waste your time.",1392940800,,447,4.463414634146342

2014723,3,B0001ME5GW,"This movie is kinda weird.  It reminds me of the movies I used to see on Saturday afternoons.  Its low budget but its still kinda cool.

The flashing at the end of the movie may be too much for people with photosensitivity.

Overall, its just a ghost story that is worth a couple dollars to see.",1369958400,,295,4.214285714285714
2014724,3,B0001ME5GW,"There will be no awards given out for this movie and I will forget it within a week, of that I am sure. But I did have a pretty good time watching the movie despite its lack of originality, barebones quality acting and direction by someone who probably did his job by cell phone.
Not a bad rental. I wouldn'tt buy the thing to save my life but very well worth a rental.",1367020800,8,369,4.068493150684931
2014725,2,B0001ME5GW,"This movie starts out well with the play-lot scene and the ending is effective; much more professional than ALL that comes in-between the beginning and the end.  Henry's affected speech and animation along with the nosy neighbor was embarrassing.  The major characters were a little better but still very inexperienced.  And, why is it people carry lanterns around in a house that had electricity on just a few moments earlier?  I guess that adds spook power- not.  Mist, poor lighting, dark rooms, cobwebs, and weird lights were OTT (over the top). The children and costumes were a plus. Too bad the interesting story line suffered under the rest of the movie.",1365120000,3,661,4.918918918918919

2014727,5,B0001ME5GW,"When I give INVITATION 5 stars, I'm comparing it to other low-budget films. I am NOT putting it up against THE EXORCIST, THE SHINING, or any other multi-million dollar horror epic. So, yes, it is cheaply made, has no name stars, and has that cheezy ""soap opera"" look. However, it is well-made considering its limitations. I found it semi-creepy, mysterious, and entertaining enough to watch it again. The rural lodge setting w/ its bizarre caretaker and host of potential victims is nice and compact. My only complaint would be that it could have been a few minutes shorter. Also available on DECREPIT CRYPT OF NIGHTMARES...",1258848000,7,624,4.9523809523809526
8014555,3,B0001ME5GW,"Invitation begins by showing a group of little kids playing a game of baseball.  When one kid hits a ball over the fence one of the boys goes to get it.  It rolls onto the road and he gets hit by a truck.  The other kids stand there looking on in disbelief.

We now see a man and woman making out in bed.  They receive a paper message in an envelope from someone encouraging them to reunite with old friends at some cabin.  A convenience store guy gets the same mysterious message on his cash register when he steps outside for a moment and returns.  A girl leaving for work, a girl on her computer, a cute girl doing exercises and a man in a recording studio all get these mysterious envelopes when they either leave the room for a moment, turn around or check the front door.  It's almost comical when the envelope appears and suddenly the same haunting music plays.

We see a blonde woman in her bathroom taking a pregnancy test.  She's pregnant but doesn't seem happy and doesn't know how to break the news to her boyfriend.  They discuss the boyfriend's waterproof watch and he mentions they haven't been together since the funeral of someone's mom.  The boyfriend wants his girlfriend to marry him.  She says ""We've been over this.  We're best friends!""  She says she loves him.  We now see a baseball mysteriously rolling around by itself in an old man's cabin.  He says he's Henry the caretaker as the one dude who received the reuniting envelope shows up before the others.  I was going to use the word ""reunification"" but it's not actually a longer word for ""reuniting"" and actually means ""a restoration of political unity to place or group, especially a divided territory"" so I'd rather not use the word ""reunification"" if you don't mind.

The cute girl doing exercises shows up next.  She enters a bathroom and uses it.  A man appears in front of her stall.  This makes her nervous and she forgets to wipe.  The one guy who shows up to the cabin has trouble communicating with his office job friend who's also supposed to show up because the phone is suddenly filled with static.  A boyfriend and girlfriend who are driving around lost show up to a store looking for someone who can help them.  A creepy man with poor acting skills tells them the location.  The friends begin to show up, except the one guy working at his office.  He hears something odd when he walks around.

The group of friends catch up on old times and want to check out the lake.  An old lady shows up and asks where Henry is.  She warns the group of young men and women to leave.  ""People come and never leave"".  They say ""We'll be careful and if we see anything strange we'll be sure to let you know!""  The old lady says ""I know they're here somewhere!""  The friends say ""The only other person here is Henry"".  The teens think it's cabin fever the old lady is going through and reference the Shining.

The movie gets boring for a few minutes.  The guys mention the friend's recording studio and his hit song, then bring up the one guy's girlfriend from high school.  Henry ominously comes in and mentions the canoe on the lake.  The friends tell Henry about the old lady and the things she said.  Henry says she has cabin fever.  She's been all alone since her husband vanished.  The women friends discuss how the one boyfriend hasn't given the blonde girl an engagement ring yet.  She can't believe it's been 7 years without a ring.  Her friends think it's her job being the reason, or perhaps the boyfriend isn't making enough money.  The blonde girl brings up sex.  She doesn't admit she's pregnant when the other girls wonder if she might be the reason behind her and her boyfriend not being married yet.  Meanwhile the guy at his office job gets stuck in the elevator.  The ghosts don't want him to reunite with his friends I guess!

The one male friend says they need to bring up the death of the little boy who died at the baseball field.  And wow, how heartless these people are.  They joke about his enormous grave because he was big, and the one girl says maybe 10 years ago they would've cared about his death but not now.  The one girl says he was creepy but the male friend says ""He was 11"".  They go through with the tribute anyway.  The guy in the elevator is free, but he senses something is wrong with the elevator when he leaves.  He panics as he heads to his car feeling the presence of something.

The old lady who warned the teens to leave is at home having strange dreams.  She wakes up saying ""Why don't they ever listen to me!"" worried for the teens safety.  Around the campfire the teens reminisce about old times.  The old lady walks around the woods saying ""They're here!""  The blonde woman says to her boyfriend he's a kind and compassionate man when he feels he embarrassed himself by bringing up the death of that boy.  He says ""You always know how to make me feel better"".  She then says ""Marry me!""

Someone knocks the old lady out and she wakes up buried in the ground before being run over by a rototiller.  What the!  Henry's the one controlling the rototiller!  The one girl named Jenny who criticized the deceased boy explains why she acted the way she did.  She said she missed the whole incident and ""Just because he died doesn't suddenly make him a good kid.  He's still the fat weird kid we grew up with and will remember him for"".  Wow, just wow.  So many ways to pick apart this girl's silly heartless words.  The teens admit they made his life hard but he wasn't a bad kid.  Jenny at least agrees that making fun of him now is sick.

As the blonde woman is about to tell her boyfriend she's pregnant their own friend interrupts the moment by barging in wearing a clown mask.  He takes the mask off and apologizes to the guy  for criticizing him for simply bringing up the deceased boy.  I think an apology is a good thing here because they were out of line!  He understands his friend was simply bringing up a deceased boy who was killed tragically.  No reason to make fun of someone bringing up a tragedy, or the victim of said tragedy.

While Jenny's getting changed -the same girl who criticized that deceased boy by the way- she hears something strange in the house after changing into her bathing suit.  While at the lake she sees a strange woman who looks possessed.  She dunks Jenny's head into the water and drowns her.  How odd the first friend to die is the one that *should* have died!  Okay that sounds harsh.  Not *really* die of course, but she's surely the ungrateful one of the bunch!  Usually these characters don't get what's coming to them until later on.

The teens leave the campfire and head to the cabin for the night.  The one girl has a nightmare that she's revisiting that baseball game as a kid.  One of the guys dreams a woman is jumping on top of him sexually then turns into a monster.  He wakes up saying ""There's a dead woman in my room!"" but the other friends assume it's a dream the way he worded it (even though I wouldn't have!)  Another girl says she had a dream children were on top of her.  They check the room but when they open the closet stuff falls out.  The one guy friend says ""It's an old house- it's going to make noises"".  The guy recommends checking on Jenny by the lake.

The guys go to check on Jenny at the lake and question if the old lady's right.  The friend answers that a few bad dreams and creepy noises doesn't mean something horrible is happening.  The one guy at the office is driving to his destination.  He still hasn't arrived!  He envisions hitting that little boy at the baseball game.  While searching the woods the two girls from the group discover a pair of shoes and get flashbacks of the little boy who died at the basement game.  Meanwhile the blonde girl's inside taking a shower.  The one guy discovers Jenny.  She's possessed with her eyes wide and just standing there.  She doesn't want to come with him so he says ""Suit yourself I'm outta here!""

He heads home and sees Jenny again!  He turns around again to sees Jenny, then falls down and passes out on a rock his head hit.  Inside the cabin the blonde girl says someone was watching her take a shower.  It was Keith, the guy who went to check on Jenny.  The girls say they heard a voice that sounded like Jenny but the guys aren't sure.  They say something strange is going on here.  They think that journal might explain what's happening here.  The other teens discuss waiting for Keith and Jenny to return.  When the one girl grabs the journal her boyfriend hides behind a corner.  It looks like he's trying to scare her but when she returns with the journal she sees her boyfriend hanging above a floorless room... until she looks again and sees an empty room.

She runs downstairs and tells her friends that her boyfriend just disappeared.  She says she saw herself enter a room that wasn't there when she first went inside.  It was filled with smoke and her boyfriend was dead.  When she looked again the smoke and her boyfriend were gone.  In the journal they read something about children.  Outside the man sees Jenny possessed and standing in a shed.  The journal mentions the accidental poisoning of a little girl.  Her mother seduced a salesman while her husband was at work.  Another story- a person died tragically while playing hockey on a lake.  The book mentions nothing but children dying in tragic ways so the one friend thinks this place is meant to collect ghostly children.

They find the story about the little boy who was hit by a truck at the baseball game.  The guy friend tells the ladies to get outside now!  Their cars are gone.  The office job man who envisioned that wreck earlier was actually involved in the wreck.  He's lying on the ground bleeding.  He tells these ghost children to call for help.  He tries to run away but the ghost kids blast a stake through his body.  In the cabin the boyfriend of the blonde girl thinks we have a haunted house prank happening here.  He thinks it's a tourist attraction and Henry's in on it.

The one guy in the cabin says he sees their friends outside, but the other girl says ""How's that possible?  I just saw them go upstairs!""  They explore the upstairs and see locked doors.  One of the girls says ""I ain't going down there!"" as she walks down a hallway when suddenly cobwebs wrap around her neck, lift her up and strangle her.  I guess she's right, she ain't going down there!  The others realize this is no prank except for that stubborn boyfriend.

Another girl gets stabbed in the stomach.  Meanwhile some older guy enters the house and sees a baseball rolling around on the floor.  He tries to pick it up but a nearby shovel lifts itself up in the air and cuts his head off.  This should provide quite the sight when the teens return downstairs!  The boyfriend and blonde girlfriend see intense flickering as they walk to the attic.  The boyfriend says ""If this is a prank it's a pretty darn good one!""  He still insists it's a prank.  Just then a bunch of images pass by and the boyfriend and his blonde girlfriend are standing outside on a road.  Huh, how did they get here?  A truck comes by and hits them as the movie ends.  What kind of ending is that!!

What the heck man!  Otherwise the movie has okay characters (even though most of them show no sympathy for the boy who died which, regardless how long ago it was when it happened, is weird from my point of view).  The atmosphere is okay too.  It's an average movie at best with nothing particularly great about it though.  It feels like the characters should have been given more time to expand, and Jenny's possessed character should have done more horrible things instead of stand around ominously.  I barely recommend Invitation.",1501977600,,11733,4.438703616721465

Okay, this is a decently acted movie for a horrible script, the dialogue is almost painful to listen to. It took a lot of good things from other horror movies and tv shows and just kind of butchered them. I almost reached through the screen and smacked ""keith"" for doing a horrible jack Nicholson impersonation, (ah! but i knew what he was trying to do! so it must have been good! nope. i had on captions because the volume was horrible on this movie and the closed caption said ""impersonating jack Nicholson"" so that's how i know.) In case you didn't know i hated keith in general, not the actor, just the character.

You would hope the entire plot has more of a point but it doesn't, it doesn't really explain itself, it just kind of whimpers and fades (or in this movie's case, flashes out) You see where the plot was going, but they prefer to just focus on showing some cliche horror stunts, and campfire scenes.  Also, was the neighbor lady supposed to be a horrible homage to the log lady from twin peaks, because that is insulting, the writing i mean, not the actress. Sigh.
