2169383,3,B00065GX8C,"There is no way that this fourth season will capture the enthusiastic responses from fans of the previous seasons. Although some shows can survive the departure of a lead character, it seems unlikely here. Fans of the previous seasons will both enjoy and loath this new season, and new fans will not be attracted. Watching these episodes one cannot but realize how integral Jeff was to the show's success and how much everyone else functioned mainly in supporting roles. Think of those ""Jeff-ism"" episodes that you have forced visitors in your house to sit down and watch (""I've got too many legs"" ""Oh, Jeffrey"" etc.) and then bemoan the absence of anything in this series that comes remotely close to matching those. It is somewhat sad that one of funnier scenes in the entire series involves a dream sequence in which Jeff ""returns.""The Oliver character struggles through some horribly written lines with abysmally-timed comedic acting but does become believable, if not likeable, by the end. And yes the other characters do mature, Sally, Jane and Patrick becoming less neurotic, less crazy, and less dumb along the way...but it must be said, also perhaps less funny too. Gone as well are the clever storylines: nothing rivals the innovation of the temporaly displaced Hebrew-English translation, nor the time-shifted split screen episodes for example. Instead we have a collection of fantasy bits that while funnier than Allie McBeal are often less so than Scrubs for instance.

Bottom line is that there is nothing here that one will watch and enjoy in two decades time as one can (and indeed does) with the entire Faulty Towers series or with selected gems from the Doctor in the House series, and I expect one will with a handful of selected episodes from the first three seaons of Coupling.

So should you buy it or wait until it is shown (again for some) on American television? If you are a big fan you have probably bought it already. If, however, you thought the first 3 seasons were hit and miss, you should do the latter here. It must be admitted though that even after all the criticism, even an average episode (and you have 6 of them here) is still better than 4/5ths of large network sitcoms from this side of the Atlantic.",1107129600,5,2241,4.803108808290156
2169384,4,B00065GX8C,"I have been a big fan of this show from the very first season. It is funny, a little edgy (at least in comparison to American shows) and very entertaining. So of course I was anxiously awaiting the start of the fourth season. Even thought fourth season remained funny, I could not believe that my favorite character - Jeff was no longer part of it. I was and still am puzzled by it, how do you replace the funniest character on the show?

Instead we get a less sympathetic and not as funny knockoff called Oliver. And even though Moffat tried to put Oliver in Jeff-like situations with same type of dialog, it's just not the same. I won't Jeff back. In addition to Jeff's departure, it seems like the whole show got toned down a notch. I guess I got used to this show to be unbelievably funny and changes made to it do not seem to make it better. However, like I said before it is still very funny and I will be watching it many times till the next season comes out.",1106956800,2,966,4.221621621621622
2169385,2,B00065GX8C,"I was dismayed to discover early in the first episode of Season 4 that Jeff was aparently already en route to Lesbos (!) and wouldn't be seen for the remainder of the Series!

Instead we get this inserted look & sound-alike, called Oliver, who Moffatt gives all the Jeff-like lines & situations to, but the poor Newbie just can't handle them, and anyone who has got as far as Season 4 with the wonderful (so-far) 'Coupling' will be just left cringing and WISHING Jeff could be there delivering the lines in HIS inimitable and wonderfully zany and accomplished  way!

The rest of the cast are Wonderful, as we have come to expect & love, but each time the Oliver character appears, one is left feeling like fingernails have been dragged down a blackboard, and the whole scene is ruined by it.

Stick with Seasons 1 - 3 !",1105488000,9,819,4.513513513513513
2169386,5,B00065GX8C,"I have been a huge fan of this show from the beginning.  This DVD's release date isn't for a few months, but I wanted to share my insights.  The fourth season starts a few weeks after the end of the third season left off, with lots of new twists and turns, great jokes, and compelling stories.  The bad news is that Richard Coyle, who plays Jeff, left the show (the character travels to the isle of Lesbos, and you fans can easily decipher the joke, I'm sure).  But the good news is that a new character named Oliver, played by Richard Mylan, is an enjoyable enough replacement, despite having big shoes to fill.  Here is a recap of the six episodes (if you haven't seen the finale of season three, then there might be some spoilers):

1.) 9 1/2 Minutes - A well-written story from three interweaving points of view, taking place in the bar: a.) Patrick and Sally encounter their first major conflict in their new relationship; b.) Susan is upset with Steve when he shares his odd view about her pregnacy; c.) Jane fears her blind date is her gynecologist, but it turns out to be a goofy guy named Oliver, who runs a sci-fi bookstore.

2.) Nightlines - Relationship troubles lead to a late-night phone call between Susan, Sally, Steve, and Patrick.  Out of the blue, Jane joins into the conversation, and it is revealed that she keeps a key to her ex-lover's flat.  But it's not who we expected.  Meanwhile, Oliver receives a visit at his store from his ex-girlfriend Tamsin, whom Susan befriended earlier in the day at a seminar for pregnant women.

3.) Bed Time - A battle of wits develops between Patrick and Sally, as Patrick attemps to go home after sex, and Sally finds ways to make him spend the night at her place.  Later, Sally hosts a dinner party and Oliver, Jane's date to the party, worries about his ""nipple erections"".

4.) Circus of the Epidurals - Steve and Susan attend an antenatal class, with Tamsin, Sally, Jane, Oliver, and Patrick in tow.  The instructor turns out to be Jill (Jane's former therapist from season one's ""Inferno"").  Steve and the other men in the class are baffled about why a woman in labor would refuse painkillers, leading to a standoff between him and Jill.

5.) The Naked Living Room - The evolution Oliver's flat has gone through after his break-up with Tamsin is shown, becoming ""unedited"" as the months pass.  He runs into Jane at the supermarket one day, and completely panics when she asks him to bring her up to his flat.  Later, Susan begins to go into labor.

6.) 9 1/2 Months - While waiting for Susan to begin childbirth at the hospital, Steve falls asleep and dreams that a female version of Jeff has returned from Lesbos.  Steve recaps the events of the day to her: a.) Sally and Patrick's relationship changes when she learns the truth about one of his previous partners, and then she discovers a mysterious box hidden in Patrick's video cupboard; b.) Oliver's romantic night with Jane is foiled by the arrival of Steve and Susan on the way to the hospital, and he wonders if Jane still has feelings for Steve.  Finally, Steve and Susan's baby is born.

Overall, an excellent group of episodes with many funny and touching moments.  And although the character of Oliver doesn't match the greatness of Jeff's character, fans should still give him a chance.  I highly recommend this DVD, which I'll purchase when it is finally released.",1097712000,60,3391,4.613333333333333

Oliver just misses the mark. He doesn't fit in with the group well. He is a sad, odd little man, more pathetic than funny. Steve and Susan face some emotional turmoil as Susan begins to grow and her body changes. Patrick and Sally face their biggest relationship problems yet. They appear to try and change Jane to show some maturity growth and she looses a lot of the spunk she had before, she was more fun as crazy, wacky Jane. Considering this was the final season, the ending is a narrative from Steve's point of you. He admits that he is not a man or father that Susan deserves. I understand that the situation they were in isn't funny and they were trying their best to put in some comic relief. But the ending was just lacking. Something better would've been a tiny glimpse just to show the 6 of them together for a final moment. They quickly ran through every story while Susan was in labor. I'm glad we found Steve's heart melting and the promise that he could be a good father to his son.",1434758400,,1164,4.4186046511627906

Right off the bat the first episode will grab you.  The script is wonderful as all 3 plots intertwine in a way that isn't cheesy or easily seen.  This type of foresight doesn't end after the first episode.  All of the acting from front to back is very sharp.  The other bad acting is from extras, you'll see what I mean.

The first three seasons were outstanding and I will admit, I did enjoy the fourth season, however, it was no where near the first three seasons.  The six main players fit together so well that is was almost like having your family together at Thanksgiving or Christmas.  The loss of Jeff and the decision to make Susan pregnant was, in my mind a fatal mistake.  When this type of show moves away from the original premise of single men and women having a good time and seek to make the show about a more serious relationship, then what follows is doom.  Did I like the show?  Enough to say that I have watched the first three seasons about 3 or 4 times.  I just recently got the fourth season from Amazon and finished it a few minutes ago.  I am sad that was the end, but am sadder that it was such a let-down, but over-all this is still the best show I have seen on T.V.",1346544000,,1113,4.12037037037037

Bad.  Painfully bad.

I do not exaggerate here when I say I didn't laugh once.  Not even a chuckle.  Whereas before I would laugh until my sides hurt, Season 4 left me feeling uncomfortable.  Dismayed.  Wondering what had gone so wrong where everything previously had gone so right.

It wasn't just Jeff being gone.  The writing was off, as was the acting.  The feeling of camaraderie was gone.  The characters had lost their depth, and the actors delivered their lines in a way that seemed forced.

Richard Coyle could have played the character of Oliver and made it hysterical. It is the absolute over-acting by Mylan in every scene. His scenes are just painful and are to be ff through.

2169429,1,B00065GX8C,"...you get Season 4 of ""Coupling"". For 3 seasons this was a brilliant, brilliant comedy that combined a terrific spot-on cast with the writing talents of Steven Moffat. Absolute magic.

I have no clue why Richard Coyle left the series thereby removing his character Geoff. Perhaps (perhaps, perhaps) he sensed that the series was heading toward the shark tank and decided to bail before the decidedly un-funny Sally-Patrick relationship storyline gained momentum. Whatever the case, I prefer to think of the series as ending at the conclusion of Season 3.

There were certainly funny moments in Season 4. Jack Davenport as Steve, Gina Bellman as Jane, and Ben Miles as Patrick were all tremendously talented comedians. But the writing began to suffer as the voices of Sally and Susan began to sound like fingernails on a chalkboard rather than provide humour. What was a tremendously funny comedy series that provided me with some of the best belly-laughs I've ever had became a mire of gender gap jokes that weren't as funny as they were sad and pathetic. I began to emit courtesy laughs just to cover for the obvious embarrassment of the actors. Then I just turned off the tube altogether. A sad conclusion indeed. In the end you could just see the shark tank looming up ahead.",1178409600,11,1279,4.862385321100917
2169430,4,B00065GX8C,"I have to admit it. I'm a ""Coupling"" freak. This BBC comedy import about the trials and tribulations of the dating & mating rituals of six British singles is a wonderful piece of entertainment. I can watch this series over and over again and still keep finding enjoyment from both the big laughs and the soap opera-ish drama. It dosn't seem to get old no matter how many times I watch it.  Whenever, I come to the end of the final season, I always have just a twinge of sadness. It's seems like the show is being wrapped up, yet it leaves you wanting more.

The main story arc of Season 4 (SPOILER ALERT! IF YOU HAVN""T SEEN SEASON 3!!) revolves around Susan's pregnancy. At the very end of Season 3, Susan announced to boyfriend, Steve Taylor ""Times up Steve, I think it's someone else's turn to be a child."" And that pretty much sums up, what Susan and Steve fight about, over the course of six episodes as Steve must get over his fears of impending fatherhood (including dreams of ax welding fetuses) and the emotional commitment that comes along with it.

Other storylines include Sally and Patrick's eventual recognition, that they really are ment for each other. The only thing getting in the way is Patrick's long & storied sexual past (well documented and locked away in the cupboard) and Sally's jealousy and lack of self-regard. Meanwhile the insanely self-involved, Jane is introduced to the desperate new guy, Oliver Morris (replacement for the departing Richard Coyle's Jeff). During the course of the season an interesting flirtation begins to grow between these two and actually adds a little depth to Jane's wacky character.

There are some wonderful episodes. I love the insanely long and out of control phone call from ""Nightlines"", where the entire cast gets to comment about the various inter-relationships. ""Bedtime"" is also hilarious, while we watch both a literal and figurative game between Sally and Patrick, over where to spend the night. We also get a sequel of sorts, when Jane's eternally perturbed, former psychiatrist raises the ghost of the ""Lesbian Spank Inferno"" in the very funny episode, ""Circus of the Epidurals"". A personal favorite of mine is ""The Naked Living Room"", where Oliver's fear of Jane seeing his flat ""unedited"", leads us to some very sexy (and funny!) scenes.

To be perfectly honest, while Season 4 is quite enjoyable, it is a tad sub-par to the preceding three. But thats' like complaining, that your favorite baseball team is only hitting triples, instead of homeruns, everytime it comes up to bat. One problem might be Richard Coyle's sudden departure from the cast. It seems to have upset the show's perfect chemistry. The other problem is in the last episode, where it appears that Series Creator, Steve Moffat is trying to both tie up the storylines with broad stokes, but still leaves some nagging details unanswered. In other words, we are sort of left hanging. Will Sally & Patrick make it as a couple? What's with Jane's mysterious comments about, who she really cares about? And what's with the uncharacteristicly serious tone of Steve's last words about the birth? The last show of the Series leaves us wanting more!

Despite these small complaints, ""Coupling"" is still a wonderfully funny show, that will leave you addicted to big laughs. I only wish there was another season! Highly recommended!",1174608000,3,3360,4.885964912280702

2169436,5,B00065GX8C,"I think it's time to clear up some of the debate over Coupling's love-it-or-hate-it fourth season.

The fourth season is a huge departure, because all of a sudden the show is about monogamy instead of swinging. Everyone is growing up, just about everyone feels out of their depth and Jeff's mythical trip to Lesbos leaves a noticable gap in the group. That being said, I laughed harder while watching the season 4 episodes than I had since I first watched season 1. For anyone who has ever gotten pregnant, had a baby and/or been dragged kicking and screaming into adulthood, season 4 offers a terrific chance to recognize yourself in the Coupling characters and get a good chuckle out of the experience. The neverending phone call, the disastrous ""antenatal"" class, Steve's obsession with potential damage to Susan's ""equipment"" -- the satire is just as real, the jokes just as spot-on as it was in the first season.

That being said, all my single friends who have not yet experienced their ""John Hurt moment"" don't see what's so funny. So my best advice is, if you're still in the dating scene, stop at season 3. If you watch Coupling because you remember when life was like that and wouldn't go back to it if someone paid you, I can highly recommend season 4. I respect a show that can grow up the way Coupling has been willing to, and I like the fact that it has something to appeal to most people regardless of their current stage of life.",1152921600,7,1445,4.596899224806202

2169440,4,B00065GX8C,"If you were disappointed when you learned there were only two discs for Series Four of ""Coupling,"" then the news that there are only episodes on the first of those two discs is going to be downright depressing. Given the results I have seen to date I appreciate the British idea of avoiding having a set number of episodes in any given series (read ""season"" on this side of the Pond) because that increases the quality of what we see a lot more than the American model, which is driven towards the goal of having one hundred episodes that usually translate into profitable syndication. But only six episodes to get us through Steve trying to deal with Susan's pregnancy, Sally and Patrick's serious relationship, and Jane's close encounters with Oliver, the new guy, fans have to feel Series 4 comes up short (and that is before we ever come to terms with that new guy replacing Jeff).

This series takes us from ""Nine and a Half Minutes"" to ""Nine and a Half Months,"" and since the previous series ended with Susan (Sarah Alexander) announcing she is pregnant it is not surprising that this one ends with the birth of the baby. We have seen writer Steven Moffat play with time and space before (e.g., ""The Girl With Two Breasts"" from Series 1 and ""Split"" from the start of Series 2), and he continues along those lines in these two episodes. ""Nine and a Half Minutes"" gives us the same time frame from the perspective of each couple, while ""Nine and a Half Months"" finds Steve (Jack Davenport) unstuck in time (and having his weirdest dreams ever) as Susan goes into labor.

With Susan being pregnant her relationship with Steve is pretty much reduced to his complete and total fear over the miracle of birth. Dragging him to antenatal classes (""Circus of the Epidurals"") is the disaster you would imagine. But overall the best moments for Series 4 come from watching Sally (Kate Isitt) and Patrick (Ben Miles) become closer. The sticking point becomes whether or not Patrick has slept with Jane (Gina Bellman), an issue raised by a late night phone call that does not end until all six characters are on the line (""Night Lines"") and not resolved until the final episode, when Sally actually gets into the infamous cupboard of Patrick's love and finds a box she should not open. In between we get the creative allegory of a knight playing a game of chess with a princess in ""Bed Time.""

I agree that the attempt to work Oliver (Richard Mylan) into the mix is problematic. Part of the trouble is how Oliver comes across too much like a poorer version of Jeff (Richard Coyle), who is present in spirit and a bit more (Samantha Spiro) for a couple of episodes. Granted, changing the peculiar mix of characters in this sextet is risky, but they should have come up with more when they came up with Oliver. The other factor here is pairing up Oliver with Jane, which works a bit better because it finally allows her to justifiably be the confident one in the relationship, as amply seen in ""The Naked Living Room."" This certainly suggests some ways of rethinking the Oliver character, but it is obviously a bit too late for that. Like everything else on ""Coupling,"" the story of Oliver and Jane is to be continued.

However, I have to think we are getting close to the end of the road for ""Coupling."" This is not because baby Joshua has arrived, but rather because everybody is now paired up on the show (""Friends"" stopped before things got that far). No wonder there were only six episodes in Series 4: once Jane and Oliver hook up nobody is out looking for sex any more. In fact, there is every possibility that ""Coupling"" will no longer be about sex but will actually be spending more time on the subject of love, at which point we should probably turn out the lights because the party will be over.",1135123200,7,3797,4.579411764705882

Jeff's replacement, Oliver, really never develops into any particular role. He is just sort of there but lacks the depth of the regulars. It's a shame Jeff left before this series ended but if you followed these characters up to this point, then you have to get the last season if for nothing else, closure.

Many people argue that this was the worst season of Coupling...but I beg to differ.  While I think Season 1 was arguably the best, I think Season 4 really holds its own.  The season follows the 9 months up to Susan and Steve's debut as parents, Patrick and Sally's hilarious attempt at a real relationship, and Jane's flirtation with new guy Oliver.  While Jeff is sorely missed, Oliver is quite funny - he's a quirky comic book store owner who is unapologetic about his dorky demeanor.

2169444,4,B00065GX8C,"Coupling is no doubt one of the best sitcoms ever. The script is fresh and witty and Steven Moffat is one of the best writers around. On the down side, I can't help but miss 'Crazy' Jeff, who was one of my favorite characters with his 'nudity buffer', 'sock gap', 'giggle loop' and 'melty man' monologues. (""Men are disgustoids in human form."") Oliver, Jeff's replacement, just can't compare and I felt that most of his scenes were slow and unnecessary - and just basically not funny! His acting feels forced as he tries too hard to imitate Jeff and misses by several miles.

On the other hand, the episode 'Nightlines' was absolutely fantastic - a late night phone conversation between the six characters where they all (especially Patrick) end up revealing a little more than they intended.

[Fav quote: ""An axe-wielding fetus?!""]

'Circus of the Epidurals' was also one of the gems of this season where the group attends Susan's antenatal class which results into Steve's nightmare version of well, Inferno. We also see the return of Jill, Jane's ex-therapist from Season 1.

SALLY: Patrick? Have you slept with ALL these women?

PATRICK: Well, I don't know, I only just got here, I havent' checked.]

2169446,1,B00065GX8C,"One underlying problem to those serials penned by only one creative mind is that they inevitably run out of steam. ""Coupling IV"" demonstrates this in spades. While I & II were fine examples of the genre and made one eagerly anticipate each new episode, relish each situation and have empathy with each well-developed character, this stalled somewhat in III. True, Stephen Moffat tried in the third season to introduce novel scenarios and tricks to maintain interest, and was quite successful in maintaining viewer interest and enjoyment, but this lagged badly in IV.

One essential problem of course is the departure of Richard Coyle and his replacement by Richard Mylan. Mylan's ""Oliver"" character is a whiny, lisping schlemiel who just doesn't fit into the Coupling ensemble.  Another problem is the stridency of Jack Davenport in his role; one can tell that this actor is getting tired of his role and no longer enjoys the part.

Although every season of Coupling has been a fine example of British Humour, one could do well to own just the first three seasons.  In many ways, the last season does a lot to undermine the total enjoyment of the first three collections.  My advice is to forego the disappointment and save the money.",1111708800,36,1234,4.913461538461538
2169447,4,B00065GX8C,"First of all let me say that I am a huge fan of this series.  I predict that this show will be remembered as hilarious twenty years from now!  As for Season 4, I have some mixed feelings.

It is interesting to see the five returning characters evolve into relatively stable people.  Its only natural when we see Jane finally getting over Steve and Patrick and Sally making a go of it that we find ourselves pulling for them.  The problem with that is, as the show and its characters mature, its becoming less funny.  It happens to a lot of comedies (think M*A*S*H*).  So I don't know if Coupling has run its course or not, but if it has not it will be a challenge for Mr. Moffatt to breathe new hilarity into this cast.

Now for Oliver.  Quirky characters are not new to this series.  At times Jeff, Jane, and Sally have all been way over the top and with great results.  With Oliver however, you find yourself almost embarrassed for him at times.  Where Jeff seemed to be able to deliver the crazy lines and still be funny, the Oliver character doesn't seem as able to pull it off...

I hate to say that ""Jeff"" departing has ruined Coupling, but it was definitely a damaging blow.  Overall, Season 4 is still worth watching, but in my opinion it is the least funny of all and makes me wonder about the future of the show.

If you have seen the first three seasons, then this is a must buy.  If you have not seen them, by all means watch them first!",1110326400,30,1449,4.252747252747253

The only possible complaint is that Jeff is not in this episode.  The storyline gives hope that he will return in future seasons.  I hope so!",1110240000,3,405,4.276315789473684
2169449,4,B00065GX8C,"I have looked forward to getting Coupling's fourth season on DVD.  I couldn't wait to watch more clever episodes like the ones in the first three seasons.  I knew that Richard Coyle (Jeff) had left the show.  I knew the show wouldn't be the same with such an incredible character, but I was willing the give the new guy a chance. Oliver (played by Richard Mylan) is a blatant Jeff knock-off who does not steal the scenes and make you laugh the way the aforementioned character had done.  Oliver has some lines that had obviously been intended for Jeff.  The comparisons are inevitable -- and Steven Moffat, the show's writer, is partly to blame for that, for Oliver, like Jeff, cannot talk to women without chocking on his own words.  However, Mylan does add a bit of his own style to the mix.  He uses a slapstick approach with the use of physical comedy in various scenes (especially in the episode ""Bedtime"").  Oliver is also not as sex-obsessed as Jeff.  The character's development was slow though.  But he grew on me in ""The Naked Living Room,"" where he shows Jane his ""unedited"" flat and ends up opening up to her in a very vulnerable way.  The rest of the characters show a great deal of growth and more depth in this season.  Coyle's departure is a mixed blessing because it allows the characters to be more dimensional now that Jeff is not around to steal the spotlight. Steve and Susan deal with their pending parenthood, Patrick and Sally discuss the realities of a meaningful relationship, and Jane shows some maturity this time around.  In fact, Jane is far less neurotic on season four.  Her character is almost unrecognizable at times!  But things are not as dull or as bad as they sound.  The show is still hilarious.  Despite the overuse of dream and fantasy sequences and the fact that this season only has six episodes, Coupling is still far cleverer than most American sitcoms I have seen.  My favorite episodes are ""9  Weeks,"" ""Night Lines,"" ""Bedtime,"" ""The Naked Living Room,"" and ""9  Months.""  The show is not as funny now that Jeff is gone, but it is still worth owning the DVD.",1110067200,2,2103,4.599462365591398
2169450,4,B00065GX8C,"Essentially a racier, British version of Friends, Coupling has survived a disastrous attempt at Americanization and the departure of popular cast member Richard Coyle. The addition of Richard Mylan to the cast is hardly a substitute for Coyle who was arguably the funniest cast member on the show but he is fine in his own way and the quality of the writing is still top notch.

The quality of the show's writing is still excellent. For example, in one episode Steve refers to child birth as the John Hurt bit, a reference to the slimy creature that bursts out of his chest in Alien. He also describes a child birthing video as ""horror porn,"" - seeing a face coming out of a place where one shouldn't. However, the pairing up of the cast has the potential for disaster as the thrill of the chase is now gone. Of course, this presents a new series of comedic possibilities as the dynamic between couples is explored. Moffat also continues his spot-on parodies of British popular culture, including one clever bit where Patrick imagines himself in an episode of The Prisoner when he's actually having sex with Sally.

""Making of Coupling-`From Script to Screen'"" is a 43-minute featurette that traces the development of an episode from the writing phase to rehearsals to actual filming. Now in its fourth season, the process is much more polished. This is a good look at how the show is put together.

There are ten minutes of outtakes that include your usual blown lines and flubs but in a way that conveys how much fun the cast must have working on this show.

Also included are eight and half minutes of deleted scenes that include more of Steve's dream sequence early on in the season. Most of the bits are amusing in their own right but were rightly cut.

""Interview with Richard Mylan"" features the new addition to the cast as he talks about the daunting task of replacing Richard Coyle and how he got on with the rest of the cast.

Finally, there are some very detailed biographies for the cast and crew.",1109203200,6,2009,4.629213483146067
2169451,5,B00065GX8C,"For some reason I was unable to watch these episodes when they aired so when I bought the DVD I promptly watched the entire season straight through.  If you can not handle long periods of laughing, I would not recommend doing this.

The season stars shortly after the end of the last one.  Susan is pregnant, Sally and Patrick are together and Jane is alone (we never see how the breakup with the priest unfolds).  The season progresses through Susan's pregnancy until it's end.  Overall the season's episodes seem to have been planned as a single story and flows better than previous seasons even if it was too short.  The plt starts with 9  Minutes and ends with 9  Months.

The season opens with another brilliant episode where a period of just over nine minutes in the bar is seen from three different viewpoints.  Each viewpoint explains others while raising its own questions.  It reminds me of Split.

Jeff is sadly absent from the season.  He is traveling to the island of Lesbos.  We know of him in the first episode in the form of a phone call.  He appears in the final episode in a dream sequence where he is played by someone else who does a remarkable impression of him.

Patrick and Sally have become firmer in their relationship although it will have to go through some rock moments.  The relationship seems to have settled Sally down a little as her insecurities erupt in only one episode.

Jane is a free spirit looking for males.  This is where we get Oliver, a rather interesting character who we later learn can actually understand Jane (no simple task).  His relationship with Jane is really one of the highlights of the season.

The pregnancy is almost a character in and of itself and anyone who has gone through one will certainly identify with much of this season.  A birthing class gives Steve that chance to perform one of his great rants that is right up there with ""cushions"" and ""men like looking at naked bottoms"" from previous seasons.

The only problem with the whole season is that there are only six episodes.  They are great episodes but there are still only six of them.  They all fit on a single DVD while a second DVD includes some interesting extras including deleted scenes and an interview with the new character.",1108512000,6,2255,4.605527638190955
2169452,4,B00065GX8C,"I will pass on the traditional episode-by-episode description and instead address the central issue in this entire discussion, one that has chased the series since the news of Richard Coyle's quitting: What will this series be without Jeff Murdock?

Well, the short answer is very funny and much more meaningful. The ongoing arc of the four series of Coupling has been the growth of each character from their initial short brief into a fully realized person. While the first series featured the first inklings of Susan and Steve as people, it was really the growth of Sally and, to a considerably lesser extent, Patrick over the course of the second and third series that helped bring audiences in and enjoy a tremendous amount of laughter. Which left us with Jane and Jeff, whose abortive relationships of the third series began to teach us about them.

Well, Jeff left and so we have Jane. Given her on-her-own-planet nature from the first series, this would be a challenge. And Moffat chooses the same vehicle as he did for Sally and Patrick: love. But realizing the limitations of the third series when she began a relationship with a secondary character, Moffat wisely decides to kill two birds with one stone by making Jeff's replacement Jane's love interest. Thematically, it is a great decision, because it really allows Gina Bellman to act, well, human, and devote the appropriate amount of time to this. In this way, I think Coupling has gained tremendously with Jeff's departure, in allowing the development of real emotional depth and using less farce as they did earlier in the show with Jeff's ravings.

But, it's a comedy, so we have to go back to the real question: is it funny? Absolutely. However, I always consider ""Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps"" of Season 3 to be the funniest half hour I have ever seen, and this series does not meet up to that high level. Secondly, my above paragraph and thematic elements notwithstanding, Jeff WAS incredibly funny, and his interludes, which were always extremely welcome breaks from Moffat's intricate plots, are missed, simply because of Coyle's amrvelous comic prescence, which Oliver does not replace, nor does he especially try to.

Coupling's fourth series is a rich and worthy addition to the history of the series, and any owner of the previous series would be making an error ignoring this one. Though not the funniest (that title belongs to Series 3) I still found these episodes immensely enjoyable.",1108339200,5,2463,4.942028985507246

However, this season the writing was definitely not as good as before.  The laughs were few and far between and the actors seemed stiff and the entire show felt forced and awkward.

A new character named Oliver is introduced to replace Jeff.  He is obviously meant to be an identical replacement, but he doesn't work.  He is mostly annoying, not funny, and his physical gags are not amusing.  I think the show would have been better served by picking a replacement that was very different from Jeff.

Finally, although this season is disappointing, it would have been nice to have more than 6 episodes.  BBC production continues to baffle me as this show's output has varied radically from year-to-year.  The show continues to have potentially interesting storylines, so I am hoping for better writing and execution next year.",1107734400,12,958,4.786585365853658

Well, you'll see most of it here but definitely not Jeff.

The reason why Richard Coyle is no longer in the show is unknown to me, and never mentioned in the bonus materials (which by the way include a complete interview with the new guy, Richard Mylan), but the writers obviously tried to justify his absence not succeeding at all. I will be honest and say that Jeff Murdoch was definitely my favorite character of them all, and I don't have anything against the new Oliver character, but listen to his dialogues and you'll see that the writers tried to fit already made Jeff dialogues into his persona, which doesn't help the new character at all.

But regardless of the new Oliver character, this season comes as witty and intelligent as it has always been. The first episode for instance shows you the same timeframe (9 1/2 minutes) from three different points of view that fit together in the end, total genius!

`Nightlines' and the never ending phone call will give you a good laugh, the game of coupling in the third episode is just amazing and the highlight is definitely episode 6 (9  months) with a retuned Jeff that totally lets you down, put aside that and the rest of the episode will make you cry (Steve definitely draws all attention here)

I usually give 5 stars to the show but being the current Oliver-Jeff situation this won't be the time. I think this problem could be fixed if the writers could give Oliver a personality of his own instead of trying to adapt him with Jeff's.",1107561600,5,1794,4.576323987538941

""Nine and a Half Minutes"" gives us the same time frame from the perspective of each couple, while ""Nine and a Half Months"" finds Steve (Jack Davenport) unstuck in time (and having his weirdest dreams ever) as Susan goes into labor.

With Susan being pregnant her relationship with Steve is pretty much reduced to his complete and total fear over the miracle of birth.  Dragging him to antenatal classes (""Circus of the Epidurals"") is the disaster you would imagine.  But overall the best moments for Series 4 come from watching Sally (Kate Isitt) and Patrick (Ben Miles) become closer.  The sticking point becomes whether or not Patrick has slept with Jane (Gina Bellman), an issue raised by a late night phone call that does not end until all six characters are on the line (""Night Lines"") and not resolved until the final episode, when Sally actually gets into the infamous cupboard of Patrick's love and finds a box she should not open.  In between we get the creative allegory of a knight playing a game of chess with a princess in ""Bed Time.""

I agree that the attempt to work Oliver (Richard Mylan) into the mix is problematic.  Part of the trouble is how Oliver comes across too much like a poorer version of Jeff (Richard Coyle), who is present in spirit and a bit more (Samantha Spiro) for a couple of episodes.  Granted, changing the peculiar mix of characters in this sextet is risky, but they should have come up with more when they came up with Oliver.  The other factor here is pairing up Oliver with Jane, which works a bit better because it finally allows her to be the confident one in the relationship, as amply seen in ""The Naked Living Room.""  This certainly suggests some ways of rethinking the Oliver character, but it is obviously a bit too late for that.  Like everything else on ""Coupling,"" the story of Oliver and Jane is to be continued.

However, I have to think we are getting close to the end of the road for ""Coupling.""  This is not because baby Joshua has arrived, but rather because everybody is now paired up on the show (""Friends"" stopped before things got that far).  No wonder there were only six episodes in Series 4: once Jane and Oliver hook up nobody is out looking for sex any more.  In fact, there is every possibility that ""Coupling"" will no longer be about sex but will actually be spending more time on the subject of love, at which point we should probably turn out the lights because the party will be over.",1107302400,8,3798,4.573746312684365

8039007,5,B00065GX8C,"Season four showed up fast and in excellent condition. As to season for itself, it was an ok end to a great show. It REALLY lacked Jeff though, it was NOT at all the same. That said, still worth watching!",1517702400,,204,4.125
8039008,4,B00065GX8C,"A lot of 1- 2- and 3-star reviews here by disappointed fans. I was a bit disappointed too when I watched it for the first time a couple of years ago in strict sequence with the other 3 series. I skipped it the next time I watched the show, thinking it was a bit of a lemon, one of my discs that was best left unplayed. So I'd forgotten most of it. But on impulse I watched it again two nights ago - separately, that is, NOT after watching the other 3 series. And to my delight I found it to be a lot better than I remembered. When you see it by itself, it's actually pretty damn good.

If the inspiration is not quite up to previous series, that's kind of understandable. After the wonderful fun and games of series 1 & 2, the show suddenly accelerated into series 3 with a new emotional intensity, with that symbolic crack appearing across the screen. It became a bit serious then, quite deep in places, and was obviously heading for a shoot-out and a resolution. The last episode was clearly meant to be the final word, with the guys getting the girls in the best Jane Austen tradition, and everybody's future mapped out.

So, being persuaded to go on to a fourth series, Stephen Moffat was doing something akin to trying to revive a football match after the final whistle has blown. And then the news that Richard Coyle wouldn't play - no Jeff this time. Which left poor Moffat on a hiding to nothing with the hard-core fans. He could have been forgiven for succumbing to the Melty Man and losing his bottle completely.

In the circumstances he did a sterling job, but it was inevitable that people in mourning for Jeff would be coming on Amazon and taking it out on the writer by posting 2-star reviews for a series which is so much better than almost anything else on TV. Where else could you find a multi-way phone conversation so well orchestrated, so exquisitely timed, as you get in NightLines, or a scene in a bar played three times from three different perspectives in 9 1/2 Minutes? Or the re-opening of the previously closed cupboard of Patrick's love in Circus of the Epidurals? Where else can you hear a line like ""There are some places you just don't expect to see a face"".

So, what I would say is, don't treat this series as if it was Coupling Uncoupled. Watch Series 1-3 when you fancy it, but leave a decent break before taking on Series 4, and ask yourself how you'd rate it if Series 1-3 didn't exist. Give it a chance on its own terms. It's better than you think.",1512432000,,2486,4.362850971922247

I found it hilarious and I was looking to watch it again. But nobody streams it. So, I had to buy all four DVDs.
If you're a fan of Brit comedy, and you like relationship hilarity,  I think you're going to like all four seasons of these. I'm going to put this exact same review on the other three seasons so don't expect anything new there. Sorry about that. :-)",1497571200,,532,4.105769230769231
