8285324,5,B0002LX5C2,"""Best of WWF 2001"" is from TNN's 2001 New Year's Eve Special.  It is the exact same thing that was on TV except for the video montages on certain superstars.  I did not even know this show was on DVD.  Maybe it was only available on DVD.  The DVD talks about major surprises, best kisses, and shows a the 9/11 tribute.  The best part of the DVD is that it shows the top ten matches from 2001.  They are not shown in thier entirety, but are stil great.

10. Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit (Royal Rumble 2001 - Interconintental Title/Ladder)

Good exciting match.  Ladder mathces are the best.  Good high spots and innovative offense.  Watch for the Walls of Jericho on Benoit on the top of the ladder.  (9/10)

9. Undertaker vs. Triple H (Wrestlemania 17)

This match was not a Street Fight, but turned into one when the ref gets knocked out.  Good spot when the Undertaker chokeslams Tiple H off a scaffold.  Very exciting finish.  (9/10)

8. Kurt Angle vs. Shane McMahon (King Of The Ring 2001 - Street Fight)

One of my all time favorite matches.  These two go all out for this match.  Shane pulls off some crazy spots.  Watch for the Angle Slam off the board on the top rope.  Pay attention to the kid in the light blue shirt in the front row after this move.  He makes the move even more exciting with the way he reacts.  (10/10)

7. Chris Jericho & Chris Benoit vs. Two Man Power Trip (RAW 5/21/01 - WWF Tag Team Championship)

One of the best straight up tag matches you will ever see.  This is the infamous match in which Triple H injures his quad.  It is a testament to his love for wrestling to see how long he wrestled after being hurt.  Lost in this, is the greatness of the match.  Very exciting.  (9/10)

6. Trish Stratus & Lita vs. Torrie Wilson & Stacy Keibler (No Mercy 2001 - Bra & Panties Match)

Nice to see the ladies, but they could have put a better a match on. (6/10)

5. The Rock, Chris Jericho, Undertaker, Kane, & Big Show vs. RVD, Booker T, Shane McMahon, Kurt Angle, & Stone Cold Steve Austin (Survivor Series 2001 - Team WWF vs. Team Alliance/Winner Gets Control of WWF)

Unfortunately this match doesn't pick up until it Rock and Jericho vs. Angle and Austin.  Great finish.  (9/10)

4. RVD vs. Jeff Hardy (Invasion 2001 - Hardcore Title)

Very exciting match with many high spots.  Jeff Hardy pulls off a couple of crazy spills.  I wish Jeff was still around.  (9/10)

3. Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. The Rock (Wrestlemania 17 - WWF Title/No DQ)

Very, very exciting match with a lot of blood and a shocking finish.  Match of the Year in my opinion.  (10/10)

2. Hardy Boys vs. Edge & Christian vs. Dudleys (Wrestlemania 17 -WWF Tag Team Championship/TLC)

Another great TLC match.  Numerous amounts of amazing spots.  Not as good as the first TLC.  Rhyno, Spike, & Lita make appearances.  Watch for the spear by Edge off the ladder on Jeff hanging from the belt. One of the best moves you will ever see.  (9.5/10)

1. Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Triple H (No Way Out 2001 - Best 2 Out of 3 Falls)

1st Fall - Regular Match

Good straight up match between the two.  (8.5/10)

2nd Fall - Street Fight

Amazing effort by both men.  They went all out for this fall.  (9.5/10)

3rd Fall - Cage

Good finish, altough both men were exhausted from the Street Fight.  (8/10)

Overall Rating for the Match:  (9/10)

There are no extra on the DVD's.
