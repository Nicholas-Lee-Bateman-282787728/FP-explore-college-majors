3627287,5,B001H9JBW6,"A series that is a prodigiously well-knit plot, so well-knit that we can wonder what the truth is in the end. It is a lot more than just a rewriting of Big Brother with all the cameras everywhere and the tracking chips in the shoes, belts, or even under the skin. All that is covered up by the imposed ID card which is supposed to concentrate opposition while the necessary software are tested to identify the eyes, the finger prints, the figure and who knows what else of every single person. The new generation of trackers are infinitesimally small molecules injected or simply incorporated in the body of a person even be it only via a drink and then the person is tagged for life, and even beyond. The series here shows how an experiment went wrong, not really wrong but actually came out dirty. A set of these tags were injected to thousands of refugees in Afghanistan in some kind of innocuous medical injection, and that tag had the capacity to recognize the genes of the person and then to kill one particular human family, Arabs in that case. The film on such a point is badly informed since in Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan the people are of Indo-European stock and not Semitic, and wrong again if you wonder how such a tracker can make the difference between a Jewish Semite and an Arab Semite? But never mind such details. They were testing a genetic weapon that could annihilate a whole population in a few days, in other words an illegal genocidal genetic weapon. They even doubled up the demonstration by making the only British citizen who got the tag recover within twenty-four hours. So Big Brother is becoming there Big Western War Criminal. And the West wonders then where these middle-easterners and far-easterners find their terrorist ideas. In our security laboratories, and no where else. But the series has another interest. It shows the inside picture of that kind of security experimentation and we find out that there are at least four or five levels and that most people have one foot in more than one level and often in three levels. The last scene is typical. Michael, the NGO worker who was the ultimate guinea pig of the tag is executed on the ship that is leaving Britain by the man who helped all along Michael, his Brother Stephen and his wife Yasim, and we discover that he who appeared to be a freelance fighter to avenge his own daughter is in fact a multiple agent working for the secret and totally undercover circle of the security services of the government. That gives to the series an interesting twinge. Note that tag was also used against illegal immigrant who were infected in a way or another and died within days. Actually the doctor of this experiment manages to find a cure but he is eliminated in due time and all evidence destroyed. The experiment had been a full success. Let's keep that in reserve. The final element is the sentimental level. Michael is officially killed and buried and Stephen comes back from China for the funeral. Yasim, Michael's wife is then ripped between the dead husband and his brother, and the brother is divided between his brother's wife and his brother's widow. One of the side effects of that false death and burial is that Stephen is brought back to England and then will no longer be able to leave, hence will be forced to work for the government. So even the wife torn between two brothers is not really dramatic, certainly not tragic. It is one more level of political plotting. But altogether the series is interesting and even fascinating, British in one word in that genre of political science fiction.

Storyline will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. Always remember ""Big Brother"" is watching you and RFID chips that are now so common can be your worst nightmare! For those of you curious about the mark of the beast, as stated in the book of Revelation, this secular movie would be of great interested.

A very compelling movie, it deals with the government's ability to monitor citizens' every movement, financial transaction, what they buy and possibly even deduce their thoughts through a ""super computer"" program that the British government is attempting to implement. Throw in some shady characters, all with unknown agendas and the threat of a possible biological attack you have several hours of great entertaimnent. Be prepared to sit down and watch this movie from beginning to end because once it grabs your interest you can't wait to see the outcome. Great acting, interesting characters and a well produced DVD make this a very entertaining and worthwhile investment. There are many plot surprises along the way so don't think you have this figured out until the end. One of the best TV dramas I have seen in quite awhile.",1249862400,47,901,4.973509933774834

As London has become the de facto standard in regards to CCT video, advances in heuristic computer modeling via known association, and biometric recognition software - 'Enemy' drops a brilliant computer engineer into this coming world via the mysterious death of his estranged brother, a well-known and respected field aid worker helping the less fortunates of the world. A brother that may have stumbled into an international cover-up of a possible global pandemic.

3627291,5,B001H9JBW6,This fictionalized account of privacy in everyday life and how technology is changing things is right on the mark and very scary.

3627292,5,B001H9JBW6,"I was having a discussion with a much younger person, a college freshman, who was talking enthusiastically about how much she accomplishes on the internet: banking, investing, shopping, updating her information on Facebook. I suggested that she read George Orwell's 1984, Margaret Atwood's Handmaid's Tale and watch the movie The Net. Also to check out what happened during the 2003 North East Blackout when debit cards wouldn't work, computers stopped, cell towers were overloaded so it was hard to make a call and if you needed a card to enter a building, you're out of luck.  This BBC drama takes the whole scenario even further to demonstrate the good and the bad of using surveillance technology to protect us as long as we are considered ""the good citizens."" You don't have to be particularly paraniod to see how many of the things written about in 1984 and The Handmaid's Tale have become matters of course.

This series has excellent acting, plenty of suspense and makes you want to watch it all in one viewing.  It's entertaining as well as thought-provoking.",1235088000,137,1068,4.9222222222222225

3627294,5,B001H9JBW6,"In recent years there have been some interesting - and scary - television productions about the dangers of what we might call life in ""the surveillance society.""
""The Code,"" which was produced in Australia, was - for example - a brilliant examination of life in a society where privacy is no longer an option. ""The Last Enemy"" is cut from the same cloth and it, too, is brilliant.
With a cast led by Benedict Cumberbatch, it tells the story of an aid worker on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border who becomes concerned when he begins seeing patients with a mysterious disease that is always fatal. When his SUV is blown up after apparently hitting a land mine his brother, a reclusive mathematician living in China, flies home to England to attend the funeral. Once there he finds himself being recruited by the government to help push through new legislation that will allow the police and security agencies to monitor people 24/7 in the name of public safety.
And therein hangs a tale of love, betrayal, murder, and the frightening lengths governments will go to in order to cover up unethical and immoral experiments on men, women and children. I will warn you now that this is not a series for everyone. If, for example, you are someone who believes that the government has the right to spy on its citizens in the name of security, then this is not a program for you. Likewise, if you believe that it is okay to trade your rights for safety, this is not a series that you should watch.
If, however, you believe - as Ben Franklin did - that when you trade rights for safety you end up with neither, then you will find this 5-part series fascinating and frightening at the same time.
That's especially true now that the United States and other countries are pushing new laws to restrict immigration as a means of preventing terrorist attacks and militarizing police forces in the name of security.
Cumberbatch, as mathematician Stephen Ezard, is brilliant in the role as are the rest of the cast. I would single out Eva Birthistle, who plays Stephen's former girlfriend, for additional praise, however, because her portrayal of the junior government minister seemingly unaware of the administration's dirty tricks is perfectly done and all the more frightening because you can see men and women just like her on television screens around the world daily pushing and prodding for ever-increasing surveillance initiatives.
Directed by Iain B. MacDonald, the series moves along at a nice pace and the cinematography is well done.
Definitely a 5-star series that raises important social, political, and moral questions.",1480464000,3,2613,4.887387387387387

Not only is BC a terrific actor, he has a memorably unusual face and I found his name to be delightful.  The Last Enemy also introduced me to Robert Carlyle (check him out as ""Gaz"" in The Full Monty), and again it was instant love.  Both their performances in The Last Enemy are solid and nuanced.  The story is frightening in its Surveillance Society's inexorability in making dissenters into ""non-persons"".  With its thousands of CCTV cameras, England is already a public surveillance state and this movie takes it just one small step further into a hell of no privacy at all, anywhere, at any time.  Welcome to Big Brother, UK-style.  WELL worth watching more than once.  i give it five big stars.",1413849600,2,955,4.3559322033898304

Once again Benedict Cumberbatch plays an introverted British man, who surrounds himself with numbers and abstract problems, rather than people.  He has just returned to England after working in China for several years, and is swept up into a world he does not recognize.  His journey includes a romance with his dead brother's wife, and indirectly involvement with a group of activists.

This one, hoo-boy, is an quite the story and again, like ""Parade's End"", Cumberbatch is quite stunning in the portrayal of emotions.  Almost scary.

3627379,4,B001H9JBW6,"I missed almost all of this series when it was originally aired in 2008. Yet, of the little that I did see of it, I remembered the scene where Steven Ezard (Cumberbatch) is being interrogated by David Russell (Carlyle) in front of Russell's electric fence, and that the main character was a professor who had worked in China. With this scant amount of information, 5-years later, I was able to, Steven-Ezard-like, cyber-track down the title of the series via Google, and then purchase it on Amazon.

This is a very well produced drama which seeks to integrate the qualities of prior art such as Smiley's People and Reilly, Ace of Spies, with a more contemporary editing style, like that of its US counterparts. 24, for example. My impression, on a first viewing of the DVDs, suggested an overly elaborate story line that depended on the heavy use, if not heavy-handed use, of foreshadowing and allusion, to maintain the viewer's interest. Nevertheless, like Roman Polanski's Ghost (The Ghost Writer), the series contains an engaging amount of pathos and inner detail which more than mitigates the issue.

The acting was consistently excellent. Especially from, yet not limited to, Benedict Cumberbatch, Anamaria Marinca (irrespective of a line of tricksy dialogue) and Max Beesley. The rich tone of the images seems to have benefited from being shot on film.

After becoming acquainted with the intricacies of the story for this series, the DVDs give one the opportunity to gain a much better impression of its strengths. Strengths that have enabled The Last Enemy to be included in the lists of Masterpiece Contemporary.",1395964800,3,1621,5.041044776119403

Is it about big government's attempt at total control of all it's citizens whereabouts at any given time or is it about a type of ethnic cleansing through targeted vaccines?  A father's revenge?

The whole ensemble cast, from Benedict Cumberbatch, to Anamaria Marinca and Robert Carlyle, make this dark futuristic tale by Peter Berry more believable. Cumberbatch is superb as Stephen Ezard, a research scientist just returning to London from China to attend his brother Michael's funeral. After all his years away, he is bewildered by an England he does not recognize; London has become a police-state. Unlike his late-brother, Stephen Ezard is a recluse who abhors germs and personal contact. Despite his walls, he's drawn to his brother's complex widow, Yasim (Anamaria Marinca delivers a finely nuanced tough/gentle performance), a medical doctor. They become embroiled in a swirl of conspiracies while he works on the government's super-database. Ezard's struggle to survive is a superb character study enriched by a marvelous performance by Cumberbatch. Robert Caryle is perfect as a menacing rogue government agent - quite convincing. Despite the subject matter, this isn't a political left/right film or story. As one outsider-character states, people have the right to be anonymous. ""The Last Enemy"" explores what happens when populations lose that privacy. A topical, haunting story, quite relevant to issues today, and also reminiscent of Ray Bradbury's masterpiece&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fahrenheit-451/dp/1451673310/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fahrenheit 451</a>.",1380844800,3,1551,6.152073732718894

3627406,5,B001H9JBW6,"This British mini-series is very gripping and responds to an increasing anxiety not only in the UK but also in America about governmental surveillance--surveillance cameras, examination of email, Internet activity, global positioning, anything and everything that is intended to protect us from terrorism but could (potentially) strip away our privacy and our freedom if taken too far. It's a fantasy, of course, along the lines of Orwell's 1984: a what-if, near-future science fiction series that tells about a brilliant but naive mathematician who has lived for five years in China, quietly conducting his research. When he returns to a very changed England to attend the funeral of his politically active brother (killed in an explosion in Afghanistan), he meets his brother's angry and grieving widow and confesses to her that his popular and important older sibling has always belittled him, that he hated him and resented every second it took him to fly across the world to come to a funeral he missed. He and she take refuge in each other; they fall in love, and he is unwittingly drawn into a political, top-secret plan that will change his and her life drastically. Both Benedict Cumberbatch and Anamaria Marinca are brilliant in conveying both tenderness and confused loyalties. The series is thus complex on several levels that are very compelling: in its political message, in its suspense, and in its story about sibling rivalry, love, manipulation, cruelty, and innocence and experience. I was very moved by it.",1375660800,4,1525,5.178137651821863

However, shortly after his arrival, he realizes things are not as he thought they were, which kicks off his search for knowledge of people and things he had little or no connection to just days ago.

3627409,3,B001H9JBW6,"My wife's infatuation with Benedict Cumberbatch continues unabated, so I was invited to watch five hours of this nonsense with her and, well, it was that or divorce, what would you do?  While it was going on she admitted that even Cumberbatch, the single greatest man who ever lived in all of history she thinks, was finding it heavy going breathing life into this story which we had both seen, like, one million times.  Anyone who has watched Tom Cruise in a futuristic movie has seen it, and seen it done much better.  I hereby give Tom Cruise a Bell Curve Oscar for his sterling work in Oblivion, Vanilla Sky, War of the Worlds, etc.  Lifetime Achievement Award, and it will be presented live on TV to him by Rosie O'Donnell and a deflated Benedict Cumberbatch.

The story is ridiculously expanded to pad out two hours to five.  My questions include, Who are those evil foreign brothers from Russia or wherever?  Who is Robert Carlyle playing and how does he know so much, and yet so little, about every twist and turn of the plot?  Is every government employee in England satanically evil?  If you were a woman passionately devoted to your husband, and he died, and his brother showed up the day of his funeral, a brother you had never met and moreover looks nothing like your husband--we were 100 per cent sure it would turn out that he actually was the husband, with a facelift and his memory shifted as in Total Recall or Source Code--would you skip the funeral and have sex with this stranger instead?  While a plague stricken woman lies dying in the next room, a woman you are sworn to help?  (This is no spoiler as it occurs within the first 25 minutes of the miniseries.)  My wife murmured, ""Benedict Cumberbatch couldn't help himself, but that woman Kasim is a slut.""  Later she apologizes by explaining that, ""He was there.... And I wanted him,"" a sentiment my wife sympathized with.  OK, more questions, Carrie's boss in Homeland, David Estes, shows up in this effort playing the exact same part, only here he's British.  Does he play no other sort of role?  It is the sort of part Rod Steiger and then John Malkovich used to excel in, cold as ice and pure and icy ambition.

Then there's the Robert Carlyle question.  It seems like only yesterday he used to be a great star, in The Full Monty and Trainspotting and others.  Surprised to see him still alive, and unable to follow a single word of his dialogue due to my accent recognition software malfunctioning, I spent a lot of time looking him up simultaneously on IMDB and finding out that in fact he's been busy acting in thirty-two movies I have never heard of, sometimes playing characters such as ""Third Man in Tavern"" or ""Chauffeur.""  I guess he saw he had a lead part in a miniseries and jumped in with both feet, but the cruel producers here made him leave off his lifts, so he tries his best to menace and murder and hold hostage, but it's cute because he's no more than five feet three I would estimate.  It's like watching little Haley Joel Osment from The Sixth Sense as a supervillain, in punky clothes borrowed from, oh I don't know, Punky Brewster.

Final question, have you ever seen a tacked-on ending before?  Of course you have, but this one will leave you with your head in your hands, mumbling and pouting, one thought ratcheting through your brain, that soon, very soon, your wife is going to be forcing you to see Benedict Cumberbatch in the forthcoming biopic of Julian Assange (!!!) and she'll be whispering in your ear, ""Oh be a sport, at least it will be better than The Last Enemy.""",1369526400,39,3578,4.547581903276131

3627413,4,B001H9JBW6,"It's 2008, and we're in the high mountain-desert on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. There are no trees. There are not even bushes. Just some yellow-green grass that looks like it would rather be someplace else. It's the Killi Faizo medical refugee camp, a gathering of white tents arranged in rows in the middle of nowhere. A Britisher gets into his Land Rover and drives out of the camp. Over the next hill, a man releases a hawk. A special hawk, this one is carrying a miniature video camera.

Cut to London, where a woman is awakened from her sleep by a phone call. It is a video. The man in the Land Rover is blown to bits as his vehicle hits a land mine.

An interesting and mysterious beginning to ""The Last Enemy"". Mysterious because you don't know how the man with the hawk knew that the Land Rover was going to hit a land mine.

Stephen Ezard travels back to England for the funeral of the man in the Land Rover, who was his brother Michael. Stephen is a mildly-misanthropic mathematical genius. He's been holed up in China, not communicating with the outside world. London today has some surprises for him. Due to terrorist attacks, a lot has changed. Retinal scans in the airport. Identity cards. Police in body armor patrol London in bands of five. Camera monitors on every street corner, in every store, even in the houses.

A limo picks Stephen up at the airport and he asks the driver to go faster because he's late for the funeral.
The driver replies, ""Oh, I'm afraid we don't have clearance to break monitored speed, Sir.""
""Monitored speed?  I've been away, about 4 years.""
""You'll be noticing the changes then, Sir.""

At Michael's apartment, Stephen has more surprises.
1) There's a sick woman with an IV in the bedroom
2) Michael had a wife, Yasim, a doctor who met Michael in refugee camp

""The Last Enemy"", in an original script by Peter Barry, at first seems just a cautionary tale about giving up your rights to the state in return, you hope, for protection against terrorism. Where do you draw the line?  For England in this series, the line may be the passage or not passage of T.I.A.  Total Information Awareness, according to the developers, is ""the entire U.K. in one database, birth to death, day to day, up to date and in real time. ... Absolute surveillance.""

But there is more than that going on. Why does Yasim hide the sick woman's body when she dies? Why are murders following Yasim and Stephen? What happens when the powers that be want to test an ultimate weapon, any way they can?

There is a reason why the tagline for this mini-series is
""Tomorrow Is Nearer Than You Think...""

You don't find out where the title, ""The Last Enemy"", comes from until almost the very last words spoken. It reminded me of when, many years ago, I read George Orwell's ""1984"", immediately followed by reading Ray Bradbury's ""Fahrenheit 451"". I ended up liking ""Fahrenheit 451"" better, because the end leaves you with hope. Unlike the ending of ""1984"", Bradbury lets you believe that there is a chance the world could change.

Wait until the last scenes of ""The Last Enemy"", and decide if there is hope... or not.

3627425,5,B001H9JBW6,"This is hands down one of the best series I've seen in a long time. The acting is superb and the plot won't unfold till the very end. Make sure you have plenty of time to watch it because it's pretty hard to walk away from.

The story deals with surveillance, and to what extent it will encroach on our lives, what's so scary about it is that most of what they show is already here. What makes this unique is that my entire family loved it, both my brothers and my parents thought it was great.

I find it very hard to find fault with it. Some people may think that it's a bit long and drawn out, personally I don't think so, the characters are well developed and the plot ever thickening.",1348704000,4,689,4.134328358208955
3627426,4,B001H9JBW6,"The frightening world of the general population under constant surveillance and general government control is upon us.  This series should serve as a warning that you can't gain safety by giving your freedom away.  This is a well acted story about too much power being given to government along with the technology that gives it total control over us.  This seems to be the road we're headed down, a brave new world indeed, where we find out that the last enemy is us.... we're almost there.",1344556800,,491,4.686046511627907
3627427,4,B001H9JBW6,"I liked this mini-series. I wandered in looking for more of Benedict Cumberbatch's work after seeing his great performance in ""Sherlock"" (which I give 5 stars). This multi-episode story held my attention throughout, and Cumberbatch played well a genius astounded at what was unfolding around him. You can't look away from the screen though because they don't dumb it down for you. One must pay attention. Yes, there are definitely some holes in the fabric the filmmakers weave, as well as some thin spots you could easily rip wide open... but I am going thumbs up on the drama as a whole. I cared about the characters and what their ultimate fate would be.

Of far more importance however then the drama itself is the obtuse message delivered by the producers. We are on the verge of losing what remains of our personal liberty. The England painted by the film makers is not some maybe, kind of, far off 'Mad Max' could-be dystopian future. It is more of a 'Max Headroom' world that is looming up all around us. The world of The Last Enemy is just around the corner. In fact, we are at least half way around that corner. Much of the technology used in the film appears to be here already (and micro-biologists ARE dying at an unusually high rate).

Many well-intended people in government --such as portrayed in 'The Last Enemy""-- think strong controls on the populace is a logical means of preventing terrorism and related crimes. History does not bear that philosophy out however. You can't gain freedom by removing freedom. Given the current state of the evolution of human consciousness, powers given to the Government are at first used with [hopefully] good intent. Then they are mis-used. Then they are ab-used. Every single time. Treatments such as 'The Last Enemy' help point out the futility of 1984 style controls placed on a society. Our best way out of the dilemma the world faces is instead through individual citizens raising their own consciousness. We MUST evolve or freedom [which world history shows to be a temporary state] will die.

btw - A title I can think of that might interest those who liked this film is the British political mini-series 'The Amazing Mrs Pritchard'. And those wanting to learn more regarding the themes presented in 'The Last Enemy' have an abundance of choices in video. Two that come to mind are the black dystopian comedy from Terry Gilliam 'Brazil', and the documentary 'Ayn Rand & the Philosophy of Atlas Shrugged'.",1343606400,15,2465,4.7952941176470585

When the inevitable moment arrives, she kills Russell and throws his body overboard, an action that escapes detection. She and Stephen eventually reunite. If Sherlock Holmes could survive the Reichenbach fall, anything is possible, right?

The best part of this excellent TV mini-series is the love story. I can't help but think that Peter Berry had ""Casablanca"" in mind when he wrote it. Some of the non-romance plot is a bit murky. (Who were those two foreign pursuers, and why did Russell keep popping up all over the place? Who was he working for?) But generally, the writing is brilliant, and so is the acting. Benedict Cumberbatch is outstanding as usual, and so are Anamaria Marinca, Robert Carlyle, Eva Birthistle, Geraldine James and Christopher Fulford. I would especially love to see Anamaria Marinca again as Yasim.

A hero's journey in the kinda soon future, which engages the intellect, heart and deep deep philosophical stuff down beneath, if you're lucky enough to still be able to go there.

The characters are complex, mysterious, and ultimately so well developed that by the end I felt I knew them intimately and would miss them very much.  The Hero, Stephen Ezard initially seems difficult to warm up to, but I fell in love with him and found him (character and actor, indistinguishable for the most part) to be real enough yet still big enough to carry a kind of prototypical inadvertent seeker warrior role.  Who knew that guy could come to be swoon worthy?

For me this was like watching a great, spare production of Shakespeare, or re-reading a Jane Austen fave when it really gets in.  I felt immediately when we first started watching, that this is a classic work, and at the end of many hours of transfixed yearning watching, I was like, wow, this is the real deal.

But it felt like old news to me, and all of the twists and turns seemed like they'd been rehashed from other productions.  The ending (spoiler alert: the bad guys win in every possible way) certainly did not make up for how long and drawn out the plot was.

What a totally well done production - character, drama, intrigue and wonderful acting. So I just had to get the DVD too. The first episode made me crazy, trying to figure out who/what/when/why)

And for all you OUAT fans: If you think Carlyle is good as ""bad-maybe"" Rumpel/Mr. Gold, you haven't met the character ""David Russel"". If you Carlyle fans want to experience cognitive dissonance, watch Carlyle in OUAT episode 8 (""Desparate Souls"") and then watch him here. That man can ACT!!!!

Without giving any details away, the gist of the main storyline is that entities in the government in Great Britain are working to implement T.I.A. (Total Information Access), a network of data feeds that includes banks, stores, transportation systems, surveillance cameras, and any data source that requires the use of an ID card, bank card, etc.  This is being done to increase statewide security against the possibility of terrorist activities, etc.  Of course, this kind of total info access can be used for all kinds of agendas...

...enter our main character, a world renowned Mathematician who has been out of country for several years, living more or less in isolation, to attend a funeral.  When he gets home he discovers that there have been MANY changes in his absence. And so the story begins.

As the story progresses you won't know which way to turn, who is on whose side, and what everyone is after.  This is top-flight made-for-TV drama and suspense.

I have to admit that I did not care personally for some of the interpersonal situations that were presented from time to time, though one did add to the storyline.

This is a not too futuristic version of Big Brother is Watching.  The acting is strong, and the story line is engaging.

All in all, I'd say this is a very good offering, I can recommend it, with just a a few personal reservations.

3627450,5,B001H9JBW6,"This video is spellbinding from beginning to end as we look into our own futures.  The day is not long off when we will all be carrying around ID cards and using them to get into all buildings/conveyances so the government will always know where we are....a frightening thought, but it IS coming.  People have become like sheep in letting their governments get away with all they do.  The youth of America and the UK are becoming conditioned to accept all of this as ""normal"".  I feel sorry for them as they will never know the freedoms that we experienced as kids.  They should make the viewing of this video mandatory in every school in the US and Europe.  Benedict Cumberbatch is in his best role ever (even better than Holmes).

Wake up people......the days of the Beatles walking barefoot across Abbey Road are gone forever.",1292198400,10,829,4.636986301369863
3627451,5,B001H9JBW6,"This movie works on so many levels, it's difficult to review accurately.  I think you will view it differently than your neighbor, depending on what you choose to focus on.  Is it a mystery?  Is it an issue of the manipulation of vaccines?  Or is it about a society where the government can monitor it's citizens 24/7, track you everywhere and control your behavior through a massive computer system? Or is it a modern view of an old classic love story?

And it works on all of those levels.

Look at where we are in America today.  Look at the TSA at airports, coming to train stations, bus depots, metra stations, and who knows where else.  And when you see this movie, you can very easily see where we are headed.

And, in addition, This Perfect Day by Ira Levin is a better book describing a future than 1984 or Brave New World.",1290556800,5,832,4.38562091503268

Very scary and shocking ending ...
I recomend it.",1285891200,,175,4.67741935483871
3627453,1,B001H9JBW6,"I am very fond of British drama on TV, and I am a regular watcher of Masterpiece Theater (and its two spin-off features, Masterpiece Mystery and Masterpiece Contemporary).  However, I did not catch The Last Enemy when it appeared on TV in early 2008.  After reading the reviews in Amazon (seven very enthusiastic and one very negative), I bought the set.  I have watched an episode a night for the past five nights.  My opinion: The Last Enemy is not very good.  From the very first episode I found it very difficult to follow.  It moves too fast for me, without sufficient explanation, sufficient clues, to know what is going on even superficially.  At the end of an episode I found myself somewhat puzzled and annoyed.  It is not very clear just who is who and just how they are related to each other in their roles and jobs.  There is a good deal of sliding ID cards through the door locks, submitting to an eye scan to get through gates, etc.  In the course of five episodes this kind of action becomes just too much -- too much running down a corridor, opening a door with an ID card, then running down a set of stairs, opening another door and bursting into a room where another character is sitting at a computer.  Too much quick scene changing from one group to another, and back and forth changing from group to group, cutting the action into little bits and pieces.  I found the last episode - number 5 - the best of the lot, because it explained more clearly, made more sense, went more slowly, with people talking clearly to each other.  But it too was disappointing - with a disappointing ending.

I found the love story very poorly related to the main plot of suspense: complete information control and thereby people control, political intrigue, and terrorism.  It is also very poorly developed and portrayed, the animal ferocity of Michael's widow in the very first episode being somewhat ridiculous and unbelievable.  The ready complicity of Stephen at this point was also unbelievable.  I found the resolution of this love triangle also very unsatisfactory - and ubelievable.

This story was shown on TV over a period of five weeks - five Sundays, starting in February 2008.  I wonder how many people who began it stayed with it until the end.  Watching it on DVD, I had the opportunity to re-run scenes I did not quite catch - to pick up the bits of dialogue I could not understand at the first playing.  Viewers of the actual Sunday night TV Masterpiece Theater did not have that luxury -- they got it the first time or they didn't get it.  How many lasted through all five Sunday nights?

Finally, this DVD set really needs English subtitles.  It does not have them.  At this date (2010) there is no excuse for that.  (Incidentally, the directions on the screen state that you can have subtitles by clicking on your remote control.  I clicked on mine for each disc and got nothing but the off sign.)

More and more I am finding that the Masterpiece Contemporary shows do not quite satisfy.  They do not in my opinion match Masterpiece Theater or Masterpiece Mystery - not by half.  This DVD set of The Last Enemy confirms my opinion.  I now wish I had saved my money and borrowed this set from the public library.",1280707200,28,3234,4.5528596187175046

8308256,5,B001H9JBW6,"The lead actor ~ Benedict Cumberbatch, is excellent in this disturbing story.  All the other actors were also great but for me, I had a very difficult time understanding what they were saying as the British and Scottish accents were very heavy and they talk so fast, it's just hard for me to understand, so there was a lot of ""backing up and repeating"" involved.  It's a disturbing movie,  given the fact that this COULD happen and at times, I wonder if this is where we're going.",1500336000,2,480,4.494252873563219
8308257,5,B001H9JBW6,"This series is very intense and mysterious.  In a near future time (perhaps today?) the government is able to follow the moves of everyone via a chip inserted in their arm.  All done for your protection at the loss of any privacy.  Your internet use, video views of what you're doing 24/7.
But their is a much more sinister motive behind this, and you are not the beneficiary of the surveillance.  Benedict Cumberbatch becomes involved when he returns from another country for his brother's funeral.  The acting of all the actors is great.  The pace is fast, the tension grabs you and is mesmerizing.",1493424000,2,600,4.721153846153846
