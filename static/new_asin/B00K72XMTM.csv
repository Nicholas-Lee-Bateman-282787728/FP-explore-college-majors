6403959,4,B00K72XMTM,"This is one of my favorite movies to show for our Esperanto film nights, since it's two movies in the length of one.
A lot of the group really likes The Wall People because it feels pretty unique, but they're both sufficiently entertaining.

FYI it has Esperanto dubs and subs - usually we watch them in Esperanto with English subtitles.
Also the pronunciation and grammar is decent, I think Mihm got the help of real Esperantists for translating and dubbing, so no ""Google Translate"" Esperanto here.",1471737600,2,500,4.813953488372093

6403963,5,B00K72XMTM,"Christopher R. Mihm continues his passionate homage to 1950s creature features and sci-fi epics with this pairing of drive in fodder complete with announcements and intermission, which was a great touch. Each of these films is about 45 minutes long and both are enjoyable in their own ways. The first installment ""X: The Fiend From Beyond Space,"" is the more traditional space-based sci-fi thriller that also plays well as a modern retro tribute to ""Alien,"" complete with a strong female lead. I loved the spaceship made of pegboard and the special effects are enchantingly ludicrous, but that's part of the point. Mihm does produce a film that looks true to the original films of the 1950s, complete with ridiculous terminology (""the gravity well of the rogue planet,"") and a great monster with a very specialized tongue. The dialogue is likewise fittingly campy (""A toast to our friend Creepy, the space monster..."") while the petty interactions of the crewmembers are true to the original hammy melodramas.

""The Wall People"" has a more ""Twilight Zone"" spooky vibe and some very dark undertones. There are great moments of sublime humor (find out why the government really took lead out of house paint!) and a strange plot involving Dr. Barney Collins' son being lost on Pluto. But is it really Pluto or is it the afterlife? If you don't follow closely (very closely) you'll never be sure. There's a great monster and a true to form ""Five Years Later..."" postscript that gets even weirder. The acting is appropriately over the top for the material, and even though it's not one of Mihm's funniest, it's definitely one of his well-plotted.

The DVD comes with a typically long blooper reel and a great trailer and photo gallery. I am thrilled Mihm continues to make these movies that he obviously loves so much. This is a great little duo, and I recommend it to B-movie aficionados everywhere.",1425686400,6,1895,4.91875

6403965,3,B00K72XMTM,"X: THE FIEND FROM BEYOND SPACE - like Attack of the Moon Zombies, it takes place entirely inside a rocket ship.  Only this time it doesn't work.  The reason is because most of the characters are unlikable.  Stephanie Mihm gives the only enjoyable performance in the movie. It was disappointing that Michael Kaiser was cast as the alien, instead of being given a speaking part.  In my opinion, this is the worst of the Mihm films.
THE WALL PEOPLE - This is a bizarre mind twister.  Mike Cook and James Norgard give good performances as the men who try to help the father find his son.  I like most of Christopher Mihm's movies, but these were a disappointment.",1413331200,3,659,4.5423728813559325
6403966,4,B00K72XMTM,Great stuff from Christopher  R. Mihm and company. The Wall People is basically a better version of Insidious.,1405209600,2,110,5.111111111111111
6403967,5,B00K72XMTM,"Late Night Double feature is a great send up to old time drive in double features. We even get the old fashioned announcement that our show starts in a few minutes as well as a brief intermission. First up is X: Fiend from Beyond Space. While the film doesn't actually have much dramatic tension like others in this genre such as ""It! The terror from Beyond Space"" from which Mihm obviously borrows the title, we do get one of the best creatures designs so far in the Mihm-verse. Over all it's a fun romp through some much loved sci-fi tropes. A good quick opener for our double feature event. The real stand out in this set is Wall People. Very much a send up to the days of Twilight Zone, Outer Limits or even Night Gallery. Douglas Sidney gives a stand out performance as a man anguished over the disappearance of his son eight years prior to the film.  Michael Cook once again appears as the always charming  Dr Vincent Edwards who continues to survive all the crazy adventures Mihm can throw at him. And let's not forget the great creature effects showcased in Wall people as well. Finally, both films have great soundtracks with Wall People utilizing the music fully to keep the tension tight. And the song over the end credits is not to be missed. A great tune by Bad Horse.",1404172800,4,1281,4.47008547008547

8656463,5,B00K72XMTM,"I'm a total fan of Christopher Mihm. His movies are ultra low budget, the acting is terrible on purpose but his films have creativity and a sense of fun that is sadly lacking in most new Hollywood films that cost 100's of times more money to make. Of all his films this ""double feature"" is one of my favorites. The first one is s a standard alien movie, more or less the plot from the first Alien movie. I love the ""space ship"" which has walls of plasterboard with holes like my dad used to have in his workroom and along with pseudo electronic gadgets on the wall there are oven mits and teacups! But the Wall People was really what made this. I could see Wall People being remade into a big budget movie. I had a very interesting plot that kept me guessing right up until the end. If you are familiar with P.K. Dick's novels and stories where reality is never what it seems Wall People had that sort of feel to it. Set your expectations; the effects are ultra low budget but if you love creativity and style over special effects and if you love seeing homages to classic 50's films I  think you will really enjoy Mihm's work and this film in particular.",1518220800,2,1155,4.298165137614679
8656464,5,B00K72XMTM,"Oh, yeah, the Mihmiverse does it for me again!

A most delightful break from collating the files on my computer as I sat back, cracked a coca cola and began consuming popcorn (hot BUTTERED, naturally) and basically relived my youth.
First, let's talk about ""X: The Fiend from Beyond Space"" . One quarter alien, one quarter IT, the Terror from Beyond Space (1958) only Michael G. Kaiser was luckier than the late, great, Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan who played ""It"". At least Michael didn;t have to keep punching himself in the face to get his eyeholes back in position so he could see.
As mentioned by another reviewer Michael didn't get his usual ""dual"" role here....usually a ""Barney Fife"" kind of role as well as the Monster...but he does have absorbing down really good.
The other two quarters of this one? Space Opera, friend. Just old school Space Opera.
Which blew their entire budget for duct tape so none was used in the second feature of this double bill.

Which brings us to the horror that is

THE WALL PEOPLE

They come through the walls like a shadow in the night to steal the children of earth and take them to...
Let's just say, ""Somewhere Else.""

The always enjoyable Douglas Sidney (as Barney Collins) thinks HE knows but even he isn't always certain as the Master of the Wall People manipulates his mind (and, consequently, his perception of reality) in order to keep him from gettinng back his son who had disappeared some eight years before the story begins.

Or was it eight years?
Did he have a son?
Did I even watch this?
Could it have been a dream? An undigested bit of beef? A blot of mustard?
Am I even writing this?
Does it even make sense that I could have been watching a movie on a screen via some sort of wireless connection?
That's pure science fiction!

It is far more probable that I am lying in a sanatorium in a straight jacket having completely lost touch with reality!",1516406400,,1899,4.551319648093842
8656465,5,B00K72XMTM,"I love all of Mihm's movies, and this fun double-feature of his has that throw-back, black-and-white B-movie horror and science fiction feel to it.  Just like going to the drive-in theater or grindhouse back in days gone by.",1514592000,,224,4.894736842105263

8656468,5,B00K72XMTM,"X: The Fiend From Beyond Space is far too short and comes off more like an attempt to condense the plot of The Thing From Another World into the span of a Twilight Zone episode.  By contrast, The Wall People comes off as an effort to expand a Richard Matheson-penned Twilight Zone episode into a feature-length film. Miraculously, both pieces work well together and fans of the Mihmverse will be satisfied by this Double Feature. I only wish the closing theme song ""Late Night Double Feature"" (a clear tribute to the music of Richard O'Brien and another famous song about late night B-movies) were available as a separate track without going through the hell that is iTunes.  Still, one can't have everything... but this film is darn close.",1487462400,,740,4.7734375
8656469,4,B00K72XMTM,"Being really into 1960s ""Outer Limits"" & 1950s ""Twilight Zone"" as well as ""Suspense"", ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"", & ""Tales Of Tomorrow"".  my friend Prof. Bachman, suggested I check out this Local MPLS-SP Directors work. Mihm has done 10 of these type of films so far, however I believe this one is probably his best, as it is the closest, to that genre I love so dearly. Do yourself a  favor & watch the ""Special Features Sections"" so you can see how Mihm & crew (especially his wife Stephanie)  do so much with so little.  If you're into, 50s-60s Film Noir , you might want to  check out some of Mihm's other work like: ""Attack Of The Moon Zombies"" ""Destination Outer Space"" & the children friendly ""Danny Johnson Saves The World"" or his last film ""Weresquito: Nazi Hunter"". I am really looking forward to his newest 2017 ""Demon With The Atomic Brain""  That's the real deal .... RLS",1485475200,,884,4.598726114649682
