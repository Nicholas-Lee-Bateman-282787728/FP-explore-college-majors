4249597,5,B0042EJD8A,"GASLAND will forever change they way you think about Natural Gas Drilling. The Natural Gas Industry wants you to believe that Natural Gas is the ""Clean Burning Fuel"" but what you don't know is that the horrible chemicals they  use in fracking are contaminating people's water all over the country.  No one should ever be able to light their water on fire, but they can. No one should have to breath chemicals in the air right outside their own homes, but they do.  This excellent documentary takes you across the US to show just a hand full of people whom are being affected by the gas industry.  You won't believe your eyes or your ears to what Josh Fox uncovers, jaw dropping facts and the cover up taking place every single day.",1292371200,16,731,4.515151515151516
4249598,5,B0042EJD8A,"Gasland is an artistic masterpiece! This tour de force dismantles the argument that natural gas is the new bridge fuel and in fact cleaner than coal.  Josh Fox's chilling revelations of the impact of natural gas drilling and fracking includes a decidedly frightening look at ordinary citizens who have water that can be literally set on fire. Gasland features a well written narration as well as a beautifully sequenced pace which creates a work of art as well as a meaningful revelation of a very complex subject.  Gasland could be as significant as ""Silent Spring.""",1292371200,13,567,4.957894736842105

4249600,5,B0042EJD8A,"If you live in a zone increasingly referred to by its residents as being, "" on the shale"", you are certainly aware of the documentary "" Gasland"", Pennsylvania native, renown off Broadway theatre director and now Sundance Film Festival special jury prize award winner, Josh Fox's attention grabbing foray into activism through film. So powerful is the result, the oil and gas industry, via a PR group, "" Energy-In-Depth"", drafted a paper circulating around the internet called ""De-Bunking Gasland."" Fox responded with a 39 page retort,"" Debunking the De-Bunkers"". Commentators, bloggers and posters have been weighing in around the country whether they have seen the film or not. Viewers report reactions ranging from nightmares to insomnia to joining the fight.

Those of us living above the geologic layer known as the Marcellus shale have no need to ask why all the fuss. The 15 million or so who reside in or draw their drinking water from the watershed of the Delaware River, as well as residents of 34 other states living above gas bearing shale formations, perhaps ought to find out.

Synopsis: Youthful, sincere, witty, brilliant, urban hick Fox and his family receive an offer  to lease the old family hippie homestead located on a tributary of the Delaware in northeastern Pennsylvania for natural gas ""exploration"". Close to $100,000 for the right to drill a mile under their 19 acres in moist, luscious, secluded, fern and forest country. Fox has heard of the water well contamination from gas drilling in nearby Dimock, PA and embarks on a quest to discover the possible pitfalls to accepting the windfall. With remarkable ability to gain access into people's homes and lives, Fox makes friends everywhere he goes, documents people's horror stories, gets rebuffed by corporate gate keepers, dismissed by bureaucrats in charge of protecting the health and safety of we, the citizenry, and finds a couple of genuine scientific heroes along the way. He also discovers - surprise! - our evil former Vice President cleverly cleared the path for the expansion of a technique pioneered in environmentally deprived Texas, known as high pressure slick water hydraulic fracturing, which opened up previously unexploitable gas bearing shale formations to massive development in areas all over the country. One of which, the United States northeast's Marcellus shale, has been called the ""Saudia Arabia of shales"". Potentially the second largest resource of ""natural"" gas yet found in the the world.

In only his second effort at film directing, highly political theatre director Fox, along with a very skilled film editor, crafted a remarkably moving piece of work. Why do we allow corporations to roll over people's lives, trashing our various pursuits of happiness and right of quiet enjoyment of our real property? Why are representatives and bureaucrats so unresponsive and unemotional when presented with evidence of ill treatment of their constituents? Why do some brave souls risk their livelihood or at least their neighborhood standing in fighting for health and justice? These are among the questions that may haunt a viewer of ""Gasland"".

Is it possible not to be moved by 3rd generation cattle rancher, John Fenton, as he expounds, ""This may not seem like much to most people, but its my way of life. My father and grandfather were the old time cowboys. This is my family's heritage, my wife's family's farm. We're proud of this. But by God, if your way of life is being besieged....I don't know what else you could do. I don't know where the hell I could go. This is happening everywhere. That's what I want people to know."" ? Is it possible not to understand the injustice, when seeing the Fenton family cabin perched on a dry Wyoming range country hillside, overlooking gas well pad, after pad, after pad; storage tank, after tank, after tank, or when seeing their home enveloped in a sick looking toxic fog, or watching tranquil mooers you may one day find on your dinner plate slurping from watering tanks amidst an industrial wasteland? Is it possible to see and hear all that, and, comprehending that the Fenton's do not own the gas rights to their ranch property - that all the mess was all imposed on them without their say and without benefit to them - and not be emotionally moved?

Maybe not if you make you living in or around the extraction of natural gas. Then you may be moved by ""Gasland"" in a different way; moved to near panic. What if people catch on that the current extraction process is a vast experiment, what if the public figures out that the risk, the potential trashing of our finite fresh water supply from a combination of toxins added in the fracturing process and naturally occurring elements and compounds released by the high pressure forcing of these fluids deep underground, is just too much of a gamble? What if people begin to think: we've got to get off hydrocarbons asap? Not worth the risk, not worth the environmental degradation and its potential effects on our loved ones health. Or on our ability to enjoy and renew ourselves in the natural world we ultimately depend upon for our existence.

These too are among the questions ""Gasland"" slips into a viewers mind. On screen, unintentionally, Fox proves himself one of the heros he brings into focus. His friendly, empathetic manner not only gains him amazing access, but wins viewers over. He is open minded, curious, funny, non judgmental when it comes to people ( not necessarily corporations), a bit disheveled, and very determined.

All of these characteristics are on display when you see him enter the modest home of Mike Markham and Marsha Medenhall in Weld County, Colorado. As Mike lights water directly from his tap on fire, Fox's first reaction is a completely unselfconscious: ""Woah! Jesus Christ!"". He joins Mike in a hard laugh at the absurd circumstance of a huge billow of flame erupting from the family kitchen faucet, then asks, as any adventurous kid might, ""Can I do it?"" When he does and is taken aback by the flames and the potential danger, he reels away from the tap physically moved. You see on his face a change from astonishment at his personal circumstance to true empathy, as he appears overcome by the emotion of the havoc that has entered the lives of his hosts. To the viewer it becomes clear, by the circumstance of having the camera turned on him, the heroic nature of the Director. It is hard not to think: those hippie parents sure did a good job with this one. Raised a real human being who feels sincerely for others, looks at societal issues critically and is able to act effectively to move things in a different direction, all with his sense of fun and passion for life intact.

If we are to move forward as a society in learning to treasure our home in the universe, we need real heroes like Josh Fox and John Fenton. And like Weston Wilson, long time EPA environmental engineer who boldly faces the camera and holds forth regarding citizen's experiencing well water contamination via migrating methane gas and plausibly, from ""proprietary"" chemical formulations used in hydraulic fracturing, ""This is America. We shouldn't be assuming corporations can keep a secret. Especially when they are practicing in our backyard. The onus should be on the industry to prove that their practices are benign. Even if it weren't true, they are citizens of the United States and they certainly don't deserve to be exposed to secret chemicals. It's un-American.""

There is a myth going around the parts of Pennsylvania once know as the ""Endless Mountains"" and the ""Pennsylvania Wilds"". As residents find the rhythm and pace of the place where they chose to make their lives changing almost overnight, as semi-truck and pick up traffic become more like the overwhelming hassle they see in urban areas, as roads disintegrate before their eyes, as stories of incidents of pushy land men, water well contamination, illegal dumping and overweight trucks become common place, as Texas license plates proliferate like rodents, the myth gains circulation: The shale area of Texas once looked like the present day northern tier of Pennsylvania. Then gas development began to take hold. As it grew, eventually the streams and rivers dried up from water withdrawls and associated micro and macro climatic changes in annual precipitation, leaving only bone dry stream beds most of the year. As more and more trees were removed from the forests to make room for well pads, storage tanks and ponds, pipelines, pipeyards, roads, metering and compressor stations, and all the other infrastructure of gas field development, remaining drought stressed trees began to die in droves. When the big trees were mostly all gone, succeeded mainly by invasive weed plant species, people moved off the land into endlessly growing urban and suburban centers which soon sprawled together in a huge toxic blob. Rural land was left abandoned, unfit for human and animal habitation, deemed an unnecessary obstacle to drilling and pipeline efficiency. The mountains were flattened, hollows filled in and result: Texas.

Will the myth prove prophetic for places you care about that are ""on the shale""? Not if enough people join the fight. If you need motivation, check out Gasland.",1292284800,16,9283,4.9787234042553195
4249601,5,B0042EJD8A,"Josh Fox's GASLAND is an entertaining, high energy piece of art that will make you laugh and leave you terrified. Fox traveled across the country and through the gas patches in his old Camry with nothing but his curiosity, ample passion and a camera. Watching GASLAND is an interactive experience; you will laugh, cry, shake your head in disbelief, curse and marvel at the triumph of the human spirit. If this film doesn't make you think about the future and motivate you to action, check your pulse.

I live on top of the Barnett Shale and for six years now I have blogged about the devastating effects of natural gas extraction. Everything in GASLAND, I have witnessed firsthand and captured in video and photographs on my blog.

Natural gas is not a clean energy, and if this is our bridge fuel, we aren't going far. It's another dirty fossil fuel that creates massive amounts of toxic and radioactive waste for which industry has no plan. They are spreading this waste on our farmland, dumping it in streams and ditches and burying it in fields. The water use is simply not sustainable and our surface and groundwater is being contaminated. The emissions make natural gas worse for the climate than coal--now that's BAD!

We can decide now to go forward and build a sustainable world where our children will have a future or continue to beat the hydrocarbon energy dead horse to the ruination of our vital natural resources.

4249603,5,B0042EJD8A,"In 2001 Dick Cheney and the most powerful figures in the gas and oil industries hid behind closed doors to devise an energy policy that made hazards to health and the environment legal.  Today filmmaker Josh Fox, out in the open with just a video recorder, responds with the documentary GASLAND, a trek across 24 United States where natural gas drilling makes tap water flammable - and makes an inordinately high percentage of locals sick.

I had never thought twice about natural gas - it's been an energy source since before I was born.  As GASLAND explains, what's upped the ante is the secret Cheney meeting's approval of the secretive process of hydraulic fracturing - nicknamed fracking - a mix of dangerous chemicals and large amounts of public drinking water to extract gas from the ground that devastates the environment.

Will GASLAND prove the stone with which David-like Josh Fox fells the Goliath that is Big Energy?  As I write this in November 2010, Pennsylvania has just elected natural gas industry-friendly Tom ""Pennsylvania is open for business"" Corbett.  The Keystone State has one of world's largest gas deposits and, with none other than Josh Fox one of its leaders, a grassroots resistance mobilizes.

This is no sci-fi thriller that could never happen in real life, however. Shockingly, it IS really happening and it's worse than you can imagine.

Very fortunately, for all of us, Josh Fox, brave soul that he is, ventured out into the heart of America and into the small towns of this country to actually speak to regular, law abiding, tax paying citizens who are now paying the ultimate price for ""clean"" gas drilling with permanent health effects, including brain damage, chronic respiratory conditions and many other serious conditions, too numerous to mention. Their land is worthless, their water undrinkable. The now famous scene where the tap water actually bursts into flame is just the tip of the iceburg. The epidemic of hydrofracking now taking place in America is worse than any disease we've ever encountered. It destroys our water, our air, our animals, our vegetation (including farm crops), our livestock, our health and our lives. This is Three Mile Island, Love Canal and Chernobyl--times fifty.

GASLAND should be shown in every elementary, high school and college classroom. At least that way, when our children grow into adults, they will know why there is no such thing anymore as fresh water in America. And they will know who was responsible.",1289520000,231,1515,4.984189723320158

From Josh Fox's living room in Pennsylvania begins a journey to Arkansas, Texas, Wyoming and beyond. No matter where the story carries him, the view is always the same with a repeated pattern of toxic chemicals, contaminated water, mysterious foul smells and above all, worry and frustration of the citizens forced to live in GasLand everyday.
The people featured in the film become your friends, you cannot help but like them.  They share their stories and you will find yourself searching the internet to learn more of the injustice being delivered on them at the hands of corporations who consider them to be part of a sacrifice zone and their elected leaders busy looking the other way as they accept millions of dollars in campaign contributions.

In this film, you will not see a single interview with a scientist. Nor will you hear much in terms of scientific explanation. What you will see is an amazingly well-crafted piece of misinformation and scientific ignorance.

To start with, pretty much all the interviews are conducted with common people that have little to no scientific understanding of the environment. In the most dramatic scenes we see water taps bursting into flames, or Josh wearing a gas mask while strumming a banjo in this apocalyptic world [brought on by fracking obviously].

Propaganda at its finest; unfortunately, a couple of pesky scientific facts are ignored:

1. Natural gas occurs naturally in many areas (hence the name natural gas), including in water
2. Natural gas is not toxic

(Natural gas is only dangerous when it displaces oxygen in the air, causing asphyxiation. It also explodes, but so do all forms of energy, and the ability of something to explode or burn has nothing to do with toxicity.)

So why is he wearing a gas mask? Propaganda. It reminds me of when it gets really cold in select areas during the winter and the members of the Far Right interview common people and confirm that since they are cold, global warming must be false. They take a few pictures of someone bundled up and snow flurries in the background and there you have it, the Far Rights version of Gasland.

Mr. Fox does pretend to present scientific information. At one point there is a chemical analysis of the fracking fluids used in one location. Mr. Fox reads the lab report himself (no scientist present), notes that one chemical is a toxin, and thats it. There is no explanation of what this toxin is, how to works on the human body, and what it does to it.

In terms of the process of fracking there is even less information. In fairness, there wasn't a lot of information readily available at the time this movie was made. But since then President Barack Obamas Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), under the administration of environmentalist Gina McCarthy, released the one and only detailed scientific study of fracking, not funded by the fracking industry itself. The scientific report concluded that if done properly, there is no leaking of fracking fluid or natural gas before, during, or after the fracking has occurred.

Has fracking occurred in a manner that wasn't proper? In a few instances; of course. But all that means is we need to regulate and watch over energy companies more, not ban them from fracking completely.

We know regulation can work because Norway does it very well. 20% of Norways total economy is based upon the extraction and sale of fossil fuels (as opposed to only 6% in the United States), and yet they maintain one of the cleanest countries and healthiest populations in the entire world (putting the United States to shame).

Unfortunately, all this ignorance and propaganda surrounding fracking is bad, really bad. It is so bad, in fact, that it has increased the rate of global warming! To understand why you have to understand two last, important scientific facts:

1. Natural gas is one of the cleanest and cheapest sources of fuel in the world. It burns hot, releases little carbon, and is abundant.
2. Alternative energy sources like wind, solar, and tidal power, are currently neither cheap nor reliable.

What this means is that in order to effectively transition to alternative energy sources we need natural gas. Natural gas is already used to supplement most large scale solar farms. This helps bring the cost of solar power down while making it more reliable (the sun doesnt always shine, but natural gas will always burn). To hinder the extraction of natural gas is to hinder the solar industry.

One day scientific discoveries will allow us to abandon fossil fuels entirely. Were on the right track. Barack Obama has been supporting alternative energy directly and indirectly throughout his presidency, and people like Elon Musk are showing how businesses can contribute as well. But we just don't have the technology yet for mass scale implementation of alternative energy. Until that time comes replacing oil, coal, and gas with natural gas will substantially bring down our CO2 emissions, almost immediately.

For me, at least, that's important. Because I care about ending global warming ASAP!",1439164800,2,4766,4.9523809523809526

""(1) Water trouble

(5) Lack of confidence in State regulatory commissions
(6) A feeling of having been deceived
(7) A feeling of powerlessness
(8) Dead or sick animals
(9) Difficulty in obtaining good information about gas drilling
(10) Idea that there's a cover-up taking place""

The above comes from this powerful documentary that focuses on communities in the U.S. affected by natural gas drilling, specifically, a method of horizontal drilling into shale formations deep below the ground known as hydraulic fracturing or ""fracking.""  The above list presents some hazards of fracking as told to us by the narrator.

The writer and director of this film, Josh Fox, narrates it.

He begins by telling us of a letter he received in May, 2008 from a natural gas company.  They offered to lease his family's land (located in Pennsylvania) for one hundred thousand dollars to drill for gas.

Fox then sets out to discover how communities are being affected in the west where natural gas drilling has been occurring for the past 10 years.  He spent time with citizens in their homes and on their land as they described stories of natural gas drilling in Colorado, Wyoming Utah, and Texas, and many other states.

Many of these people have experienced a variety of chronic health problems traceable to the contamination of their air, water wells, or surface water.  In some cases, these residents reported that they obtained a court injunction or settlement from gas companies to replace their contaminated water supplies with potable water or water purification kits.

Throughout the documentary, Fox reached out to scientists, politicians, and gas industry executives.  He ultimately found himself in the halls of congress as a subcommittee was discussing the ""Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act,"" a ""bill to amend the `Safe Drinking Water Act' to repel an exemption for hydraulic fracturing.""  Hydraulic fracturing was exempted from the Safe Drinking Water Act in the ""Energy Policy Act"" of 2005 (thanks to everybody's friend, former U.S. Vice-President Dick Cheney).

This documentary has extraordinary visuals.  A VERY interesting environmental story is made better by the fact that its visuals are very poetic, very lyrical and its themes & ideas are relevant and well-presented.

There were 90 people interviewed for this documentary (according to the end credits).  The number of interviews that were declined was 30.  Two that declined was a representative for Exxon Mobile (well-known for distributing disinformation) and a representative for BP (responsible for the 2010 oil spill, the largest--thus far--in history).

Some awards for this documentary include:

(1) 2011 Primetime Emmy
(2) 2010 Environmental Media Award
(3) 2010 Sundance Film Festival Special Jury Prize
(4) 2010 Yale Environmental Film Festival Grand Jury Prize

It was nominated in 2011 for an Academy Award for Best Documentary.

There is a sequel to Gasland entitled ""Gasland Part II.""

Be aware that there is a popular book and popular documentary that champion fracking and oppose Fox's film.  They are entitled ""Groundswell"" and ""Truthland"" respectively.  The former was written by a one-time tobacco industry lobbyist and the latter was funded by the gas industry.  Need I say more?

Finally, the DVD itself (released in 2010) has 9 extras.  All of them are interesting.

In conclusion, if your soul isn't moved by this unforgettable documentary, then yours is a heart of shale.

4249720,1,B0042EJD8A,"This film should never have been made. It is misleading and untrue - grassroots filmmaking at its worst. It relies on false information from scurrilous sources and has caused panic in America and countries across the globe. Yet this movie has won its creator, Josh Fox, numerous awards, including an Emmy. And - heaven help us! - it nearly won an Oscar.

How come when it's fraudulent?

Because it plays on people's ignorance, manipulates or ignores scientific evidence, and exploits emotions. Terry Engelder - Prof of Geosciences at Penn State University - is critical and has publicly stated:- `I have seen ""Gasland"" and the flaw is that there is a tremendous amount of innuendo in the movie. The innuendo is that all the problems that you see in that movie are a direct result of the gas industry and in particular hydraulic fracturing.'

This film would have us believe there's no proper regulation for oil companies - they are free to rampage across the land, wrecking the country and people's lives. In truth oil companies are tightly regulated. They are fined enormous sums of money if they damage they environment ...

You want proof? ... Then read this New York Times article dated 4 Sept 2014. The headline tells it all:- `BP May Be Fined Up to $18 Billion for Spill in Gulf'.

Later in the article the NY Times reveals other companies are in trouble:- 'This week Halliburton reached a $1.1 billion settlement with individual and business plaintiffs. Last year, Transocean agreed to pay $1.4 billion to settle federal criminal and civil charges, which is likely to cover most of its liability.'

There's plenty of regulation when it comes to oil companies. And there's no way they can do what they like when it comes to fracking. There's no get out clause - no loophole - when it comes to the law despite what ""Gasland"" claims.

In short, ""Gasland"" is peddling false information. And this is just one of many falsehoods - bogus claims and gross errors - that litter this documentary and mislead the viewer.

Not only is this movie untrue - it's atrociously made. It looks as if it's shot on a mobile phone by a drunken child. Pictures are constantly out of focus and joggle all over the place. It's painful to watch. Fox's lack of basic cinematic skills destroys the film's credibility.

Above all it's boring - God it's boring! Fox drawls on and on and on in a dreary monotone - the ultimate snore-monger - tedious beyond belief.

Somebody once said, `A little knowledge is a dangerous thing'.  ""Gasland"" proves this is true. Feed Josh Fox a tall tale and he'll believe it. If someone claims fracking  causes his kitchen water tap to explode into flames Josh believes him and shoves it in his movie. If other people claim fracking causes `weapons grade uranium' to contaminate their drinking water then shove that in your movie, too. Neither story is true but heck, who cares, it looks good on the screen.

Josh Fox is a dupe and easily hoaxed. He's one of the most successful peddlers of disinformation in modern times. Everything about his movie is shoddy and amateurish. But he's fooled millions of people and caused panic. Fracking is now banned in parts of America and Canada and other countries as a result of his scare stories. He's doing immense damage to us in the West.

What about the arguments? After all, many people have genuine concerns about fracking ... I've gone into them in detail in a long review elsewhere on Amazon. So I'll avoid repeating them here.

But if you read my book review - ""Groundswell - the case for fracking"" by Ezra Levant - you'll see evidence that contradicts the false claims made in this movie. My review is called:- `Thank God for fracking - It's saving us all in the West.'

Also take a look at a couple of documentaries that challenge this film. Unlike ""Gasland"" they're crammed with experts. You can watch them for free on YouTube.  The documentaries are called ""FRACK NATION"" by Phelim McAleer. The second free documentary is called  ""TRUTHLAND"". Besides talking to people with genuine expertise these documentaries visit the places and speak to the folk featured in ""Gasland"". And yes, they show flaming water pipes! But they tell a different story from what Fox would have you believe. In particular, look at the way Josh behaves in ""Frack Nation"" when challenged about  flaming water. Is his reaction what you'd expect from a person telling us the whole truth about fracking? Or has he been caught out and got something to hide?

It's time for the nonsense to stop. Organisations who have given  awards to this film - such as Sundance and Emmy - must reconsider their decisions. It is intellectually indecent to endorse muck like this. They destroy their own good name and credibility when they do so. If they have a shred of decency they will withdraw their awards right now.

Besides these foolish organisations, who have given awards to a factually challenged film maker, look at who else is opposing fracking. Misguided green campaigners for a start. Then Middle Eastern states - the OPEC countries. They have atrocious human rights records and some are waging a terror war against us. Also the Russians. ""Gasland"" is a gift to their misinformation campaigns. Like the Middle Eastern dictatorships Russia is using oil and gas as political weapons. The West needs energy independence and only fracking can provide that at the moment.

Meanwhile, one hopes critics in the West will increasingly see hydraulic fracturing for what it is - a technological game changer pioneered in the USA that offers cheap power to everyone. Shale-gas is the miracle of the 21st century. When properly regulated this industry can safely and responsibly unlock vast supplies of cheap, cleaner-burning natural gas. This means lower gas and electricity prices. Great, if you struggling at home to pay your energy bills. And lower costs for industry. The results - a burgeoning economy and greater energy security.

The truth is out there if only the ignorant and gullible will do some homework. And they can find it if they watch those two films free on YouTube - ""Frack Nation"" and ""Truthland"". Sadly,  ""Gasland"" fails to tell the truth. It's trash.

I wish this film were a joke, but it's not. This is a matter of national security. Indeed, international security. The film harms not only the USA, but all her democratic allies. I suspect this film and its follow-up may fall foul of the Patriot Act. When are the security authorities going to act?",1408233600,,6492,4.8104222821203955

4249739,2,B0042EJD8A,"I watched this documentary with an open mind, as I did not know very much about fracking and was politically ambivalent about the issue. Unfortunately, the argument that it was trying to make was underwhelming.

The premise of the movie is that the practice of hydraulic fracturing is ruining water supplies across the nation. It attempts to show this by visiting several homeowners who show us their filthy drinking water. I'm convinced. That is, I'm convinced that their well water is filthy. But there are two critical questions to be asked: what was the cause of the filthy water and how prevalent is this problem? Although the homeowners swear backwards and forwards that the water was perfect before the gas drilling and filthy immediately after, we can only take their words for it. The possibility of a coincidence was not addressed. There are many environmental problems that can cause contaminated well water, both natural and man-made.

The second question is what is the prevalence? If there were millions of houses near fracked sites and only a handful were problematic, that is not such a dire problem. But if there were a large percentage of homes with such a problem, then it is a dire problem for the nation. I don't know which is correct, but the movie makes no attempt to answer that.

This movie seems like it was made for people who already don't like fracking, but don't really understand why and don't want to. I think a more scientific approach would be more useful, and for me, more interesting.",1404950400,5,1520,4.816091954022989

This is a large and growing problem.  As for solutions, I would expect the director Fox to advocate for a system like France when it comes to electricity, or at least explain that one hundred square miles in CA, AZ, NV, and NM need to be turned into a large solar thermal power station.

4249803,5,B0042EJD8A,"This is an in-depth look at the now widely used method of recovering natural gas from non-productive wells called, ""Fracking"".

While the video is highly engaging, and I applaud the director for his efforts, I found it lacking in several areas.  For one thing, it focuses mostly on the effects of fracking on the lives of the farmers and ranch-men where it is taking place.  It's pretty spectacular to see drinking water burst into flames, but there is much more behind the story which I think the director missed.

I wanted to know more about the technical side of fracking, what it is and how it works.  There is very little of that in the video.  I ended up having to do my own research over the Internet.  For instance, GasLand focuses on the fracking process itself as the problem.  In fact, my own research turned up that the disposal of the contaminated waste-water is the bigger story.

After fracking, the gas companies end up with million of gallons of highly contaminated water.  What to do with it?  Not having anywhere to send it, they simply dig another hole and pump it back into the ground.  This is the real problem because the disposal hole is not nearly as deep as the fracking hole so there is much more opportunity for the toxic waste to contaminate drinking water.  And it does!  If the video mentioned this, I missed it.  Perhaps it needs more emphasis.

The one thing that amazed me, and GasLand does a pretty good job of reporting on this, is that the gas drilling companies managed to get our law-makers to exempt them from the Clean Air and Water Act.  Interesting...  What good is a law when the government exempts the very companies that are violating it.  It's inexcusable that mega-companies get to dump millions of gallons of toxic liquid into the ground while Mr. Citizen can be fined tens of thousands of dollars for having a leaky 55 gallon oil tank in his back yard.  Where's the logic in that?

Overall this is an eye opening documentary with a personal emphasis to it.  I recommend it as a starting point for further research into the subject of Fracking.",1397865600,,2093,4.584905660377358

Gasland's creator has become rich, as have most environmental and global warming alarmists like Al Gore and David Suzuki. A very nice little business these people propagate - instilling fear in a large portion of the population, people all too willing to join the cult, desperately wanting to believe that man is the evil perpetrator destroying our world, and profiting handsomely from that.

4249833,3,B0042EJD8A,"I am not surprised that fracking, as it is now practiced, may be harmful to the environment. Fortunately, I live in a state yet to face that particular menace. Nonetheless, I was shocked to learn that this industry is largely exempt from environmental protection laws, and I think that needs to change immediately. I was further shocked to learn that much if not most fracking is conducted on public lands, which can be left forever polluted and scarred.

This is obviously a complex issue. On one hand our nation needs low-cost energy, and the economic stimulus that can provide. On the other, both current and future Americans need clean water and air. Ultimately, we may well regret having squandered those precious limited resources for short-term profit, if indeed that is the case.

I think this film made a good start toward exposing the environmental and public health dangers of fracking, but it was largely based on anecdotal evidence, which was arguably biased against fracking. However, I would like to see more scientific evidence brought to bear on the issue, so the industry and its political lapdogs -- politicians and lobbyists -- have less room to argue their way out of their responsibility for the long-term social costs of fracking. The problem reminds me of the decades-long battle against the tobacco industry, which resisted public accountability until the scientific evidence became so overwhelming it could no longer be denied.",1393113600,,1453,5.100840336134453

George Washington use to light his water on fire.  This has been a past time of Americans for many generations.  I love America because everyone can have an opionion on anything.  This is honestly very rare in the world.  I just wish people who make documentaries would take more care to make them factual.

But throughout this video, I felt there was a conscious effort to manipulate me with things other than the facts. I can even be more direct. I did not like Josh Fox's style. He got off on the wrong foot at the very beginning, by opening with ""I'm not a pessimist."" I've heard that one before, repeatedly. Usually, it's a tipoff that I'm going to be told some sort of fecal matter is about to hit the fan. Methinks the gentleman doth protest too much! I don't know if he's really a pessimist, and I don't care. I just think he's self-consciously making a name for himself by trying to make US pessimists.

I don't like his mumbly delivery. I'm not convinced by lighting tap water on fire, or bottles of dirty water. (They could've come from anywhere. Duh.) And sophomoric stunts like playing a banjo while wearing a gas mask are a complete waste of time.

4249859,5,B0042EJD8A,"I finally got to watch Gasland, a 2011 nominee at the Academy Awards for best documentary. The accolade was well deserved. The film, directed by Josh Fox, tells a story of truly staggering proportions. In the search for sources of energy other than foreign oil, the United States (and Canada too, I later discovered) is increasingly turning to natural gas that is trapped in shale deposits (not to be confused with the natural gas that is produced after a bowl of chili; sorry, I know that was lame, but the eight year old inside me couldn't resist). It turns out that where natural gas is concerned, North America is the Saudi Arabia of the world with a sea of natural gas trapped in massive shale deposits that cover entire states. All you have to do is frack. And what is fracking, you ask? A series of controlled explosions deep underground complemented by the injection of fluids with 596+ chemicals  many carciogenic, many others with unknown effects upon human beings and the environment  to force the natural gas which has been released from the shale up to the surface.

This is so insanely short-sighted that it is difficult to comprehend. Once youve extracted your share of natural gas, how are you going to get all those chemicals out of the ground again? This is like dumping red wine on a white carpet every time you want to get your childs attention. It may work, but how do you propose to deal with the aftermath? (One of the most terrifying statistics presented in the film is that fracking has already contaminated more than 40 trillion gallons of water with those 596 chemicals. Thats a lot of red wine soaked into the carpet.)

The stuffed-suits from the satanic corporations that are despoiling the environment have an advantage over the public relations disaster of fractured pipelines spilling crude onto the tundra: out of sight, out of mind. And it works  for a little bit anyways. That is, until people discover that the water running from their taps is flammable, and until the hair on their pets starts falling out, and until they start suffering from migraine headaches and nausea. Twice anti-christ representatives come from the natural gas companies to tell these beleaguered residents that their water really is okay. Twice those representatives are then handed a glass of tap water by those beleaguered residents who then ask them to take a drink. And twice the shameless representatives decline.

Those executives aren't lying about the water. They are just saying whatever they can to maximize returns to shareholders and line their own pockets. Even if that means injecting 596 chemicals into the earth in state after state after state.

Heres the real problem though. It is easy to complain about evil energy companies (as I have been doing) and there is no doubt that what they are doing is often evil. But look, we want to have air-conditioned homes in Phoenix in August and toasty warm homes where I live in Edmonton in January. We want to go on long road trips to visit the in-laws for Thanksgiving and we want to eat kiwi fruit year round. We want 60 inch television screens and iPhones and plane flights to Hawaii and a hot cup of coffee and a thick burger .

So wheres the energy going to come from?

I don't have the answers. Im just a Christian theologian, after all. But I do know this: if living as we do requires that some of us have flammable water, and environmentally induced cancers, and a destroyed environment, then we really have made a deal with the devil.

Josh presents the facts (and you can check them yourself if you so desire) in such a plain, simple, understandable and well-illustrated way that I could not take my eyes from the screen. Many times I had to replay parts of the video because I couldn't believe how deep this corruption goes (no pun intended). Comparing what big oil companies are doing today with what big tobacco companies did decades ago, is genius! Fracking and smoking are safe! Ha!! I've also watched GasLand II, and anything else I find about this subject. The fracking issue is on the ballots here in Colorado as I write this and I pray the BOCs will not be allowed to tear up our landscapes, kill our wildlife, poison our air and water, and ultimately, lead us all down the path to Armageddon, all on the pretense that this is the safe and best answer to our energy problems.",1383523200,,1067,4.533678756476684

The film shows the effects of suspension of the Safe Drinking Water Act that allowed the broad use of hydraulic fracturing for natural gas extraction. The episodes show a marked contrast to the romanticized versions in the TV ads for the industry.

The film raises questions about control of land use policy, public health priorities, and the rights of citizens vs the rights of corporations.  It raises troubling questions about the fracturing of policy decisions, and the burden of proof of harm.  It raises questions about protecting our life support system: safe water, clean air, fertile ground and the biodiversity of species that support life on Earth.

The film suffers from a rough production style, and has less impact than it might due to an ""amateurish"" appearance.

The content is critical for people to know before they make decisions about land use. I have used it as a discussion base for both community development groups and for environmental policy classes.",1382400000,,1140,5.135135135135135

When you have to sue someone to hide facts, that is not only unethical but dirty. Josh Fox did just that. He was exposed. Phelim McAleer asked Josh Fox why he chose to leave out facts from the Colorado Division of Water about the methane in water that existed long long before hydraulic fracturing (which has been going on since the 1950's). The answer: ""they were not relevant"". Someone posted on YouTube the facts Josh Fox was trying to hide, but being an environmentalist and therefore an enemy of science, he sued so that YouTube would take down the video. He didn't counter with a debate, he silenced. Where I come from, when you try to silence someone it means you have something to hide.

But don't take my word for it. Don't take anyone's word for it. Be an enemy of environmentalists and ask the most important question: ""Where is your raw data as required by the scientific method?""

They consistently deny the ground water is polluted but also when they meet with the affected citizens, refuse to drink the very water that they have declared fit for consumption.

If they made an enforceable law that required all the Fracking industry employees to consume the very water they potentially will affect, that would certainly bring about better results to prevent the poisoning of the ground water.

Throughout my childhood,I am proud to say I helped my parents and many others save beautiful area's throughout the state from enviromental ruin from large industry that only saw dollar signs. It will be up to the people of each state to chip away at this gas monster ,Halliberton or Hellofaburden, (as I like to call them) to save as much land and water as possible. If we don't Our world will face a human induced apocalypse that will be 100 times scarier than watching ""Gaslands"".

At the very least if we keep up with mass amounts of fracking, we will be in world wars over water for survival not energy.
  The reason why I say history repeats itself, is because when the government sold nuclear energy to the american public, we were told it will be so safe and inexpensive people will probalby not even get an electric bill . It will be great and the answer to all of our energy problems. Unfortunately the average person had no idea how nuclear power worked and we were never told that we would be storing used radioactive fuel rods in your back yard. It's taken the industry 50 + years to finally start recycling the used fuel rods as they now are stacked to capacity right outside the reactors.....

4249950,5,B0042EJD8A,"Gasland directed by Josh Fox with Matthew Sanchez is an iconic documentary that stands as a warning to Americans everywhere. The film chronicles Fox's journey attempting to understand whether or not he should take the offer of $100,000.00 to lease his land to a company which wanted to use it to extract the gas and then send it along pipelines to homes who are converting to gas which is cheaper than oil. His land is in a watershed...beautiful and green. It is on top of the Marcellus Shale which has lots of methane gas underneath it if you can only get it out easily and quickly. Sounds great, right? If he leased his land, he would be helping to get off our dependence on oil by allowing drilling for gas. Great. Where do I sign; I'm helping rid us of CO2 emissions. Yeah. But he wasn't sure....and the companies weren't being up front about environmental impact. Hmmm.

And because they weren't up front, he wasn't sure about this drilling process for gas, what it entailed and how it would impact the streams on his land and the environment. So, because he had the time (which many of us do not) he went on an exploratory journey to see what happened to others who leased their land to the companies to drill for gas.  What he discovered was horrifying. First, gas companies are not responsible for their actions after they drill. The EPA doesn't even make an attempt to regulate them because former Vice president Dick Cheney (a star in the film) lobbied his buddies when he was at Halliburton to suspend the Safe Water Drinking Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water act, all of it. So this gas drilling business is completely unregulated and they are not responsible if you allow them on your land and they destroy it to extract the gas.

Fox finds this out when he talks to people who let companies lease their land and found out they had no clean water to drink or shower in as a result of the drilling. It went like this. Before companies drilled-they drank the clean water and bathed and cooked, etc. and were fine. After the companies came in-goodbye to clean, clear water; goodbye to health, goodbye to the good life. This happened to many families who had well water. Problem is, they are far from any water supply so they had to pay for water to be brought in. The companies refused to admit the water was completely toxic, nor did they deign to drink the water to taste how bad it was. The EPA can't even go in and test the water since there is a patent on the chemicals they use to drill ; the chemicals are proprietary and that means they're a secret and not to be disclosed because the Chinese could get a hold of it and put them out of business. That's how they don't have to say these dangerous chemicals are being co-mingled with water. And the EPA of various states have been bought off or lobbied to be useless.

On and on, story after story Fox discovers the impact of fracking (drilling through shale to get at the gas).its effects on the people's water and air (methane and other chemicals coming off the condenser tanes is invisible, but it leaks and goes into the air polluting the air. So water polluted, smell in the air rotten...for some it was so bad, no one would buy their homes...the water was polluted, the methane migrated and leaked into the house. Some were afraid their houses would explode. They were bought out by companies (not at market value) but were forced to sign a non disclosure agreement....they couldn't speak about the hazards. The government did nothing. They had to litigate themselves...to an expensive cost. Either that or stay in the house and be sick and die or explode. The companies are listed in the film, also. The people were not told any of this when they leased.

Josh Fox gets the interviews with the people on camera; the companies never return his calls. He gets pictures of what these folks' tap water looks like; and in many instances, creek water, or tap water has so many flammables, the water ignites into flames. So if you drink the water you die. He gets scientists to discuss the fracking process...it uses water and toxic chemicals that are sent deep into the shale and leak into the ground; of course, they leak out. Once the water supply is contaminated there is no way to purify it; it is gone for good....no reverse osmosis filtering works...no boiling works. The composition of the water has been altered forever; and then of course, the toxic waste water dumps created near the streams (you need water to frack and dump the waste)  migrate and destroy the streams.

Fox decided since he lives in the Delaware River basin and on the border of NY where the watersheds are still pure, he would not lease his land to destroy his land, his water supply AND OURS. (New Yorkers)  But the gas companies are relentless, as are the congressmen who support them. Fox is one person...  The film indicates we should not sit back and lease to liars because THERE IS NO SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT, CLEAR WATER ACT OR CLEAN AIR ACT where these companies are concerned. They can do what they want. If you don't have drinkable water, you never had drinkable water. Prove it. Take them to court to the tune of millions....over years and meanwhile, they continue to drill, continue to pollute while your bank account is drained...they make money and no one stops them, least of all you, you worm. You drink the water and die? All the better for them. You speak out? You are an eco terrorist, a tree hugger...they malign you. Check out their PR campaigns. They are the heroes and Josh Fox who created the film is a)insane, b)an eco-terrorist c)a bum d)a liar e)a tree hugger f)a fanatic g)stopping progress (on and on). What he has done is tell the truth in this film. He stands in the way of their profits (they will still make money if they have great lawyers and people bring lawsuits...that takes years, meanwhile they take the gas and pollute...your land is devalued and they have to pay very little for it in the end ha, ha, ha, ha) All this has been worked out and Cheney has made millions over this as have others. Figure it out, dummy.

Gasland indicates why people are buying into water companies and why water is becoming a precious commodity which will be sold (it may be already) on the Chicago exchange. $$$$  Surely, these gas companies are probably buying into the water companies...that would be smart. By the way, the CO2 carbon emissions...are much less than the methane emissions caused by fracking and the gas industries processing...much, much worse, in fact. We should have stuck to coal. Our current president is clueless...but he is a part of the elites which transcend political party....in fact there are no political parties as you think they exist.

The film Gasland reveals the nature of the issue; it shows that the fate of our water supply in our hands. I have gone to the screening of Gasland II ahead of its release on HBO July 8th at 9:00 pm (ET/PT) Fracking is in 34 states and 32 countries. Where are they going to get the clean water from if they pollute the fresh water supply?

His presentation of flaming faucets is real showmanship.  Nevermind that it occurs in areas where there has never been fracking - why let facts get in the way of a good story?  His implication that the process of breaking rock deep in the earth makes animals sick is a master stroke of misdirection, but he pulls it off. What a genius! It reminds me of Penn and Teller's petition to ban Dihydrogen Monoxide.  Hundreds signed it.  Would you?

While watching the 'Gasland' trailer on youtube you'll find a video called 'truthland.'  I recommend it.  Deals with facts and boring stuff about fracking.

WRT 'tap water that bursts into flame:' There are at least three places in the USA that were known as 'burning springs' about 500 years before J.Fox 'discovered' burnable gas in water (to say the water 'burns' is incredibly misleading - it effervesces methane. For the agenda-burdened, that's a detail worth overlooking) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Springs

The argument that this gas is the result of fracking is further weakened by the distinction between biogenic and thermogenic gas. Biogenic gas arises from fairly recent decomp near the surface - such as coal beds - that migrates into the water table. Thermogenic gas comes from considerable depth and is older than biogenic gas. Carbon dating can distinguish between the two sources. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasland

Science is the search for the truth, often by a process of elimination and applying rules of logic. The scientific method is a process of observing, hypothesizing and attempting to disprove the hypothesis http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method . If you disprove it, start over. If you cannot disprove it, it might be true, so revise the tests and re-do. Then share the methodology and results with others to replicate. Then write a report, get a peer review, re-write and publish. Repeat as the feedback comes in. It's slow, methodical and not very titillating. It leads to the truth, but first it will make you mad.

In the 60's the advice was: If you don't have the training or patience to do science; Or have a point of view that is not supported by science; Write a book. People like Rachel Carson and Paul Ehrlich made broad claims and crazy predictions - none of which came true - but they made millions, so why let facts get in the way of a good story?

Today: Make a movie. Claim entertainment as education or worse: A documentary. The more spectacular the show the more 'educational' it will be. Bring on 'burning waters.'

Fox doesn't say if he knew about burning springs, but it's easy enough to Google. If he didn't know about it his research was not very thorough. If he did know it, his movie is a fraud. Ignoring natural sources as a competing hypothesis is dishonest, but hey, why let facts get in the way of a good story? It's good showmanship, but awful science.",1365206400,3,3031,4.9060665362035225

This movie has already been proven to have false claims. Do you research and read the FACTS about Fracking.

What HAS happened is accidental spills at the surface have gotten into the ground, no different than any other oil or natural gas accident has. Fracturing adds no new danger to the environment.

4249983,1,B0042EJD8A,"If you want to hear the latest Environmental Disaster Fantasy, this film is for you. If you want to see the truth about Fracking, and understand just how pathetic is Josh Fox's film ""Gasland"", you should see ""FrackNation"" by Phelim McAleer.

Fox refuses to answer specific questions about his film, such as why he neglected to point out that the ""burning water"" in Dimock PA was a natural occurrence that had been present since before the technology known as ""Fracking"" was first invented. Such as why the one family in Dimock who demonstrated the burning water is now completely unable to draw water out of their wells that looks anything like the water he showed in his film. Such as what the EPA scientists had to say about that family's wells and the water therein. Fox claims that fracking is akin to earthquakes, and suggests that fracking could cause one. Except McAleer interviews the nation's expert seismologist who states that Fox is completely wrong. The Texas mayor who makes claims about the damages caused by fracking is refuted by Texas' own environmental protection agency, second in size only to the Federal EPA, which demonstrates that the water in the mayor's district is cleaner than it ever has been.

One of the first sequences in Fox's film is of his attempts to ask questions of Halliburton; McAleer cleverly parallels that with his own similar, and similarly resulting, attempts to ask questions of Fox. Apparently, Fox is happy to express his fact-starved opinions in camera - where the audience cannot make him feel like an idiot - instead of live.

The ""Lease Agreement"" that Fox shows as evidence of something mailed to him to lease his property - was a redacted draft lease that had nothing to do with him, and was never sent to him.

The Russians, led by Vladimir Putin, are weighing in against fracking, because the Russian natural gas company Gazprom - partly owned by Vladimir Putin - is dead-set against letting Poland, Ukraine, and other European countries enjoy the benefits of fracking their own natural gas, and the benefits of not having to pay the Russians. Imagine that - a corporation funding environmental activists to prevent the corporation's profits from declining. Does Mr Fox point out this conflict of interests? Not in his film. Does Mr Fox point out that Russia has used its delivery of natural gas as a weapon by reducing shipments during the winter, in order to force Ukraine to toe Russia's political line? Not in his film.

Many of the chemicals used in the fracking process belong in a lab and in a lab only.

This movie, with its predictable hysteria, has attracted viewers like flies to a cow flop. One would think that with everyone saying they want alternatives to foreign oil; the uber-left celebrities/Hollywood/academia/media would love fracking. For those willing to see reality, the process takes place thousands of feet underground, separated from underground water sources by a mile or more of rock. In the last 60 years or so, a million wells or more have been fracked, with no documented instances of groundwater contamination. The risks are small and the rewards immense. Fracking lowered the price of natural gas so much that Americans heat our homes for less, and manufacturing that once left America has returned. For those concerned about global warming, burning gas instead of oil or coal reduces CO2 emissions. Furthermore, gas got into plumbing long before fracking came. That's why it's called ""natural gas"".  Some gets into well water. Environmental officials investigated the flames shown in ""Gasland"" and concluded that the pollution had nothing to do with fracking.

However, I am tired of these so called environmentalist with their flat out lies.  We have real environmental problems, yet people like Al Gore and Josh Fox can barely open their mouths without lies pouring out.  It saddens me that so many Americans believe anything that is in the newspaper, on TV, etc.  The media would lead you to believe the USA is pure evil.  United States has some of the strongest environmental laws in the world and yet people like Josh Fox would rather make the US energy dependent on other nations that have almost no regulations.  For these people it is all about money, fame and power - NOT the truth!!!

If you are concerned about the environment but uncertain of the truth I would encourage you the watch or read ""Cool it - The Skeptical Environmentalist's Guide To Global Warming"" by Bjorn Lomborg.  I do not agree with Bjorn on many of his opinion.  But he is not trying to manipulate the facts, he is attempting to present the facts in an unbiased manner.

Fracking is a real environmental concern that we need to take serious and look at the pros and cons, solutions and even compromises. But when documentaries like this are filled with lies it only hurts the discussion. We should be open minded to the potential of safer alternative energy.

I don't believe we should give big oil the freedom to do whatever they want. We should move forward with caution and concern for the real environmental issues, not make up fabrications that are nothing but bad propaganda. The real safety and environmental issues can only be won when people know the real issues, rather than surrounding the real issues with a bunch of half-truths and lies.

The sensationalizing of these serious issues only divide American citizens from being able to have productive discussions. And the people who are profiting off the sensationalism and lies are not being held accountable.  We need to educate ourselves and start holding big government, big business and big media accountable.

Gasland addressed water quality issues that may result from fracking and showed potential effects on humans, livestock and the environment.

It discussed how the gas and oil industry is exempt from the Safe Drinking Water Act.  Their practice of fracking to release gas and oil reserves from rock below the ground is not subjected to testing for effects upon drinking water.

When I want the truth regarding fracking I watch ""Gasland,"" an anti-fracking propaganda documentary financed by the government of Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez, who also opposes all U.S. drilling.

Come on people you can do better.

So, what is fact? What is fiction?

Scott Anderson is the Environmental Defense Fund's point man on gas exploration.  ""If we're talking about whether or not the fractures that have been created by `frack' jobs have been known to intersect drinking water aquifers, the fact is there have been no confirmed cases of that happening.""

In states like Pennsylvania, the gas rich Marcellus shale lies about 6,000 feet deep. That's where the hydraulic fracturing takes place. The deepest aquifers run to about 1,000 feet below ground. That's 5,000 feet of separation, much of it impermeable rock.

Ray Walker is the COO of Range Resources. Range has drilled some 350 wells in Pennsylvania.""Any way you look at it,"" Walker told Fox News, ""it is hard to imagine that anything we can do at 6,500 feet would ever approach the surface.""

Things don't always go according to plan. In Bainbridge, Ohio, in 2008, a drilling company failed to properly cement its well. Gas escaped into groundwater, contaminating several wells. Instances of improperly cementing wells are rare but have occurred.

There is nothing that is 100 percent perfect in life,"" says Walker. ""But we do know -- through years and years and millions of wells -- what it takes to prevent gas migration.""

The key is doing it right. Range Resources takes extra steps to insure its wells don't leak. And, says Walker, if it looks like the cementing job isn't taking correctly, they'll plug that well and drill another.

The shale gas boom holds the promise of inexpensive natural gas -- potentially for decades. It may even help fuel an economic recovery based on cheap energy. As more wells are drilled, they will come ever closer to homes and humans. So it will be incumbent on the industry to use the best practices to insure that gas and water don't mix.",1335657600,21,2086,4.881019830028329

 While the movie is filmed on a low budget the story is well presented and organized in a way that is easy to follow. Probably the most telling feature of this film is the fact that not one person from the oil & gas industry was willing to be interviewed to explain their side of the story. There is a scene in the film however of a Congressional hearing that sheds some light on why the industry declined to be interviewed.

Most seem to be among rural 'small government' Republican voting districts and states. Many Americans, likely some of those affected by fracking, seem to confuse government with industry because the fact is, the two often work hand in glove. Republican candidates for President today want to abolish the EPA. I am sure the frackers would applaud. It is Republican goal today that the new Consumer Protection Agency be demolished, they do this on orders from Wall Street. The film fails to identify the political Party of the Congressional members speaking in the film. It fails to look at the publicly available data on how much companies like Chesapeake Energy give to politicians for their re-election. It fails to ask the people damaged by fracking, how they believe the operations can be cleaned up if not by government regulation and inspection. When the narrator mentions that Pennsylvania cut its own EPA by over 350 jobs, which Party passed the legislation and who was the Governor are not mentioned. Corporations will continue to get by with this sort of abuse of the 'little people' until somebody stops them, and that is why government is there. It should not be 'for sale' and a rubber stamp for industry. If government does nothing to protect water resources and air, it is, to a large extent, the fault of voters, who do not demand action against the big moneyed interests. American voters are too often distracted and manipulated by the perpetual snake oil of hot button, never resolved issues, like gay marriage, 'family values', 'Real Americans', or regulation of women's fertility and choice. No real American would condone the often unregulated polluting of our air, water and land for the sake of feeding more profits to investors on Wall Street.

It's obvious that many underground aquifers and above ground watersheds will soon have or are already have undrinkable, unusable water. That goes for the area where I grew up which formerly had delicious water. On a visit home I should have realized something was wrong when I opened up my parents' refrigerator and saw a lot of bottled water on the shelf. It's not simply a matter of cleaning up contaminated sites left over from fracking. Due to the underground location of the contaminants they will be impossible! to clean up or remove. This is permanent! Any saving of energy will be more than counterbalanced by the enormous number of trucks, etc. necessary to supply people with useable and drinkable water after their wells are contaminated. In one of the extras on this disc a fracking company employee tells a local person that the fracking waste they are dumping is 'organic."" Benzene(which causes cancer and bone marrow failure) is an organic(carbon-based)chemical! So are cyanide, butane, methane, gasoline, etc.! Organic farming is farming without chemicals. Organic waste includes all kinds of carcinogens and poisons. Organic has more than one meaning!!!

4250111,5,B0042EJD8A,"""Gasland"" took a good run at being the most terrifying film of 2010. The reality that our modern technology, especially our energy technology, might be both unsustainable and deadly dangerous is indeed terrifying. The specific horror in ""Gasland"" is the possibility that hydraulic fracturing (fracking) as method of extracting natural gas from deep shale deposits may be responsible for perilous contamination of our water supplies, both of ground water and of streams. If so, that would truly be terrifying. The secondary horror depicted in ""Gasland"" is the ineffectiveness and/or collusion of our environmental regulatory agencies. Honestly, I can't verify or contradict the thesis that fracking is contaminated ground water; there are vociferous arguments on both sides of that question, leaving me, as a single voice, only the fall-back position of ""Better safe than sorry!"" However, the second thesis, that the fracking industry and the whole petrochemical mega-industry is disastrously under-regulated and irresponsible is gospel truth, beyond any reasonable doubt. We don't need to watch tap water being ignited to know that! We voters had some ""hope"" after the 2008 elections that the plutocratic tyranny of Halliburton and of Big Oil might be challenged by ""change""; so far we've had to cherish the ""hope"" despite the lack of ""change"".

""Gasland"" is a well-done home movie, a documentary made by a thirty-two year old guy with a hand-held camera and little education in film-making, or hydrology, or chemistry ... just a modest ordinary guy who has gotten worried about the environment, first of his own home turf in the Delaware Valley, then about the 'big back yard' America he travels across. Most of the footage is of interviews with ordinary Americans who are convinced that living near fracked gas wells has spoiled their health or their welfare. Filmmaker Josh Fox has learned his style, I think, from Michael Moore, though he doesn't yet have the financial resources for a production like Moore's most recent releases. Fox is the main persona of his own film, as Moore has usually been. To my mind, Fox is a more likable guy than Moore, and his likability makes him more convincing. But that might not be an asset; I don't want to be convinced by Fox's personality but rather by the information he conveys. The critics of this documentary rage that Fox is deliberately disingenuous, a charge also leveled at Moore. It seems to me that a more serious question is the inherent value of a documentary of this sort: Yes, it alerts large numbers of people to a potential calamity who might otherwise never get wind of the problem until too late. But No, it can't and doesn't present the whole story, with enough fact-based insight to guide people toward intelligent political decisions. This is a 'sensational' documentary film of 106 minutes. How many people who see it will invest even another 106 minutes in learning more about the issue? What I'm saying is that films are just too convincing! In fact, all the electronic media are just too convincing. Too dramatic! Democracy demands dispassionate discourse. As my favorite bumper-sticker reads"" ""Don't believe everything you think!""

Meanwhile, however, the energy industry really doesn't want you or me to think. That's obvious in the shenanigans that surrounded the environmental impact studies in preparation for the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, intended to carry crude 'oil' from the oil sands of Upper Canada all across our 'purple mountain majesty and fruited plains' to the refineries of the Texas Gulf Coast. This is NOT a project to be rushed! Vast corporate profits should NOT be the prime consideration here, and not even perhaps a consideration at all. The prime consideration should be the environmental/ecological impact, not locally but globally, not in our lifetimes but in the lifetimes of our children's children's children. Only the federal governments of the USA and Canada can properly instigate and oversee the rational, impartial discourse that should precede such an awesome project. Government regulation is our only protection against corporate indifference to our long term welfare and to our community values. I strongly urge President Barack Obama (for whom I voted enthusiastically) to keep some of his promises ... to stop the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline until the ""informed"" electorates of both the USA and Canada have had time and info to evaluate the consequences.",1319500800,8,4491,5.1931034482758625

4250113,1,B0042EJD8A,"Sadly, hypocrites like Al Gore and discredited groups like Riverkeeper and other environmental extremists and groups interested in consolidating power and control in DC have combined to produce hysteria like this (apparently independently produced) propaganda hatchet piece.

I'm all for keeping a wary eye on hydrofracing while the EPA conducts the study it has just begun to see how many, if any of the wildly exaggerated claims about tainted groundwater are true, but despite the hysteria on the left, it seems clear that hydrofracing has been used safely and effectively for decades with no convincing evidence emerging thus far that it has caused any significant harm.

As the Syracuse News reported last year, one of the first lawsuits in the nation to try to link the process to tainted groundwater is only now working its way through the courts, and that case claims the well's cement casing was defective and caused the problem, NOT the fracing itself. Potable aquifers are seldom deeper than 400 feet, while Shale formations are generally 5,000 feet or more below the earth, leaving almost a mile of solid rock between the two. Fracing fluid is more than 99.5 percent water and sand.

This NY Times article ""Oil and Gas Group Urges Oscar Judges to Steer Clear of 'Gasland'"" notes the strong controversy GasLand's questionable claims ignited and cites a pro-""Gasland"" rebuttal on the movie's website that claims ""evidence from regulators that the incidents COULD have been caused by drilling."" When the producer back peddles like that to defend the movie it raises my eyebrow. Until the EPA report or other solid evidence is gathered, the jury is still out on hydrofracing but leaning towards the view presented in the New American article ""Natural Gas -- the Coming Shale Gale.""

4250122,4,B0042EJD8A,"You've probably seen all the America's Natural Gas Alliance (ANGA) commercials of late, cheerfully consoling us that safe, clean, natural gas can be easily extracted from the ground while happy people live above, leading clean and healthier lives. The Oscar nominated GASLAND exposes the corporate lie of Natural Gas mining. From the start, where filmmaker Josh Fox receives a letter offering him something near $100,000 for the rights to drill gas from his mountain and creekside home in upstate Pennsylvania, to the end, where you watch New York City and State lawmakers fight to keep the watershed that provides millions of people from polluted drinking water, Fox explores how the Power Companies have managed to manipulate the system with the help of corrupt and gullible politicians the outright greed of the Bush/Cheney administration.

The central point of GASLAND is that, in 2005, the EPA made changes in environmental policy that are called ""The Halliburton Loophole."" That rule, snuck through by Cheney and his secretive energy board buddies (including then CEO of Enron, Ken Lay), exempted the Halliburton developed technology of hydraulic fracturing (now widely known as 'fracking') from regulations of the old Clean Water Act. The end result? Drilling for natural gas and the unbelievable amount of water and chemicals pumped into the ground required to create a well are all but completely exempt from regulations regarding the toxins that are needed to extract the gas.

Of course, all the companies involved say that they have nothing to do with hundreds of drinking wells across the country suddenly turning unsafe withing weeks of fracking. Or animals getting sick and losing their hair. Or the methane explosions of people's homes. Or the mass die-offs of animals and fish when chemicals leak into a stream. But Fox, who tried to contact companies and individuals in mining throughout the course of his investigation gets the same treatment as the folks in states across the country; either ""no comment"" or massive run-arounds. When a State Environmental Agency head in Pennsylvania tells Fox that he'd help Fox and other PA citizens of Dimok (the first town Fox visits), only to note when the meeting ends that the state slashed the office's budget and basically dismantled it.

But more revealing than anything else in the movie is the notorious flaming sink footage. When fracking shatters the aquifer of a peace of land, the gases seep into the water table. The chemicals used to pump the gas out also get into the water, and before you know it, you have flammable tapwater. It's not just that water that is getting mixed up, the air outside the well is loading up with toxins to the point where a rural area of Colorado where the population is approximately one person per square mile is as dangerous or more so than a bad day in Los Angeles. GASLAND serves as a warning and reminder; the same smiling advertisers trying to convince you that clean, accessible natural gas is not threat to you at all are the same folks that told you off-shore drilling was both safe and existing regulations guaranteed that even if the miniscule chance accident were to ever take place, they could stop it from becoming disastrous.

When you watch GASLAND, there will probably be a detractor ready to tell you that the film is just lefty propaganda. Just remember the last sentence of the previous paragraph, and make sure to remind your companion of two little words. Deepwater Horizon.",1313798400,2,3496,5.001718213058419

4250131,5,B0042EJD8A,"We left peak oil behind some years ago.  In a democratic state, where rationality and taking care for the next generations would prevail, we would radically chose for renewable energies.  But in the tyranny of corporations in which we live on a global scale, this is not even considered an option.  The power elite is very keen on the power they have and this power is related to their interests in fossil fuels.  So we'll continue exploring oil in the oceans, even if the ocean bottom in the Gulf of Mexico is cracked after the Deep Horizon explosion.  Although we were told the hole was stopped, from the cracks in the ocean bottom oil continues to spill into the water. And now that a huge amount of gas has been found in the soil of the US, well, this will be exploited too, even if you don't want to.  In 2005, the former CEO of Halliburton and then vice-president Cheney wrote the Energy Act.  The environmental laws were suspended in case of fractional gas drilling, a method which pushes 592 toxic products into the bottom, slowly releasing them into the ground water.  You think you still live in a ""free"" land?  Forget it.  If Halliburton wants to drill in your backyard, they will do it.  ""It's the law !"".  As a ""reward"", your ""drinking"" water will not only be intoxicated, it sometimes can be light on fire.  On top of that, you will fall ill, and the natural environment you knew will disappear.  A great number of deplorable situations are shown in the brilliant documentary.

If they need to have a gas pipe through your front garden, well they'll do it.  Don't expect much in return.  They'll give you 10 bucks.  ""It's the law !""

4250132,4,B0042EJD8A,"This is a Michael Moore kind of documentary, that is, before he became rich and famous. There's all the down home kind of people being featured and they're fighting, in this case, Big Gas, which means ExxonMobil, Halliburton and various and sundry others. I really don't know enough about the situation to pass judgment on the central accusation of the film, namely that hydraulic fracturing causes long-lasting environmental damage and the poisoning of water supplies. The fact that film maker Josh Fox shows several homes with water that can be set afire at the kitchen sink tap is however a bit disconcerting to say the least.

The problem seems to be that the methods used for fracturing employ a number of chemicals that are carcinogenic and, most significantly, there is no way to control the spread of those chemicals to areas around the wells including into the atmosphere. It's clear to me that there is not one executive at ExxonMobil or Halliburton that would want any hydraulic fracturing done anywhere near his home. Not in my backyard or across the street or even several football fields away is how just about everybody feels about this technique for getting oil and gas economically out rock/shale formations.

But there is a lot of money to be made and there is the argument that using such techniques can alleviate our dependence on foreign oil. The amount of natural gas and oil that can be fractured out of the rocks in the United States is enormous with some estimates claiming the supply is over a hundred years at current energy consumption levels. But Josh Fox's point is, at what cost? What personal and environmental cost?

What this film pinpoints is another example of how the economic interests of a few large corporations trump the lives of countless number of people and how the real environmental and human costs of production are dumped onto the public, especially the public that is our children and our grandchildren to come. The sad fact is that energy is relatively cheap today because the real cost of that energy is being charged to coming generations in a kind of Ponzi scheme. Since ExxonMobil, Halliburton, et al., have a shareholder horizon of the next quarter's earnings numbers, it is impossible for them and their execs to give a flying you-know-what about tomorrow's children or the world they will face. The future can take care of itself is the position that they are embracing. Meanwhile they personally are not polluted directly or inconvenienced or made cancerous since they live far, far away from the effects of hydraulic fracturing, and presumably with all the money they are making they can provide for their children and grandchildren to continue to live where they are (relatively) safe from the pollutants that are being expelled.

But I have to say that this is not a great documentary. Its budget is obviously quite a bit short of what some other film makers can afford, yet Josh Fox makes his point very well and does a great public service in calling to our attention the dangers associated with hydraulic fracturing. I notice that there is a lot of advertising on television paid for by e.g., ExxonMobil that is trying to make this kind of natural gas and oil production as sweet as Tupelo honey with smiley faces and fields of flowers and greenery in the background. It's nice to see a counter to that, even if the film's budget is probably a fraction of the cost of one ExxonMobil commercial.

It is gratifying to note that the positive reviews for this movie greatly outnumber the negative ones. It's clear that the industry's attack team has taken a pass on this one, hoping, I guess that it will go away from lack of interest. Take a look and see why this issue is not likely to go away; in fact I predict another more powerful film to come, which WILL be viciously attacked. Stay tuned.",1306627200,8,3856,4.775112443778111

4250145,5,B0042EJD8A,"Well made documentary about natural gas and its environmental risks.  While the natural gas companies and their PR firms like to preach, ""clean -safe- natural gas"", this film shows that in the USA- where any type of regulatory function by the EPA or state environmental agencies is considered the foe of market capitalism- regulatory oversight is often not there.  Think the BP oil spill in the gulf- there was little-if any- prior safety inspections by the inspectors- so when the back up protection failed...oh well.

Fracking- the way natural gas it extracted-is achieved by pumping huge amounts of toxic chemicals mixed with huge amounts of water-into drill holes.  This waste water can and often has leaked-(contains both chemicals and gas)- into the water table and polluted resident's water.  The toxic chemicals used are often undisclosed by the gas companies -so residents are in the dark as what's being leaked into the water supply. Natural gas has also leaked into the resident's home water supply enabling residents to literally ""ignite"" their tap water using matches or lighters. The film shows example after example of this and is just plain creepy.

The film shows the insidious practices -driven by profit--being employed by the gas companies- sometimes resulting in polluting resident's home water.  When this has happened, the gas companies are forced to install large water tanks to replace the home tap water that had become toxic.  Nice.  Residents often must sign gag orders not to speak about these situations as part of settlement issues.  With a continued lack of regulatory oversight, frakking is  environmentally precarious for all Americans.

WSJ, 7/25/12

""The Environmental Protection Agency has given the all-clear to drinking water in Dimock, Pa., a tiny town that received national attention after people there voiced concern about contamination from hydraulic fracturing. In a statement Wednesday, the EPA said it conducted sampling of drinking-water wells that served 64 homes and didn't find any contaminants that would require further action by the agency.....""

Review Update:

I wonder if Josh Fox will be reporting the naturally occurring presence of methane gas in Pennsylvania water supply wells, or the lack of contamination from hydraulic fracturing, as documented in a recent study at Penn State:

live dot psu dot edu backslash story backslash 55987

Note the following quotations from the study:

""A study of more than 200 drinking-water wells near Marcellus Shale natural-gas wells in 20 counties did not find statistically significant evidence of contamination from hydraulic fracturing -- a process used by gas drillers to release natural gas using a high-pressure mixture of water, sand and chemical additives.""

""Conducted from February 2010 to July 2011, the study found methane in about a quarter of the water wells before any drilling occurred, but the concentrations were generally below advisory levels for treatment, Swistock said. The presence of methane can be naturally occurring or related to drilling activity.""

Original review:

The scene with the flame coming out of the kitchen faucet can be attributed to shallow gas (stray gas) that has been a regular occurrence in the gas producing areas of Pennsylvania and surrounding states for many decades.

Stray gas can be encountered in shallow (< 300 feet deep) homeowner water supply wells that are not anywhere near deep hydraulic fracturing activities.  The occurrence of shallow stray gas can be easily verified by asking local water well drilling contractors that have to deal with this problem in a number of areas, particularly where shallow coal seams are present.  Or you could ask me.  I was working on a new shallow (220 feet deep) water supply well in Pennsylvania earlier this year with flammable natural gas bubbling out of the water in the well.  One of the water well drillers I was working with said he has had to deal with this problem for many years (before the Marcellus Shale was developed).

The filmmaker obviously needed to do more research prior to releasing this movie. The presence of shallow, naturally occurring gas and oil is a known fact in Pennsylvania.  Now many people who are not familiar with the stray gas problem (which has NOTHING to do with hydraulic fracturing) are being mislead and opposing this technology for bogus reasons.",1302739200,48,2732,5.186788154897494

One Man's Mystery Leads to a Backlash Against Natural Gas Drilling (Kindle Single)</a>:

While watching CNN and the devastation of Japan, two commercials came up sporting the tag of ""The People of America's Oil and Natural Gas Industry.""  Further research (because I wanted to look up the website), led to Wiki indicating these ads were actually from the American Petroleum Institute.

They spotted, that day - how new technology allows the Natural Gas Drilling to come from the same well as oil drilling (Encana is very much a part of API), however - how many of these drills do we actually see?  The ad says it lessons the impact on the environment, so we have less polluted water?  The next ad shows how they (API) boosts the economy through 9.2 million jobs.  Both these ads occur to me to be on the defensive.  They have changed from 2 years ago - when they presented themselves as the solution to all our problems (while they had folks repeating that slogan ""drill baby drill"")

***********************************

I have HBO, so I watched this in HD a few times.  Even though I live in a city area, the callousness and greed with which these companies operate will anger you.  You just can't help but relate and be saddened by the current state of affairs.

Yes, this movie is bound to set off some political back lash and controversy.  But I believe that the release via DVD AND the free Kindle Short by ProPublica is getting the news out there. Congratulations on getting the Nomination by the Academy, and the Academy not backing down due to pressure from a multi-billion dollar industry lobby.

I hope the expansion with Hydrofracking doesn't continue.  Or at the very least - those workers, execs that refused to drink the tainted water, actually have a pitcher full.  Only by getting the word out there, can pressure remain on Congress to shore up the Safe Clean Drinking Water act again, and re institute the EPA into testing and monitoring.

Unfortunately, with Congress in the state its in - funding is just not being provided, and that money from the Oil industry is needed.  But the country risks a 25% loss of usable land and water, for the sake of greed and money. Please, someone, tell us that you are listening.

While they do seem to be focused on not leaving debt to our children's children, how about leaving them with land they can live on, and water they can drink?  We may have to switch from importing Oil to importing Water, and that will cost a HECK of a lot more than importing oil (think about it).

4250164,5,B0042EJD8A,"We need more people like Josh Fox because we can no longer trust our state and federal officials to protect us from the corporations that often elect them into office. As a resident of the state of Louisiana I am well acquainted with the machinations of big oil.  People no longer even bother to question what is safe here. It is understood that too many people in this state either work for the oil companies or depend on the seafood industry. We were ""bought out"" long ago and no longer complain, even though everything his film says about our state is true.

It isn't safe for the local media to spend too much time talking about the open oil field waste pits or gas injection wells.  They have learned that ""bad press,"" isn't in the best interest of their advertisers. Oil feeds too many families here and even if that family is being poisoned by the waste seeping into water tables and over-flowing from pits during our frequent floods, who wants to learn that they may be causing cancer with an income they can't do without? Most people here in the oil and fishing industries are under educated and know little else. It is certainly easier to pretend that no one knows why cancer strikes so many people here. We even call one part of the state along the river  ""cancer alley"".  Food is an important part of Josh's story and he shows us that you can't simply turn your back on what goes on in Colorado or Wyoming were the beef cattle (soon to grace your dinner table) are ingesting tainted water with the governments blessing.

As Josh illustrates in his film these companies pick on those who cannot easily move or band together to fight back. Poor to middle income people in rural areas are easy prey. Here we have a name for that, ""environmental racism"". We call it that because many of the rural folks now living in the shadow of wells and chemical plants are poor, black, elderly or all three. They can't afford to run and their lives and properties are cheap. Incidently, a frequent target of big oil/chemical in Louisiana is the Tulane Environmental/Poverty Law Clinic. If your case isn't worth much it is very hard to find a lawyer willing to take it and endure the endless appeals that a billion dollar industry can mount against you. The industry went to our state legislature and authored a bill asking that the law clinic be banned from representing clients asking for monetary damages. They said it was ""unfair"" because a succession of law students could keep them in court forever! Apparently it is not unfair for them to use their billions to keep a landholder in court until they die from chemical poisoning.

4250169,5,B0042EJD8A,"In 2009, Josh Fox was approached by a natural gas-drilling company to purchase the rights to drill under his eastern Pennsylvania property for natural gas.  Fox was offered $100,000 for his gas rights, but he was concerned about rumors of problems with natural gas drilling in other communities.  Armed with his suspicions, a wry sense of humor and a video camera, he set out to investigate.

Pockets of natural gas have been safely drilled in America for decades.  But rising demand for natural gas has drillers looking to less easily-recoverable sources.  A new process called ""hydraulic fracturing"" is being used by companies like Cabot Oil and Gas and Chesapeake Energy to extract natural gas that is bound up in the rock of a geologic formation called the Marcellus Shale, which stretches from New York and Pennsylvania through West Virginia, Ohio and into eastern Kentucky and Tennessee.

Hydraulic fracturing - also known as ""fracking"" - injects enormous quantities of water and a witches brew of toxic chemicals including benzene and glycol ethers, under extremely high pressure to break up the underground shale formation, releasing the natural gas from the rock.  The gas is then pumped to the surface where it is processed, compressed, and then piped away.  Some of the water and toxic chemicals used to fracture the shale are pumped back to the surface, and stored in open pits.  Thanks to the ""Halliburton Loophole"" passed in 2005 during the Bush-Cheney administration, natural gas drilling is exempt from the Safe Drinking Water Act.

In ""Gasland,"" filmmaker Fox travels to Pennsylvania, Colorado, Wyoming, Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas to visit communities that have been greatly impacted by natural gas exploration, and he documents the problems there.  A scarcity of clean water is one of the greatest problems in arid western states, so pumping millions of gallons of water underground is a huge concern.  Water contamination is another.

Fox visits several people who have problems with contamination of their well water, allegedly due to the fracking.  Hair loss in pets, headaches, brain lesions are reported.  In Dimock, Pennsylvania one resident said ""Our water was perfectly fine, and then right after they started drilling, propane and stuff like that ...""

In one of the most startling moments I have ever seen in a documentary film, Fox visits the home of a Weld County, Colorado resident named Mike Markham who claims that he can light the water coming from his kitchen faucet on fire, because the fracking near his home has allowed the underground natural gas to infiltrate his well water supply.

Markham holds a butane lighter up to the faucet, then slowly turns on the water.  The flame flickers, but nothing happens.  ""Just give it a second here,"" he says.  Seconds roll by slowly, and still ... nothing.  It looks like a big anti-climax, then suddenly WHOOM!!  The kitchen sink explodes into a ball of fire.  Markham staggers back, laughing and brushing his forearms.  ""I smell hair!"" he says.

In one of the film's most touching moments, Fox visits Wyoming cattle rancher John Fenton.  Fenton, the son of ""old-time cowboys"" is eloquent and evokes all the ideals of the American West.  His property is surrounded by 24 gas wells.  Vapors from the condensate tanks are sometimes so bad that they surround his house in a brown cloud.  His wife Kathy suffers from headaches and dizziness, and a loss of smell.  Fenton shakes his head as he looks at his herd of cattle.  He calls his water ""the damnedest-smelling stuff, comes out different colors all the time ... I don't know how they (the cattle) even drink it.

""We want to raise the best, most natural clean product we can raise ... but if you're breathing in dirty air and drinking water that could be tainted, what's coming out in these cows?  You gotta be sure that what you're putting in `em is as pure as it can be.  Cute as they are, in a year or two they're going to be on someone's dinner plate.

""We need to speak in a unified voice, and stand up to these a******.""

GASLAND is generally excellent filmmaking.  I have only one area of concern: I wish Mr. Fox had spent a little time offering an alternative to the harmful natural gas drilling discussed in his film.  I say this because all the stories of people harmed by the drilling were overwhelmingly depressing, so it would have been nice to hear some alternatives.

Fracking, like some of the other methods of energy production and mining, is an environmentally unsound and dangerous practice that will likely cause long-term environmental damage as well as the immediate consequences shown in the movie. The movie shows a number of instances where groundwater, surface water, soil and air have been contaminated following fracking and where people and animals have been sickened and died as a result. It doesn't take a genius to figure out it's not a good idea to pump millions of gallons of water containing numerous toxic and harmful chemicals into the ground, yet this is occurring at tens of thousands of gas wells around the United States and in other countries. This movie has received lots of criticism from the gas industry and some regulatory agencies, so it appears to have struck a raw nerve with them. That's usually a good indication that there is even more ""dirt"" the industry would like to keep secret. It's interesting to note that the gas industry and most of the regulatory agencies chose not to participate in the movie by granting interviews.

If you are not directly affected by fracking, this is still a must see movie. The energy we are using must be produced, and that production is harming others, even if you don't think you are being harmed directly.

It should be a requirement to see this film BEFORE anyone signs a oil or gas lease.  We received a lot of information about the good things that oil leases can do for the land owners and the money it brings to the community. The film Gasland gives you the other side.  Just think about the ""what ifs"".  Like ""what if"" something happened to the water so we could not water our 500,000 Christmas trees.  What if the beautiful Clam River had toxic chemicals from drilling in it so we would not dare swim in it.  What if there was not the quality of wild life on our plantation.  Does the ""what if"" of everyone in the family becomming a millionaire balance out the possible distruction?",1294963200,6,798,4.308724832214765
4250183,1,B0042EJD8A,"This is a movie with flaming faucets and little science.
Gasland features wells from three Weld County landowners, Mike
Markham, Renee McClure, and Aimee Ellsworth. A thorough investigation by the
Colorado Department of Natural Resources showed that the Markham and McClure
wells had biogenic gas which had nothing to do with oil and gas drilling.  There
is biogenic gas everywhere in the air and in the earth. Cows belch it; swamps
emit it; and it forms all over in the earth's crust. If your water well hits some, and
there is very much, you have to start over.
 There is also thermogenic gas which comes from all forms of oil and gas
drilling. Ms Ellsworth's well had some of both kinds, and she reached a
financial settlement with the driller. The film also deals with a wetland owned
by a Lisa Bracken.  Nine different tests from 2004 to 2010 determined that all
of the Bracken property gas is biogenic unrelated to drilling. There were other
instances in the film of seepage from oil and gas activity resulting in
penalties assessed against the operators, but affected homeowners may not have been properly compensated.
There was more in the film which the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) found to be baseless.
COGCC Director, Dave Neslin, offered to speak with Gasland's producer, Josh Fox,
on camera during the filming of the movie with COGCC technical information. The
offer was declined by Mr. Fox.
In 2010, the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission appointed a 3 person technical team to review Pennsylvania's regulation of gas drilling.
The team included WILMA SUBRA who appears in this film. They found that Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental Protection was doing an effective job.
This is a film with good intentions, but it is one for the heart, not the head.",1294790400,44,1807,4.9375
4250184,5,B0042EJD8A,"My family and I recently bought this and viewed it. We used to live in Michigan which, if you have seen the oil & gas map in this documentary you know is one of the (maybe the ONLY)all red states. During the time we lived there, there was a tremendous upsurge in already existing natural gas drilling and the companies came around to sub-divisions, farmers, every property owner,offering to buy mineral rights. Everybody in our sub-division except us sold their mineral rights for $100. Pretty cheap for a soul, wouldn't you say? Since everybody else did it, it wouldn't have mattered that we didn't because the drills would have been all over our backyards, too; but we never did and would never, ever do that. We would also never buy property that did not come with the mineral rights. Soon after, new drilling began in the area - not in our immediate neighborhood yet but in the area - and people could then see what Hell they had bought for their $100. Michigan now shows as ""all red"" on the map, meaning there are natural gas wells and pipeline and storage tanks everywhere there. There were reports of ""sour gas"" (if I recall the terminology correctly) water and gas wells in western Michigan, water wells contaminated, tap water set on fire, etc. When BP and Halliburton recently displaced the Gulf of Mexico waters with oil (i.e. ""spill""), it was also disclosed that BP has plans to drill for natural gas under Lake Michigan. LAKE MICHIGAN, people, one of the most beautiful features on the planet and one of Nature's most magnificent marvels, the Great Lakes, and the planet's largest repository of fresh water!
Is there nothing these villains won't destroy? And when all the fresh water is either contaminated (BP, Massey Coal, natural gas companies) or privatized and sold in plastic bottles (Nestle), will people drink oil? America and the world better wake up fast because it's all being destroyed for the outrageous (and short-sighted) profit of the few and/or the stupid. Michigan has also permitted the ""mining"" of its once pristine, marvelous waters by Nestle and sold in plastic bottles as ""Ice Mountain"". Some brave citizens tried to fight it but ungodly amounts of water are still being removed and sold off. We humans are so blessed to live on this wonderful planet and so unimaginably stupid as we foul it and ruin it. Watch ""Gasland"", folks! I wish Michael Moore and Josh Fox would team up to do a ""gasland"" specifically about Michigan. Also watch ""Flow"" about what is being done to our water. Also fight against mountaintop removal mining in Appalachia where the Appalachian mountains are being destroyed as well as the magnificent mountain waters and ecology of the region. ""Clean coal"" and ""clean natural gas"" - what B.S.  And people, be careful about mineral rights; you may find a natural gas well in your own front or back yard. Do you know that there are people in Michigan who sold their rights in exchange for ""free"" natural gas for life? Free to them, but expensive as Hell for the planet!

Buy the ""Gasland"" DVD. Buy copies for your friends and family. Buy a copy for your local library. Do the same for ""Flow"" and for the books and DVDs about mountaintop removal!

""Gasland"" is director Josh Fox's tour de force on the natural gas drilling industry's environmental quiet crisis.  A winner of the Special Jury Award for Documentaries at Sundance, Gasland is fast becoming the grassroots cinema phenomenon of the decade!

It is considered by many eco-activists around the U.S. to be one of the best eco-documentaries ever made; a must-see both for the startling content and for the innovative, personal style of Fox's film-making.

The natural gas drilling industry today uses a new technology called hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, that causes groundwater pollution and other environmental damage.  From unregulated air pollution to poisoned wells to ear-splitting round-the-clock noise to muddied streams to wildlife and fish kills, large swaths of the United States are getting fracked and it isn't pretty.

 In 2010, Gasland, was distributed by New Video Group, HBO and International WOW Company. The documentary was produced by Trish Adlesic, Molly Gandour, David Roma and Josh Fox. Josh Fox also directed, wrote and narrated the documentary. It is 104 minutes long. The documentary follows Josh Foxs journey to see if he should allow hydraulic fracking on his familys land.
 A natural gas company sent a letter to Josh Fox stating that they would pay him $100,000 to use his familys land, located in Milanville, Pennsylvania. They wanted to do horizontal drilling, also known as hydraulic fracking, on Foxs land. He wanted know how communities were being affected by fracking. So, he set out across the country making his documentary. He went to Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and Texas. While here he interviewed citizens and spent time in their homes and on their lands. He was told many stories about natural gas drilling. Some of the citizens he spoke to have experienced chronic health problems. They were able to trace their health problems back to the contamination of their water and air from the drilling being done on their land. Fox went to scientists, politicians and gas industry executives. He went congress to discuss the bills being considered about fracking. Fox found his answer and discovered a toxic world that many did not even know existed.
 This whole documentary started from a personal question? I liked that it started this way, because it made Fox, relatable. A lot of documentaries have a clear idea and purpose, but they are not always relatable. I believe that most people can relate to Josh Foxs position. He wanted to protect his familys land and ultimately his family. He did not want to blindly commit to a deal. Yes, the deal looked good on paper, but was it right. Because of Foxs research he knew that taking the money and selling his land was the wrong option. He discovered that fracking is dangerous and should not be done.
 I would recommend this documentary to mature adults interested in fracking. I liked that the documentary started off with Josh Fox explaining how this was personal for him. It should he had a purpose and it made him more relatable. Also, I liked that he went to everyday people that sold their land to gas companies. This made the documentary real for me, it showed that it could be anyone that is affected by fracking. Finally, I liked how he went to scientists, politicians and gas company executives to back up this argument. This brought the facts and the other side of the fracking argument.",1483315200,,2826,4.782786885245901
