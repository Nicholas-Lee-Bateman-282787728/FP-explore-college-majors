Durbin is a terrific young actor and should have been named  one of the headliners of this film.  The film industry should take note of the special,  unique, potential and talent of Joseph D. Durbin.  Hats off to Joseph D. Durbin for his role in this film, A+, 5 star performance.",1210032000,,390,4.661764705882353
3049629,5,B0010PI72M,"congratulations!

Another remarkable piece of work by the multi-talented Harry and his crew.  ""All Hallows' Eve"" is a facinating film; it is colorful and suspenceful, the dialogue awesome and the acting performances impressive.  This movie will hold your attention through to the end.

We urge anyone who has not seen ""All Hallows' Eve"" to not rely on the bland, critical evaluations of it.

The future of the horror movie industry may be in the hands of young Mr. Sparks and his team keeping it alive.  This movie is worth adding to any serious collection of horror films.  Don't wait, buy it, watch it again and again.

Yes it may have been low budgeted film, however, it was well done. I love how all the stories interwine with one another.

3049653,2,B0010PI72M,"I purchased this DVD in large part due to the theme description/name backed by the surprising number of high-star reviews, so I went into this with happy expectations. Unfortunately, the film was, overall, a let down.

The acting was, respectfully, not bad but about the equivalent of a lower-level college course or community theater troupe; they do what they have to do - sometimes stiffly, sometimes believably - but also somewhat cliched and don't really put forth a believability factour. It leaves you feeling, as noted, like you're watching some relatively rookie'ish performance in many cases. That said, it wasn't that which really brought down the film for me - one realizes you're not watching for Oscar-level performances here and the acting isn't sub-par enough to really detract that much enjoyment.

What really left me wishing I could get a refund were the stories. I love Hallowe'en and I love anthologies - this sounded like a perfect film. Unfortunately, Hallowe'en is relatively non-existant for the film except as a ""time of year"" framing sequence (I should note the introduction talking about Hallowe'en though was exceptional - if the rest of the film had gone for the same atmosphere it would have been much better). People at a Hallowe'en party decide to tell scary stories - that's about it for Hallowe'en's appearance. The three stories - basically three girls slamming competitors and their boyfriends - have nothing to do with the season or the ambience one expects in a tale called ""All Hallows Eve"".

The first story was easily the weakest and should, perhaps, have been saved for the middle as it was such a turn-off it made it difficult to enjoy any of the rest of the film. It's about a man who neglects his one-year anniverary to go out hunting and ends up chased by a sniper. There were just some truly...absurd...actions in it (SPOILER: If you're being chased through the woods by a gun-toting ""sniper"" (I think the ""sniper"" was maybe just trying to scare and not actually kill, though that's rather unclear to me) do you stop and doze off when the killer has barely even moved away from your rather open hiding spot?). The acting was also the most wooden in this section.

The second story was better and, as it was meant (at least I guess based on the constant references) as a nod to Hitchcock, delivers a nice little twist you would expect from the great ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" series. Acting was better than the first story and the camera work was better. Still some slightly illogical bits - pay attention to the length between mention of the police outside and their actual arrival - but nothing too distracting. The big problem, like most of the film, is that the story isn't all that scary - just meant to creep out a boyfriend and a flirtatious competitor at the framing party - and, most importantly, isn't a Hallowe'en tale. That may not seem like a big deal but, well, the movie is presented as a Hallowe'en film.

The third story is a relatively straight-forward vampire tale. Decent enough for the budget/troupe and would have been fine except, again, doesn't really fit the theme presented by the name/description. I will give them credit for trying to make their own little mythology with this (part of the reason for the second star).

Really, this would have worked a lot better if it wasn't presented so much as a Hallowe'en anthology. Call it something else, downplay the Hallowe'en party, etc. and, perhaps, it wouldn't have been such a disappointment. Still not a fantastic film - and really not worth $20 (sorry) - but the misleading aspect really drags down things.",1286409600,,3632,4.821829855537721
3049654,3,B0010PI72M,"I'm not a fan of the genre, but I enjoyed watching the flick.  The concept was good and there were some moments that were truly well-done -- the vampire's erotic bed scene was mesmerizing.  Overall, however, the film's indie origins were too evident.  Some of the visual segues were too abrupt and distracting.  I kept wondering: ""How did we get from there to here?""  ""How did it change from night to day in minutes?"" etc.  Also some of the background details need to be watched carefully.  Indie films are made on a hairline budget, but it doesn't cost anything or take any time to remove distracting items from the background, the room, etc., or to change the camer angle to avoid getting them in the frame.  Example:  The real estate box on the door of the vampire's house.  Still, it was fun to watch as long as it wasn't taken too seriously.  The people making it were obviously having fun.  So should the viewer.",1223683200,3,918,4.530487804878049
3049655,3,B0010PI72M,"I've read all of the rave reviews as well as the nasty ones regarding this independent horror flick, but my comments attempt to find a middle ground.  All Hallow's Eve is indeed made on a shoestring budget, but accomplishes a lot with what it has.  The action is initially set at an apartment where a group of costumed young friends have gathered on Halloween for a party.  They proceed to tell spooky stories, which take place as three small movies within the movie and cast members playing double parts.  The stories are basically enactments of urban legends related to an escaped convict, a jealous lover and a local vampiress. All of the stories are told by females in the group, and in each, the boyfriend/husband is a lunkhead. Actual rivalries among the young women are inserted in the stories as well, taking the form of frequently naked seductresses and their aggressive avengers.

Some aspects of the film are surprisingly effective: the energetic cast, the moody theme music, and the stories themselves, which are often suspenseful. However, other aspects are pretty lame, particularly in the middle story, where the acting, staging and special effects (is that chocolate syrup they're trying to pass off as blood?) don't rise to the occasion.

Those weighing whether to check this film out might go the unbox route, as I did; you get to watch the movie without being saddled with a disk you don't want.",1218931200,8,1414,4.870833333333334

The acting was, respectfully, not bad but about the equivalent of a lower-level college course or community theater troupe; they do what they have to do - sometimes stiffly, sometimes believably - but also somewhat cliched and don't really put forth a believability factour. It leaves you feeling, as noted, like you're watching some relatively rookie'ish performance in many cases. That said, it wasn't that which really brought down the film for me - one realizes you're not watching for Oscar-level performances here and the acting isn't sub-par enough to really detract that much enjoyment.

What really left me wishing I could get a refund were the stories. I love Hallowe'en and I love anthologies - this sounded like a perfect film. Unfortunately, Hallowe'en is relatively non-existant for the film except as a ""time of year"" framing sequence (I should note the introduction talking about Hallowe'en though was exceptional - if the rest of the film had gone for the same atmosphere it would have been much better). People at a Hallowe'en party decide to tell scary stories - that's about it for Hallowe'en's appearance. The three stories - basically three girls slamming competitors and their boyfriends - have nothing to do with the season or the ambience one expects in a tale called ""All Hallows Eve"".

The first story was easily the weakest and should, perhaps, have been saved for the middle as it was such a turn-off it made it difficult to enjoy any of the rest of the film. It's about a man who neglects his one-year anniverary to go out hunting and ends up chased by a sniper. There were just some truly...absurd...actions in it (SPOILER: If you're being chased through the woods by a gun-toting ""sniper"" (I think the ""sniper"" was maybe just trying to scare and not actually kill, though that's rather unclear to me) do you stop and doze off when the killer has barely even moved away from your rather open hiding spot?). The acting was also the most wooden in this section.

The second story was better and, as it was meant (at least I guess based on the constant references) as a nod to Hitchcock, delivers a nice little twist you would expect from the great ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" series. Acting was better than the first story and the camera work was better. Still some slightly illogical bits - pay attention to the length between mention of the police outside and their actual arrival - but nothing too distracting. The big problem, like most of the film, is that the story isn't all that scary - just meant to creep out a boyfriend and a flirtatious competitor at the framing party - and, most importantly, isn't a Hallowe'en tale. That may not seem like a big deal but, well, the movie is presented as a Hallowe'en film.

The third story is a relatively straight-forward vampire tale. Decent enough for the budget/troupe and would have been fine except, again, doesn't really fit the theme presented by the name/description. I will give them credit for trying to make their own little mythology with this (part of the reason for the second star).

Really, this would have worked a lot better if it wasn't presented so much as a Hallowe'en anthology. Call it something else, downplay the Hallowe'en party, etc. and, perhaps, it wouldn't have been such a disappointment. Still not a fantastic film - and really not worth $20 (sorry) - but the misleading aspect really drags down things.",1286409600,,3632,4.821829855537721
3284151,3,B0010PI72M,"I'm not a fan of the genre, but I enjoyed watching the flick.  The concept was good and there were some moments that were truly well-done -- the vampire's erotic bed scene was mesmerizing.  Overall, however, the film's indie origins were too evident.  Some of the visual segues were too abrupt and distracting.  I kept wondering: ""How did we get from there to here?""  ""How did it change from night to day in minutes?"" etc.  Also some of the background details need to be watched carefully.  Indie films are made on a hairline budget, but it doesn't cost anything or take any time to remove distracting items from the background, the room, etc., or to change the camer angle to avoid getting them in the frame.  Example:  The real estate box on the door of the vampire's house.  Still, it was fun to watch as long as it wasn't taken too seriously.  The people making it were obviously having fun.  So should the viewer.",1223683200,3,918,4.530487804878049
3284152,3,B0010PI72M,"I've read all of the rave reviews as well as the nasty ones regarding this independent horror flick, but my comments attempt to find a middle ground.  All Hallow's Eve is indeed made on a shoestring budget, but accomplishes a lot with what it has.  The action is initially set at an apartment where a group of costumed young friends have gathered on Halloween for a party.  They proceed to tell spooky stories, which take place as three small movies within the movie and cast members playing double parts.  The stories are basically enactments of urban legends related to an escaped convict, a jealous lover and a local vampiress. All of the stories are told by females in the group, and in each, the boyfriend/husband is a lunkhead. Actual rivalries among the young women are inserted in the stories as well, taking the form of frequently naked seductresses and their aggressive avengers.

Some aspects of the film are surprisingly effective: the energetic cast, the moody theme music, and the stories themselves, which are often suspenseful. However, other aspects are pretty lame, particularly in the middle story, where the acting, staging and special effects (is that chocolate syrup they're trying to pass off as blood?) don't rise to the occasion.

Those weighing whether to check this film out might go the unbox route, as I did; you get to watch the movie without being saddled with a disk you don't want.",1218931200,8,1414,4.870833333333334
