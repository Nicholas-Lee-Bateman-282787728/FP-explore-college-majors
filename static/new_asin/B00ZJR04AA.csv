7283082,5,B00ZJR04AA,"A delightful romp through the late, great Jazz funk meister Grover Washington's superbly crafted oeuvre, complete with an A list ensemble of studio musicians such as Richard Tee on keyboards, Ralph MacDonald on percussion, Eric Gale on guitar, Paul Griffin on synthesizer, Anthony Jackson on electric bass,and Steve Gadd on drums. Closer to a Paul Simon record than anything as in the tradition as Phil Woods or anywhere near incendiary as late John Coltrane, nonetheless Washington brings a personal voice to his music, and one can clearly see why Sonny Rollins tapped him for one of his pianoless quartets before Grover went home. There is a kind of integrity here that is completely absent from subsequent pretenders to the throne such as lightweight Kenny G or any of the other somnambulant purveyors of smooth Jazz.",1449360000,,820,5.0814814814814815

7283086,4,B00ZJR04AA,"A joy to witness the seminal artist perform. I was able to see him live @ Red Rocks Amphitheater in Morrison, Co. GW Jr. Live at the Village Vanguard gives a wonderful taste of genius musicianship with quality sound.  Video Quality is lacking: yet it is true to the era in which it was made.  It probably deserves 5 Stars. I thoroughly enjoyed the concert.",1445472000,,356,4.461538461538462

7283089,5,B00ZJR04AA,"This is the late, great Grammy-winning master saxophonist Grover Washington Jr. recorded live. For those who may be buying or renting this, this was recorded at the Schubert Theater in Philadelphia, Pa in 1981, not at the Village Vanguard, as the Amazon lead banner is mis-labeled ""at the Village Vanguard"". On this performance, Grover is accompanied by some notable jazz men, including Richard Tee on keyboards, Ralph MacDonald on percussion, longtime stablemate Eric Gale on guitar, and Steve Gadd on drums, as well as the very versatile Paul Griffin on synthesizer and Anthony Jackson on electric bass, who does a terrific job. But this is Grover's show except for a few solos by others along the way. Grover Washington Jr. is one of the most influential saxophonists in jazz history, not compared to the likes of John Coltrane and Sonny Rollins, but with his own flotilla of ""smooth jazz"" tenor and soprano saxophonists who have eagerly followed in his footsteps, including the likes of Kenny G and George Howard who then founded their own styles, and late arrivals like Boney James and Euge Groove, with new ones continuing to emerge to this day in 2015.

The performance begins with the lead track from his hit album ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Winelight/dp/B002FVRTVU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Winelight</a>"" where Washington is revealed as a master of 'the vamp', spinning off of pedal points with endless inventive improvisations, as he does throughout the show. And then they perform ""Let It Flow"" dedicated to NBA star ""Dr J"" Julius Erving with brief NBA basketball footage included. This takes us to the 18 minute point on just 2 songs. ""Number 5"" (or ""On The Dark Side"") turns out to be as sensually and hopefully beautiful as it is mesmerizing. Longtime associate Eric Gale adds a haunting, bluesy solo in his inimitable guitar style to Grover's own solo of rising intensity on this song and the following song that is dedicated to his wife: ""Make Me A Memory"" (aka ""Sad Samba""). Special guest Zack Sanders is the vocalist on ""Just The Two Of Us"" which was a huge hit by Grover and Hall of Fame singer/songwriter Bill Withers, with Sanders adding his own stylings to this classic, followed by Paul Griffin on synth imitating a steel drum on his solo. The session ends with another big hit whose first notes get a rousing audience ovation, ""Mister Magic"", which is also associated with vocalist Roberta Flack, Grover switches to tenor for an emotional solo and another soulful Gale guitar solo with a great ""Big Boss Man"" quote, and two surprises. One hour of excellence with Grover Washington and his sextet with guest vocalist. Highly Recommended. Five GROOVING Stars! (Produced by Bruce Buschel and Gary Delfinger; Directed by Donny Osmond. Not Rated, Color, Acceptable video and very good sound. 6 tracks, Time-1:00:03. Backstage and NBA footage interspersed.)",1436227200,11,2921,5.175475687103594

The montage of ""Dr. J"" photos in the background for ""Let It Flow"" was worth the price alone.

7283129,3,B00ZJR04AA,"I was looking forward to receiving the DVD of Grover Washington Jr. In Concert. Grover is the godfather of smooth jazz before it was called smooth jazz. He is a consummate musician on saxophone. It is a shame that for whatever the reason the producer of this video did not make the effort to represent Grover in as high a quality of professionalism as he performs. The problem is that the video is of poor quality and astonishingly the audio and visual is slightly out of sync (just enough to be noticed). The only redeeming value is that it is Grover Washington Jr. performing with great musicians in support. If you can ignore the imperfections of the recording and picture quality it is worth having in your collection. After all, we don't have Grover anymore to perform in any more videos. He is certainly missed and whatever I can get my hands on to uphold his memory I will purchase it. The price is reasonable also.",1451779200,4,922,4.5602409638554215

8720406,1,B00ZJR04AA,"Grover is great on this.  However . .
1.  NOT at the Village Vanguard.  This concert is in Philly.
2.  Video/audio synch is horrible.  If I listen to it without watching the picture it is OK but when everything on screen is about a half to a whole beat off from the audio it gets disturbing.
3.  Video quality is really lacking.

Everyone on the session plays great but the mentioned problems really wreck it for me and the false advertising about the Village Vanguard is rotten.",1530921600,,479,4.436781609195402
