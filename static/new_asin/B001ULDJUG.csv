3802998,5,B001ULDJUG,"Showed this video to my leadership in race relations classes in Wisconsin. Middle school through high school students were riveted during the tense moments of the sit-ins,  They commented that they never receive this view of American history in their regular history curriculum.  The film inspired them to want to discuss how watching the film impacted them and to learn more.",1369699200,7,376,5.147540983606557

3803003,5,B001ULDJUG,"Great documentary.  I knew the basic story of the sit-ins from history classes, but this is the first time I've heard the full story from the people who lived it.  These four young men (who were just teenagers at the time) are brave, brave heroes and proof of everything we've been told:  ordinary people can do extraordinary things; one small spark can light a great fire; be the change you wish to see in the world; surround yourself with good, brave people and amazing things will happen, etc.  It started out with just four people and quickly ballooned into a national movement.  Had they not done what they did, who knows how much longer the Civil Rights Movement would've taken.  We need more people like them today - people who aren't afraid to stand up for what is right.  Thank you David Richmond, Franklin McCain, Ezell Blair, Jr. (now known as Jibreel Khazan), and Joseph McNeil.",1483401600,2,890,4.666666666666667

3803006,5,B001ULDJUG,"Really appreciated the quality of this documentary and the ability to listen and see the four and those that knew them. I already knew how effective sit-ins were for Civil Rights and how this was mostly done by students; great to see the originators and hear about their friendship and the impact they had on our nation. Still reeling from the emotions that remain. Pride, appreciation, and thankfulness for my elders, impressed by the film and the artist who created the memorial, and sadness to learn that most strip malls were initially designed as business' form of  'White Flight'.",1475625600,2,586,4.91919191919192

3803008,5,B001ULDJUG,Very good documentary of the sit ins which were initiated by four courageous students from NC Agricultural & Technical (A&T) State University.,1473033600,,142,5.5
3803009,5,B001ULDJUG,"Excellent first account documentary of how four young black college males helped jumpstart racial equality in this country. I was raised in a small predominantly white city in Virginia, so needless to say we never learned much about this issue in school. At 38 I'm just learning a lot about African American history. I've been watching a lot of documentaries about civil rights and this is an awesome one.",1473033600,3,405,4.884057971014493
3803010,5,B001ULDJUG,Hearing from the people who started the sit-in feels like a rare privilege--their courage is admirable. This film tells the story very well and should be viewed by everyone.,1472860800,,173,5.0

3803015,4,B001ULDJUG,"Good documentary, well done.",1462406400,,28,6.25
3803016,4,B001ULDJUG,"Good original footage along with recent interviews from the original four. This documentary holds the viewers' interest, reminding us of the silly, unjust, and awful arbitrariness of the Jim Crow laws. Everyone could buy goods at Woolworth, but Blacks and Minorities could not sit at the counter and be served. The film does a powerful job of showing the nerve it took, and the radical action it was for these four to sit down on those stools and ask to be served something to eat or drink.",1462060800,4,490,4.64367816091954

8344217,5,B001ULDJUG,"Exquisite documentary about the Woolworth lunch counter racial segregation protest led by four young African American students from nearby A&T University, that was the catalyst for similar racial equality protests en masse across the south in 1960, and another precursor to the larger civil rights movement that spread across the country throughout the 1960's. As another mentioned, there is a great deal of original footage of the actual event and its aftermath, as opposed the usual reenactments. Such brave young people. Hearing each speak about their frame of minds before the first sit-in, their awe at the movement it sparked and their personal inspirations and respect for one another,  were the most wonderful aspects of the film, as all are exceptionally humble, despite their iconic status. This film of course is very educational, but it also quite moving and inspirational, as well as surpisingly uplifting. A must see.",1527120000,,931,5.29054054054054
8344218,5,B001ULDJUG,"A well-told story of the bravery of four men who stood up and put an end to what they were willing to take. I'm glad I watched it and I recommend it to a person interested in getting a better education on our entire history. Well-told. So proud of these men and all who stood for us like they did! Well-deserved praise for their heroic acts. Well done young men, now older and passed. You are heroic gentlemen. Thank you for serving your country by serving what is true to your hearts. Thank you for showing us that God exists in you and letting the spirit free all over Greensboro. You did well!",1512604800,2,596,4.283185840707965
8344219,5,B001ULDJUG,"Outstanding. The quote by Edmund Burke comes to mind... The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing. These young men did something, and it set in motion the changing of a country.",1507334400,,214,4.375
