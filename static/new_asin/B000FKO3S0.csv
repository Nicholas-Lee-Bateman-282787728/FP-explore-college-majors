2570845,4,B000FKO3S0,"I for one love Strawberry Shortcake period...as does my 3 1/2 yr old neice but this movie wasn't what I had hoped for. Hardly any of Strawberry's friends are in this movie and my neice noticed that. She was waiting for all the different characters to show up and they never did. Normally she wants to watch the new Strawberry over and over but as soon as this one went off she wanted to watch the Strawberry Shortcake ""World of Friends"" instead. Cute movie but others are better.",1156291200,16,479,4.454545454545454

8124328,5,B000FKO3S0,"My four year old daughter aboloutely loves Strawberry shortcake. We got this DVD in a combo back and it continues to be one of her favorites. Nothing scary, just good wholesome entertainment.",1322611200,,191,5.0
8124329,4,B000FKO3S0,"This DVD contains two episodes [for a total running time of 45 mins]. In ""When the Berry Fairy Came to Stay"", Strawberry finds an injured fairy, Margalo B Berry Glow in her garden, but later the fairy takes advantage of Strawberry's generosity. In ""The Legend of Sherry Bubble Berry"", Strawberry lends a helping hand to a klutzy fairy who is on a special mission for the fairy queen. This particular instalment in the Strawberry Shortcake series was not one of my favorites, or my preschooler's, but it is still worth watching.",1251331200,,527,4.802197802197802
8124330,3,B000FKO3S0,"This is a good video except for one unforseen problem. The first story revolves around a character who is behaving very badly in her whole attitude. Eventually Brambleberry fairy learns her lesson but she have a lot of sassy dialog in the mean time. Unfortunately this bad tempered mouthy little girl is the one my daughter has decided to model and now when she mad she recites these tantrums back at me word for word. So we don't watch this anymore. She does like them though. I'm sorry to have had to take them away. She is 3 years old.

The second story is good. Cheesy but good.",1250899200,4,582,4.388888888888889
