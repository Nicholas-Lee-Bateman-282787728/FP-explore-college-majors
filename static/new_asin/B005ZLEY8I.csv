8489745,3,B005ZLEY8I,"It's a not a terrible presentation but to be perfectly frank, I would rather prosecute and wipe out those that have assisted these 90-something year olds, along with getting them in the process. Meaning - chasing half-dead old men is fine...but getting those that have supported these monsters would be even more fine. In fact, hunting down the facts as to why they weren't prosecuted to begin with would be a much more interesting documentary.

I also felt that the yelling match between Zuroff and the pro-Palestinian guy was really out of place. Zuroff should have not taken the bait and explained that the issue of the Palestinians is separate and clearly, rational people could easily disagree on this subject. We're here to hunt Nazis, not deal with who is right or wrong in the Middle East this week.",1432425600,,807,4.805755395683454
