4371014,3,B004FUKLIW,"Bad acting, bad writing, bad directing but my kids (9 and 7 years old) enjoyed it. Probably ok for for younger kids too.",1393286400,5,120,4.260869565217392
4371015,3,B004FUKLIW,"It's a good, clean, comedy that was fun to watch.  It won't win any awards for brilliance, but it was fun.  It might teach the kids some mischievous tricks, though!",1392076800,12,164,4.433333333333334
4371016,2,B004FUKLIW,"Lame movie poor acting, and poor story. The main actor Rico Rodriguez is in the movie for about only 10 minutes. All the other actors are very poor actors, more like a movie shot by amateurs in a weekend.",1389830400,7,204,4.256410256410256
4371017,5,B004FUKLIW,"Great movie for 10 year old boys!!!! My son loved it. Fun characters, quick to the point plot. Fun movie.",1386806400,6,105,4.3
4371018,2,B004FUKLIW,"What a disappointment. After viewing the trailer, I was hoping for a fun,silly movie in the lines of Home Alone or even Dennis the Menance. Not even close! A young boy tries to drive off all babysitters so his parents will spend more time at home. This movie plays more like a tv show. Some tired jokes played by a very weak cast with no direction. And yes, Danny Trejo is the tough babysitter in about 2 scenes. Very young children may like this,but if you are over the age of 6, skip this one!",1339200000,3,495,4.221052631578948
4371019,1,B004FUKLIW,"The most frustrating movie, leave you keep wondering what was the big idea, and why anybody would think that watching a kid suffer is funny. Idiotic parents work so hard every night entertaining clients, that they are ready to leave their kid with anybody. He is supposed to be a good puppy and stay put, while mom and dad make money to pay for lexus and a big house. That is exactly what is wrong with the modern world. The kid learns a lesson that being bad or being good does not matter, because his parents are going to do what they want anyway. As a mother I felt frustrated, and they call this movie comedy. Spare your time, do not bother even wasting your evening on this film",1314316800,3,683,4.3023255813953485
4371020,4,B004FUKLIW,"Danny is a great 7 year old kid who does his chores, tends to his iguana, Iggy, and plays with toy dinosaurs. All he wants to do is to play catch with his dad, who never has time for him. He plays catch with his regular babysitter, Janelle, who throws like a girl, but they have a great rapport. However when the babysitter can't sit because she is taking an SAT class and his dad breaks his promise to play catch, Danny tries to get on the ""no baby sit list"" in order to force his parents to stay at home. In order to get on the list he must go against his grain and misbehave. He has to take lessons on being bad. Danny gets to the point where he is down to his last baby sister, a man known as ""The Guard"" played by Danny Trejo, the ugliest babysitter to hit the screen since Robin Williams in drag.

Unfortunately Trejo's role is limited. The picture we see of him bond in tape never happens. Like most kid films, the acting is substandard. The parents know why Danny is being bad because he tells them, yet at other times they can't figure it out. Seems to be aimed at kids 7-9. The movie is short and painless the first time through. The message is that it is bad to be bad, parents know best, and family is good.",1304640000,15,1219,4.100418410041841

He does bad things to his sitters to accomplish this.  Nothing too bad (loud music, yogurt balloons, paint on jacket etc).  However my 9 year old did not think it was very funny because the baby sitters always gave in too quick to end the scene.  It is a cute movie for younger kids as he always gets in trouble and sees his parents disappointment at his behavior but not worth 9.99.",1456185600,,556,4.0181818181818185

4371415,1,B004FUKLIW,"Atrocious. This was hands-down one of the worst films I've seen in a long time, and that's coming from someone who's seen every season of Mystery Science Theater. The story is terrible, the acting horrible, the film quality looking like a 1990's made of TV movie, and ultimately this felt like an awful 'Home Alone' clone done on a ridiculously-small budget. It almost feels like they tried to film this in a day, as characters are always dressed the same, the dialog is unenthused as cardboard, and some sequences that you'd expect to be far more devastating, such as dropping model paints on a motocycle or a lava cake hurling through the air, all seem to have minimal, bare-noticable impact on anything. Just when you think it can't get worse, the film wraps up, barely over an hour, not with any sort of discipline or correction, but with parents that cave to rotten behavior, and the ludicrous, maudlin ending is cringe-worthy.",1416787200,2,932,4.795031055900621

4371429,3,B004FUKLIW,Meh. A lot of bad acting and I don't thing I laughed once. It's ok if you have nothing else to watch. I thought it would be a lot better. Low budget. The only great thing about it is that there is zero bad language. Too bad the only movies without trash talk is mostly in low budget films.,1412380800,2,289,3.9152542372881354
4371430,3,B004FUKLIW,"Strictly for the kids.  Rico Rodriguez's acting abilities far out shine the rest of the cast despite his age and Danny Trejo proves once again that he will take acting gigs wherever he can find them.  Trejo's character could have been so much better if given a bit more screen time and a better script.  Taylor Negron is almost unrecognizable in his limited role.  Again, his many talents were wasted in this movie by the limited screen time his character is afforded and a poor script.  One need only revisit his performance in Rodney Dangerfield's hilarious movie, Easy Money, for proof of what he can do if given the chance.

In short, it's quite obvious why this film never found an audience in the theaters and its repackaged title and emphasis of the now better known Rodriquez and Trejo.",1409011200,2,794,4.676258992805756
4371431,5,B004FUKLIW,"I was pleasantly surprised. I thought this was going to be sort of like Home Alone, where the child would battle against his babysitters, but it was really about a boy trying to get his parents to finally pay more attention to him, and for him to finally realize that, in spite of his parents' busy-ness (business), they were regretting the time they weren't spending together.

The movie is both hilarious and dramatic. By the end of the movie, babysitters hate him, but he can't hurt the one babysitter who was always special to him.

When you get a chance, watch this movie. Even if you don't have kids (like I don't), it's a fun movie to watch.

So, watch alone, with a friend, or with your kids.",1408579200,5,700,4.453125
