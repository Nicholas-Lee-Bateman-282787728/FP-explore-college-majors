4369080,5,B004FKKU92,"One of the better films in quite some time
Heartwarming and Bright
A wonderful story and script with very talented artists
Highly recommended",1282435200,5,141,5.173913043478261
4369081,5,B004FKKU92,"Radu Mihailenau built a demolishing, irreverent and sentimental portrait that began in the extinct U.R.S.S. Twenty-five years after losing his position as the conductor of the Bolshoi Orchestra for his refusal to fire the Jewish musicians, a once-famous musical director attempts to stage a late-career comeback. Andre Semoinovitch Filipov (Aleksei Guskov) was at the top of his game when the Soviet regime ended his career. Two decades later, he's working as a janitor in the same theater where he once conducted. In his spare time, Andre and his wife stage mock communist demonstrations to entertain the locals. When Andre happens across an invitation to Paris' famed Thtre du Chtelet, he contacts his old orchestra friends in hopes of staging a performance that will bring the crowd to their feet for a standing ovation.

During the development of the first movement of Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto, a sudden and unpleasant fact occurs. Such event will withstand in the mind of an untamed director as well as his musicians by then.

The movie is developed like a Symphony in three movements. The first two deal with the efforts against the bureaucracy and obstacles to surmount to materialize a dream to perform a concert at the famous Hall in Paris. Hovered by a fine irony and bitter humor until the dramatic conclusion.

A magnificent and original movie. An invaluable fine jewel. One of the best films of the year.",1277856000,64,1422,5.042553191489362
4369112,5,B004FKKU92,"One of the best movies I have ever seen.  Moving and funny at the same time, it is a story of memory and redemption, of oppression and survival.",1472774400,,144,4.142857142857143
4369113,5,B004FKKU92,"I LOVE this movie. Just had to have it for myself although it's currently on Netflix. The last 15 minutes is really cathartic.
The rest of the film is really a build up to this. Everything the naysayer say about it is true, but who cares? I enjoy it every time I watch it.
By the way, it should be watched in the original Russian and French NOT in the dubbed English.",1471737600,,367,4.111111111111111

4369120,2,B004FKKU92,"This is a French film in Russian, about Russian musicians.  The story is simply preposterous, predictable, and beneath the dignity of anyone fool enough to fall for the reviews.  Well, I did, especially the promise of great music.  The film's climax, i.e. the music, is embarrassing.  Caveat emptor.",1441411200,,299,5.166666666666667

4369148,5,B004FKKU92,"A concert by the Bolshoi orchestra is interrupted in the middle of Tchakovski's violin concerto. Nearly 30 years later, the former conductor of the orchestra, now a janitor at the Bolshoi Theater, gets a chance to finish the concert: by assembling a small orchestra to impersonate the current ensemble at an ""overseas"" concert in Paris' Chatelet theater. Radu Mihaileanu's film is funny, touching, poetic, inspiring. And the English version does a good job of rendering the beauty of the original (in Russian and French, with French subtitles).",1431302400,,544,5.264367816091954
4369149,5,B004FKKU92,Watched it at the theater a few years ago and I loved it. But the DVD I bought through amazon had so many cuts that thje plot was ruined. Many of the really funny parts were shortened or cut out.,1428537600,,195,3.9

4369168,5,B004FKKU92,"An endearing story of a man's dream to finish a concert which was interrupted 30 years ago. Andre Semoinovitch Filipov (Aleksei Guskov) was conductor of the Bolshoi Orchestra when the Soviets pulled the plug on him for refusing to fire the talented musicians in his orchestra. Because of his refusal, the entire orchestra was destroyed and all of them had to find menial labor. Yet as the film unfolds we come to see that the music never dies. Friend after friend unpacks hidden instruments and shows that the music is still in them. Andre intercepts a fax meant for the current Bolshoi Orchestra, steals it and decides to risk everything to get to France in two weeks to play at Paris' famed Th&eacute;tre du Chtelet. He gathers all of his friends, arranges fake passports and off they go! I do not want to give away the storyline, but this is a delightful story of hope, friendship, dedication and faith which ends with a wonderful ending. Granted, the English dubbing over the original French is quite bad and some scenes are unbelievable (putting together and stamping fake passports at the airport?) but nonetheless, it is a delightful movie that will make you feel good. The performance of Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto was superb.",1422316800,,1237,4.867298578199052

I own an old DVD player and an old television set that I hooked it up too. I have no idea what to do. But I would think that should have been made clear in the descriptions. I can't seem to find any way to watch the film and am afraid to throw good money after bad by purchasing it again. I'm really disappointed.",1420848000,,450,4.183908045977011

4369189,5,B004FKKU92,One must be a classical music lover to fully enjoy this movie.  Tchaikovsky's violin concerto is the focal point of the concert.  Having said that the story line and the acting is something anyone will enjoy.,1408320000,,208,4.75
4369190,5,B004FKKU92,Powerful story which also reflects current Russian control. It is a moving and heartfelt reflection of the lives of individuals who were censored. Incredible musical ending will bring tears as well as joy!!! I have purchased 10 copies as gifts!,1408147200,,244,5.125

4369203,5,B004FKKU92,"I saw the American shortened version of this on Netflix and fell in love with it. Then I learned there was a longer version available only in ""European version,"" so I bought it. Yes, it does require recalibration of the DVD player, but it's worth it. This version is longer, explaining many plot elements hinted at but never really colored in (chopped out) by the shortened version. There are no English subtitles (so you have to know French)--and something else: the script in French is not as funny as the English version. In one description, the English goes, ""...the Bolshoi sounds like mating cats! We're better..."" The French is ""...the Bolshoi is terrible! We're better..."" Either way, the movie is very funny, and, as stated by other reviews, the last 20 minutes will have you crying. Very touching.",1398902400,,807,4.855072463768116

4369207,5,B004FKKU92,"This movie did not get the promotion it deserves.  It is really good -- funny, yet with a serious undertone.  It is Russian and makes fun of the Soviet regime while carrying a message, with humor and satire.",1393372800,,207,4.421052631578948

4369222,5,B004FKKU92,"I like this movie so much, I ordered three copies to use as gifts.  It captures with sparkling humor the experience of Russian Jewish musicians during a very dark time. My only complaint is that the conductor's gestures were out of sync with the music being conducted in a few scenes.  Downbeats became upbeats, etc., which may bother musicians, but no one else will notice.  Enjoy!",1385683200,,382,4.757575757575758

It's a hilarious comedy and at the same time such an inspiring movie. You can tell those who made this movie really love music, especially that of Tchaikovsky.

4369300,5,B004FKKU92,"Stumbled onto this DVD at the library.  I loved this movie!  Begins with a custodian watching a rehearsal of the Bolshoi orchestra and masterfully weaves the background story as the plot develops.  Thirty years ago, he was the maestro.  A lofty crime is conceived on a compressed timeline.  Light-hearted comedy in the middle requires a little suspension of disbelief, but sets the stage for impending disaster.

This film satisfies on many levels.  Fun and lighthearted, yet more.  Tight film.  Believable politics.  The ravages of time.  A hidden secret.  Hints of truth.  Deeper themes about the power and beauty of music are masterfully interwoven to advance the plot.  With true artistry, the film transcends itself and touches us deeply and profoundly.

Radu Mihaileanu couldn't have chosen a better masterpiece than Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto, so delicate and powerful at the same time, moreover the story is breathtaking and the actors just awesome.
It is an inspiring story about how you can turn a frustrated life into a triumph of the spirit.  If we, in the real world, would run after our dreams as Andre Filipov did in the film, there would be many success stories to be told.

Maybe a special documentary on the DVD would have been a plus, but I don't miss it.  I highly recommend this film to anyone, but you will especially enjoy it if you are from the former communist block.

As someone else pointed out, the US version is sadly cut and missing about 15 minutes of the film, notably several parts with King of Gas character.

4369345,5,B004FKKU92,"I bought this from Amazon and thought that the US Version only came Dubbed in English.  I now  have  discovered that the US Version does indeed have the Original Version,  Here's where you can find it:

Go to Settings: then choose AUDIO Options;  Choose French/Russian.  Then resume movie.  The key to this is the default is set to the Dubbed version.

In the Original version you hear the Actors voices.  The Film is subtle and quiet in creating these characters.  It says so much that as you watch this film, you realize you are watching something very special, even magical.  It is that powerful in its emotional impact.  This is not only rare, but something we only see as an exception that is exceptional.

The Dubbed version is poor at best and all the magic is drained out.  Whoever did this took nothing from the original version.  If you want to do a comparison, look at the way the main character and his wife interact together.  In the Original it is real love in the quiet way they talk to each other.  The Dubbed version never comes close.

So in Closing this review, I owe an apology to the ARC Entertainment that put out this US Version, but to be honest, they did not say that the Original version is on the disc.  Even Amazon had no idea and that's where I tried the European version.  That DVD is set up correctly, but as Region 2, you need a DVD Player that plays all regions.  So yes, this is a wonderful film and , no, you are not stuck with the Dubbed version, As I said before.....

Do you love feeling your heart and throat swell with emotion?  We definitely have got it in this film!

I don't know where they got the story but I died laughing at the broad humor and caricature that was used in portraying the Russians in the beginning of the movie.  Having MANY close Russian friends and having traveled to many Russian cities, I couldn't help but get choked with emotion and laughter at this look inside Russia today.  If you understand about modern Russian weddings, you might chuckle the hardest through that scene and the Novy Russki.

There are twists and turns that are unexpected and surprising.  There is a sense at one point that the film is moving away from the broad humor to a more serious vein.  It never gets heavy or ponderous but instead, like a flower opening from a bud to a full-blown flower, you begin to see and appreciate deeper human emotions and though the actors' experiences might not have been your own, their parts are acted in such a way that you feel emotion right along with them.  The cinematography is very interesting and presents flashbacks in a way that I have never seen but was very effective!

I watched this in a large theater of senior citizens in south Florida.  Various parts of the room laughed at Jewish jokes, French jokes, and we all laughed at the antics of the Russians.  Even though the film was spoken in Russian and French with English subtitles, I thought the subtitles were very well done.  Sometimes foreign films either don't give you time to read the words by flashing them by too fast or they display them against inappropriate backgrounds making them virtually impossible to read.  I thought these subtitles were some of the best I've ever seen; thanks!!!

The ONLY reason I didn't give this film 5 stars is because it is not Gone With the Wind or Dr. Zhivago or Lawrence of Arabia or even Elvira Madigan.  How about 4.5 stars?  It certainly deserves that!!!

Happily that is now an unnecessary purchase.  This movie is not without its imperfections, but it is also uniquely satisfying as it  swings with gusto from broad farce and roughneck socio/political silliness to its deeply moving finale.  I defy anyone with the least shred of appreciation for music to watch the last 20 minutes without tears rolling down your cheeks.  It is difficult to believe the director is the same man who made the remarkable Go, Live and Become (Va Vis et Deviens), which is one of the most serious and powerful films of the last decade.

It is now Oct. 10, 2011 and I am adding the following paragraph to my original May 30 review.  Elsewhere Simina Farcasiu complains about the cuts to this release.  Having watched this region 1 dvd three or four times by now I became curious and since I already owned the all region dvd player mentioned at the beginning I purchased the region 2 disc and just began watching it.  Simina is absolutely correct.  After only 10 minutes I have counted about a dozen meaningless cuts, some only seconds in length, which serve no purpose but to mindlessly streamline a narrative which does not need streamlining.  In fact they weaken the impact significantly.  The film remains a delight but so much more so in the uncut European release.  My suggestion for those who care about such things is to purchase a PIONEER 420 -K all region dvd player.  It's only about $80 (!  There will certainly be other occasions when owning it will be useful.  Often there are films available in Europe that are totally unavailable here and with this machine they are all playable.

The suspense builds up to the concert at the end; seems impossible to happen; meanwhile the secret of Anne Marie (Melanie Laurent, one of the most beautiful women in the world), is beginning to leak out, despite efforts to conceal. In the final concert her brilliant violin awakens the long gone skills of the orchestra, who play beautifully. She is amazed at her own playing as she is coming to realize that she is actually the daughter of Lea, now long dead in the Gulag, and she is (perhaps, point is not clear) the daughter of this amazing Russian maestro she is playing for and with. All this is conveyed without words, only by expression and gesture, a brilliant performance. Anne Marie finally realizes she is Jewish, she is Russian, her soul is Tchaikovsky, her mother was the famous Lea, and this maestro (I believe) is her never known father.

4369357,4,B004FKKU92,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I went to see this movie.  It was billed as a French film, and some described it as a tear-jerker, others a comedy.  When the action began in Russia, I groaned inwardly. Russian movies can be bleak, and I wasn't in the mood. But as the film progressed, I found myself drawn into the valiant, but realistically implausible, plotline about a former orchestra conductor, presently working as a janitor, who intercepts a fax to the Bolshoi orchestra begging the Bolshoi to play in Paris.  The fun begins when the conductor re-assembles his own, by now, ragtag former orchestra to take the gig.

So as not to spoil your experience, I will keep my observations general. This is a movie about standing up for your beliefs, believing in yourself, and overcoming great odds to validate both yourself and your beliefs. There are quite a few delightful surprises, and many opportunities to chuckle if not guffaw.  If you're firmly rooted in reality, you will resist the suspension of disbelief this film requires, but if you can relax your Type-A self you will be pleasantly entertained.  There are some maudlin moments (hence the 4 star rating). These are most noticable toward the end of the movie, prior to and during an INCREDIBLE musical experience that made the real audience sitting beside me clap wildly along with the movie audience in the film.  How often does that happen?

I left the theatre buoyed in spirit, hungry for Tchaikovsky music, and smiling.  To put my money where my review is, I've signed up for the DVD whenever it is released, and I've ordered the soundtrack.  How's that for an enthusiastic endorsement?",1299628800,5,1654,4.812720848056537
4369358,5,B004FKKU92,"I don't usually review movies, but this one touched in me a range of emotional buttons that I am making an exception. The music first of all - not only the powerful performance of Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto in D Major. It plays an important role in the story and its primary characters. The other music pieces of the sound track can get under your skin, such as the gypsy dance music, nicely integrated as another theme in the story. While the events are set in post-perestroika Russia, the shadows of the past hang over all the characters, yet in particular over Andre Filipov, the former ""Maestro"" of the famous Bolsho orchestra, convincingly portrayed by Alexei Guskov. It was exactly that violin concerto and its performance under Filipov that was crudely interrupted some twenty years earlier by Breshnev himself ""to shame the orchestra"". The fall-out was much more dramatic than the incident itself and not only Andre has suffered ever since. He now works as a janitor in the Concert Hall that was integral to his fame in the past. An intercepted fax from Paris with an invitation to the Bolsho to perform there, launches the bitter-sweet, satirical, with hilarious moments of light relief, depiction of Russian ways of doing things. The young Paris violinist, Anne-Marie Jacquet (M&eacute;lanie Laurent) has been asked to play the virtuoso part... why? Flashbacks add important depth to the human story of friendship and music.

One has to suspend disbelief and go with the flow... then one can enjoy the funny aspects, the ironies and the deep emotions that will come to bear in members of the orchestra and others. It is a greatly enjoyable and also heartwarming story, beautifully acted with a flair of Paris and the Russian soul. [Friederike Knabe]",1290643200,17,1762,4.952702702702703
4369359,4,B004FKKU92,"Like another reviewer here before me, I too had fairly major qualms about the believability of the main thread of this movie: that a rogue group of 20-years-banished musicians could intercept a proposal for a major international music organization; get and publicize a gig (with full advertising and TV coverage no less); and ultimately (after *considerable* difficulty getting to the stage) pull off a world-class concert WITHOUT PRACTICE.  Sure. That could happen.

Still, if you can suspend you belief, 'Le Concert' is an enjoyable tale of redemption.  This is, at heart, staged as a wry, comedic tale.  So, I'll grant writer/director Radu Mihaileanu poetic license.  Mihaileanu - a Jewish emigre (to France) from Ceausescu-era Bucharest - has the background to stage a tale centering on a group of Soviet Jewry Refusniks.  And, at the center of his tale, Aleksei Guskov is likable and winning as director Andre Filipov.  We root for his triumph.  I also was delighted by the performance of Valeriy Barinov as Ivan Gavrilov, the orchestra's Soviet-era manager.  Though Gavrilov banished Filipov (or, at least, delivered the verdict), Filipov recognizes that he needs the apparatchik's considerable negotiating and fixing skills...as well as his more-than-passable French.  Barinov is wonderful - the best part of the film.

There's also the not unpleasant sight of the beautiful Mlanie Laurent, here playing virtuoso violinist (and more - hint, hint), Anne-Marie Jacquet.  Until I remembered her from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paris/dp/B002VKB0M4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paris</a>, I was convinced they'd scored a real concert veteran for the role.

4369361,3,B004FKKU92,"On the artistic front (stuff like writing, believability, characterization, cinematography) this film is a must miss. Filled with hideous stereotypes, clich&eacute;s and plot twists that demand Golden Gate scale suspensions of disbelief, The Concert is pure cheese. M&eacute;lanie Laurent and Aleksei Gutskov take two for the team and offer very touching, at times charismatic performances with what they have been given, but that is far from enough.

If you know anything about Russia (no, you can't walk all the way to Sheremetyevo from Central Moscow) or music (no, you can't assemble an orchestra and put on a concert without a single re-hearsal), you will probably find The Concert hard to sit through. Yet for Russophiles there is at least one redeeming virtue: most of the acting is done in Russian by Russian actors. A refreshing change when too many films are full of non-Russians playing Russians and speaking something closer to Klingon than the real thing.

Rating: 1.5 out of 5.0

If farce mixed with slapstick and a heavy dose of sentimentality is your thing, than check out The Concert by Romanian born French director Radu Mihaileanu. The premise is so absurd that only those with the most meager of critical faculties will enjoy it.

The protagonist is Andrei Filipov (Alexei Guskov), who was the world famous Bolshoi conductor who lost his job by supporting his mostly Jewish orchestra members after they were all forced out during a purge instituted by Soviet premier Brezhnev in 1980.

Flash forward to the present and Andrei now can only dream of his glory days while toiling as a janitor at the Bolshoi; he ends up intercepting a fax sent by Paris' Theatre du Chatelet begging the Bolshoi management to bring the orchestra to Paris as a fill-in for the last minute- cancellation of the Los Angeles Philharmonic.

Well yes it's supposed to be a farce but even the most exaggerated of conceits must operate within some kind of credible context. Here, the context is too absurd to be taken seriously. You can probably guess what Andrei's next move isgather together his former band of musicians (now a motley crew of low-lifes, scrounging for their next day's ruble) and arrange for all of them to fly to Paris, and pawn themselves off as the real Bolshoi musicians.

Andrei, along with his buddy, the portly and amiable Sacha (Dmitry Nazarov), end up relying on the former Bolshoi manager, Ivan (Valeri Barinov), a former KGB apparatchik, who speaks French and negotiates with the head of the Theare du Chatelet, to bring Andrei's long out of the limelight misfits to Paris. The joke of Ivan, attempting to revive a Communist Congress in Paris, grows tiresome early on.

The conscripted musicians all turn out to be stereotypes of one kind or anotherfrom their money grubbing demands for pay immediately and their desire to party (instead of rehearsing), up until minutes before the concert is supposed to begin.

Meanwhile Andrei has decided to perform Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto, performed by the young French violinist Anne-Marie Jacquet (Melanie Laurent), who has never played this Tchaikovsky piece before. Since the farce and slapstick fail to evoke many laughs, director Mihaileanu suddenly shifts gears and attempts to evoke the tears.

It turns out that Anne-Marie is the daughter of two of the Bolshoi musicians who were sent to a gulag in Siberia and Andrei uses the promise of disclosure of this information, to entice Jacquet back to play at the concert, after she insists she won't play under any circumstances.

The absurdity of the script reaches its apotheosis when the orchestra begins playing without rehearsal and predictably plays completely out of tune. But the great Jacquet plays so beautifully that Andrei's motley crew rises to the occasion and wows the audience to the point that they're hired for additional engagements across the continent, for the upcoming year.

While most of the actors do their best with such thin material, in the end the project cannot be saved. Sentimental, with few laughs, The Concert gives the classical music world a bad name along with its cinematic counterpart.",1478390400,,3215,5.00187265917603

8427881,5,B004FKKU92,So good. There are plenty of hilarious situations ( but not necessarily many funny lines or physical humor.) A moving movie about the affects of war without the bloodshed. Great music and acting.,1475884800,,195,4.9393939393939394
