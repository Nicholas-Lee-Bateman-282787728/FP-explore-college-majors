8127266,5,B000FVGNSM,"Rainer Werner Fassbinder made 47 films in 12 years and died at the age of 37. These two films are among his several masterpieces. MARTHA features an extraordinary 360 degree camera pan that only remains more breathtaking over time. IN A YEAR WITH 13 MOONS is especially exceptional as Fassbinder designed the production, wrote the script, operated the camera, directed and edited the picture. The film's last scene features a long complex camera movement that would have seriously challenged any master cinematographer with decades of experience. These films are often difficult to watch, difficult to reflect upon, and are also filled with unexpected brilliant humor. The reality of Fassbinder's achievement as an artist is staggering; even his slightest films have redeeming qualities that reward repeated viewings. This DVD package is as much a treasure as it is a bargain, representing a depth of substance and quality of film making that no longer exists in the world (I wish that was a hyperbolic statement). If you don't know these films, prepare to be staggered, stunned, and yes, even entertained.",1439424000,14,1106,5.219101123595506

8127269,5,B000FVGNSM,"This set would probably be the best introduction to Fassbinder's films that you can find. 'Martha' represents the quintessential Fassbinder melodrama.. Margret Carstensen's desperate performance as a tortured wife is unforgettable.. 'In a Year with 13 Moons' is among the director's best works - it is a transitional film in his catalog it brings together the experimentation of his early years with the scope of his later hollywood-like (tongue in cheek hollywood) films..

This would be my choice for an affordable introduction to Fassbinder.",1153785600,27,544,5.476190476190476
8127270,5,B000FVGNSM,"Granted I haven't seen the dvd, or the features (these films have been released seperately for a while though), I can easily say these are some of Fassbinder's masterworks.

Both are haunting, touching, and unflinching in that sense.

Fassbinder was a true master, and these films accentuate that.

In A Year With 13 Moons is a little odd as a film, but what film of Fassbinder's isn't? But Martha is definitely something else and well worth seeing (more so than 13 Moons at least).

Regardless, if the picture quality lives up to the quality of the films, this shouldn't be a set a fan of Fassbinder (or world cinema in general) should miss.",1153267200,5,642,4.654867256637168
