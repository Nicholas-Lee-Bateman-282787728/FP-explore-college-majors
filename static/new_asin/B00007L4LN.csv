1819328,4,B00007L4LN,"As the negative reviews on this page make plain, there's a lot to quarrel with in Alex and Andrew Smith's ""The Slaughter Rule."" The film is essentially a series of intense set pieces, lacking a strong enough ending and narrative arc to tie them together into a cohesive, satisfying whole. The characters' tragedies and setbacks come unbelievably thick and fast, and large blocks of dialogue are lost because the Smiths encourage the actors to mumble inaudibly. Smaller things about the film also are bothersome, such as the Smiths' decision to saddle the protagonist with the joke name of Roy Chutney. (I kept expecting Uncle Allardyce Chutney and Cousin Clarence P. Chutney, played by W.C. Fields and Groucho Marx, to show up for a visit.)

Nevertheless, ""The Slaughter Rule"" manages to wield considerable power, thanks to the excellence of its ensemble cast. Mumble though they may, these are actors who know how to keep an audience mesmerized. David Morse gives the performance of his career as Gid, a grizzled, eccentric football coach and celibate gay man with a chaste but burning crush on Roy, his star quarterback. Gid's big speech, meant to reassure Roy about his intentions, instead comes across as a torch song, only serving to scare Roy all the more.

Ryan Gosling is equally compelling as Roy, continuing the extraordinary string of performances he began with ""The Believer"" and carried through ""Half Nelson,"" ""Fracture"" and ""Lars and the Real Girl."" I was also greatly impressed by the performances of Clea DuVall as the barmaid with whom Roy has a brief fling, Eddie Spears as Roy's best friend, Kelly Lynch as Roy's nasty mother, and David Cale as the town drunk, living out of an old Studebaker and sputtering his encyclopedic knowledge of classic country music. (Amy Adams is in the movie too, but you'll miss her if you blink.) Be sure to check out the deleted scenes on this disc, which fill in so many blanks in the story that I'm surprised the Smiths left them out.",1216512000,5,1987,4.875739644970414

1819330,3,B00007L4LN,"The Slaughter Rule (Andrew and Alex Smith, 2002)

I'll watch Ryan Gosling in anything. I'll watch David Morse in anything. So when you put the two together, you're bound to get dynamite, right? Well, not really, but it's not for lack of trying on the parts of the two main characters. Roy Chutney (Gosling) is a football player with anger management issues who gets cut from the team after funding is dropped by the state. Gid Ferguson (Morse) is an ex-coach with a shady past who's trying to regain his reputation and glory by putting together an underground football team for a renegade six-man league who battle it out in cow pastures. When the two meet, you've got the ingredients for the kind of uneasy-mentor movie that we haven't seen too much of recently.

Morse and Gosling, as should be expected, are the best parts of this movie. Both are fantastic actors, and they do god work here exploring the dynamics of a relationship fraught with greed and mistrust. The problem is that this relationship alone isn't quite enough to drive the entire movie. It makes it watchable, but not much more than that. Still, if you're a fan of either (or both) of the principals, you'll want to check it out. ** ",1172534400,3,1204,4.643192488262911
1819331,2,B00007L4LN,"**1/2 Despite the novelty of its setting, ""The Slaughter Rule"" is a fairly conventional coming-of-age tale about a boy who grows into manhood by becoming a member of a ragtag six-man football team.  Roy is a teenager trapped in a small Montana town whose life has not been going any too well of late.  His father, with whom he had only the most casual of relationships, has been discovered dead on a railroad track, a possible suicide victim.  His mother, embittered by their divorce, sleeps around with countless men and has no real inclination to provide her son with any but the most cursory form of maternal affection.  On top of all this, Roy has just been rejected for the school's varsity football team because the coach finds him lacking in the kind of ""anger"" he feels a player needs to be a success on the gridiron.  When Roy is asked by Gid, a somewhat eccentric older man in the town, to come join his six-man football team, the youth only reluctantly acquiesces (six-man football is a near rule-less poor relation to the real game, one ostensibly only played by farm boys).  It is at this point that Roy's growth into manhood begins, since it turns out that the enigmatic Gid, who one assumes will be merely a father figure for the affection-starved youth, may be seeking more than just a father/son, athlete/coach relationship with the boy.
This latent-homosexual subtext, in fact, is just about the only element that separates ""The Slaughter Rule"" from countless other films in this genre.  Most everything else about the film feels derivative and stale: the emotionally distant parents, the promiscuous, psychologically detached mother, the abusive stepdad, the sweet girl who wants to flee this hicksville town as fast and as far as a bus ticket can take her.  Towards the end, especially, the filmmakers start to pile up the heartbreaks and tragedies, one on top of the other, almost to epic proportions.  One wonders how so much can happen in so short a time to so small a group of people.  In the almost two hour running time of the film, only the ambiguity of the Roy/Gid relationship arouses any real interest in the viewer.
Ryan Gosling is tremendously appealing as the troubled Roy, and David Morse (the father in ""Contact"") turns Gid into a nicely sympathetic figure.  The starkness of the Montana landscape also provides an appropriate backdrop for the bleak melodrama that is playing itself out in the foreground.  Apart from these few quality elements, however, there isn't a whole lot else to commend in ""The Slaughter Rule.""",1088380800,8,2554,4.83256880733945
1819332,4,B00007L4LN,"Sundance directors and screenplay writers constantly slaughter the rules of filmmaking in splendid style.  THE SLAUGHTER RULE is no exception to the Sundance standard, however it slowly twists the rules before it nearly breaks them right off.
Set in the bleak and dreary high school years of a cold and frozen-ground Montana, this story of the strong-arm sport of six-man football and a young recruit who recklessly tries to control the often brutal game is clearly a sad satire of lives that many wouldn't bother living.  The actual regulation, the slaughter rule, allows a team to simply quit when they're getting badly beaten by their opponents.  As our young athlete slowly realizes that you can't stop the weather and you can't keep out the cold and you can't control what you don't respect, he begins to wish that life had a slaughter rule of its own.
Ryan Gosling (THE BELIEVER) continues to excel from one movie to the next.  He's like a young Edward Norton (AMERICAN HISTORY X), choosing films for their class and their taste rather than for their big screen appeal.  David Morse (THE NEGOTIATOR) is a complex and emotional coach with an odd and dubious attachment to his players. The writing by brothers Alex and Andrew Smith is incredible, as is the often black and white cinematography set in their Montana home.  A dreary soundtrack score by alt. country forefather Jay Farrar is subtle and hits home in a simple sort of way.  Farrar manages an uppercut from a light slap similar to the way that snow-capped mountains cut the landscape.
This film is not for everyone.  It's a football movie on the outside, but don't look for ANY GIVEN SUNDAY or VARSITY BLUES here.  Many viewers will have issues with the slow storyline and with the lack of resolution when the credits roll.  But, these are the spectators that have problems looking at life as well.",1077753600,13,1863,4.79375
1819333,5,B00007L4LN,"Ryan Gosling is a wonder!!! The scenes between Ryan and David Morse were so intense that I was moved to tears several times. Both gave heartbreakingly beautiful performances.
Sadly a much misunderstood movie...",1058140800,11,210,5.393939393939394
1819334,4,B00007L4LN,"Overall, I liked this film for many of the reasons already mentioned here. It's a high school sports movie that brings to mind the scores of films that have been made in this genre (e.g., ""All the Right Moves""), and it tries mostly successfully to work against that genre's conventions. It also explores the male-bonding that underlies the relationship between coach and player by bringing together two males who are both outsiders, each needing the other to fulfill a sense of purpose in lives that are otherwise going nowhere.
Whether the coach's need for ""friendship"" crosses a boundary is an ambiguity that, from the point where you first see it, makes the film not an easy one to watch. And the filmmakers have created a tension there (sexual or otherwise) that their film doesn't totally resolve -- which is maybe appropriate in the hard-bitten world of the movie, where football is played under bleak winter skies on snow-swept, frozen fields. Endings are often difficult, and this one feels somewhat contrived and melodramatic, but the overall film remains strong, and its moody narrative sticks with you long afterward.
Morse, as the coach, has played this kind of character before and portrays well a man of both pride and weakness, who has experienced hurt and failure. Ryan Gosling is wonderfully natural and plays the young protagonist with what seems to be complete understanding. His affair with an ""older"" woman may seem a nod to convention, but the relationship is written and played for the truth in it -- that his immaturity makes him less than what she's hoping to find in a man. Equally memorable is the cinematography, capturing the Montana landscapes in wan winter light. The music is perfect.
I like films that are not quite predictable, show me a world I don't know, and play with conventions, expectations, and ambiguities. This one held my attention from beginning to end.",1058054400,25,1899,4.956112852664577
1819335,4,B00007L4LN,"I bought the DVD because, sadly, I had missed the screenings and couldn't find it for rental anywhere. The Jay Farrar music and the Indians were the reasons for me seeing it. To be a little critical, it came off as Cohen-brothers lite; if you strung together all the slower sequences of Blood Simple and Fargo, you'd have this movie. I did like the fact that nothing followed convention, and the hopelessness of living was conveyed well. I could've done without the scene near the end where a Native drives up in warpaint, hair flowing, on a motorcycle - it's like things turned into a Sherman Alexie story all of the sudden.",1057017600,,625,4.589285714285714
1819336,1,B00007L4LN,"Why did I watch this movie?  Why did I KEEP watching this movie?
Is loneliness a good reason for making sexual advances on a teenager?  Well, maybe it is if your sexual partner is a homeless drunk with diabetes who keeps interrupting you during karaoke night.  Heck, as long as the coach takes his high school team out for beers after a football game, he can do whatever he wants.  (And if he buys them a box dinner, he can watch them shower together.)
It seems some people cried at the character development of this movie.  I cried that there are actually people out there posing as coaches for high school sports who use the roster as a way to find who they can add to their list of molestees.
Then I cried when I realized I will never get 2 hours of my life back.",1053907200,2,766,4.219178082191781
1819337,5,B00007L4LN,"Starring Ryan Gosling (MURDER BY NUMBERS) and David Morse (THE LANGOLIERS), this movie is a *must see* - it's a bittersweet drama about how lonely people deal with loss and vulnerability.
The writers/directors of THE SLAUGHTER RULE are Andrew and Alex Smith - two brothers from Montana who workshopped this script at Sundance. In fact, THE SLAUGHTER RULE was up for Sundance's Grand Jury Prize. The kernel of the script came from their own high school experiences where every boy snickered that the coach was rumored to be gay. Though they never found out if that was the case, the Smiths were haunted by the fact that they dismissed the coach that easily based on school rumor and inuendo.
Gosling plays Roy Chutney, an affable high school student in a small Montana town where there isn't much to do except drink, play football and go to the local bar. In the beginning of the movie, he loses his father and is cut from the varsity team. The combined losses hit him very hard but he is soon recruited to play 6-man football by a local never-do-well, Gid (Morse) who has his eye on Roy. The term ""slaughter rule"" is apparently a football term where a game is lost if the opponents are too far ahead in points.
This is a fascinating and touching film about small town life and about loneliness. We're asked to accept Gid for what he may or may not be - a lonely older gay man who's only joy in life is to coach football. We're also asked to accept Roy for what he is - a teenager with a world of problems and yet no one is cutting him any slack.
The real star of this movie is Ryan Gosling. Ever since his breakthrough performance in last year's critically-acclaimed but little-seen Neo-Nazi drama, THE BELIEVER, critics have only had a chance to notice his talent in the flawed MURDER BY NUMBERS. In fact, Gosling and his co-star Michael Pitt were the only good things about the Sandra Bullock 'by-the-numbers' murder mystery.
One good way of judging a performance is to imagine if any other actor could play that role - or, how would the movie be different with someone else. In THE SLAUGHTER RULE, this is easily Gosling's best performance. Here he is, a high school student (say 17), who has to deal with his father's death, school traumas, an aloof mother, an unsympathetic girlfriend (Clea Duvall) who just wants to get out of town. His only 'father figure' is his coach who borders between being too close which in turns makes Roy worry about his own sexuality. It's an incredible emotional barrage but Gosling handles the part poignantly - as an angry teen, as a sensitive young man, and finally as someone who earns some maturity and wisdom.
David Morse, a familiar character actor, shines as Gideon, an older man with a melancholy past. His performance is a careful counterbalance to Gosling's confused and vulnerable young man. Gid is a man who has had a hard life but knows what he wants.
Two incredible and outstanding scenes in this movie (and there are many wonderful moments) - one is a line-crossing confrontation between Roy and Gid (I can say no more but everyone in the audience was hyperventilating with the tension in the air) - and the other is a smart bedroom scene between Roy and his girlfriend when he looks to reassure his masculinity but is instead taught a bracing lesson about intimacy.
Set in Montana, THE SLAUGHTER RULE also uses music to great effect - the sort of crooning that enhances the loneliness that big open spaces have. Cinematography is icy-crisp. Editing is a little rough in the beginning of the film, but overall THE SLAUGHTER RULE is a wonderful debut film for the Smith brothers and a powerful new additional to Ryan Gosling's successful transformation from child actor (MMC, Young Hercules) to mature actor. How good is Gosling? Last year, I went to vote for Jake Gyllenhaal at the IFP awards. I saw THE BELIEVER and voted for Gosling instead. He's that good!
THE SLAUGHTER RULE will unfortunately be a small indie film release, but look for it in your art house theaters and later on video. It's a wonderful experience you won't soon forget.",1041292800,53,4093,4.654696132596685

1819365,4,B00007L4LN,"""The Slaughter Rule"" is, in many ways, a less-bold cousin of ""Brokeback Mountain"" with a similar look and feel. Both films are beautifully filmed in the West and feature a theme of unrequited love. ""The Slaughter Rule"" is a coming of age story of a Roy Chutney (the gorgeous Ryan Gosling) who must deal with his Father's sudden death, being cut from the varsity football team, and is left in a dead-end town with a demanding, selfish Mother. Roy is recruited my Gid (David Morse) the Coach of a brutal six-man football squad to play QB. Roy finds success on the gridiron and in the bedroom with his girlfriend (Clea Duvall) but soon things begin to unravel with the girlfriend wants to leave town and Gid falls completely in love with Roy. Relationships break apart, slowly mend, and a bit of tragedy intervenes. Needless to say there is plenty of drama here, but the two leads are first-rate. Gosling, ever the eye candy, brings a sensitivity and depth to Roy and Morse fearlessly portrays Gid as a closeted gay man beaten down by life. Though not in the same league as ""Brokeback,"" this is still worth a look.",1296604800,2,1111,4.616161616161616

1819367,3,B00007L4LN,"When I first got my digital cable in July of 2007, this movie always seem to pop up every damn day on the Sundance channel. This movie stayed on television for two months straight, taunting me to watch it. I've liked Ryan Gosling since I saw him in Murder By Numbers and The Notebook, but I never wanted to watch this film because I'm just not into football. But after one late night in October, I finally decided to give this movie a chance.
I can't lie to you; I was lost as hell. I didn't know where the film was going or where it wanted to go. And this film had REAL Indians in it, so that was what kept me interested. So I kept watching....and kept watching....and kept watching. By the end, I was like, WTF  was that?! It seemed stupid to me. I never wanted to watch it again!
Then I realized I had to watch it again for two reasons:

1. I didn't see it from the beginning and

2. I was lying down when I was watching it, therefore I wasn't totally focused.

Damn. So I watched it later in the day because I knew it would be back on. Every time I thought I knew what would happen, something else happened. For me, this film went in too many damn directions and the ending didn't sit well with me. It didn't make much sense to me and I still came to the conclusion that I didn't want to see it again. But after watching it several times, I started to get what the film was trying to say. To this day, I still don't totally get what was supposed to be achieved with David Morse's gay/accused child molesting ways, or Tracey Two Dogs getting injured, or Roy coming to terms with whatever the hell he was supposed to come to terms with. Seems everyone had issues in this movie.
The storyline was all messed up for me, but its the actors who give this the 3/5 stars I've chosen.
David Morse for his creepy performance as a coach who is obsessed with his star player.
Ryan Gosling for his performance of a confused teenager trying to deal with the death of his father, his crazy mother, and whether or not he should get close to a coach with a horrific past.
Eddie Spears for his performance as the kid who gets beaten by his stepfather, and backs his best friend in any decision.
Everyone else seems to be a blur with no purpose but to make an already jacked up story more confusing than when it first started.
