1879201,1,B000094U3Y,"The product was not well maintained as other ""used"" DVD's I had purchased in the past.  Gave it to my special needs son as a reward and as he tried to watch it, it would not play after the first 10 mins. Had to return for refund and have a disappoint young man now.  Ordered a replacement from another seller",1412294400,,308,4.116666666666666

1879203,5,B000094U3Y,"Got the DVD for my son, but must confess, I am enjoying The Wiggles just as much as he does. I think a collection is beginning. Wish we had these guys when I was 3.",1400284800,,164,3.7142857142857144
1879204,5,B000094U3Y,Animated Wiggles good video who cares. My 10 year old son has 2 of theese because his first one is all scratced up 14.99 for this are you sirious.,1375228800,,146,4.068965517241379
1879205,5,B000094U3Y,"Both of my boys absolutely love this movie. It's different than other Wiggles shows/movies as it's an animated adventure. But the songs are catchy, and it's really cute. Highly recommended to any parent of a child who loves music or the Wiggles.",1371081600,,245,4.857142857142857
1879206,5,B000094U3Y,My kids love wiggles and it amazed my 15 month old to see them in the cartoon version. Great songs.,1253059200,,99,4.0
1879207,4,B000094U3Y,"I don't know what it is about the Wiggles that kids like so much, but both of my kids have really enjoyed them.  My son is 10 months old and sometimes, thats the only thing that can make him happy.",1229212800,,197,3.925
1879208,5,B000094U3Y,"My grandson Sean age 5 and I just love Space Dancing.  This is our third copy, one broke, and we gave the other way and decided we really wanted to have a copy again.  We would like to have another episode of Space Dancing with the new Wiggle Sam.  We love the Wiggles!!!",1169078400,,271,4.0754716981132075
1879209,5,B000094U3Y,"My kids love this movie.  We used to check it out from the library everytime we went.  When the library's copy finally broke, I decided it was time to buy our own.  The songs are cute, and my kids love to dance to it.",1168300800,,217,3.8863636363636362
1879210,5,B000094U3Y,"I was a tad bit skeptical about buying this DVD initially when I read the reviews. But I bought it anyway for my 2 year old son, who is a loyal Wiggles fan. My son loves it and watch it over and over again. He already has a wide collection of The Wiggles DVDs and count this also as one of his favorites.",1167523200,,304,3.8412698412698414
1879211,5,B000094U3Y,"I was very skeptical of this ""different"" Wiggles adventure.  My 2 year old son LOVES the Wiggles and will only watch that show.  He received this DVD as a birthday present and absolutely loves it!  Now that I have seen it a million times, I love it too!  The music is very catchy!  I definitley recommed this one!",1146873600,,313,4.327586206896552
1879212,5,B000094U3Y,"This is my all time favorite. It is totally different from all other Wiggles DVDs that I have ever seen. The story is based on an animated adventure happening inside Jeff's dream. In this adventure, they visit 3 planets on an alien ship then rock and roll their way back to earth. The reason I like this is that unlike so many children's movies, it is fun without having evil monsters or horrible tragedies. It is also weird enough to appeal to a 46 year old male like me as well as my 4 year old daughter. We have enjoyed watching this one together many times. Unfortunately, our copy has gone missing. We have the box but no DVD :-( I think my wife may have ditched it but it was good enough that I am ready to buy another copy!",1141430400,,730,4.184397163120567
1879213,4,B000094U3Y,"The first time we borrowed "" Wiggles Space Dancing"" from the library my children were younger and we pretty much concluded after the first watching that we were REALLY happy that we could take the video back.

But that was then.  Now, it's a couple of years later and WOW what a difference time makes.  My babies --now 3 and 5 years of age- are mesmerized by the video [on a lark we checked it out again]... and even I like it.

Whereas we found the animation and story annoying before, this time we found it refreshing and fun and a nice change from the real Wiggles.

Four Stars.  Cute Wiggly story line with the ever popular characters.  From our experience, a video for older Wiggles fans.",1134345600,,693,4.409448818897638
1879214,1,B000094U3Y,I don't recommend this Wiggles show at all.  It is so weird and very unlike all of the other shows we've seen.  My son usually loves the wiggles but this one is mostly animated with very few songs.  Save your money!  I'm going to try to sell our copy on ebay!,1105920000,,259,4.019607843137255
1879215,5,B000094U3Y,"For holding kids' attention, the Wiggles are worth their collective weight in fruit salad.  This is almost like ""Star Trek"" crossed with the Wiggles (at least red-shirted Murray doesn't have to worry).  Throw in Mr. Scott playing bagpipes, Spock playing the lyre and Kirk singing ""Mr. Tambourine Man""...well, maybe not.  The Wiggles' own ""Star Trek"" is good fun.",1088985600,,362,5.206896551724138
1879216,5,B000094U3Y,"I was very skeptical of this cartoon release by the Wiggles, and quite hesitent when my kid really wanted it. I will say that our family has enjoyed this release just fine. The story and cartoon format is interesting and different. It is interspersed with little ""real Wiggles"" footage. I was surprised how the story moved along even with only 6 songs. Special features of this DVD are; The making of Space Dancing, a section on characters, an audience with King Mondo, and a Return to Earth game (7 sequential questions from the story--a review format to test comprehension/memory of the story). My kids love the game (they are only 3 & 4) and strangely want to play it again and again even though it is never different! If you really like just the traditional Wiggles, I would recommend trying to borrow or rent this release for viewing first before buying it. If you're open to change and ready to see the Wiggles in something other than the standard studio production, then blast off for a fun Wiggly space adventure!!",1077840000,,1022,4.683333333333334
1879217,4,B000094U3Y,"My 16 month old daughter didn't really care for this one at first but now it seems to be one of her favorites.  She laughs at a lot of the scenes, especially the one where Captain Feathersword is trying to figure out what the space ship is.  If you don't like this one at first, give it some time.",1077494400,,297,4.016949152542373
1879218,3,B000094U3Y,"The songs are great, especially ""Eagle Rock"" -- but my two-year-old son, who hates puppets, is afraid of the computer animation because he thinks they are puppets.  He says ""I don't like puppets.  Puppets are scary"" and refuses to watch it.
I like it just fine, but some kids like my son might be freaked out by the animation.",1074038400,,326,4.508474576271187
1879219,5,B000094U3Y,"I purchased the Wiggles Space Dancing Adventure DVD as a Christmas present for my granddaughter (who is the Wiggles Number One fan), she absolute loves it.  The first day she must have watched it at least 5 times.  The video is quite enjoyable for all ages!! and very easy to follow. All songs are new with cute (animated) dances moves.  I highly recommend this DVD for any child, if they are into the Wiggles or not!",1074038400,,417,4.4605263157894735
1879220,5,B000094U3Y,"This was the first movie that had the Wiggles and their friends in animation.  It doesn't start out animated right away, because Jeff's asleep and Greg, Murray and Anthony wonder what he is dreaming about.  When the Wiggles are finally in his dream, the're all animated and stil inside Wigglehouse.
While visiting Planet Rock in Outer Space, the Wiggles and friends are invited by King Mondo to dance and sing in his rock and roll band...singing ""Eagle Rock"".  King Mondo is played by (Ross Wilson).",1073865600,,499,4.847058823529411
1879221,2,B000094U3Y,"My 2-1/2-year-old daughter is about as big a Wiggles fan as you will find.  We have seen them in concert, watch the Playhouse Disney show nearly every day, and own virtually the entire Wiggles video collection.  When we play ""pretend Wiggles,"" she is Anthony, I am Greg, and Mom is Murray.  (Jeff is always asleep.)
While she first got hooked on the early videos (noted below), she now particularly enjoys ""Wiggle Bay"" and ""Wiggly Safari.""
However, she has asked if we can return ""Space Dancing"" to Santa Claus.  She told me, ""This is not a fun DVD.""  While she enjoys the ""Eagle Rock"" song and has sat through about four viewings of this DVD now, she does not want to watch it again.
As to the DVD itself, the animation isn't too bad, the music is just so-so.  The live-action opening and closing scenes are, frankly, pretty horrible.  I watched the bonus features separately and they weren't too bad.  Not as good as the Steve Irwin interview on ""Wiggly Safari,"" though.
To the parents just being introduced to Wiggles videos, don't give up on them -- first, go purchase the older ones, specifically ""Wiggle Time"" OR ""Yummy Yummy"" OR ""Toot Toot"" OR ""Wake Up Jeff.""  Your child will thoroughly enjoy those, and will then find ""Wiggly Safari"" and the other 2002-2003 videos, which were seemingly produced for kids who are already Wiggles fans, entertaining.",1073433600,,1357,4.764957264957265
1879222,2,B000094U3Y,"As an HUGE Wiggles fan, I was extremely disappointed with this DVD.  I don't like the songs, I don't like the animation (the Wiggles look a little creapy), and I don't like the story.
On the contrary, my 4-year-old says she likes it.",1073433600,,233,4.4186046511627906
1879223,5,B000094U3Y,"The good news about The Wiggles Space Dancing is that I thought, it was a very magical Animated Adventure in most of the movie and it's the first time that the Wiggles and their producers would make a film which of course is mostly animated, including little bits of live action from begining to end.  Best of all, I liked all the songs from this new movie, including ""The Zeezap Song"", ""What's This Button For?"", ""Eagle Rock"", ""Dance Your Gloomies Away"", and ""Going Home"".",1066348800,,473,4.630952380952381
1879224,3,B000094U3Y,"As parent of kids who are big fans of the Wiggles, I was disappointed.  You get the feeling that the story was made up as they went along; it is really rather weak and dull.  My daughters love it however, and that's all that matters.  The small sampling of songs is good; that's what the Wiggles should stick to.",1063929600,,312,4.254237288135593
1879225,5,B000094U3Y,I didn't think my 3 year old would like this movie because it's animated.  However my mother-in-law bought it for her and she loves it.  We have had it for about three days and we watch it about 5 times a day.  So if your kids are Wiggle fans it's a must have for your collection.,1063065600,,280,3.9642857142857144

7989444,4,B000094U3Y,"Considered by many to be The Wiggles comeback CD, and lyrically speaking maybe one of their best to date. Murray Wiggles states in Rolling Stone, ""Many critical things were written about us, that we lost our flow, were washed up etc. We're here to let all our critics and fans know that we never left the game and that we're still capable of writing some good s***!""

One of the best comeback albums of all time!

""Well we tried to tell you so (yes we did),
But I guess you didn't know,
As the saddest story goes,
Baby, now we got the flow,
'Cause we know it from the start,
Baby, when you broke our heart,
That we had to come again,
And show you that we're with.

You lied to us,
All those times we said that we loved you,
You lied to us,
So, we're back up in the game,
(Running things like our swing),
Lettin' all the people know,
That we're back to run the show,
Cause what they didn't know was wrong,
And all the nasty things you've done,
So, baby, listen carefully,
While The Wiggles sing their comeback song...""",1424736000,,1017,4.231958762886598
