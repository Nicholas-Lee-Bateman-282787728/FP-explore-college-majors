3545317,3,B001E2PQGG,"Ok. I'm only 10 minutes into this and already I feel compelled to write something. I've never written a review of anything before, but this time is just different. The acting seems ok - so nothing to say there. When it comes to the portrayal of Hareidi (""Ultra Orthodox"") life let me clarify: this is baloney. One of the reviews mentions that the portrayal is accurate, which intrigued me. The typical Hollywood portrayal of Hareidim is so far off, I just assume that neither the actors nor the directors ever met one. An Israeli film, I thought, will probably be better. It's not. (I'm a born and bred Hareidi, and I spent some years in Israel, in Hareidi circles.) There are many subtle flaws, and a surprising amount of ridiculous ones. Example of ridiculous: The groom says ""I think this is idle women chatter"" - what???? Never heard (or heard of) a guy saying anything remotely similar - even if he thinks it. And to his fiance and her sister?! The saying ""idle women chatter"" is a misquote, a conflation of two Talmudic sayings - but don't let me bore you.
 All in all, acting aside, in just 10 short minutes this film revealed to me that the producers have no actual knowledge of the people portrayed, or of the culture and setting in which the story takes place, or they are willfully misrepresenting it (which wouldn't be surprising given the social-religious tensions in modern day Israel).
...I just finished the movie. The story-line is interesting if incredible, and the acting is superb, at times riveting. (The style of the movie is a refreshing change.)
The distorted depiction of Hareidi Jews and Judaism continues and worsens.. Nearly every aspect of the life is taken out of context. Just bear that in mind and enjoy what you can!",1483228800,2,1749,4.697068403908795

3545322,4,B001E2PQGG,"Good story of 2 young women studying at a rabbinical college in Israel and their interactions with an older, very sick woman seeking forgiveness.  Strange, offbeat drama and yet I was strangely absorbed into it.

3545326,5,B001E2PQGG,"I sympathize with those who attack this movie for letting homophobia and the dictates of conventional heterosexuality ultimately prevail. But let's face it. This position, especially in Orthodox Israel, is the dominant one by far. Having a ""happy ending"" here would have been an unrealistic copout. Similarly, I find religious ceremonies--and especially the Jewish practices which are as irrational and confining as anything dreamed up by fundamentalist Christians, Catholics, Muslims, Hindus, etc., a serious obstacle to progress and human rights. But again, it was not the intention of this film to liberate Orthodox Jewish viewers from their sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, and irrationality. What the film aimed instead was to give us an accurate portrait of beliefs and rituals as practiced in Israel today, and their effect on everyday lives. This, the movie did magnificently. Through superior directing, acting, and cinematography, The Secrets provides a portrait of Orthodox Jewish life seldom encountered anywhere else. It affected me emotionally in ways that very few movies do. It deserves 5 stars.",1478390400,15,1110,5.613095238095238

3545334,5,B001E2PQGG,"Religious views or commentary aside, I thought this film was beautifully delivered. It was refreshing to see an Israeli film addressing such challenging issues, a real breath of fresh air I can imagine for many of us women who have felt it our fundamental human right to be able to both express and enact choice despite the adversity we have often been faced with throughout the long course of history. Indeed it addresses the right we all have to express and enact personal choice in our lives despite opposition to our personal best interests.
Were it not for my own great grandfather making the choice to follow his heart and marry outside of his own orthodox Jewish religion, I would not exist, nor would my own children. There is much to be said for being true to oneself, even if that means going against the established, traditional grain, and as such this was the resounding message throughout the whole film told within the converging threads of each character's story. Very well done, and highly recommended.",1475625600,5,1018,4.822857142857143
3545335,3,B001E2PQGG,"Interesting in some ways and fairly well acted. It's hard to know how true to form it is in terms of Jewry. It's also hard to not feel like some of the themes are completely insane, but I live in a very different world, so what do I know? Mostly, it's a little over-the-top. Example: The whole premise of them helping to save someone's soul, sure I get it, but it was portrayed almost like witchcraft. And SPOILER ALERT: that an evening of erotic dry humping would make someone want to live with someone else. Again, I have a very different life, but geeezz... really??",1474243200,2,569,4.428571428571429
3545336,2,B001E2PQGG,This was a very slow moving movie,1473984000,,33,3.857142857142857
3545337,5,B001E2PQGG,"Only a film can instantly transport the viewer into another world and belief system.  I can say without hesitation that this is one of the most moving films I have seen in years.

The principal character is Noemi, a studious and beautiful young woman brought up in a fundamentalist sect in Israel.  She is extremely tightly wound, holding back her emotion as she prepares to enter into a marriage with her Rabbi father's closest student.  In every circumstance, it seems, she can quote scripture and provide a proper interpretation strictly in keeping with her concept of religion.  Her judgments, particularly of herself, are as harsh as the austerity of her mind and her utter lack of feeling for her fiancee.  But the recent death of her mother makes her hesitate and, with great difficulty, she gains permission from her father to take a year for religious study in a women's retreat.

There, she meets Michelle, a rebellious immigrant from France who is full of life and the courage to do what she thinks is right.  Noemi is at first repelled, then as they attempt to aid a dying French woman, Anouk (the amazing Fanny Ardant), she comes to see that she has found a great friend, the kind of kindred spirit that you are lucky to find a few times in life.  To help the woman, Noemi researches deep into Jewish mystical tradition, finding bizarre rituals of purification that they hope will reconcile her with God.  At the same time, the two younger women explore their sexuality, with some surprising outcomes.  During the time, the tragic story of Anouk is slowly revealed.

Once what they are doing for Anouk is discovered, they face opposition from traditionalists.  Nonetheless, they complete the ritual when they can.  In the meantime, life moves on in ways that I should not describe in order to avoid spoilers.  Needless to say,  it turns out that Michelle is more traditional than Noemi.  Though deeply wounded, Noemi finally finds the courage to confront her emotions - to allow herself to feel them, including her rage and grief, but also love - and to choose a new path in life.  It is astonishingly beautiful and moving, ambiguous when it comes to what it means about religion.

There are many wonderful additional characters, all as superbly acted.  Noemi's fiancee is at turns righteous and sour, confused by what she is experiencing and, in spite of being her devout father's favorite pupil, comes off as spiteful and less holy than other characters, thinking only of himself and the face of his community.  There is also Michael, a musician that Michelle meets who is as full of life as she is.  They have a hilarious encounter in a restaurant at which Noemi laughs for the first time in the film, a moving and completely believable moment as her emotions finally began to burst forth.  The ending is at turns sad and beautiful, just like life.

Though I am an atheist, I enjoyed every detail of this film, from the Kabbalistic rituals to Noemi's defiant courage and discovery of who she really is.  I think it is a first rate portrayal of youth in a completely alien landscape.  It left me in awe.",1473984000,,3118,4.727777777777778

I have not seen it because I really do not understand what they are saying.  I wish I could return the download.  Not sure how it works with movies and videos.

3545424,4,B001E2PQGG,"1 star less for not showing what happens to Naomi and her career after she gets her own apartment, not to mention what happens to her love life.

I definitely enjoyed watching this film, and it even brought tears to my eyes towards the end, however I do have one complaint. There was never a true conclusion to the story, IMHO, with Naomi. Yes, the story was finished on one level and set up to start the next chapter, but there was never a next chapter.

I agreed with the ending, and maybe, that was the only ending, but I could have wished for a different ending. Relationships work, when both partners are of the same sexual orientation. I thought that Naomi was quite mature with her own feelings and in touch with them. I liked how the writer wrote the scene, when she woke up the following morning. I do agree with what Naomi said at the end, when she asked a very poignant question, namely if what they have is not normal. The movie was filmed in 2006, but does ring true today (July 2015).

Personally, I disagree that Naomi and Michelle violated rules to visit a friend dying in the hospital. Wrong would be to not visit the person. Also, Naomi, through this action made peace with her own mother's death, as she finally was able to release some of her own pain. That scene really touched me. The headmistress said that they gave food was insulting.

I looked up the actress, who played Naomi, now 9-years older, and she was born in Moscow, Russia, which surprised me a bit. She did not look Russian to me.

I should deduct a point for no continuation of the story. I for one, want to know if she becomes a rabbi (conservative? reform?) Significant other? Relationship with her family? Is she dead?

I guess the one true question determining whether or not I liked the film is would I watch the film again. The answer is a resounding yes, but that would not change the ending or continue the story.",1436054400,3,1908,4.421652421652421

I always read other people's comments before watching a movie, and although others have said the ending is horrible, I went ahead and watched the movie. Although it was a good movie, well worth my time, and I do not regret my emotional investment in it, the movie falls apart at the very last 10-15 minutes. There is no reason for the movie to end the way it does but for homophobia. The very last scene, when the girls dance and laugh together, is the worst part of the movie.

If you are looking for a ""lesbian"" move to watch, don't waste your time (or money if you do not have Amazon Prime)! This movie does have a pretty good storyline, and the acting wasn't too bad. For more details on feminism and making difficult choices in an Orthodox Jewish culture, I would suggest reading some of the other reviews which do a thorough job at that (I don't want to be redundant, and I am not Jewish so I can't really speak on that). I do agree that the ending was a little disappointing. (Spoiler alert)  Lesbian, or not, if you got your heart broken by the love of you life it is quite doubtful that you would attend the wedding of this person and forgive them for choosing (and marrying) someone else. I guess that is why this is a movie! If you are Jewish and don't mind a some-what progressive school of though, you may enjoy this one.",1428969600,,945,4.279329608938547

After watching the movie, it's awesome, I'm in love with Ania Bukstein (Naomi) character, especially when she said ""I'm not like you, I am not a coward"", inspires me so much.

But, This film somehow showed me how to be Brave and strong like Naomi, and the art of Letting her go (Letting Michelle go) and Let her be happy with her choice, her determination.

I really hope if there will be a sequel for this film.

Ania Bukstein deserve an award for her performance in this film.

The film is a character study of a variety of people from the two main characters to a whole host of personality types within this community where tradition dictates virtually all behavior and thought. . There is a remarkable attention to detail and a menu of different players in a world frozen in time. Each uses the existing rules and regulation to their own personal needs.  It keeps the viewers interest from beginning to end and I think it is one of the best films I have seen that has entered into the orthodox community. The main theme of love of two young women is a bit on the edge but a reality in this day and age that no longer must ""stay in the closet"". Deprived of all heterosexual contact I am not surprised that they experimented in this area. Interestingly, they use the religion and its writings to rationalize that it is not a sin, although they obviously feel guilty about their intimacy.

3545493,4,B001E2PQGG,"In The Secrets, 2 brilliant young women discover their own voices in a repressive orthodox culture where females are forbidden to sing, let alone speak out. Naomi, the studious, devoutly religious daughter of a prominent rabbi, convinces her father to postpone her marriage for a year so that she might study at a Jewish seminary for women in the ancient Kabalistic seat of Safed.

Naomi's quest for individuality takes a defiant turn when she befriends Michelle, a free-spirited and equally headstrong fellow student. When the pair encounters a mysterious, ailing foreigner with a disturbing past named Anouk (Fanny Ardant) they begin a risky journey into forbidden realms.

In the hopes of easing her suffering, Naomi and Michelle secretly lead Anouk through a series of Kabalistic cleansing rituals. The process opens up overwhelming new horizons for the girls who find themselves caught between the rigid male establishment they grew up in, and the desire to be true to themselves, no matter the cost.",1391644800,,1005,5.197530864197531

I thought at least would have a similar ending to The Graduate and whisk away together leaving the husband to be behind; after all, according to this man he knew his soon to be wife loved the other woman more than him but still chose to go ahead with it; pretty foolish I believe.  However, even if they switched endings, this movie could never remotely compare the fabulous past movie The Graduate which was wonderful from beginning to end.  This movie was dull, dark very depressing.  I cry every time I see Goldie Hawn in Butterflies Are Free yet in this movie not a tear shed because the characters are unbelievable.. the two women who were supposed to be in love (I guess) had virtually no chemistry together.  The French woman dying was a strange subplot I never got into fully; I did find it moving when the woman thought her son finally forgave her after all these years and it turned out  to be an illusion.  Even so, that couldn't save this movie from disaster.

The traditionalism underlying a revolution in feeling, compassion, love and coming of age is really intriguing.  I enjoyed watching how this film portrays spirituality, culture and intelligence.  Watching the women in their religious environment was educational and the music and singing was moving.  The scenes introducing the two supporting roommates also has a nice edge of lightheartednes and fun which invites the viewer into the movie.

The beginning of the movie at Naomi's mom's wake established sound character development for Naomi, the main actor and intelligent seminary student.  The middle and end of the movie are really believable and kept me interested.  I really liked the dynamic of Naomi and Michelle's growth and development as they assist the dying Anouk with her concerns, issues and loneliness.  The 1 and 1/2 affectionate scenes (no sex) with Naomi and Michelle is also very realistic.  I loved the dynamic of the musician boyfriend and how he fit into the plot.  Although it's not a ""perfect"" ending, it is a great, realistic and believable ending.

I would've given 5 stars for fine acting, cinematography, originality, evolution, inspiration and believability, but I hold out for the cryptic nature of some of the rituals for Anouk, the way that Naomi and Michelle got their roommates involved with Anouk's affairs, and wondering how Naomi afforded her own apartment.

3545524,4,B001E2PQGG,"""The Secrets"" is a film about the many ways the ties of love can be tested, and about how boundaries can and, sometimes, cannot be crossed.  It is also about courage, the courage to look within at one's naked self and, in the interest of justice and equality, to defy norms, or to try or even hope to change them.

If this sounds pretty deep for a film about lesbian love, that's because this film, like ""The Gymnast,"" also supposed to be about lesbian love, is really about so much more than that, and yet, in both films, that sensual quality, once awakened, is subtly shared between the principal characters, simmering at the core, though, in ""The Secrets,"" it's the purity of love that triumphs, as might be expected for a story that begins at a wake and ends at a wedding.

This Israeli film, nominated for eight Israeli Academy Awards, is set in Tel Aviv and Safed, Israel, and deep within the culture of Orthodox Judaism, with dialogue in Hebrew, and some French, subtitled in English.  But, though the religious culture frames the story, it does not overpower to detract from the human challenges and circumstances in which the story is wrapped, and which are compelling enough to hold the viewers' interest.  The subtitles, however, are faster than usual and will prohibit taking in the full measure of the settings and actors, except for speed-readers.  But that is about the only technical flaw worth mentioning, and it is negated with the pause and re-wind buttons on the remote.

Avi Nesher's direction (who also co-produced, produced the music and, with Hadar Galron, co-wrote the screenplay) is, like ""The Gymnast,"" without clumsiness in the sexual confrontation and, save one instance described below, is flawless, if the standard for that, and an excellent screenplay, are believable and wholly natural character portrayals by the cast, which is topped by Israeli beauties, Ania Bokstein, who plays ""Naomi,"" the devout student of Kabbalah, and Michal Shtamler, who plays the rebellious, confrontational, ""Michelle,"" the foil to Naomi.

The story centers around the two young, Israeli women, polar opposites, as they struggle to adapt to one another in a Jewish women's seminary, where one girl, Naomi, chose to be, while the other was sent by her parents, quite against her will.  It would be too much to say more, other than the relationship between the two girls develops around circumstances of adultery, murder, and self-torture, which should be enough to lure the more basest among possible viewers, though it must be said that the blood shed in the film is slight, as is the clothing, though what is revealed there is not at all so slight in its beauty.  And, there is some X-rated imagery, missed by the ratings board, made less than fleeting only through the use of those trusty rewind and pause controls.

It is in the dramatic interplay of the two opposed leads, Naomi and Michelle, where the film stumbles through its greatest weakness, which is eerily similar to, again, ""The Gymnast,"" where the principle weakness was the swift transformation of the character playing the protagonist's husband.  Now, to explain this further, spoilers follow, but for those who wish a verdict in order to decide whether to watch:  do, because as with ""The Gymnast,"" the weakness of this film is not fatal to the objectives of the story, the involvement of the viewer, or the film's value as worthy entertainment.

In drama, the turn of the story is expressed through the changes imposed upon the principal characters, and in ""The Secrets,"" it is Michelle's character who seems too quickly to change, from confrontational opposite of Naomi to her bed-hugging friend and lover.  Though it is likely that the interaction of the girls, in their mission to provide service to a dying ex-con, ""Anuk,"" played with a portrayal of wrenching pain and need by French actress, Fanny Ardant, would provide the kind of bonding necessary to flip the extreme, initial characterization of Michelle, the film does not take us fully through the journey that transformation would require, though it is made clear that the transformation hinges, in great part, upon Michelle's growing respect for Naomi's intellect and spiritual devotion.

In the end, the hushed confidences in ""The Secrets"" are hardly worth whispering about as the paths of shared turmoil and pain end in something that is more enduring than romance and, well, worth shouting about.",1318550400,3,4441,4.981081081081081
3545525,2,B001E2PQGG,"I'm glad I didn't pay money for this film, having only checked it out at the library. Beautifully acted film; unfortunately, the ending completely negated any value it had for me. I wish filmmakers would stop wasting our time with more bad movies that pair lesbian women with bisexual women, or characters that sacrifice their true love for societal approval, as this film does. Such a tiresome theme. The ending of this film was not only disappointing, but stale and rediculous. I always feel so sad when I watch women give up their true love, for valuing external approval more than their own. What a high price to pay!

Fanny Ardant plays a very interesting woman who lost her family due to a murder she was accused of committed. This puts the religion on trial and makes a romantic film to ask questions about theology and philosophy.

3545531,5,B001E2PQGG,"I'm so surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie.  It really was like having a good strong cup of coffee in the morning after expecting a mediocre brew.  As with the strong coffee, it awakens, it stimulates and it prepares one for the challenges of the day.

In ""The Secrets"" two beautiful young Jewish girls face the challenges of friendship, family and faith while trying to find their place in a male dominated orthodox Israel.  I enjoyed watching the transformation that takes place in the girls and so many of the characters. It was like watching a revolution of beliefs and ideas tangling over a pure sparkling soul.

If you come to this movie thinking its all about lesbianism you'll be sadly mistaken.  If all you get out of it is a lesson in lesbianism you've sadly cheated yourself.  ""The Secrets"" embodies so much more than just a love story although there are multiple love stories in this movie.  It reiterates old sayings like ""question authority"" and ""seek thee truth"" to young people as they begin on a journey toward adulthood.

Lastly, this movie is about redemptive truths.  Finding God and not cowardly turning away from the truth.  Its a movie that us men should see in order to be shaken and reawakened to the truths about women and the roles ""we"" assign them in our societies.  All women are beautiful and deserving of more than we men can ever give them.

3545535,4,B001E2PQGG,"I have always wondered what being a woman is like in different cultures and countries. I can imagine most of it from what I grasp through literature and movies, but deep down I know that there is no way to know unless you live it in your own skin. Being a woman is not easy, even in the western world. In most industrialized countries women still earn less than men, for example. An on top of that being a lesbian complicates matters for some women. But when you see movies that portray realities like this one, you get to see that we are not so different after all. We have a lot in common, no matter what country we live in, or what preference we have. The emotions, fears, pleasure, desires, doubts, dreams, faith, drama, beliefs, etc, are common ground for most of us.

So, if you are curious as to what being a woman, and coming of age is like in a different part of the world, this great movie gives you a good insight of what it is like in this Jewish community. The plot reveals a lot about how their society is structured and how they relate to other issues such as sexuality, religion, emotions, human contact, etc. Their religious beliefs rule and guide their public, private and spiritual lives, so to speak. They are taught from a young age how to behave, dress, live, and think. Which of course allows conflict to arise among the leading characters, since what they feel is not exactly what they are expected to feel and do. However I was very pleased by the bravery of one of the two girls, who decides to be honest and truthful with who she is.

There is a lot of drama. Good dialogues. And the Hebrew language is a pleasure to listen to, it's such a beautiful language phonetically speaking. The directing is great, and the acting is excellent, and it has a lot of suspense. This is definitely one of the best lesbian movies I've ever seen. Fully recommend it if you enjoy not so commercial and foreign cinema.",1267056000,4,1927,4.410112359550562
3545536,5,B001E2PQGG,"Unlike certain other movies one might think of (such as Kadosh and A Price Above Rubies), this film very sensitively and accurately portrayed Hareidi life.  In spite of the crazies who grab all of the headlines with antics such as spraying bleach on women wearing pants and short skirts or violently protesting at the Jerusalem Intel because it's open on Shabbos, the reality is that most Hareidim are more along the lines of the people shown in this film.  These characters are multi-faceted, and part of a community that is very warm, loving, and loyal to its own, even though certain of the characters test those limits of loyalty because of how they ultimately don't quite fit in.  After her mother dies, the scholarly Naomi asks her father, who hasn't balked at teaching her Torah and Talmud, to postpone her marriage to Michael so she can study in seminary for a year.  After initial hesitation, he relents and agrees to let Naomi study at a women's seminary in the holy and mystical city of Tzfat.  This seminary turns out to be run by a Hareidi feminist hoping to provide higher education to young women and empower them in that way.  As the headmistress tells Naomi in one scene, as Orthodox women their liberation is a lot more difficult than and different from the liberation of non-Orthodox women, because they have to work within certain strictures and change things much slower.  Naomi is put with three roommates--Sheine, whom she meets on the bus; Sigi, a ba'alat teshuvah (newly religious) who later kind of goes off of the deep end (as sometimes happens with ba'alei teshuvah, going from one extreme to the other without enough time for slow transition), and the much more progressive and secular Michelle (Michal), who didn't go to the seminary of her own choosing but because her French parents wanted her to.  The unlikely pair of Naomi and Michelle are soon bonding after being assigned to deliver food to a dying outcast Frenchwoman, Anouk, with a dark secret in her past and a desire to make amends within herself and with God before she passes on.  Though traditionally one must be at least 40 years old, male, and married before starting to study Kabbalah, Naomi begins constructing a Tikun based on the teachings of the Arizal so that Anouk can achieve her hoped-for repentance.  As the story progresses, Naomi also starts to have second thoughts about her upcoming marriage to Michael and instead falls in love with Michelle, who herself has caught the eye of the endearing Yanki, a clarinetist who, like Naomi and Michelle, also doesn't quite fit into Hareidi society.

Each character is portrayed so vividly that they come across like real people instead of stock characters or people acting out a script.  I also liked how it took awhile for the story to unfold and for the characters to develop, even though my boyfriend didn't like how Naomi and Michelle didn't do anything physically until the film was about halfway through.  Too many modern American movies are so predictable, with the viewer knowing within 15 minutes what's going to happen and who's going to end up with whom, but in this film, we don't immediately know what's going to happen, like if Naomi and Michelle will decide to live together as a lesbian couple, if Naomi will marry Michael or break the engagement, if Michelle and Yanki will end up together, what Anouk's backstory is and if she'll achieve peace and a sense of atonement, if the seminary will accept or disapprove of Michelle and Naomi's delving into Kabbalah.  The story also illustrates, as the headmistress said, just how difficult it is to be female, feminist, and frum.  As someone who's not Orthodox, it's easy to say they should just affiliate with Masorti (Conservative) or Liberal/Progressive (Reform) Judaism, or at least find a liberal Modern Orthodox community.  This is their entire world, life, culture, identity.  They can't just leave the only world they know how to exist in and relate to, even if they do test the outer limits of what's considered acceptable within that world.  Someone as brilliant as Naomi faces an uphill battle in her desire to become a rabbi, unlike a woman in a non-Orthodox denomination who faces no opposition anymore to applying to rabbinical school.  A lesbian relationship might not be prohibited by the Torah (as Naomi points out, it's never even mentioned in there) and only have a relatively mild Talmudic censure, but it's also not exactly easy to live as a fully frum person who is out of the closet.  Yanki is a great person, but because he chose to be a klezmer musician instead of a rabbi or studying in kollel full-time his entire life, he isn't respected as much as someone like Michael.  The film also leaves a number of questions to contemplate, as opposed to tying everything up with neat hospital corners and a stereotypical happy Hollywood ending.",1265414400,28,4873,4.8329326923076925
3545537,1,B001E2PQGG,"Gee - an Israeli movie called ""Secrets"" made by a secular person about an intelligent religious girl in the oh-so-oppressive ultra-orthodox world.  How ever could we have guessed that she would go from being a total square to an angry lesbian?  The random addition of a sickly non-Jewish woman looking for forgiveness in Tzfat (uh, what?) upped the angsty factor.

3545539,5,B001E2PQGG,"Call it an acquired taste.  First of all I am Jewish and I have spent a considerable amount of time studying its religious texts...Thus a film about the process of analyzing scripture or the Talmud is likely to find favor in my eyes whereas others might gravitate towards science fiction or romantic comedy.

I thought ""The Secrets"" was one of the best dramas to arrive from Israel...but it is not in the mold of a holocaust memory film, a war film, or an exploration of ethnic tensions.

The movie is about personal choices, moral choices, partner choices. Ostensibly  it revolves around a story of Noemi, a very bright young woman  - a daughter of an important rabbi in the Orthodox community - who asks to study for one more year rather than rush into a marriage dictated by her father,

She first approaches problems as a ""know-it-all"", and then discovers that others have answers, even to tough religious and moral questions.  Through that process, she develops a deep, let's say, intimate relationship with another young woman, Michal, in the Orthodox seminary.  But this movie is not really about a same-sex relationship as it it about making choices...some of those choices carry great personal baggage and some of those choices are entirely unorthodox.

All the performances are top notch.  Two scenes stick out in my mind.  In the first, Noemi is deep in the library analying the Talmud to find a way to help a troubled, mortally sick stranger repair her broken relationship to God. She does so even when the traditional rabbis have all but given up on the stranger. The second scene involves the prospective groom of Michal - a pharmacist who moonlights as a klezmer musician - who reveals great courage (and tolerance) in asking Noemi to come to his upcoming wedding. When he makes that request he knows that Noemi has been intimate with his bride.  (How many us, religious or not, orthodox or not, could do that!)

A final remark.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I don't experience the ending of the film as negative.  Just the opposite. In summary, ""The Secrets"" is not only an excellent movie, it is a meaningful one.",1243296000,92,2137,4.769021739130435
3545540,5,B001E2PQGG,"THE SECRETS (HA-SODOT) is not only a deeply satisfying film as a story that involves the viewer at every level, but it is also a reminder that certain customs/prejudices of inequality between the sexes still exist.  Written with poetic distinction by Hadar Gairon and Avi Nesher (who also sensitively directs the film), THE SECRETS brings us into a world few know and even fewer understand. And it informs us of cultural differences while telling a griping and fascinating story in a way few films are able to imitate.

Israel, despite the enlightened quality of life the Jews enjoy, remains a place where the division between men and women may have been erased when it comes to military obligations, but where  the orthodox  religion  very decidedly separates the roles of male and female.  Noemi (Ania Bukstein) wishes to 'postpone' her obligated marriage in order to study spiritual matters at the seminary in the ancient Kabalistic seat of Safed.  She convinces her father to allow her to study for a year and then return to fulfill her feminine obligation to become a wife and mother. Once enrolled at the seminary Noemi becomes friends with another young 'rebel' girl Michelle (Michal Shtamier) and as their friendship grows they discover a French woman Anouk (Fanny Ardant), apparently living a life of poverty supported by the kindness of the seminary despite her history of imprisonment for murder.  Noemi and Michelle study the secrets of the Kabal and become determined to administer the cleansing rituals for Anouk who is dying from cancer.  Noemi and Michelle bond and become emotionally and physically committed to each other.  Once they have administered the cleansing to Anouk the two girls are expelled from the seminary.  They part ways with the hope that they will be together on the outside. Yet once back in the milieu of their society, old customs and rules alter their relationship: tradition conquers.

Director Avi Nesher unfolds this delicate story with restraint and taste and encourages the viewer to identify with each of the characters, no matter whether they are male or female, confined in traditional viewpoints or enlightened.  Every actor in this large cast is excellent, but the work by Ardant, Bukstein and Shtamier is exemplary.  This is a very fine film deserving of a wide audience,  In Hebrew and French with subtitles.

3545542,3,B001E2PQGG,"I bought this film based on supposed lesbian relationship discussed in the teaser.  As I watched this well crafted and acted film, I was swept away by the intense storyline of a young woman pursuing her dream to become a rabbi, despite the misogynistic culture/religion of Orthodox Judaism.  I also enjoyed the storyline of the two young women in a feminist seminary trying to give peace to an older woman who was dying of cancer, and had been rejected by the town.  However, what really killed this movie for me was the very unhappy ending of the two female leads, who were supposedly in love.  I have literally seen dozens of films and tv shows where two women who are in love can never lively happily ever after at the end of the show and this film fit that bitter and homophobic cliche to a 'T.'  The romance between the two women might not have been important to anyone else but it was very important to me.  I cried at the end of this movie because I was so bitterly disappointed.",1242518400,153,986,4.419889502762431

so i had really high hopes for this movie but the end just killed me.
for once the whole story didn't revolve around their forbidden love between the two girls, which is refreshing.  the progression of the bond forming between them was well paced and didn't felt forced at all. i was ready to give this movie a 5/5 ratin but then i realized the whole point of this movie

was to give a very clear message to women.  if you are smart, independent, compassionate, loving and caring  beware! smart women end up alone, so be stupid and you'll be happy. do what michelle did. that's all women need. .. a MAN!  even if your religion don't strictly forbid love between two women, you'll end up alone and bitter because no matter what how clever and beautiful you are, you are nothing without a dick between your legs..

that was the message Ladies.
Still, i can't complain about the acting (Ania Bukstein was BRILLIANT and boy is she a sight for sore eyes! ).

some things were predictable like that little rat betraying them time and time again, eager to proof her devotion at any cost.
what pissed me off the most is that they could have ended the movie on a good note,  but threw their only chance away. why not have the guy serve as their  proverbial ""beard""? Sweet JC, it was RIGHT THERE!!! that would have made this movie EPIC

instead 1 hour and 15 minutes of an effing good story was completely wasted in the last 15 minutes. why even bother making it in the first place?",1525046400,,1497,4.446886446886447

I've seen several movies of LGBT theme and tend to think perhaps they are all done by homophobic people because they never get a chance at a happy ending. Even though I am straight, I've seen the pattern and find it offensive. Either one dies or one decides that going away is best, or one decides, as in this case, that a straight life is a better option, even leaving both lovers heartbroken.  However.. the acting was superb.  The story was fresh and new and deep.  Though I had to have the subtitles for the Hebrew and quite a bit of the French, I still found the script to be excellent.  Were it not for the lame lame lame ending, easily 5 star movie.  But I just can't get past the unnecessarily morbidly depressing ending.  I was rooting for these gals and to have it end as such a turd was a real let down.
