8090328,1,B000BP59ZU,20 minutes long if that. This is what you consider a documentary! Shot from a camcorder this is a true joke and amazingly you try to sell this as a documentary. The sound is horrible the interview is horrible and it looks as though I was watching a homemade (movie) in the silent era before film or video technology were discovered. A complete waste of money and time. Being a huge Ted Williams fan this would have turned him over in his grave! He would have never allowed you to put this out i can assure you. Take this off the market or Amazon needs to look at this. I will be reporting this to Amazon as well. An embarrassing joke to say the least!,1133568000,26,651,4.216
