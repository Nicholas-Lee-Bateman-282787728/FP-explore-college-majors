7555701,5,B018V1ZY3M,I won't repeat what everyone else is saying. Some of the photography just blew me away and the musical score is one of the best.  And they did it without making it nearly as gruesome as what it could have been.,1511308800,,210,4.121951219512195
7555702,5,B018V1ZY3M,"This is one of the best animal documentaries I've ever seen.  The footage they some how manage to shoot is nothing less than extraordinary.  It doesn't hurt to be narrated by Mr. David Attenborough.  He has the perfect voice for these types of documentations.  If your reading this it means your on the fence about buying it.  Do yourself a favor and get it.  When you get it, put it on your big screen, crank up the volume, sit back and be amazed.",1510358400,4,448,4.337349397590361

7555707,5,B018V1ZY3M,One of the best documentaries from BBC.  Excellent footage with crisp images and a superb music score accompanying every scene and driving emotions with each note.

7555712,5,B018V1ZY3M,"Netflix streaming 4k HDR with DD+ sound on my Premiere+/BD900/LS10500 system.

I have to say this is better than Planet Earth 2 in HDR.

The PQ is great, every little detail comes to life, the DD+ sound is immersive, more so than PE2.

The adventures from Planet Earth 2 don't come even close the intensity and dramatism of this series.

7555743,5,B018V1ZY3M,"This film series is the pinnacle of UK produced natural history programmes, in my opinion, capturing amazing dramas between predator and prey often resulting in the escape of the prey. Successful or not there is always beauty  in the Chase. It is a fitting memento to my  life 'shared' with Sir David Attenborough from Zoo Quest on.",1483833600,,332,4.807017543859649
7555744,5,B018V1ZY3M,"Utterly amazing footage.  This is all predator stalking and hunting prey.  For 6 episodes.

Incredible visual quality.  You see sure kills turn into upsets, and seeming failures become successful takedowns.  Of course there's also some more straightforward kills and failures, but this series really gives you some insight into how hard it is for some predators.  Sometimes, when they get desperate, there's footage of really bizarre strategies to try and get food.

I've seen a lot of nature documentaries, but I think this is going to be my favorite.",1482278400,4,552,5.134831460674158

7555768,3,B018V1ZY3M,"Incredible HD footage, once again brilliantly shot through the BBC wildlife camera lens. Beautifully shot. Worth ever cent of the HD purchase price. My only issue with it, is that the title suggests animal ""action"" as it were, i.e. the hunt/kill. And it is just that, except each episode isn't filled with it. With the title of the series you expect tons of meat eating predators hunting on the African plane. But this documentary series focuses more on the hunting failures, and not the successes. Tons of footage of predators hunting...and failing. To illustrate the reality of the hunt, and the fact that for example the cheetah will only be successful in 1 out of 20 hunts, this series shows 25 minutes of the cheetah's failed attempts, one after the other, and then finally a 3-5 minute shot of a cheetah's successful kill. A bit strange, but if you've seen any of the other BBC nature series, you know that the filming and cinematography are more 'poetic' and less 'national geographic.'",1476316800,,993,4.812865497076023
7555769,5,B018V1ZY3M,"This is a great nature video and everyone seems to love this narrator. I'm not sure how young children will handle the brutality of the predators in nature. But, the quality and content is well covered and narrated. Get it.",1475971200,3,223,4.6
7555770,5,B018V1ZY3M,"I actually bought this more for my cat than myself.  She is enthralled with David Attenborough, and watches very attentively.  Thankfully, I find the series very informative and well done.  If you have a cat who happens to like Attenborough like I do, or you're just interested in nature documentaries, this is a series well worth your time and money.",1475539200,2,351,4.816666666666666

Even my 20 year old daughter became addicted to watching it! I cant wait and pray they do another season! Its a MUST watch show! Its jaw dropping, and so educational.

7555775,4,B018V1ZY3M,"I love the BBC nature studies with David Attenborough, and this is one of the best.  There are truly incredible close-up views of all manner of beasts, from killer whales to spiders, trying to get their dinner.  Obviously the cameramen have the best equipment, but even so they must have endured an enormous amount of hard work in uncomfortable conditions, patient waiting, and frequent frustration to photograph these scenes.  Also, with Blu-ray high definition the scenes of jungles and arctic ice floes are often very beautiful.
So why do I give it only four stars?  I have one complaint that prospective customers should be aware of.  Every DVD and Blu-ray disk has several minutes of garbage that you have to sit through before you can get to what you want to watch.  Fast-forward is disabled and you have to just sit through it.  These disks are no exception; there is the usual stupid warning about copying, institutional advertising from the BBC, advertisements of other disks they'd like you to buy, and so on.  But why do I complain, since all disks have this?  Because these Blu-ray disks have disabled the feature that lets the player remember your place when you turn it off.  Each disk has four 50-minute episodes.  You probably will not watch them all at once.  It would be nice if you could leave the disk in the machine and the next time you turn it on, automatically start in the place where you left off.  Most disks can do that, but the BBC decided not to permit it here.  So you will have to sit through all the same garbage each time.  Why?  Ask the BBC.",1474848000,37,1576,4.594982078853047
7555776,1,B018V1ZY3M,how many more shows about animals killing for food?  we do it also as humans but we hide it,1474675200,,91,3.789473684210526
7555777,5,B018V1ZY3M,"I am a fan of all these BBC/ Attenborough nature docs, and for my money they are the most impressive use of High Definition imagery.  This one is not just equal to Life, Africa, Frozen Planet, and Planet Earth, but perhaps even a touch better, for two main reasons:

1. The camera moves these filmmakers use have gotten more sophisticated.  Dolly shots and tracking shots make dramatic, but seamless, presentations of these animals.

2. The theme of a hunt gives this series more narrative thrust than the others.  There is now a good deal of suspense added to the WOW factor of the images.

The images of the victim prey animals are handled tastefully, neither sanitizing nor gratuitously exploiting the death scenes.  Like always, they indulge in a bit of latent anthropomorphism, but not too much, and they aren't silly about it like Disney's nature docs often are.",1474588800,7,868,4.824324324324325
7555778,5,B018V1ZY3M,"Attenborough remains the best in the business - impeccable photography with a cinematic experience better than just about anything in theaters. Every episode stretches the capabilities of your blu ray player. There is a fantastic African wild dog hunt! The last episode covers how some of their features were made, and you learn about wildlife conservation and just how difficult some of these shots were. The soundtrack is great as well, though the soaring strings and trumpets has resulted in one speeding ticket already.",1473897600,9,523,5.238095238095238
7555779,5,B018V1ZY3M,"This is def one of the most amazing series in the realm of nature and animals. The photography, detail, and beauty of the creatures on their home turf is nothing short of stunning. No CGI here, just natural and unforgettable shots(after shots after shots...). My favorite is the underwater episode. To see the sunlight shimmering from above and thru the water while birds, sharks, whales, and tuna all feast on a swirling mass of minnows is nothing short of breathtaking. And the series is FULL of surprises as far as sudden incidents that occur. Talk about timing w/having the cameras where they need to be at one specific moment.  And while the title infers a hunt as far as searching out food and whatnot, there is a heavy part of it that also seems to show in some detail about the mating and mating process.  This is just fascinating all around, and again--the detail cannot be stressed enough. The shot of the polar bear looking down an ice hole from below(in the water, some ways down....)for food is one of many things that will bring a smile to your face, as well as the inevitable question of 'how did they do that?'. Every creature is shown in it's full detailed beauty(the hair on the penguins, for example...), and I find it even more deplorable that people actually kill these animals after seeing this. It is a whole other world this show has taken us to and shown us. And while nature stuff has been done before(some quite well...), I would have to say that this series takes it to a new level altogether. Well worth it, and well worth the many repeat viewings that are sure to follow. Some stuff is even cool for kids, but I would preview what to show them first. Bloody at times, but the good far outweighs the bad in that sense. Seeing seals rubbing their noses together balances the grimmer stuff out.
Quite a find, and even something 'non-nature watchers' would even find very intriguing. Brilliant, colorful stuff!!!!!! Better than a lot of Hollywood movies nowadays too for sure :^)",1473552000,22,2005,4.629213483146067

Well, when my family went to actually watch it, we found that it was coded to the UK, and that in order to view it, I would have to buy it its own designated DVD player. *sad face* and all that jazz. But because I opened it, and it was obviously shipped from over seas, I am just going to have to eat this useless copy. It may be great, but I'll never know.",1520985600,,531,3.7837837837837838
