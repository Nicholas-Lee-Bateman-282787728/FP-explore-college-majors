3916698,5,B002EBRFCY,"This Godard film has been described as a summation of his previous concerns (from the start of his career to the mid-60s). It broke new ground, deconstructing genres and reconstituting them in this almost cubistic, free-form masterpiece. Thriller elements, philosophical inquiries, musings, musical numbers, romance,political asides, essays--they all merge and then explode. Raoul Coutard's cinematography and the music of Bassiak all contribute to the film's myriad felicities. At the center is the incomparable duo of Jean Paul Belmondo (in his best performance since ""Breathless"") and Anna Karina, the muse of Godard and the New Wave. Godard has pursued his original vision to the letter, with uncompromising passion. The Criterion Collection DVD is a must-have. Restored color. Better subtitles. Lots of extras.",1205193600,,815,5.743801652892562
3916699,5,B002EBRFCY,"...straight to the current interview with Anna Karina found on disc 2 of this set. Anna now looks like the female equivalent of the way Keith Richards looks nowadays, and talks like him too for that matter..all liquor soaked and head tossing. It's really uncanny. This will almost squash all your passion and longing vision that you have for her. Almost. For, aside from the main feature (disc 1) we are chauferred back in time via several mini-featurettes contained on the 2nd disc. ""Godare, L'amour, la Poesie"", a fifty minute documentary chronicling Godard's life and films with Karina is worth the price of this set. Here, we learn and understand the man that Godard was, what his films meant to him and how he met and worked with and used and loved and fell out of with the singular Anna Karina.
Her face........her face, her hair, her lips, her tall slender figure clothed in reds and soft blue, and the black and white film clips from the period, restore the magnetic allure that will captivate any man from any decade. There are two black and white interviews with Jean-Luc from the time period (1965)that show him very relaxed and thoughtful to the questions he is given and his answers. Another filmed interview from the period with Belmondo shows him to also be very relaxed and amusing. It's quite a revelation to see how he was in real life away from the brusk gangsters and ne'er-do-wells that he played on the screen.  The 2 disc set comes with a thick booklet carrying beautiful color stills, a lengthy interview with J-L.G, a nice review from Andrew Sarris and more.",1203552000,16,1583,4.714801444043322
3916700,4,B002EBRFCY,"I want to echo a sentiment expressed in an earlier review,"" Godard's films are known for their memorable scenes,"" (G. Merritt) more so than their memorable stories.  In fact, Godard elevates the cinema beyond mere storytelling and into a realm where the cinema interrogates itself as an artform- this is what explains his intense appeal to filmmakers as well as his modest appeal to the general filmgoer.  As a filmmaker Godard makes you see the possibilities of the cinema by breaking nearly every rule thought indispensable to the cinema.  In fact, those of us who love his work are actually in love with particular scenes or moments in his films that strike a deeply personal, profoundly intellectual or unrestrained comic cord within us. (often simultaneously in one scene) The trouble is that once you are struck by him you end up returning or seeking out Godard's work again and again in the hopes that he might strike that cord again for you.  He almost never does strike the same cord in you twice, but instead he always gives you something else.
Pierrot Le Fou is a bizarre, exciting and comical film from Godard.  The pleasure of this film is found in the fact that you have absolutely no idea what Pierrot the character or Godard the filmmaker is going to do next.  You literally have to just sit back and enjoy the adventure; you have to hang out with Pierrot and you find that there is rarely a dull moment.  My favorite scene in this film is the ""C'est Moi, Marrianne"" sequence that alternates between silence, voice over, Duchamel's brillantly emotional score and Raoul Coutard's incredibly hypnotic tracking shots that all combine to create one of the most spectacular escape scenes in all of the French New Wave films. Pierrot Le Fou was made after Godard's attempts to direct the American version of Bonnie & Clyde fell through (it was of course directed by Arthur Penn) but you can see the Bonnie and Clyde influence in Pierrot Le Fou as Pierrot (Jean -Paul Belmondo) and Marianne (Anna Karina) run away together and cause havoc to unsuspecting bystanders and ultimately to themselves.  Pierrot is an attempt to escape from the conformity of marriage,  Paris  bourgeois lifestyle and a world being consumed by consumerism.  This is evident in the famous sequence where party goers only speak in advertising slogans.  For filmmakers it has a cameo of the great American director, Samuel Fuller who is in France attempting to raise money to do a film.  As with most Godard films, they work their best when they are on  the big screen, but if this DVD transfer is as good as I expect Criterion  films to be...  Pierrot Le Fou will be an adventure you won't soon forget.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Screenwriting-into-Film/dp/1425726437/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Screenwriting into Film</a>",1201824000,8,2847,5.038379530916845
3916711,5,B002EBRFCY,"I'm giving ""Pierrot le fou"" 5 stars--because even when it fails--its originality makes up for any flaws.  This is truly an iconoclastic, anarchistic, nihilistic--not to mention entertaining--tragicomedy.  I first saw this film a few years ago and remember that I liked it.  Now after my second and third viewings--I think it may be my favorite Godard film of all.  And in spite of being filled with serio-comic violence, blistering social critique and cultural commentary apropos to its time--""Pierrot le fou"" is also a deeply poetic picture.  I can see how another Amazon reviewer referred to this as ""Part II"" of ""&Agrave; bout de souffle"" (Breathless).  It is the surreal color version of ""Breathless""--as if ""Breathless"" had been deconstructed and turned into a kind of Dada-esque comedy.  This film rips into the heart everything that ""The Man / The Establishment / Authority / Conformity"" had come to represent to those participating in the then burgeoning 1960s youth culture.  ""Pierrot le fou"" is a ""happening"" on film.

Protagonists Pierrot / Ferdinand and Marianne escape from their bourgeois comfort zone and decide to burn the candle at both ends.  And for this decision--they suffer the consequences.  Yet who can blame them for not wanting to go on living as lobotomized consumers (who are referenced in a funny party scene near the beginning of the film).  Jean-Paul Belmondo (as Pierrot / Ferdinand Griffon) is a fantastic comic, impressionist, physical / slapstick actor--and I want to believe that underneath his whimsy, he is profound as well.  He has great chemistry with Anna Karina (as Marianne Renoir) who I have enjoyed in other films by Godard, including ""Alphaville"", ""Bande &agrave; part"" and ""Vivre sa vie"".  The scenes in which Karina sings are priceless.  Both lead actors look like they were having a great time making this picture.

Pierrot le fou's Riviera location renders this thematically dark film strangely soothing.  The use of collage, multi-media and visual symbols is yet another innovative Godard staple thrown into the mix.  [The only scene I had remembered from my initial viewing of this picture is the one where the pastel blue-green convertible is driven into the sea--that convertible representing the objects of consumer society that are used and then discarded thoughtlessly.]  Plot is irrelevant in this film--I suggest that the viewer just surrender to this wildly improvisatory spectacle and go with the moment.  ""Pierrot le fou"" also features a haunting score by Antoine Duhamel.  As usual--Godard polarizes the reaction of the audience--that being a sure sign of his greatness.

3916712,5,B002EBRFCY,"The negative reviews Amazon has highlighted for this  Criterion DVD,  released in 2008, are dated 2000-2004, suggesting a different DVD is being reviewed. One review complains of the sound quality, but suggests this might be deliberate on Godard's part (CB radios, etc). This is likely. The screenplay for ""Made in USA"" says, of one scene: ""We hear the voice of (whoever) giving a political analysis (which Godard largely agrees with) at unbearable volume"", or words to that effect. Like with Dylan, it's always worth while looking to see if godard is critiquing (or just complicating the approach to) the views that he himself agrees with, or at least thinks are part of the story. Paraphrasing another quote from memory, Godard said once that there are three kinds of cinema: bourgeois cinema, fascist cinema and radical cinema. Bourgeois cinema says enjoy it, learn from it in an unproblematic way, fascist cinema tells you what to think (left-wing or right-wing doesn't matter), and radical cinema invites/ requires questioning and self-criticism. Godard's cinema overall aims to show beauty and oppose power, left or right (exept in his Maoist phase, where he still allowed Cohn-Bendit's anarchist views to get a mention in ""Wind from the East"").",1326240000,,1251,5.188118811881188

Goddard seems to try new experiments with each scene and in this movie they flow together rather extraordinarily. It's fun to watch this troubled couple on the run reciting poetry and treating life as if it was a great series of adventures that could be tossed to the wind at any moment.  Yet at times, there is genuine care and emotion between goddard's 2 most charismatic actors.  Goddard only includes what is important to him and leaves out many of the usual details that just might be irrelevant to his movies.",1318118400,,611,4.79047619047619

3916715,5,B002EBRFCY,"Easily (and I mean that in the boldest of senses) one of my favorite films of all time, `Pierrot le Fou' is cinematic perfection personified.  There isn't a single moment of this film that doesn't fill me with every emotion needed to captivate and just thrust me into a sensory overdose.  From the lush sets to the engaged performances to the witty banter to the sharply edited sequences to the ravishingly spectacular script, `Pierrot le Fou' is, in a word, perfect.

Enough gushing already.

The film tells the story of a dissatisfied husband who has married solely for money, not for love, and thus embarks on a passion filled escapade with the babysitter.  Ferdinand uninspired by his existence, but Marianne promises (with her bewitching walk and `come-hither' eyes) a life free from regret.  He sees a future that encompasses everything his current state is lacking, and so he runs off with her, setting their sights on Paris (who wouldn't?).  Things get sticky along the way, and the two find themselves engaged in acts of random violence they never imagined was their destiny.  Their adventure turns dangerous and soon they are left with nothing left to do but jump right into the fire.

The very thought of this movie makes me want to drop to my hands and knees and perform an act of worship.

I have and always will be an advocate for French cinema, especially the 60's new wave campaigned by the likes of Francois Truffaut and my personal favorite film director (of all time) Jean-Luc Godard.  `Pierrot le Fou' capitalizes on everything I find so enthralling about French new wave.  There is the obvious weighty themes but they are presented in an enchantingly jovial tone that keeps the audience entertained, even in the throes of crisis.  The colorful sets only serve as slick compliments to the films grounded performances (Jean-Paul Belmondo and Anna Karina were never better) and the films sharp editing helps embellish the complexities of the films plot.

In the end, `Pierrot le Fou' is about our personal convictions and the need, as people, to be invested in our own destiny.

While one can easily point to the films sporadic delivery and ascertain that it is merely an `art' film, one would be wrong in simply dismissing it for its entertainment value alone.  The film, for me, captures elements from all sides of the cinematic spectrum.  The film is deeply unsettling when you start to take its elements seriously (especially the eventualities contained in the films conclusion), which adds a completely different layer to the films tone.  The film is undeniably entertaining, which is not something many `art' films can attest to being.  Most people label `art' films as boring and needlessly complex (I'm not talking about myself here) but this film, which is most certainly an `art' film, is far from either.  There is a rich poignancy here that transcends the films release date, and there is an enigmatic atmosphere that only helps elevate the films importance.

It is fresh, it is exciting, it is dangerous, it is meaningful, and it is loud, abrasive and epic in every sense of the word.  It is cinema; cut, paste and send.",1278460800,4,3151,4.861423220973783
3916716,4,B002EBRFCY,"""Pierrot Le Fou""(1965) was Jean Luc Godard's tenth film. The premise is simple enough, Ferdinand (Jean-Paul Belmondo) is unhappily married and recently fired so he decides to leave his wife and children for his babysitter, and ex-girlfriend, Marianna Renoir (Anna Karina). They travel about a little like Bonnie and Clyde, stealing automobiles and money, on their way from Paris to the Mediterranean Sea in the French Riviera. This, however, is a Jean-Luc Godard film so the unexpected always happens. Like pop art, the film uses visuals drawn from cartoons and utilizes a garish visual aesthetic based on bright primary colours, and a parodic, but admiring attitude towards American pop culture, mixing high and low art, dissecting popular movie conventions with a collage-like narrative structure. This was the last movie Godard directed with Anna Karina, which was filmed as Godard was breaking up with her, so there is an extra poignancy to the scenes when Marianna betrays Ferdinand and runs away with another man.

The remastered blu-ray looks marvelous in colour, with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio. It's monaural soundtrack was also cleaned up. The set also features a video interview with Anna Karina, an informative ""Pierrot"" primer with commentary by Jean-Pierre Gorin, and a 53 minute feature, ""Godard, l'amour, la poesie"", about Jean-Luc Godard, his life and films with Karina.  There are also archival interviews with Godard, Karina, and Jean-Paul Belmondo, as well as a booklet with an essay by Richard Brody, and a 1969 review by Andrew Sarris, as well as a 1965 interview with Godard.

3916721,5,B002EBRFCY,"In 1964, Jean-Luc Godard went to work on his tenth film, a color film titled ""Pierrot Le Fou"" which would feature his ex-wife Anna Karina and Jean-Paul Belmondo (who worked on Godard's ""A bout de Souffle"" (Breathless) and ""Une femme est une femme"" (A Woman is a Woman).

The film is his most ambitious film yet, not only reuniting with two stars that he has worked with before but the fact that elements of his previous nine films shows up on ""Pierrot Le Fou"".

The film was released by Fox Lorber in the US back in 1998 and received The Criterion Collection treatment in February 2008.  Over a year later, the film became the first Jean-Luc Godard film released by the Criterion Collection on Blu-ray.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Pierrot Le Fou"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1 Aspect Ratio). The film is probably the most gorgeous film I have seen by Jean-Luc Godard to date.  The film is full of colors, absolutely vibrant, reds and blues just pop.  For fans of Godard's '60s work, ""Pierrot Le Fou"" is his most colorful film.  It's important to note that the restored high-definition digital transfer was approved by cinematographer Raoul Coutard.

Accord to Criterion, the HD digital transfer was created on Spirit Datacine from the 35mm negative and color corrected on a Specter Virtual Datacine.  Thousands of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter and flicker were manually removed using MTI's DRS system and Pixl Farm's PFClean system, while Digital Vision's DVNR system was used for small dirt, grain and noise reduction.

""Pierrot Le fou"" is featured in its original French language and features a monaural soundtrack remastered at 24-bit from a 35 mm optical track print.  Dialogue is clean and understandable and Anna Karina's singing voice is crystal clear in this film.  Clicks, thumps, hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD.  Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated audio workstation.

Subtitles are provided in English.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Perhaps one of Godard's most accessible films, ""Pierrot Le Fou"" is a film that is best enjoyed after watching a good number of his films that preceded this film.  With the film now released on Blu-ray for the first time through the Criterion Collection, many people will will be introduced to Jean-Luc Godard but in my opinion, this film is not a starting point for the beginner.  It's more of a film that can be appreciated even more after watching his previous films and seeing how things have culminated in his work before he started to focus more on his political films.

""Pierrot Le Fou"" is often seen as an early paradigmatic example of postmodernism in film.  In the film, Godard shows his feeling towards American pop culture but Godard also becomes gets political as he uses the film for his characters to discuss the Vietnam and Algerian war.  For many viewers familiar with Godard and his work, many believe this is Godard's way of using characters to flesh out his true feelings about society.  While many feel the film is a paying homage to his nine previous films leading to ""Pierrot Le Fou"".

Personally, what I enjoy about this film is the adventure that Godard takes you.  We wonder how these two people who are in love with each other, are yet so different.  Ferdinand is reserved, quiet and just wants to enjoy the simple and peaceful life he has at the moment.  Marianne just is tired of settling down and not doing anything.  The fact is that she's a bad girl.  She's involved with some shady characters dealing with illegal activity but in some way, that is her form of fun and she wants to expose Ferdinand to that life.

The way that Godard has shot the film is quite intriguing.  We see things in the film but rarely are they explained.  Why does Marianne enjoy killing and hurting others and why is it that both see or do things but not much is mentioned about it.  It's like it's something natural for them.

Nevertheless, its the adventure of these two unlikely individuals that I find so interesting.  Personally, I found it great to see Jean-Paul Belmondo and Anna Karina together as the primary leads for the film.  The two have really good chemistry onscreen and the fact that we are enjoying this adventure of two people involved in criminal activity is quite interesting.

Godard has done a great job and utilizing many scenes with the two together to show their story of life together, when things start to become problematic leading up to a pivotal scene that comes out of left field (granted, this is common theme with Godard's '60s films, always expect the unexpected).

Overall, ""Pierrot Le Fou"" is an enjoyable stylish, arthouse film.  It's also one of those films that I feel is appreciated the more times you watch it.  Again, this film is not where you should start out if you are wanting to get into Godard films, otherwise you will find yourself a bit puzzled by how the film is paced, how the scenes were cut and how Godard's endings tend to be.

""Pierrot Le Fou"" is a Godard masterpiece, but I highly recommend watching a few of his films such as ""Breatheless"", ""A Woman is a Woman"", ""A Band of Outsiders"", ""Contempt"", ""Alphaville"" and ""Masculin Feminin"" before tackling on this film.  Once you start appreciating Godard's filmmaking, then you'll definitely appreciate this film even more.

Definitely recommended!",1264464000,18,6861,4.896790980052038
3916722,4,B002EBRFCY,"great video, amazing movie but the it lacks in the extras department. they should have packed everything in one disc and charged less. my favorite thing in this item would be the colorful booklet (essay + review + godard interview + pictures )",1262131200,,243,4.674418604651163
3916723,4,B002EBRFCY,"Jean-Luc Godard, the darling of French ""New Wave"" cinema, premiered this film at the '65 Venice Film Festival (where it was Booed!).  Starring Jean-Paul Belmondo and Anna Karina as a sexy couple who hit the road to escape the bourgeoisie, it is much more than a road movie.

Godard called the characters Belmondo and Karina portray ""the last romantic couple.""  This was Godard's tenth feature in six years.
Playful, farcical, satiric and at times light-hearted,, thje story of a husband running off with his ex-lover (and child's baby sitter) afforded an opportunity to make fun of consumerism and politics in this episodic and meandering tale rich in metaphor and meaning.

A pop-art sensibility pervades this energetically acted film that is enhanced by the emphasis of primary colors and the vivid Technicolor cinematography of Raoul Coutard (who approved this stunning Crierion hi-def transfer).

Although Godard said he didn't use a script, Lionel White's hard-boiled novel Obsession, seems to be the source of whatever plot the picture itself has.  Another source element is Raymond Queneau's comic novel from the `40s, Pierrot Mon Ami.  Which in turn inspired the 1959 Euro hit ""Mon Ami Pierrot"" which Karina sings to Belmondo whom she calls Pierrot, which invariably moves him to say, ""that's not my name.""  (He's ""Ferdinand"" in the movie.)
Godard's films are filled with allusions and references.  Often to movies themselves.  In fact, the actors do not hesitate to break the ""fourth wall"" and sometimes turn to the camera to make comments directly to the audience.

Godard's oft-repeated description of the film is especially precise, it even refers to a central image in the opening scenes.  He said, ""Life is the subject with CinemaScope and color its attributes. In short, life filling the screen as a faucet fills a bathtub that is simultaneously draining at the same rate.""
This film is, on one level, a celebration of art for art's sake.  It's contextual meaning is more obscure and layered.
Criterion's breathtaking Blu-ray release warrants a second look at this enduring cinematic treasure.

Generous extras include an interview with Anna Karina, a 50 minute documentary about Godard's life and films, archival interviews with Godard, Belmondo and Karina.  An enclosed booklet has a fascinating essay by film historian and ""New Yorker"" writer Richard Brody who says: ""Exactly as Godard intended, `Pierrot Le Fou' reflects appropriately vast, cosmic, quasimetaphysical artistic dreams of a Balzacian grandeur.""  What a great sentence. There are many more like that!  Also in the booklet, an erudite review by Andfrew Sarris and an interesting 1965 interview with Godard.",1257120000,2,2687,5.269953051643192
3916724,4,B002EBRFCY,"First let me get the technical specifications out of the way. This is a gorgeous looking transfer of a beautifully photographed film from the 1960s. Criterion did their job with this transfer. The colors simply pop off the screen. The color scheme was designed to be extremely stylized by Godard and his famous cinematographer Raoul Coutard and this Blu-ray brings the visuals to the screen with striking clarity. The whole picture is vivid and you get a real sense of immersion in the textures. This is one of those Criterion releases I had to have even though I don't like the film that much. I certainly love the look and even people who hate artsy cinematic snobbery like Pierrot Le Fou can sit still for awhile and just look at the pretty pictures. It looks much better visually than most mainstream films coming out today. The audio is perfect for what it is, a basic two channel monaural track. It's the picture that pops! The special features are extensive, including an interview with Anna Karina from recent days. Perhaps the most obnoxious feature is the Pierrot Primer, a long-winded analysis of the first half hour or so of the movie by filmmaker Jean-Pierre Gorin. He later collaborated with Godard on some film projects.

Now, I have heard my share of pretentious commentary tracks on Criterion from critics and intellectual snobs of all stripes but this commentary may take the cake as the most over thought, over analysed procession of verbiage I have ever encountered outside of a hardcore film theory book. The commentator discusses counterpoint and narration interlaced with editing techniques. It sounds like he's talking about J.S. Bach when in fact Godard is merely toying with technique and this film theory nonsense makes one want to pull their hair out. I don't doubt that Godard really is that pretentious, but I'll give him the benefit of the doubt since he's not the one doing the voice commentary here.

With that in mind, allow me to unveil my own views of Pierrot Le Fou and Jean-Luc Godard in general. It's been said many times before that Godard is the most radical of the French New Wave filmmakers, even going farther than Alain Resnais. Pierrot Le Fou was made when Godard was in his best form, before he turned to radical politics and his films became less and less coherent. Show this movie to anyone raised on mainstream studio fare and they won't know what to think of it except that it's boring. The mainstream viewer would be absolutely right in that opinion since at this point of his career Godard cared less and less about mere entertainment or telling a good story than he did with satirizing consumer culture, the middle class, American imperialism and all that jazz but encased always in this pop art sensibility with the girls and the guns and the crime stories. He was also deeply influenced by Bertold Brecht and his alienating effect. This could be an explanation of the apathy and boredom one feels when watching much of Godard's body of work. Not all of course as there are more emotional films such as ""My Life to Live"" in the Godardian canon. Godard's later works would be even more alienating but Pierrot Le Fou is already there. Forget about the superficial jump cuts, the misplaced dramatic musical cues that end abruptly, the characters acknowledgement of the audience, even directly conversing with the audience at points... forget about all of that shallow postmodernism and ask yourself what is this film about? Politics, love, death, war, consumerism, cinematic form? The famous Sam Fuller cameo speech can be used as an explanation I suppose. It all feels completely beside the point. There is no heart and soul in these cleverer than though films and more than 40 years later, one can even ask, who cares?

Truffaut is far less intellectual than Godard and yet Truffaut has heart. Resnais has a sense of cinematic form that eludes Godard in most respects. As attractive as the Godard films are and they all look great, I always felt he was the kind of French fraud that one reads about. He doesn't hold a candle to Robert Bresson. I think Godard would agree as he deeply respects Bresson. The main thing I dislike about Godard and this can be applied to other French New Wavers but none as much as Godard... the main thing I dislike is his pop art sensibility. I know this kind of thing was hip and cool back in the 60s and it was the height of trendiness but I can't stand it! I have the same revulsion for Quentin Tarantino's obsession with blaxploitation films, kung-fu spectacles and other sub-genres from the 1970s. It clouds Tarantino's aesthetic in kitsch and here is Godard, Tarantino's antecedent clothed in kitsch as well. Granted, that to compare the intellectual Godard to the lowbrow take of Tarantino is a disservice but Tarantino has many times claimed Godard's influence. Godard is one of the heights of cinematic modernism but also the blatant forerunner of postmodernism. His sensibility just doesn't grab my attention like Antonioni, Bergman or once again Bresson. All three are far more penetrating modern voices.

I have to say, beyond everything I mentioned. The one thing that grates on my nerves about Godard is that his films are anti-spiritual, almost always especially at that point in his career. His work always dealt with objects and humans as objects and commodities. He was deeply affected by Marxism and his movies are materialistic in nature, never attempting to ascend beyond the world of flesh and greed. Sometimes Godard tackles religious matters head on as in his film ""Hail Mary"" which was criticized by the Pope! Watching that film just proved it for me. Godard is not a spiritual artist and it's hopeless to look in his work for some kind of transformative ideal. Still he did photograph a lot of pretty things in beautiful ways and here we have a genuinely gorgeous Blu-ray ripe for decadent home viewing on your 1080p HDTV.",1256774400,11,5933,4.813725490196078
3916725,3,B002EBRFCY,"First of all, I like The Inscrutable Art Movie as much as the next guy.  Maybe this movie says something about when it was released (I was about three years old) that is lost today (e.g. the Vietnam references).  Setting aside such ambiguosities (I just made that up) as ""nihilist"" and ""groundbreaking"" and (God forbid) ""deconstruction,"" what is this movie about?  Even ""Last Year at Marienbad"" is about something, or many things (or ""nothing,"" you choose), and it does the job quite well.  (Funny, all the talk about what THAT movie means... check out the original trailer at Criterion's website and you'll see it was marketed as a cinematic version of Mad Libs.)  And what about ""2001: A Space Odyssey""?  Lots of folks don't ""get"" that movie either, but it's a heck of a lot of fun to watch.

Which is more than I can say about Pierrot le Fou.  I won't be cranky and gratuitously mean and give it one star.  It's not the Worst Movie Ever.  I won't whine that I wasted two hours of my life, blah blah.  But a friend once offered this test for a movie's worth: In the middle of movie, do you care about any of the characters or what happens to them?  I don't mean you have to like any of them.  In this movie, married guy goes wild, but what he and his wild Eve are ""looking for"" is never explained.  If they want self-destruction, then make that a credible (not necessarily smart) choice.  (If this girl is such a rebel, then what's she doing working as a babysitter?  How about breaking into parking meters or something?  But I quibble.)  Visually, the Criterion DVD is beautiful.  But the movie is like watching one long music video.  And music videos, with all their cliches, get tedious really fast.  I likened this movie to ""Pulp Fiction,"" and I wasn't particularly wowed by that, either.",1252108800,7,1794,4.526479750778816
3916726,5,B002EBRFCY,"Godard's first ten films are characterized as his most ""new wave"" of films (why Maculin/Feminin and Weekend aren't ""new wave"" is beyond me. Perhaps it has to do with Anna Karina and Godard's separation, though they had divorced before filming Alphaville). Anyway, if this indeed is his last new wave film, it serves as a sort of masters thesis of everything that he made before.

Ferdinand/Pierrot (Jean-Paul Belmondo, wonderful) lives an unsatisfying life of domesticity with his rich, vapid Italian wife. Marianne (the beautiful, amazing Anna Karina), a since forgotten fling of Ferdinand's appears in his life once again, and the two undertake a spree of murder, poverty, cunning, theft and isolation. One of the bonus features on the second disc describes Pierrot as the reverse Breathless (Godard's first full length), and it makes sense. Here, Godard is self-referential, making sly gestures and nods at his previous work. Some of my favorite lines of any Godard film are here: Pierrot glad he hates spinach and his old man's monologue on writing and Joyce. Raoul Coutard's filmography is, once again, stunning. The film is awash in blues, in comic book two-tones, which Karina's red dress stands out as an ode to non-conformity.

Of course this is a long film, and though its structure is completely linear, the odd sense of time in it may detract viewers (I for one love it). Different elements and characters seem to be thrown in at odd times, but eschewing the normalcy and heightening the artificiality of cinema was Godard's intentions. Some might see this as arty pretension, well it is. But as a film lover I'm rather tired of movies I watch once and everything is handed to me neatly. Anything demanding close repeated watching is the only thing worth watching, personally. But really, this movie isn't so over everyone's heads as to be unenjoyable to those unfamiliar with Godard's work. It's funny, sad, exciting, and most of all enigmatic.

Now, if you've seen Godard's previous nine films you'll want to see this, unless you didn't enjoy them, which begs the question Why did you watch them? Belmondo and Karina are at once very archetypal characters in the Godardian universe, but they're also very much distinct from the other characters they had played. For instance, they seem to be the complete opposites of their A Woman is a Woman roles. Karina here plays the feisty, un-containable murderess always on the move, whereas the earlier film all she wants is a kid. Belmondo here is a sensitive, artistic brooder, with a playful side to be sure, but in Woman he is a horny, egocentric, calloused hanger-on.

Also, the end of Pierrot is one of the most abrupt, unexpected, wonderfully humorous and disconcerting of any I have ever seen!

So, while I whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone interested, perhaps it'd be best to acquaint yourself with his earlier films to get a gist of Godard's intentions as a filmmaker. If you're new to his work, I suggest this order: Breathless, Band of Outsiders, A Woman is a Woman, Contempt, Alphaville, My Life to Live, Pierrot le Fou. And if you like those then watch Masculin/Feminin and Weekend. All the films mentioned above are outstanding, amazing, brilliant films worth a million Jurassic Parks, Mama Mias, Titanics and ET's.",1219363200,10,3293,4.98

But the film is too playful for me to appreciate, it's more interesting as an idea than to watch. 2 stars for the film and 4 stars to Criterions package. If you haven't tried Godards films before don't start with this one, try A Bout de Souffle (""Breathless"") instead, also on Criterion in a fantastic edition.",1214438400,2,611,4.5636363636363635

3916730,5,B002EBRFCY,"Criterion does it again.
I saw this film on the big screen twice in the past year. So, with that in my mind, I was prepared to be forgiving toward Criterion's transfer (which I knew would be better than anything around, but just not as solid and beautiful as the new print). But forgivness was not necessary. In some ways it would be a greater experience to watch this DVD on the proper Television than to watch a projected print! What an accomplishment.

If Godard is not your thing, you may not want to purchase this DVD, but if he is (or if you enjoy 60's French cinema) then this is a MUST OWN.

The Double disc is worth the price for the documentary on Godard and Karina alone. And also for the interview with the latter. Plus, it has a wonderfully insiteful primer from Jean Pierre Gorin.

8367494,1,B002EBRFCY,"Pierrot le fou (Jean-Luc Godard, 1965, 110')

Written by Jean-Luc Godard. Based on Obsession by Lionel White. Produced by Georges de Beauregard. Starring Jean-Paul Belmondo, Anna Karina. Music by Antoine Duhamel. Cinma-tography by Raoul Coutard. Editing by Franoise Collin. The film was the 15th highest grossing film of the year with a total of 1,310,580 admissions in France.

I was young when I first saw Godard's films, actually when they first came out, and, including my copains, gave Godard 5s. Which by today leaves the following five 5ers': #1 Masculin, fminin (1966, 110') as Top Godard, 15/3/2011, #24 Le mpris (1963, 103') -About European culture, 1/9/2011, #37 Made in USA (1966, 90') -Un film po, 20/9/2011, #36 La Chinoise (1967, 96') -China and violence as options, 18/9/2011, #262us Bande  part (1964, 97') -B+,  25/11/ 2013. So far, only ""L'Infantile"" (Une femme est une femme) got a 1, and so does ""Pierrot"". It may worth reflecting that Pierrot was Godard's tenth feature film, between Alphaville and Masculin, fminin - the former also 5, and the latter his top film, actually a ""hors classe"" 5.

Wikipedia's plot states: ""After abandoning his wife and infant daughter for the new babysitter, a woman he'd loved and lost several years earlier, an errant husband embarks on a haphazard road to tragedy."" Equally brief was IMDb: ""Pierrot escapes his boring society and travels from Paris to the Mediterranean Sea with Marianne, a girl chased by hit-men from Algeria. They lead an unorthodox life, always on the run."" In variation of Godard's own dictum - ""each film has a beginning, a middle and an end, but not necessarily in that order"": Well, in this film, it is all chronological; even Anna Karina is by now playing good tennis in a smart outfit

More relevant seems the statement at the party, where slightly inebriated, but otherwise emi-nent American director and producer Samuel Fuller sums it up: ""Film is like a battle-ground. Love, hate, action, violence, death, in one word: emotion."" Godard's Hollywood and B series movie Made in USA (1966 - another five star Godard), marginally later, but with a related topic, ""is dedicated to <Nick and Sam>, meaning Nicholas Ray and Samuel Fuller, Hollywood mave-ricks, who were objects of filial awe and oedipal aggression"" for Godard and a few of his con-temporaries, at the Cahiers du Cinma and later as filmmakers.

""Pierrot"" - ""je m'appelle Ferdinand"" is the regular start of talking by Marianne and the riposte. The action, apart from the sheer minimal plot, is like a ""Tour de Godard"", but Astrix and Oblix, the two popular cartoon characters at the time, are better, and so the earlier series of les pieds nickels. A lot of brutality and blood, with not much need. The political background could be plain criminal just as well and still not unlike l'Organsation d'Arme Secrte (OAS). With the personal dramas about Marianne's liaisons evolving at the same time, Ferdinand takes to the gun and kills her and two lovers. In all four when he blows himself up with dynamite.
