7991178,4,B00009L53V,"This is my 7,5/10 mangaupdates review and this anime is a direct adaptation but with filler so deduct 0,5 points i guess:
Rumiko can draw, design and is famous for starting strong but then never really closing a series after spinning wheels for volumes on end. This early work though has a very decent start, a somewhat dead middle with too much repetitive nonsense and a highly drawn out and predictable love polygon but i will admit that the series finishes strong. The narrative further has a bit of a problem with tone and the original pitch for the manga sounds better as Rumiko wanted to move on the other couples after resolving the main romance in a timely fashion. Mitaka's romance is further way more engaging and Godai is a pretty boring protagonist but beggars can't be choosers. I honestly can't recommend any of her other works due to the reasons stated above and her next best pieces, namely One-pound Gospel and Mermaid Saga, are only a 6/10 as they also deteriorate over time. Read them if you must but check out Living Game (8,5/10) first as that early 90s apartment romance never overstayed its welcome and actually bothered to explore a relationship over time and the best 80s romance manga is the 10/10 Please Save My Earth. That one was even awarded with a sadly unfinished OVA series by IG.",1429660800,,1313,4.663793103448276
7991179,5,B00009L53V,"""Maison Ikkoku"" is unlike anything I've ever seen.  There, I said it.  I was debating whether or not that would be too much of a set up, but after hours of arguing with myself on how to review this wonderful show I threw all my notions of how to write a review out the window.  Despite what some people think, writing a review really is a process.  You want to make your review entertaining and informative, but you are supposed to hold onto your final recommendation till near the end of the review to maintain the readers interest throughout.  This is a normal review.  However, ""Maison Ikkoku"" is not a normal show.  Oh sure, when I tell you what it's about it may SOUND like a normal show, but trust me; it's not!

""Maison Ikkoku""is a one-of-kind.  A show so smart, so beautiful, and so joyful to watch, that a typical review would be pointless as well as a complete disgrace.  For this show I have to be up-front: ""Maison Ikkoku"" is one of the best shows I've ever seen.  It's one of the best shows I've seen in the past ten years.  And if I were to sit down and look at every show I've ever seen, from prime time to Saturday morning, from animated to live action, from American to Japan, I'd say ""Maison Ikkoku"" would very likely be in the top five (and if not there, then it would definitely be in the top ten).  While the show has minor nitpicks one could complain about, they ultimately don't matter, as THIS is as close to perfection as television can possibly be!

There, now that I've laid out all the cards, I'm going to now have faith that my readers will stay here long enough to let me explain why I feel so strongly about this show.  ""Maison Ikkoku"" revolves around a young college student named Godai, who is attempting to get into a high college in Japan but failing miserably.  He lives at the Maison Ikkoku, a run down apartment complex that has few tenants and seems to be hidden in a back ally of some sort.  Then one day the apartment complex gets a new manager in the form of Kyoko, who Godai falls instantly in love with.  Yes, this is a romantic comedy.  Yes, there is nothing particularly new or daring in this concept.  In all honestly, I could give away every story twist this show throws at you, and unless you actually watch it you would find the descriptions fairly uninteresting.

Therefor, discussing the storyline beyond this point would be pointless (hey, I managed to squeez a bad pun in there).  However, the journey for this show is one that will take your breath away.  Maybe not instantly.  Very few shows start out with a bang and keep the energy going.  Instead, ""Maison Ikkoku"" begins as a fun little comedy that evolves into something much deeper then you could possibly imagine.  Seeing that the basic storyline is about two people falling in love, the show mimics real life in that the relationship develops slowly and realistically.  Though Godai is smitten with Kyoko right off the bat, Kyoko has no interest in a relationship.  Particularly since, despite her young age of twenty-one, she is a widow.

Still fresh from a tragic event that took her husbands life six months into their message, Kyoko is suffering some trust issues of her own.  It doesn't help the that three other tenants, Akemi, Yotsuya, and Ichinose, tend to be loud mouth drunks who tend to get in the way of the relationship (though, to their credit, they usually don't mean to).  But...man, I'm already doing this show a disservice.  There is just NO way to review this thing!  Some romantic comedies are considered ""a slice of life,"" but this show is the whole pie.  The transition and change in this show is amazing.  The character development is stunning.  There are several characters that look like RC stereotypes, until you spend time with them and get to see their true colors.  In a strange way, you develop your own relationships with these people.

Alright, I'll say it in a way everyone here will understand: You come to care for this cast as much as you come to care for the cast in the Harry Potter books.  Yes, it's THAT good!  ""Maison Ikkoku"" was written by Rumiko Takahashi, who is the richest woman in Japan.  She has written popular series that have become famous worldwide, including ""Ramna "" and ""InuYasha.""  Trust me, this show blows all those other shows out of the water.  More epic is story then the aforementioned but with a more subtle tone, ""Maison Ikkoku"" is something that any fan of good storytelling will just eat up.  The TV format gives a life to this story that even the books couldn't match.  That life would be time.

At 96 episodes, ""Maison Ikkoku"" is not short.  It takes its time telling the story and developing the relationships.  During that time characters age, seasons pass as do holidays, and the economy goes from stable to unstable.  It's a living, breathing world that a single movie (to some extent) the books couldn't properly display most of the time.  I'm going to share my personal experience of the ending of this show without giving the ending away.  When the final episode was finished I starred at the TV.  And I looked at it.  Then I cried.  I cried a lot.  I'm tearing up just thinking about it.  Go ahead, laugh all you want, you don't know what this show is like.  It's not that the ending is sad or tragic per se, it's just so fitting and beautiful.  With just a few simple images, a couple lines of dialog, and the memory of the show behind you, it left me feeling truly happy I spent my time watching it.

I've only done that two other times, and for lesser shows might I add.  Like I said, this show is not perfect, but it comes as close to perfection I've ever seen.  What's even more amazing is that this is the first I've seen the show.  The show premiered in Japan in 1986 and it is now 2008.  This show is over twenty years old and it feels more fresh and originally then any RC I've seen made all year.  That fact that such an old show can have this much of an impact in the modern world solidifies it as a classic.  Now then, here's the bad news: The show is currently out of print from Viz Media.  Most of the sets can currently be found in stores, but volumes five and (more importantly) eight are close to impossible to find for less then $100.  Considering volume eight contains the moving ending, this could be considered a serious blow against the show.

Rental stores may have the show for rent for awhile, but soon those copies will be too worn to rent as well.  This makes finding the show a difficult task, but one that's well worth involving yourself in.  While no written review can do justice to this show, for those with the patience to watch it I can promise it will be a treasure.  Something you'll remember forever.  In fact, if I know me, I'll be taking the journey again many times throughout the years.",1207785600,3,6816,4.457119741100324
7991180,5,B00009L53V,"I originally watched Maison Ikkoku from the Arctic Animation fan subtitles sometime in the early 1990's, and I've been in love with it ever since. I think (and many people share this opinion) that Maison is Rumiko Takahashi's best manga and best anime, and that's saying a lot, since Takahashi has penned blockbusters like Ranma, Urusei Yatsura, and Inuyasha.

The story is about a boarding house called Ikkoku-kan where a hapless student Yusaku Godai lives, along with a hard-drinking housewife Ichinose-san, her son Kentaro, a bizarre and secretive man Yotsuya-san who is constantly frustrating Godai, and Akemi Roppongi who is a sultry hostess at a local tavern. The tenants of Ikkoku-kan continuously torture Godai: they prevent him from studying, eat all his food, and party all night long.

Into this nightmare moves in a new apartment manager, Kyoko Otonashi. She is young and pretty and Godai is instantly infatuated with her. The rest of the series is Godai trying to win the love of Kyoko over Shun Mitaka, a local tennis coach who also is in love with Kyoko. And despite the interference of the Ikkoku-kan residents!

It doesn't sound like much to start, and surely this first 12 episode set proceeds slowly, but the storyline is well-developed, and the characters are heartfelt. My friends forced me to watch the first 8 episodes, and after that I was hooked. But I'm guessing that if you're pondering buying this series, then you probably have a good idea about the plot and story and such, and want some technical information.

The transfer is excellent. This series aired on TV in the '80's and that's obvious from the animation quality, but the job done on the DVD import is good, probably as good as you could get in Japan. The Japanese audio track is mono because that's how it was broadcast. But it has good sound quality and is very crisp.

I hate dubbing, but for the sake of this review, I watched it. I don't like it, but as far as dubs go, it's passable. I would discourage watching the dub though because this show is SO Japanese that it relies a lot on the Japanese language itself.

The DVD's have essentially no extras or features. It is just the episodes. It's still a good deal, considering 12 episodes a set for ~$45. There should be a total of 8 sets (96 eps). I own 1-5, and plan on acquiring the rest.

My main criticisms of this collection:

(1) This series is so very Japanese that you HAVE to explain some things. For example, in the American mind, a ronin is a samurai without a master. In the modern Japanese mind, it's someone who's failed the college entrance exams. This DVD set NEEDS technical notes.

(2) The DVD liners are not that useful.

(3) The English dialogue loses a lot of intricacies above and beyond simple loss of Japanese. Takahashi is a huge fan of puns and such, and this is all lost. Most notable is the loss of Yotsuya's bad poetry, including numerous attempts at haiku, often coming a syllable short or long.

Still, Viz actually did a good job with this, and I'm planning on buying the whole set. But for your sake, here are some technical notes.

Numbers:

Most of the cast has names with numbers.

Otonashi means ""no sound"" in kanji and the ""no"" part would be like zero, or the numberless manager's room.

Ichinose - ichi = 1, corresponding to room #1.

Nikaido - ni = 2 (he is only in the manga)

Mitaka - mi = 3. Mitaka is also a rich district of Tokyo, signifying that the character is well to do, and would never live in a place like Ikkoku-kan, thus room #3 is vacant. It would be like saying Mr Beverly Hills.

Yotsuya - yo = 4. As is room #4

Godai - go = 5. As in room #5

Roppongi - Ro (or roku) = 6. Roppongi is also an entertainment district of Tokyo, signifying her job as a hostess at a bar and her personality. Akemi means red beauty (since she's a red-head).

Nanao - nana = 7.

Yagami - Ya = 8.

Kujo - ku = 9.

Chigusa - chi = 1000.

A ronin is a term for student who have failed the college entrance exams and are trying to get in, often attending cram schools.

A love hotel is a hotel you go with a partner to have sex. It's like a hotel you'd rent a room by the hour. This is because a lot of Japanese households are extended, and you wouldn't have the privacy to be intimate at home.

The story is set in 1980's Tokyo and there are some facets worth mentioning. Most people do not own cars. This is a big status symbol for Mitaka. Many homes do not have baths, and so people go to public baths. In the bath, Japanese enjoy soaking in nearly scalding hot water. Trains are the primary mode of long distance travel in Tokyo, so it is often featured in the anime. Despite being a bay city, Tokyo has no beaches per se, and so it is a long trip to go to a beach despite being next to the ocean. Many people in Tokyo have 'home towns' and aren't Tokyo natives (such as Godai). Often, Tokyo natives had a sense of a lack of this 'home town' feeling, and a recurring theme in the storyline is how Ikkoku-kan has a feeling of home.",1151107200,13,5010,4.388108108108108
7991181,5,B00009L53V,Thanks for taking the time to read my review. Almost everyone knows what this anime is about so I won't go into details. I just want to answer some previous questions about this series. Most of the people are not sure how well the dubbing was handled by Viz. Don't worry I've seen 60 episodes and the dubbing has been excellent. Another question that was asked by the many fans of this anime was will there be more Maison Ikkoku dvds produced. The answer is yes and volumes 4 and 5 have already come out so make sure to pick up the box sets 4 and 5. Another important fact is that this series was first aired on 1986 and since then has been a huge hit with the fans world wide. With that being said you cannot go wrong with this product so pick up your box set today. Thanks,1118620800,5,774,4.132450331125828
7991182,4,B00009L53V,"I've watched these DVDs and they were nothing other than I expected (*and* almost perfect).  I just want to reply to the, in my opinion not really fair comment in someone else's review.  They wrote that that they didn't like it that the series seems to consist of misunderstanding piled upon misunderstanding.  The people who made the anime had no choice, they *had* to make it that way, because the manga it's based on is like that, anything else would have violated the 'spirit' of the manga.  Oh, and though it does go a bit far with that kind of thing, in the manga they also end up saying serious and amazing and just super ""real"" things, real eye openers.  I can't wait for the rest of these CD sets to come out!",1065657600,2,718,4.368421052631579
7991183,5,B00009L53V,"A superb romantic comedy, ""Maison Ikkoku"", Vol. 1, kicks off this uniquely Japanese story; but the appeal of this timeless classic is universal. Heroine, Kyoko Otonashi, ranked this year as one of the top 5 heroines of anime by a poll of 10,000 adults taken by a major Japanese newspaper. Which is saying something considering that this show ended 15 years ago.
Maison Ikkoku is a run down apartment building in Tokyo. Living there is struggling and wishy-washy college student Yusaku Godai, who falls head over heels in love with the beautiful, young manager of the building, Kyoko Otonashi. Kyoko has some feelings towards Godai, but she's a widow, and still is not over the death of her beloved husband, Soichiro.
Complicating matters between the two are rich, suave, hysterically dog-phobic, and handsome tennis coach Shun Mitaka, Godai's rival for Kyoko; and Kozue Nanao, a sweet, cute, and naive girl, who accidently becomes Godai's platonic girlfriend. Kozue is clueless that Godai is in love with Kyoko.
The crowning touch is the 3 other residents of the apartment building: hard drinking, hard partying and hard gossiping Mrs. Ichinose, who lives with her young son Kentaro; Akemi, a sexy party animal who is the bar hostess at local hangout ChaChaMaru, wearing her see-through negligee around the building; and then there's the mysterious Yotsuya, who gets his kicks out of peeping, and breaking through Godai's wall so that he can mooch food from Godai. These characters would be at home in ""A Confederacy of Dunces"".
All 3 regard Godai as their personal toy, and they get their kicks from teasing him and holding their drinking parties in his room. They also discover that Kyoko is also fun to tease.
The only problems with this DVD release is Viz. Viz has long mishandled MI, and the DVD release is no exception. No subtitles for the opening closing numbers (the opening number is quite nice, too), no extras other then textless versions of the opening and closing, but most of all, no cultural notes whatsoever. ADV and Animego would've done proper justice to this show. Maison Ikkoku is set in Japan in the 1980s, the actual time that the 15 volume manga which was the basis for the anime; the result is one of the best examinations of regular life in Japan. MI is so quintessentially Japanese, that a number of anime reference books use the series to highlight aspects of Japanese culture.
However, the humor and romance will appeal to anyone with a sense of humor, or romance. The comic usage of misunderstandings is straight from Shakespeare, and any fan of screwball comedies will be rolling on the floor with laughter. But the characters are grounded in reality, and moments of drama and romance will often take you by surprise. Godai matures as the series progresses, he's only 19 when the series starts, and we see Kyoko overcome the massive loss she suffered.
The only major bone to pick with the series is the dub version. Viz did a horrible job casting Ellen Kennedy in the role of Kyoko: her voice projects Kyoko as being tough cookie - it's not the voice of someone 21-22 years old. Sumi Shimamoto, however, is perfect, sweet, innocent, the perfect lady - which makes her shows of strength, stubbornness, jealousy and anger all the more effective. The English VA for Godai is not as bad as the English version of Kyoko, but he's not as good as Issei Futamata, who makes you understand why the gals are interested in him, while also playing the klutz quite well. The rest of the voice cast, English and Japanese, are excellent.
Despite these problems, the result is a DVD release which is vastly superior in every detail to the fansubbed versions which are available. The restored print is great, and the subtitles are both clean and a good translation. But the heart of any DVD is the story itself. By any standard, this 12 episode release for a retail price of $49.99, is reasonably priced, especially when it can be obtained for less.
The first 12 episodes introduce the important characters, and are a great example of the natural story-telling style of Japanese cinema: Where an American show would introduce all the major characters in the first episode, as well as the major plot issues, these are effectively spread out over this DVD, introducing the key characters. These episodes came out in 1986, and the age is noticeable, compared with more recent releases. However, due to the nature of this show, it does not age badly, and some of the background art is stunning.
A few notes: Godai's hiding in the closet in episode 1 is a parody on Japanese creation mythology: the sun goddess hid in a cave, only drawn out by the party caused by another goddess striping outside. The dog, Soichiro. Listen, and you will hear him called ""Soichiro-san"". The Japanese honorific ""-san"", is used only for people, and equals at that, never on a pet dog, which is why the name produces curiosity from cast members.
A great series, this DVD set is a must have for anyone interested in Japan, any fan of creator Rumiko Takahashi, (Ranma, Inu-Yasha), as it is her best work, IMHO, or any lover of comedy, romance or the combination thereof.",1057881600,54,5157,4.802024746906636

7991185,3,B00009L53V,"Well, I FINALLY got done watching this show--all ninety-bleeding-six episodes.  And, while kind of rough, I have to say that, overall, it wasn't bad.  In spite of this, however, I have awfully many bad things to say about it.
The story is that Yuhsaku Godai, a college student and later job-hunter, sort of flounders around, trying ineffectually to win the affections of Kyoko Otanashi, the manager of his boarding house while being pushed around by his obnoxious flatmates and trying to deal with several other women who inexplicably are enamored of him--all the while assailed by more marginally wacky misunderstandings than you can shake a stick at.  I realize that this description contains a number of implicit criticisms, so let's take them one by one.
Flounders--This show is utterly shapeless.  Things happen, supporting characters appear, mild wackiness transpires, but until the last twenty or so episodes, there's just no forward momentum, meaning that nothing that takes place really matters, because everything will just be exactly the same after as it was before.  Which might sort of be okay if what was happening was consistently fun in its own right, but it just isn't.  There are a few winners, but the absolute torrent of pointless and boring filler episodes ('Yotsuya's Egg,' anyone?) does the show real damage.  I'm not saying that this story couldn't have been executed well in such a large scale--I'm just saying that Ms. Takahashi lacked the skills to do so (and still does, to judge by Inuyasha).  An example of how focus could have helped: there's an early episode in which Godai and Kyoko have to climb into the boarding house's attic to deal with a power failure.  There, they find writing carved into the walls--messages from previous tenants who had to leave to fight in World War II.  This is a VERY powerful moment, and it makes one think--and hope--that the characters' story is going to be intertwined with the building's history (is IS the show's namesake, after all).  But no--instead, it's never alluded to again.  A golden opportunity, wasted.  A better writer would not have let this happen.

Ineffectually--Godai has no backbone whatsoever, which makes him a pretty bland character.  He gets a bit better towards the end, but one nonetheless is hard-put to get over the impression that his final, inevitable victory is due more to dumb luck than anything else.
Obnoxious--This is a big problem.  The other tenants in the apartment building are really unpleasant people, constantly ridiculing, harassing, and blackmailing Godai.  No, not all the time, but enough to make them much less appealing than they really ought to be, given that the basic characters are pretty cool.
Women--Godai's girlfriend-of-sorts Kozue is actually pretty great, and the viewer is left to wonder why on Earth he would possibly prefer Kyoko.  On the other hand, Yagami, a deranged high school girl who becomes obsessed with him, is, by quite some margin, my most hated anime character EVER.  Really.  I don't think I can explain; you'll have to see for yourself.
Wacky misunderstandings--The show's lifeblood, unfortunately.  Somebody gets a wrong impression that, in the real world, would be cleared up in approximately five seconds, and instead goes completely off the handle.  Godai overhears a conversation that leads him to believe that Kyoko is going to marry his rival, Mitaka.  Does he, oh, I don't know, ASK HER ABOUT IT, which would quickly have revealed that it was actually Mitaka's *sister* who was getting married?  No, because that's what an actual human would do.  Instead, he decides that the only solution is to MOVE OUT OF THE APARTMENT HOUSE, in a sequence that lasts for three.  Freaking.  Episodes.  The show is brimming with ridiculous stuff like this, which lead one to suspect that Ms. Takahashi had never actually encountered another human being, much less had any sort of relationship with one, when she wrote the manga.  The fact that it's a cartoon doesn't mean that the characters ought to behave like aliens.  Yeah, bad sitcoms do it too, but I certainly hope those aren't the measuring stick we're going by here.  I'll allow that cultural differences between east and west may accentuate its strangeness to my eyes, but you can't tell me that this stuff is normal in any culture.
Overall, Maison Ikkoku is much less than it ought to be, but, yes, I did kind of like it.  My positive impression probably stems in part from the fact that it does get rather better, on the whole, towards the end, when things finally start happening that actually have some relevance to the overall story.  And I'd go so far as to say that--in spite of its hinging on a particularly idiotic misunderstanding--Mitaka's ultimate withdrawl from the contest for Kyoko's affections is quite emotionally resonant, and makes him into one of the series' most interesting characters.  The ending's good, too.  There are flashes of brilliance all throughout the show, however (making its failings all the more frustrating, of course), which is what kept me watching.  This could have been quite literally the best thing EVER if Takahashi was a better writer; as it stands, it's still better than anything else I've ever seen by her (and it must be said--she does make the cutest kids I've ever seen).  Mind you, I saw it on fansubs; whether it's worth the three hundred-plus dollars you'd spend to buy it on commercial DVD (assuming they do end up releasing the whole thing)--that, I leave to the reader's discretion.",1057276800,14,5536,4.978260869565218
7991186,4,B00009L53V,"""Maison Ikkoku"" is one of the timeless classics of anime.  The TV series aired in the mid 1980s, but it's just as watchable - and wonderful - today as ever.  It differs from almost every other anime series in that there's nothing about this show that couldn't take place in the real world: no spaceships, no special powers, no alternate worlds.  It's simply the incredibly well-told story of a would-be college student and his love for the kind young widow that runs his apartment.  If it sounds dull, rest assured that it's not.  While some episodes take on a very soap-opera-ish quality, the storytelling in general is excellent - especially as the series goes on.
In the first twelve episodes that comprise this set, however, we're just getting to know all the characters.  The rough edges haven't come off yet, and there's not much time to do more than introduce the two (or three) love triangles that make up the show - as well as the families of Godai and Kyoko (the main characters) and the other inhabitants of the titular boarding house.
Nonetheless, it's still an absolutely wonderful show.  It's a shame Viz, the American rights-holders, didn't do more with this, the first DVD release in America.  While the audio and video quality seem decent in my admittedly not-terribly large, not-exactly high definition TV, there is only one real extra to speak of: creditless opening and ending sequences on the final disc.  It's nice to see VIz price the set reasonably low, but for my money, I still would have liked to have seen some decent extras of some kind.  Viz has, in fact, treated ""Maison Ikkoku"" quite badly in its various incarnations: releasing only two-thirds of the series on VHS (and that much only in subtitled format) at a high price with little fanfare or publicity.  With the DVD release, they seem to be in danger of not giving it much more attention - or love.  Let's hope this doesn't continue to be the case for the rest of the series, or ""Maison Ikkoku"" may not make it to the end of it's run in America on VHS or DVD...",1056844800,3,2048,4.62707182320442
7991187,5,B00009L53V,"Maison Ikkoku is perhaps the best the genre has to offer in the comedy romance category. Decent value here getting 12 episodes on one DVD. I think the distributors are giving us this value since living depicted in the story is essentially Japanese. They worry how American viewers will take to it. Fortunately, comedy / romance generally transcends cultures and it works well here. My young cousins have seen the subtitled fansub versions, and kept begging me for additional episodes to view.
 A note on the dubbing since this is not released as yet, I have no idea if the dubbing was redone from the original dubbed tape releases. If it has not been, the English version pales against the Japanese voice work. I have a few of the tapes (which they dubbed only partway through the entire 96 episode series) and the dubbing stinks. Generally I prefer the dubs since I don't speak Japanese, but this is an exception. Anyone new to this series, do yourself a big favor, set the subtitles to English and listen to this in Japanese first. After a few episodes try the dubbed setting. Unless they have redone it (which I doubt) you'll most likely prefer the Japanese as well.
 One more good thing about this series, while fairly long it had a solid and definitive ending. Many anime series end when they either just run out of gas or fan interest. They leave dozens of loose ends, and a general bad taste in the mouth of faithful viewers. Later, if enough interest lingers they will produce, lower budget, uninspired attempts made to supposedly finish the series, (really just to make money) and they fall flat. Maison had a movie released after the series finished, but it was just a rehashing of the ending, some minor plot filler, and added virtually nothing (mainly because nothing more was needed). Takahashi has created a much different, more realistic storyline here than with the earlier Urusei Yasura, and later Ranma 1/2.
 This story is linear so beware, it has a beginning, procedes along a normal timeline, and it has an ending. It is not as episodic as Takahashi's other series (most of which you can view out of order without missing a beat). If you start this and get yourself hooked, you may have to buy the next seven DVDs in this series.",1054944000,15,2249,4.674242424242424
