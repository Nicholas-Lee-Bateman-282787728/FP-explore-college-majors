3136534,5,B0014Z4OLG,"Drew is one of the wittiest and funniest comics I've heard in a loooong time, and my comedian DVD/CD collection is vast.  I think what makes him stand out from the others are that his observations are so down to earth and relateable.  He doesn't waste time talking about himself, politics or stupid topics.  He doesn't swear often, but when he does, it's at the RIGHT spot to make a funny observation even funnier.  I joined his mailing list so I don't miss him when he comes to my town.

If you're into comedy, add this to your collection!",1236988800,,540,4.414141414141414
3136535,5,B0014Z4OLG,"Drew Hastings is a very refreshing performer! He tells his stories with the pauses in the right place, his facial expressions are so varied. He talks as if he's up there to have a chat with friends, not an audience. This man is one of the funniest, spot on comedians ever. BUY THIS DVD!
Thanks for the laughs Drew!",1229731200,3,314,4.338983050847458
3136536,3,B0014Z4OLG,"Most of Drew Hasting's material can make you chuckle if you're in a good mood and he does get funnier as he gets further into his set. But, he's 50 and no George Carlin. And he's dating a younger girl, and he's no Robert Smigel. He's got decent material but it doesnt hold up throughout. I'm kind of glad he didn't get extremely nasty but he does have some crotch jokes. He's not as self deprecating as most comics, but he delivers stuff in such a somber way, you kind of wish he'd beat himself up a little more so his act matches his voice. I was surprised when he talked about his younger girlfriend because I had assumed he was gay. I also assumed he was British (I mean, look at the cover of the DVD ...) but he's not that either.  He also talks about farming and hunting.  An interesting guy perhaps, but just your average comic.",1229299200,,834,4.238993710691824

I was not disappointed as he's funnier than I could have imagined.  I just had to have the DVD and I have watched it over & over and still laugh.

I found myself sitting in my chair, really wanting to like this guy, but I didn't even chuckle for most of this special.

I hadn't heard of him before but I thought it would be cool to get in a Comedy Central taping.  I am so glad I went, Drew has an instant fan in me!  I laughed so hard that I lost one of my contacts (I tear up when I laugh).  But it was totally worth it.  He covered a lot of things, from road trips with his younger girlfriend to not having children to (unsuccessfully) coyote hunting alone while clinically depressed.  I ended up driving two hours away to catch another show the next month and that was just as good.  I can't wait till he tours close to here again, but until then, I'll definitely be watching him on his DVD!",1209859200,,723,4.121428571428571

8256776,4,B0014Z4OLG,"This stand-up comedian paints pictures on larger canvasses, rather than just delivering a splash of one-liners. He really lets you live his trials and tribulations, for example on his farm  a deer-hunting poseur  a tractor-riding dandy. Hes a raffish version of the sort of storyteller that Woody Allen started his stand-up career as, on venues such as The Ed Sullivan Show.

Hastings has a compelling genius for the art of stand-up comedy, and I hope he makes more DVDs. The only reason Im giving this performance 4-stars rather than 5 is that theres a certain mean-spiritedness that runs through Hastings narratives that damped my enthusiasm for him just a little. Hes especially derogatory about his girlfriends. However, he does sort of soften that attack persona with moments of sly, self-deprecating self-awareness. He mentions the string of problematic girlfriends hes had  virtually a dozen whackos in succession - and in mock beleaguerment he asks the audience, What are the odds?

On the whole though, youll find a transport of hilarity here. But with Hastings graphic examination of topics such as the effects of Viagra and certain love-making techniques  this is not necessarily for the whole family.",1407542400,,1212,5.18974358974359

His girl friend, his farm and his observations on his advancing years -- always funny -- often with an edge -- will keep you wanting more!
I caught Drew while channel surfing at 4 AM one morning.  It was this very performance.
I simply HAD to find it again! [...] is his quirky little website.  I was directed where to look for this DVD.
