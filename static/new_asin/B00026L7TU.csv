8022695,5,B00026L7TU,"Documentary style presentation about the tremendous role our Pastors played in our nations founding and in the Revolutionary War. Excellent presentation, lots of history, lots of footnotes, very interesting for any history buff or anyone wanting to see what you never learned in school.",1357084800,,286,5.5227272727272725
8022696,5,B00026L7TU,"I had watched America's Godly Heritage by David Barton with Wallbuilders and wanted to watch this DVD after watching it. This is for rent on Blockbuster but not on Netflix (at least at this time), although the America's Godly Heritage you can stream on netflix or rent by mail. Both this DVD and the America's Godly Heritage DVD are very similar, but really great for hearing sources quoted and reviewed that are first hand books, documents and court rulings and not interviews with so called experts today or text book writers, but the items read and reviewed and looked into in this are all first account sources. It is so shocking how today our text books have become propaganda leaving out and ignoring all of the facts of our country's history.",1315785600,,749,4.7251908396946565
