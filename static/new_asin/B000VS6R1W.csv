2946506,5,B000VS6R1W,"Filmmaker Marlo Poras has done it again with another beautiful documentary film that captures the heart, soul, and courage of an American original, Doris ""Granny D"" Haddock. At the age of 90 she walks across the US to bring attention to corruption in politics, and at the age of 94 she runs for the US senate! I can't even get up in the morning and put on pants! Poras frames the life of this troublemaker in both intimate and expansive ways, connecting her own struggles as a great great grandmother fighting mortality and a citizen fighting to make America the country worth being proud of again. A marvelous film.",1222992000,4,616,4.660550458715596
2946507,5,B000VS6R1W,"I've been a huge fan of Marlo Poras's filmmaking since Mai's America, and Run Granny Run is an extraordinary film.  It's not just that Granny D is such a smart and inspirational woman.  It's that her actions open our eyes in a very powerful way to the fact that ""democracy is not something we HAVE, it's something we DO.""",1221955200,2,321,4.423728813559322
2946508,5,B000VS6R1W,"Granny D's story is one of a kind!  She is a fantastic, amazing human being.  I love this dvd.  I cannot say enough about this story.  I recommend it to everyone.",1202860800,2,162,4.129032258064516
2946509,5,B000VS6R1W,"This film provides insight into Granny D's senate run in New Hampshire.  It also covers her cross-country walk for campaign finance reform, which culminated in the McCain-Feingold Act.
The film has many lovely shots of New Hampshire, planning sessions at Granny's house, and the work her campaign did to put a little pressure on the Republican incumbent, Judd Gregg.  It also didn't edit out the hard work of politics nor the moments when Granny was in a bad mood or feeling sort of overwhelmed by the demands being put on her.  There's a hilarious scene when she's preparing for her televised debate with the professional politician.  She stumbled early on in the actual debate, but ended up making many important points.
We need for more progressive people to run for office, advocate for various causes, and otherwise make their voices heard.

For a magazine that regularly covers grassroots citizen action throughout the US and abroad, I'd recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yes/dp/B00006L2TG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yes!</a>",1201996800,3,1082,5.7375

2946512,5,B000VS6R1W,"This film is about so much more than an unexpected Senate run by a senior citizen.  It is about making the most of every minute of our lives, of one woman's determination to help make the world a better place and step up to the plate in spite of a million reasons not to.  It's about age, yet it's not just about age.  We see through Doris's eyes how an elderly person is sometimes dismissed and treated like a child, in spite of an obviously quick mind and reported history as a smart and successful businesswoman.  Yet we also see Doris as the ""regular citizen"" who fights for what she believes in and doesn't wait for others to do it -- a lesson we all can learn at any age.  I loved this film!",1192060800,5,697,4.1716417910447765

8219673,5,B000VS6R1W,"Incredible film. Very uplifting especially in 2018 as our government increases its downhill momentum to stunning big-money corruption. Granny D shows the value of trying, even if it's hard, even if people laugh, even if you have to walk thousands of miles at age 90 and run for senate at 94, and even if you lose. We all have to die. May's well do good while we can, and with fiery massive fierce love for people, truth, Earth, our land and God.",1518220800,,445,4.439024390243903

8219680,5,B000VS6R1W,"I highly recommend this video to demonstrate what a person is capable of with a little determination and guts, despite their age.

Granny D is one of those 'spunky eldsters' who helped me to realize that you don't have to complacently ""go over the hill"" after your turn 50.  When she was 89 years old,  Doris ""Granny D"" Haddock walked across the entire United States, a distance of nearly 3,200 miles,. Granny D was not an athlete, just a little old grandmotherly type from New Hampshire who decided to do something grand instead of sitting at home being depressed after her husband died. When she completed the 14-month journey, which took her across the Mojave Desert and the Appalachian mountains, she wrote: ""The walk, I must say, improved my health. ... I finished the walk twenty years younger than when I started. It was good for my arthritis and emphysema.""

To celebrate her 85th birthday, my mother-in-law, Joseta, took her first skydiving lesson.  She sent us the video and said she did it ""to surprise her children.""  Joseta is another grandmotherly type who decided to not be an old fuddy-duddy.  All across the country and around the world, we find an increasing number of men and women in their sixties, seventies, eighties and even nineties, who are in excellent health and have better physiques than many men and women decades younger. However, most of us don't see older people this way.

All us baby boomers need to look to the example of Granny D and other spunky eldsters to stay in shape as we get older.  As I discovered myself, regular exercise leads to physical fitness and a better quality of life as we get older.

8219681,5,B000VS6R1W,"It's greatly entretining and a stimulating documentary. It's America at its best. If you think this is not anymore the land of opportunity or you have the ""However,its too late for me"" kind of attitude, don't miss it, it will change your mind.",1250380800,2,243,4.674418604651163
8219682,4,B000VS6R1W,"A home movie type tribute to the campaign of Doris Haddock who is a great citizen who does not want special interest running this country into the ground and fought for it. The recent financial meltdown is a direct result of the corruption that exists in Washington and Wall Street, against which she fought. I also feel hat campaign financing reform is absolutely essential in returning the control back to the people and out of the hands of the special interests",1231891200,3,464,4.7407407407407405
