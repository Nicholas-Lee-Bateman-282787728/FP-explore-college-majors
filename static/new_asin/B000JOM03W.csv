2678383,5,B000JOM03W,This is a wonderful movie for babies!  It is a little old but it is very entertaining.,1278892800,,86,4.0588235294117645
2678384,5,B000JOM03W,My 7 month old baby loves this video. I watched my two nephews 10 years ago enjoy it and knew I had to get it when I had a baby. She likes to watch it about 4 times a day and she claps and makes noises while watching it. She loves the penguins that play peek a boo and when we took the family to Sea World she responded to the penguin exhibit exactly like she does with the video.  She loves it!,1231286400,,395,3.7590361445783134
2678385,5,B000JOM03W,"This video was created for young explorers and their parents to share. It's a joyful parade of children, music, laughter and surprises. Its combination of bright images, puppets and play will make your child's first video an exciting visual journey.",1210464000,,249,5.25
8152575,5,B000JOM03W,"My two toddlers watched this daily when it was on hulu. The day it disappeared from their site, there were tears and quite a few meltdowns at the loss of ""peek"" from my kids' bedtime routine. Finding this available on Amazon was a huge relief. It offers a great way to get the kids to relax.",1481155200,,291,4.214285714285714
8152576,5,B000JOM03W,"Sweet and gentle. Got us through a very tough bout of collic and bottle rejection. If our daughter aas watching, she didn't seem to notice the much hated bottle while I was at work. Four years later, she still likes to watch it, especially when she is sick. It is such a sweet and gentle show.",1476835200,,293,4.25
8152577,5,B000JOM03W,"This video is a life saver. My daughter loves it. We don't let her watch much tv, but this is one of the few things we have and it allows us to get a little cleaning in here and there. Our baby loves all the babies and puppets.",1476316800,,227,3.75
8152578,5,B000JOM03W,I had this on VHS when my daughter was a baby.. She loved the simple interactive video. I downloaded this video because.. She recently had her first child.. And actually asked for it.  27 yrs later,1464998400,,197,4.472222222222222
8152579,5,B000JOM03W,"Kid loves it. I feel bad admiring to letting my under-1 kid watch TV but sometimes you just need 10 minutes to do something kid free. It's simple, engaging (slow- which is what you want in a little kid show anyway and not the ""fast switch"" type shows people blame for attention span issues anyway) and gives me some hands free time!",1448150400,,332,4.370967741935484

8152581,5,B000JOM03W,My cousins and I loved this when we were little. I was so happy to have found it and play it for my 8 month old son. He loves it just like we did! :),1413676800,,149,3.2857142857142856
8152582,4,B000JOM03W,"Yes, this is good. I only wish they would make it in a DVD format.",1409961600,,66,3.466666666666667
8152583,2,B000JOM03W,"The video was simple and cute. I wish there were more muppets and less repetitive lines like ""peek""! It got very old very fast. I am still a huge fan of Jim Henson!",1392681600,,164,4.0
8152584,5,B000JOM03W,This was an absolute favorite of my now 25 year old daughter. I searched and searched for a copy for my toddler grandson. Finally found it on Amazon Prime for streaming. Cracks my grandson up just like it did my daughter.,1385683200,,221,4.414634146341464
