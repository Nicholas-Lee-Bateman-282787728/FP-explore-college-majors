This is an excellent series. It has action, drama, and suspense. The animation, plot, voice acting, and soundtrack are all excellent. There are also lots of great characters and plot twists. I try to be objective and think of just 1 bad thing to say about this series, but I can't. This is an all around incredible story. CLAMP has done it again! This is a must see for every anime fan.",1355184000,,631,4.48695652173913
7996526,5,B0000AC8OQ,"The outline that follows is an outline that refers to the entire series and spoilers will be included.

To begin with, if you are looking for an anime that is more in the style of Love Hina, than you should skip this one. If on the other hand, you are looking for an anime that is powerful, emotional, has love/romance, great character development and strong story, than you are definitely right here.

Outline of the story:

The story resolves around the Seven guardians of Heaven and the Seven guardians of Earth. The one group wants to preserve earth as it, believes in humanity no matter what they have done to earth, and hope for a better future. The other group wants to erase humanity from the face of earth so that the planet and its other creatures can life in peace etc.

The `problem' is that when watching the show you will - like it or not - agree with both groups (not to mention the fact that there is no `black - white answer' but a grey version (You will have to watch it in order to understand or otherwise I will give the entire show away, sorry guys)). Apart from it, the age of the group members does not matter much; meaning that you will see in both groups' teenagers and adults fighting side-by-side or against each other till death. Others will fight against the other group for their own personal reasons.

The biggest problem however is that there can be only one Kamui (chosen one) and the side he decides to follow will win; but, it proofs that the real Kamui has a twin star, meaning that there is another Kamui out there as well. This will lead to an explosive mixture of emotions. Lovers, who will belong to the opposing group, will be forced to fight till death against each other, brother against brother, best friend against best friend and so forth. To be honest, the story will get very emotional indeed. No matter the age, the group members will fight and die.

As for the action, you will get more than enough. To begin with, the fights occur in both astral plane and our materialistic world. In order to prevent damages in our world, the group members are able to form a kind of a shield, in which most fights happen, and no matter the destruction our reality remains unaltered. That is, if the fights remain inside the shield, something that will not always be the case. In addition, all group members have their own supernatural `super powers' etc. For instance, some can use the five elements, some others are psychics, some others use magic, some take advantage of technology, some bend reality etc.

Who will win in the end and what will be the cost of this destructive victory?

The genre of this anime could be categorized under: fantasy, supernatural, action, and love / romance.

The music that accompanies the show is very well orchestrated and good. Starts with a rock/pop song and ends up with a melancholic ballad. In-between the music changes in accordance with the shows (very good done).

As for the dub, in my humble opinion, it is very good and professional done, in the same level as CB is done.

The animation is excellent.

As for extras, it has more or less the typical stuff: Textless opening and ending, previews, trailers etc.

As for the box-set: The first DVD comes with the box and every DVD you buy it fits in there; imagine it something like a shelf.

As for the story: It is very emotional, has great character development, solid storyline (that moves forth and back, with flashbacks etc.), many twists and is very mature and character driven.

Tip: The first episode, called X-0, of the first DVD is like a prelude and `summation' of the story. If you don't want anything to be given to you in front but want to be glued to your sits from episode one, that skip this one.

Last but not least, is it worth buying or not? In two words: Definitely yes! However, by collecting all 8 volumes the cost may raise around $200. To be honest, it is worth having in your collection but if the cost might seem to you as an obstacle than try to rent it and to watch it.  The show is highly recommended!

I hope that I could help you, if so than please click on the yes button below ^_^",1156118400,2,4144,4.466225165562914
7996527,5,B0000AC8OQ,"If you really like the action end of X, you'll deffinately like these three episodes. So much happens in this DVD and so much action. What's even better is that my four favourite characters (Karen, Yuto, Seiichiro (Mr. Aoki), and Satsuki) are main features in these three episodes. What am I saying? I love all the characters so much. I can't choose favourites! Oh well. Anyway, this is a GREAT DVD, deffinately worth buying if you're into X. Plus the music is just beautiful!",1086048000,,476,4.678571428571429
7996528,5,B0000AC8OQ,"One of the notable things about Director Yoshiaki Kawajiri's presentation of CLAMP's noted manga series is his willingness to slow the progress of the story in order to properly develop the character.  He has done this seamlessly, but now the story has to shift into action, as the interplay of personalities begins to give way to the momentum of the building conflict between Kamui Shirou and his 'twin star,' Fuma Monou.  It is time for the real conflict between the dragons to play out - will the earth be saved for it's inhabitants, or will everything be destroyed in order to be remade.
There have been preliminary clashes, but these three episodes mark the beginning of the final devolution.  Three of the Seven Seals - Sorata, Seiichiro, and Karen come into direct conflict with three of the Angels - Satsuki, Nataku, and Yuto.  Strike and counterstrike play against each other in a complex interplay that is almost dance-like - and utterly unpredictable.
Even now, Kawajiri uses external events to look within the conflict, as the players discover reveal their inward struggles and discover love and redemption in unexpected moments.  In a truly focused delivery of what will no doubt be one of the legendary works of anime, the various elements are carefully kept in balance.  At the end of these episodes, the viewer knows instinctively that nothing has been resolved, that the spring has only been wound tighter.
Do not attempt to start this series in the middle - even if you are familiar with the manga.  Kawajiri's art comes together at its own pace.  While he never completely deviates from the original story, he manages to make it into something more than its origins - something the feature film was unable to do.  To be successful, the effect has to mature in the viewer's mind.",1067040000,4,1797,4.84640522875817
7996529,5,B0000AC8OQ,"This is a very good DVD. The first episode, Inferno, tells about Karen's
childhood and how she and Mr. Aoki met. In Inferno, Mr. Aoki challenges Yuto
to a match, but Karen drugs him and goes to battle Yuto instead. But when
Nataku shows up, Karen and him/her battle. Nataku is easily defeated. Then
Yuto shows up and attacks Karen, but Mr. Aoki shows up and rescues her, they
all agree to postpone the match so they can regroup. In the second episode,
Ripple, Sotata and Arashi finally kiss. But not before Arashi and Yuzuriha
have a battle with Fuma, in which Fuma tells Arashi that she will kill
Sorata. Sorata rescues Arashi and they then spend the night together. Arashi
then goes to confront Fuma. In the third episode, Current, Mr. Aoki and Yuto
square off. The battle seems pretty equal until Satsuki helps Yuto by
entangling Mr. Aoki in wires. But Beast is acting up with Satsuki, Beast is
jealous that she loves Yuto, so he is not obeying and hurting her. Karen
shows up and battles Yuto. Is she willing to give her life for Aoki? Watch
to find out.",1066694400,,1058,4.487046632124352
7996530,3,B0000AC8OQ,"All in all, I'd actually say that this was an enjoyable DVD save for one thing - if you're an X comic purist, you'll be vastly disappointed with the deviations from the manga.  Certain characters who should've made special reappearances have failed to do so, and certain characters who're still going strong in the comics have received the short end of the stick from the anime director.
So now it's three different versions of X.  The 'kill everything in sight' movie, the 'let's rush the end and sploot people while we're at it' anime, and the eternally unfinished comic.
Oye.
If you like action, you'll enjoy this DVD a lot.  However, if you're looking for conformity to what's been produced and are expecting it due to the relative following that's been taking place in the last 6 volumes, look no further - here's where it goes right out the window.
Still, it's X.
Enjoy it while it lasts - only one volume left.",1066608000,3,917,4.613496932515337
