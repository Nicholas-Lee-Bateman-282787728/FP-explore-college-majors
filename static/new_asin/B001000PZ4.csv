I found this video a few years ago and got me started ice dancing.  There's no substitute for a good coach, but these videos are great introduction and reference. I still go back to them to check on style details. I'm lucky because I live in an area where there are several Ice Dance coaches but if you don't, this is a great way to learn the basics and see examples of good, solid technique.",1478304000,,522,4.21

The idea behind the DVD is solid, and the production quality is fine. The DVD goes through the most basic of ice dancing's traditional 'compulsory dances' a couple of times, and it gives some hints on what to focus on.

Sadly, the skating is wooden. The skaters in this DVD just don't have the style or ease of performance needed for a good tuition DVD, and they lack passion or emotion in their skating.

The DVD may also be frustrating for those outside the USA, as the dances follow the test sequence there. The test levels in other countries share some of these dances, but not all.

For those who love anything ice dance, you'll want to add this DVD to your collection.

But for those who are wanting a good tuition DVD to supplement their on-ice lessons with a coach, you'd be far better off looking out for the Usova & Zhulin DVD put out by the ISU some years back. Another alternative is to go and search on the internet for footage of the top skaters doing the compulsory dances at events like the Olympics, Worlds and the US Nationals. Sadly 'compulsories', as we knew them, have now been deleted from top level competitions by the ISU, so ice dance students won't have a constant stream of new examples coming their way. Nonetheless, you can surely do better than this DVD if you're seriously interested in learning ice dance.

What we really need is a top couple like Tessa Virtue & Scott Moir to put together a 'How-To Ice Dance' DVD. Torvill & Dean did one once, the Usova & Zhulin. A version by the current Olympic champions would be wonderful!!!",1303344000,3,1679,4.470588235294118
