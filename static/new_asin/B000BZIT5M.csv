2450041,2,B000BZIT5M,"To give my background with this production, I first saw this on VHS several years ago and bootleg copied the VHS for my own personal viewing.  It was this lovely production with its wonderful performance by Ileana Cotrubas and Neil Shicoff which led me to really get into opera.  I remember being chilled to the bone when I first heard Che gelida manina and Si, mi chiamano mimi...  So I was terribly excited to see that they FINALLY released this on DVD in the US.  Well I listened to this as soon as I got and was noticed that they did their digital magic and cleaned up this over 30 year old video quite well.  The colors and sharpness are as good as they can be, however, I was terribly disappointed with the sound.  I'm not sure how this can be because of all the technology at their disposal.  The voices sounded like they were in some large hall, and the balance with the orchestra was completely off.  I know that Shicoff doesn't have the most commanding voice, but you could clearly hear him on the old VHS version.  When both Shicoff and Cotrubas are being drowned out by the orchestra you have to wonder what went wrong.  It isn't always noticeable, but severely diminished my enjoyment of my favorite parts, that being the arias in the first act between Rodolfo and Mimi.  So, don't buy this DVD.  What a terrible disappointment and waste of money.  The most important part of a transfer of the opera HAS to be the sound!",1136073600,21,1433,4.444444444444445
2450042,5,B000BZIT5M,"Of all the versions I have seen, this is the one I enjoy the most. The singing is excellent, Neil Schicoff (Rodolfo) in particular is brilliant both as a singer and as an actor, and the turbulent relationship of Marcello and Musetta is hilarious without turning into a parody as in so many other productions.

And for once all of the key caracters act really well. When all the friends are together in Rodolfo's apartment in act 1, there's a real chemistry between them, certainly better than in most films about friends, and they seemingly have no trouble fooling around with each other in a very natural way while still singing well. The production is traditional, but warm and with an old-time Disney flavour to it (in a good way), and the camera angles and cuts are tastefull and well considered.",1135296000,22,800,4.673758865248227

Both principal character actors are perfectly suited for their roles, Marcelo couldn't be better but, people ..... I tell you, I could NEVER have even imagined a more suitable Musetta than Nicole Cabell. Unlike many opera divas, her facial expressions, alone, were a tour de force performance. Musetta, as only acted and superbly sung by Ms. Cabell, is now my all-time favorite operatic character.

2450060,5,B000BZIT5M,"Robert Dornhelm's film version of Puccini's beloved opera ""La Boheme"" is absolutely beautiful.  He interprets the story and it's music with delicate sensitivity and a refinement unseen in many filmed versions of opera.  He uses delicate nuances throughout the film to both inspire and make this love story come to full life.  Maestro Giacomo Puccini himself would watch in ""awe"" the incredibly beautiful interpretation of his opera.  The barely furnished and cold garret apartment in the old Parisian quarter is portrayed artistically with an authentic time period setting enhanced by subtle lighting effects which reflect the cold and desolate winter outside while attempting to bring warmth inside to the three young handsome bohemian type men who frolic and entertain each other and try to forget their poverty and the cold of winter.  Rolando Villazon is an ardent and charismatic Rodolfo.  One can see that he is deeply engrossed in the part and gives it his all both vocally and visually.  His love for Mimi can not be mistaken.  His every movement and facial expression portray what most would want true love to look like.  Anna Netrebko is both beautiful in appearance and gives a pure and innocent interpretation of the ailing Mimi.  Vocally she excels in this role.  The onlooker can see her slow deterioration from Act Two into Act Three, particularly noted in the dark circles appearing around her eyes and her lust for life slowly diminishing as she trys to let Rodolfo know her intense love for him.  George Von Bergen does a wonderful interpretation of the playful Marcello who remains enthralled with the coquettish Musetta played by Nicole Cabel.
Vocally the film is beautifully sung but the use of film and lighting are what tie the experience together for viewer who cannot overlook these brilliant effects.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves Puccini and his opera ""La Boheme"" and I guarantee you will be hard pressed to make comparison to a live staged performance.  I would say the film must exceed the live performance in it's interpretation and artistry.  And I might add that I found myself tearful several times throughout the film from the dramatic and touching moments of the lovers struggling to make sense of their situations.  Don't miss an opportunity to view this film.",1416268800,,2316,5.007832898172324

2450065,5,B000BZIT5M,"Tragic, timeless, Puccini brilliantly performed by the  outstanding duo of Villazon and Netrebko. Rolando Villazon is the charming Rodolfo and I believe one of the best male character actors on the opera stage today. His ability to capture his character with a gesture, a movement or a facial expression is priceless. He has the most expressive face! Tenderness, comedy, despair are transformed by his ability to translate them with his body movements and facial expressions. Most opera performers are so fixed on the music they forget to act the role, giving their characters a stiff presence on stage secondary to the music. The ones that are great actors as well as great singers become the superstars. Placido Domingo as Otello, Jonas Kaufman as Don Jose, Renee Fleming as Violetta, Franco Corelli as Manrico to name a few great actors in their roles... Anna Netrebko  as Mimi...  When Pavarotti performed ""Che gelida  manina at the Met and Andrea Bocelli sang it on CD it was captivating but not particularly memorable. When Rolando Villazon acts it out, not only is it breathtakingly beautiful but an unforgettable and convincing performance; he IS Rodolfo, a poet! When he tells Mimi he is penniless but a millionaire in dreams and aspirations and ideas your heart swells with the optimism of this man's dreams. Likewise Anna Netrebko as Mimi is equally captivating in her pathos and frailty and that flawless soprano voice.  I hate to compare operatic voices as ""better than X but not as good as Y"" because I love each performer's voice for their separate unique characteristics. But I have one thing to say about Anna Netrebko: Among sopranos, I can listen to Netrebko's voice on my ipod for hours on end without tiring. It has a richer timbre and clarity than her contemporaries which I find very satisfying and pleasing to the ear and the imagination.",1406160000,5,1862,4.936102236421725

2450075,5,B000BZIT5M,"An outstanding accessible movie of one of the most accessible operas.
An interesting and human approach to the already realistic human story in the opera.  All the changes to the traditional interpretation of Mimi and Rodolfo appear to be consistent with the libretto and make the characters more human and relevant, at least to todays listener.
Netrebko and Villazon are top stars in todays opera world.  They deliver the performances expected of such stars.  Clearly the transition from the stage to the movie set presented problems, but they are not fatal to a movie of the opera.
The use of actors in some of the roles helps tell the story but can be a distraction  However, it is a movie, not a live performance.
The sound quality is a negative, particularly since it is a movie.  There is a lot of background noise which is more than distracting in an opera.  Particularly, Act III sounds more like a blizzard than a snowstorm.
Netrebko and Villazon although, as always, a little old for the characters they portray in this pretty realistic interpretation, are about as true a Mimi and Rodolfo as opera stars are likely to be.  Netrebko is not the slim sexy vibrant Violette of the Salzburg DVD of La Traviata, but a more mature pregnant woman, a real loss.
Overall a thoughtful, excellent production of a great opera.  A great gift for someone who has expressed an interest in opera.",1389312000,3,1390,4.738589211618257

2450079,4,B000BZIT5M,"How can the opera be both, simultaneously?
  I bought this, because I like the combination of Villazn and Netrebko. I saw them, together, in the Met's presentation of La Bohme, which I found excellent.
  Let's start with the failures. First, the film is lip synched. The lip synching, especially in Villazn's ""Che Gelida Manina,"" is so bad that, at times, his lip motions don't even come close to the words allegedly pouring out. There are only minor lip synch errors, throughout the rest of the film. Second, when Mimi is singing her ""Si, mi chiamano Mimi,"" she's moving and looking all over the place, including on the internal staircase to the roof, when she should be facing and singing, directly, to Villazn. While the quality of the photography is excellent, it's direction leaves much to be desired. The constant zoom-ins, zoom-outs, split screens and cuts are, at best, annoying and amateurish.
  Netrebko's red, velvet dress, in the scene when she first enters the garret, is completely out of place, for a poor girl. The quality and style are totally inconsistent and way above the level which would be believable, for a young girl, who works, as an embroiderer of flowers, in a sweat shop type factory.
  Because of the poor lip synching, I could not recommend this, as anyone's first viewing of this opera but, for those of us familiar with it, you may want to add it to your collection.
  Now, for the positives: The quality of the singing is absolutely fabulous. Villazn and Netrebko are in perfect form. Villazn is so drawn and almost emaciated, in this film, that he makes the part of a staving poet/playwright absolutely believable. The role of Marcello, which is normally assigned to a second stringer, was sung excellently.
  This version is, also, the first time I've seen Musetta and Mimi properly portrayed. Too often, Musetta is portrayed an nothing more than an innocent flirt. She is the local trollop, who will gladly fill the bed of any male who is willing to keep her. Unfortunately, for her, she is, also, conflicted, by her deep and passionate love, for Marcello. The voice of Nicole Cabelle, as Musetta, is, also, excellent and, hopefully, we'll see more of her, in strong roles.
  Some folks have suggested that the bed scene may not be appropriate. I disagree. Mimi is not a naive, innocent, young girl. She was conceived, by Puccini, as an ill-educated, poor, unwell, hard, street-reared and street smart young woman, with an attitude of ""live life, while I can."" Her depiction, here, is perfect, not harsh, inappropriate or incorrect.
  The combination of the perfect singing, with the properly portrayed characterizations, make this a keeper.",1382918400,8,2678,4.917777777777777

But the singing simply lacks the lustre it had on other occasions when the two of them just seemed to inspire each other.  I really haven't heard Villazon since the beginning of his vocal distress and I was pleased to hear the lovely voice was not entirely threadbare, that he could match Netrebko beautiful sound for beautiful sound.

The film with Netrebko and Villazon is frustrating for both technical and artistic reasons. Mimi requires a full lyric soprano voice and Netrebko has it. But her rendition is unpolished and slovenly, with scant attention paid to the requisite Italianate style, with questionable choices of phrasing, and with recurring mistakes of enunciation. I am not a big fan of Villazon, not so much because of his voice as because of his tendency to over-act...his Rodolfo is too playful, to the point of becoming a caricature of Rodolfo.",1356307200,5,787,4.917293233082707

2450091,3,B000BZIT5M,"And whatever you do don't waste your time trying to get it to work in surround sound, because in 5.1 the voices are hopelessly recessed even for the long shots and in an even more unconvincing acoustic.
This is another example of how NOT to make an opera film. It's not enough to make a good recording and then make a visually good film that more or less synchronises with the picture: you must conceive the two together and make sure they work together in terms of accoustic match and the way the characters are positioned in relation to each other. The following things need to be kept always in mind by the makers of the DVD - just so that they are never in the mind of the listener:

a) differences in the position of the singers should affect their vocal projection and volume - visually, in terms of the perceived physical effort of the singers as well as aurally, in relation to how we would hear that position relatively - e.g. they cannot have Villazon singing at full 'stage-volume' to the dying Mimi six inches in front of her face.
Intimate scenes should be close-miked with singers projecting much less - this is really taking full advantage of the medium to do things that cannot be done in the opera house.

b) the perspective image of depth as it affects the volume of the voices in relation to the other singers or their prevous position in the scene.

c) the left-right stereo image as it relates picture and sound to each other, which for example should match when the picture changes from full view of the scene to close-up when the voices need to be in the middle of the sound stage and the voices more closely miked.

d) there should be an effort to distinguish between the likely accoustic of the perceived scene - especially when the scene is going to be changed to an entirely different one - as we expect on the basis of our normal experience.

These considerations mean therefore that they cannot use the same recording they intend to release on CD, but that instead they must make a separate recording, or at least a separately engineered recording, only intended for the DVD.
If they can't manage to do any of these things as too difficult they should simply record the singing on set and not try to be too filmic with the cameras and editing. It is likely that in most cases, when for example there are no intimate scenes, they might as well film a live performance in the opera house - unless of course they intend to try filming outdoors.
Even if all the points mentioned are observed it is still highly unlikely, when film footage is edited to 'fit' the prerecorded sound, that the viewer will be deceived into thinking he is hearing the characters actually singing in the scene, no matter how good the effort by the singer/actors to give that impression.
The main impression one gets from this production is of a tremendous amount of good intentions.  But it's all to no avail, no matter how good the visual aspect is in itself, because the sound simply does not fit the picture and the very lively visuals completely distract from the music, which includes the singing of course.
Every time I try to watch this film I end up wishing that the characters were speaking the words instead of singing them. At least then we would have a unique version of La Boheme as a play. Actually come to think of it a speaking soundtrack could have been included as an extra on the Blueray disc as an alternative. The naturalism of the mise-en-scene and the lively and imaginative direction are so impressive that it's a pity that it all goes to waste.

Oh well, at least you can listen without the picture.",1348531200,4,3626,4.5182926829268295
2450092,3,B000BZIT5M,"The voices were glorious, but I personally was not as moved as I was in other productions of La Boheme.

In every one of them. Anna sings so effortlessly it is a joy to watch her. (I also have her in Le Nozzi di Figaro). However, I really love this movie version. I recognized the symptoms of TB right off. Anna presents advancing sickness so well, is so vulnerable right from the beginning. The four men act as if they are really young and struggling, happy to excess when money is available for them to pretend to an evening of fun. The moodiness of the entire movie drags one into the story. Even the evening of laughter and gaiety we know will end with all characters returning to desperate times. The search for love unattainable seems to be everyone's story in this. Finally Rodolfo and Mimi admit there undying love just as the inevitable happens. I mean this IS opera. The conclusion is forgone. Only four stars due to Villazon's effort. And it does seem to be an effort for him. Had anyone told me I would like Opera or Ballet a year ago I would have smote his nose.

2450098,5,B000BZIT5M,"An opera film is vastly different from a recorded live performance, and it is impossible to compare the two.  Each has its own peculiarities and appeal.

Robert Dornhelm's film of ""La Bohme"" is amazingly good.  As a favourite opera, I've seen and heard many versions, and did not really expect to find anything ""new"" in this one.  How wrong I was!  At first viewing, it seemed as if I caught my breath at the start and didn't let it go until the last note died with Mimi.

The sets are realistic and evocative of the time period and the changing seasons that underline the story.  The attention to little details is wonderful ... the rough table manners of the hungry men, the way Rodolfo fusses over the faint Mimi, his visible ""gulp"" as her closeness begins to affect him, the good natured teasing he receives from the others at Momus, the warming of Mimi's medicine in the final scene.

Anna Netrebko's singing is just glorious.  Her Mimi is different from most - ill she may be, but she is certainly not helpless or emotionally fragile.  This is a girl who probably knows she doesn't have a long future, and is therefore determined to make the most of every day.  She initiates the ""candle"" episode, and when love comes, she seizes it.

The Rodolfo of Rolando Villazn is a young man caught in a whirlwind of unexpected events - the almost unbelievable coming of love to his life, the inevitable possessiveness, the torment of his inability to save Mimi's life with his love, the ultimate despair.  He looks the part, acts the part superbly, and his wonderful voice carries his heart (and mine!) on its waves.

This film was my first experience of the compelling artistic partnership of Mr Villazn and Ms Netrebko, and I can certainly see why they received such acclaim. ""O Soave Fanciulla"" simply took my breath away ... and from the director's comments in the bonus documentary, that reaction was not unique to me.

The supporting cast members are likewise believable in every way - I was especially impressed with the Musetta of Nicole Cabell.  Her allure is achieved with subtle nuances of expression rather than ""in-your-face"" brashness ... an interesting and very appealing interpretation which reveals an underlying depth not often seen in the character of Musetta until the final scene.

The bonus documentary is excellent - including ""behind the scenes"", and insightful interviews with director and cast.  It enables us to see firsthand the challenges of creating a successful operatic story when filming the scenes devoid of a live audience, orchestra and stage.

A professional reviewer in an Australian arts magazine recently labelled this ""the finest opera film of the last two decades"".  I agree with him.",1319673600,5,2722,4.85064935064935

From the beginning Mimi is dressed like a harlot -- in red, with plunging dcollet, large exposed breasts, and bright red lipstick.

The set colors in general are loud and bright, the sets are incongruous, and the  cinematography is grossly oversaturated in an almost cartoonish fashion.

2450101,5,B000BZIT5M,This is the most beautiful La Boheme I ever experienced.  The magnificence the of the screen only added to what was already the classic that La Boheme has always been.,1316995200,2,167,4.566666666666666

2450103,4,B000BZIT5M,"The foremost thing to say is that this film moved me. As one previous reviewer noted, the acid test of Boheme is if one tears up as Mimi dies; I did, helped by the mainly traditional production approach and compelling singing and acting.

The film is not without a few quirks and debits, though one needs to be trying hard, I feel, to be as outraged as have been some previous reviewers. Netrebko seems to specialize in soft, feminine acting and lushly smooth singing; while this can be a bit marshmallowy, here, it creates an appealingly vulnerable character driven by her own loneliness. I cannot agree with those who were shocked by the idea that Mimi would plan ahead to cross paths with Rodolfo or that the two would make love shortly after falling in love; when considering their co-seduction within the context of Puccini's passionate music, how can these interpretations have failed to come to mind as possibilities? (And those who feel Mimi can never be the least bit calculating should check out Georghiu's Act I. A Mimi who is wholly innocent throughout the opera risks raising hapless to the point of saccharine, even for an operatic soprano role.)

Yes, some strain is discernible in Villazon's top, particularly at the finish of his most impassioned phrases. Still, his voice is able to carry his acting, which is no mean feat. Quibbling with the size of his generously sketched Rodolfo misses the significant benefits of his characterization, which paints the poet as idealistic, passionate, and temperamental--qualities which explain, and thus defuse, his later ill-treatment of Mimi. As an audience member, falling for Rodolfo as a tender-hearted romantic male lead in Act I can lead to unease in Act III when Mimi portrays him as angry, accusing, and jealous. Villazon brings to the role an edgy, youthful volatility I hadn't realized I'd been missing until I saw it in his depiction. His Rodolfo is compelling and taking.

This movie is, first, about the two principals, and, secondarily, about the production. (There is no thirdly here.) For the latter, one must consider the pros and cons of choosing to film an opera away from a stage setting. Lip-syncing to avoid an overly graphic display of tonsils is a traditional part of the movie-format choice, one that requires no more willing suspension of disbelief than do the peculiarities endemic to a live-staged operatic production. And the tight close-ups, besides being fashionable in current DVD production (see the last few years' camera work on the Met HD productions) allow some fascinating subtlety of expression, mainly on Netrebko's face but also on Villazon's. If some of the shots were other than straight-ahead--well, this is a movie. Some blips could have been avoided: The wrong-headed choice to put Mimi's apartment below rather than above the Bohemians' crosses the text jarringly without yielding any more benefit than allowing Netrebko to display her face pointing attractively upward rather than downward. And I did struggle with the thoroughly indoor setting (too far from the other action) and opulence (too far from the Bohemians' usual milieu) of the Cafe Momus.

In short, without being perfect, this film was terrifically enjoyable, largely due to the charismatic, opposites-attract pairing of Villazon and Netrebko and a production that enhanced their characterizations in some respects and got out of their way in the remaining. I trembled on the edge of giving it five stars.",1313107200,5,3474,5.089473684210526
2450104,4,B000BZIT5M,"La Boheme is a classic introductory opera and this film conveys it beautifully. Young artists starving in a garret has a romantic appeal but reality invades when the poet Rodolfo realizes that living in poverty is hastening the death of Mimi, the young seamstress; the woman he loves. Even in today's world poverty still takes a murderous toll. Love is a balm to soothe it's sting but not a cure all.

Though Rolando Villazon is in good voice, his scruffy visual image and anxiety portrayal mars the spirit of Rodolfo, the poet who declares in song that he's a millionaire in spirit. This performance is not on par with Villazon's dynamic Alfredo of the 2005 Salzburg Festival La Traviata.

My ideal Rodolfo remains the world famous tenor, Neil Shicoff. His 1982 Royal Opera Boheme filmed at Covent Garden is a cut above and now is available on DVD. I first saw Neil Shicoff in the 1980'S in this role at the Metropolitan Opera. My first thought was that he was my ideal Rodolfo and I've been duly mesmerized since then. A 2003 La Scala Boheme on DVD with Marcello Alvarez portrays a softer yet convincing Rodolfo. Both tenors are far more appealing as Rodolfo than Villazon.

Anna Netrebko as a saucy Mimi has great chemistry with Rolando Villazon. She's a genteel, dreamy Mimi with just a touch of the accustomed defiance with which she endows her heroines. This film is considerably enriched by her vocal elegance. She's a jewel of a Mimi languishing through a cruel fate in bleak surroundings.

Netrebko's interpretation of Mimi differs from that of Mirella Freni, a favorite Mimi, who graciously autographed my musical score of La Boheme backstage at the Met in 1985. Freni's incredible Mimi is truly angelic; a portrait of a tragically ill woman with a noble spirit.

The overall view of life in much of La Boheme is through rose-colored glasses; that is until the calling card of Mimi's impending death trumps it into stark reality. A wise physician once told me that despite the tragic themes in opera, people who listen to opera have a positive outlook on life. Perhaps this is because the music itself lifts everything into a higher realm as we fall under the spell woven by passionate artists doing what they do best.",1303344000,2,2228,4.761658031088083

2450106,5,B000BZIT5M,"This is an Opera made into a film not, as is more usual, a film of the Opera. This treatment allows the director to shoot with an intimacy that would be impossible in a filmed stage production. For me the difference is magical as it brings the characters to life and makes them more accessible and more human. Netrebko makes Mimi endearing, cute and lovable in Act I and II and that, in turn, made Act III and IV even more heart wrenching. Villazon is completely believable as Rodolfo and the chemistry is amazing between him and Netrebko. Cabel and Von Bergen make a great pairing as Musetta and Marcello (really great).

Some people have made an issue out of the fact that the actual film sound track is recorded in a studio rather than on set. They will probabaly compare the singing to other great singers and analyze it. In my opinion the singing is excellent in this film. Everyone has their favorite tenors and sopranos so while I adore Anna Netrebko I'm not going to compare her to anyone. What I will say is that my dad told me to listen to music with your heart not your head. With this film my heart has more to connect with because I do not have to imagine as much. I can see Mimi biting her lip when she knocks on Rodolfo's door and I can see her wince when he tries to touch her just before Donda lieta usci. I have yet to get through this film without feeling like I have been on an emotional roller coaster and judging by my daughter's reaction last night when she saw it she felt the same.

The acting of Mr. Villazon and Ms. Netrebko are both top-notch, or, they are more than just an opera stars could usually done.

Two thumbs up for the sound engineering people. It is actually very difficult to doubling and synchronizing the sound of studio recording and the 'real' environmental sound. It is technically massive work. Also the camera people have done a great job on the same matter. (there are only couple of seconds that I found the picture of singers 'mouth' not quiet together with the music).

Because it was sound recorded (the singing part) at studio quality, and it combines with 'film' (like soundtrack) taste of sound (usually a little brilliant than the live opera or concert version of sound), and the view angles are 'optimized' from the directors view, it all summed up to a wonderful experience of this opera.

Puccini's music are extremely melodic. I find hard to not be touched by his arias, almost 'too' romantic for me to take, but I have felt it all.

The orchestra sounds brilliant!

I think later I will watch a 'real' opera of La Boheme, to just feel the difference from this one.

p.s. I found only in operas, people can 'talk' and 'sing' at the same time but with totally different stuff. Even the modern visual form such like TV, Movies and not doing that. Think, in most movies, have you ever seeing a dialog going on talking about one thing WHILE another dialog with totally different subject? But, in the second act of this opera. When mimi and Rodolfo were saying how they don't want to be apart WHILE marcello was yelling at his lover Musetta. But, four of them are singing together at same time with same music. I think it is amazing, and it doesn't always happens in movies or TV shows.

The change was not based on what inspired Puccini to compose this work: ""Scenes of Bohemians"" by Henry Murger. Puccini agreed with the change made by Illica as again, he was bussy conposing Tosca.

He knows nothing of film opera - and let's face it, I doubt there is a more difficult art form than filming an opera. Just tell me of how many outstanding examples you know that surpass theater productions. This specific production is a sequence of disappointments. Villazon during Act 1 seems to be portraying Nemorino, the funny guy in the village, a character not expected from somenone who describes his life singing ""Che gelida manina"". The purposeful visit of Mimi to his apartment destroys the innocence we have grown to indentify the sick girl with. And if the fims intends to bring a more realistic approach than we are used to in the theater, who would be kneeling in heavy snow for more than 5 minutes, as Mimi and Marcello do in their exchange in Act III?

teeth on the Von Karajan reading showcasing His Highness Luciano Pavoratti & Mirella Freni. I didn't think anything
could better that monumental effort. I must confess I was wrong. There are the technical issues other reviewers have
noted. Ghost images and such. The scenic designer deserves their kudos because they accomplished what the opera calls
for. Rusticness was in abundance. I half expected a mouse to run across the floor of the garrett in Act 1. Benoit should have been reported to the Housing Authority. Guess that's what landlords can get away with when you don't
pay your rent. I shudder to think what Mimi's place looked like!
  Ileana Cotrubas was born to play this role. Physically,she is the Mimi & Gilda not the Traviata & Manon. Her
performance I find difficult to put into words. She wraps each note with so much beauty one can hardly stand it.
Perhaps,because of her reputation of being difficult, she knew that she always had to bring her ""A"" game. She could
never phone it in. Not that she ever would. Her coyness & elation in the role establish her,to me, as the greatest
acting opera singer ,bar none. The role will never be sung and acted better.

The movie settings for all four acts make marvelous contributions to the story and give one a greater feeling that one is watching it all happen. The entire opera seems to go by much faster than the 109 minute length.

Although Nicole Cabell has a satisfying voice, her appearance is not as convincing in the role as the other cast members are in theirs. Her interview in the bonus section is very compelling, however, and one comes away with a good impression of her. I'm not even sure I can put my finger on the visual disharmony but I felt it as I watched.

I noticed one reviewer criticized Netrebko's red lipstick; I for one found it a rather touching effort by Mimi to bring some color into what was a rather drab, sad life.

The Blu-ray recording is very good in surround sound. My only complaint is certain parts in the Second Act were not clearly audible; it seemed as if the sound level fluctuated somewhat. That was a very minor problem and hardly worth mentioning.

If you are a fan of La Boheme I think you'll enjoy this performance. I noticed that Villazon took his part of the Act 1 love duet down a half step, but that's not all that unusual; on two of my recordings of the opera the tenor does that and on two the tenor sings it as written. I also noticed he sang the final section as written rather than going up for the high c with the soprano, but that too is not all that unusual.

this film captures a 'La Boheme' no Metropolitan Opera
satelitte simulcast ever could - meaning, it preserves
the performances of Netrebko and Villazon as, what are
likely to be, the definitive Mimi and Rodolfo. This is
as cinematic as any opera can get (and vice-versa!).",1265846400,3,461,4.822784810126582
2450127,4,B000BZIT5M,"Clearly (from the reviews of this title) there are some opera lovers who like only traditional stage performances of operas. Which is fine, but the virulent criticism of this version seems a bit over the top. It's as if the critics are so concerned with demonstrating the purity of their high-minded regard for the art that they forget how to enjoy it.

Concerns about lip-syncing aside, this seems to me to be a perfectly legitimate creation. I sincerely doubt that Puccini would regard it as a ""rape"", to quote a previous reviewer. He was an artist, and therefore open-minded. You may or may not like Anna and Rolando; for me it's much more convincing to see a handsome, slender intense young Rodolfo than a middle aged plumpo. The same applies for the stunning Anna. It does appear that not too many reviewers had complaints about the singing, at least.

Anyway, aren't there enough versions of Boheme around to allow something different and experimental? I bet this film brings a lot more new fans to the genre than any of the more traditional productions. And if you want to see the genre survive, you're going to need new blood in the audience.",1265760000,4,1150,4.7164179104477615

The theatrical rendering of this opera is fine by me; the music falls a little more into the background in this kind of production because one tends to focus intently on the action, so that the lip syncing really wasn't a problem for me.

I'm also happy with my Blu-ray disc. It certainly doesn't resemble the very negative description given by the reviewer in Australia. Probably he's not aware that US Blu-ray discs are different from those normally used in other parts of the world.",1265241600,2,546,4.6875

You cannot deny that the camera loves Anna, or yes, that Rolando LOVES the camera, but their voices are absolutely thrilling and touching in the right places.  On the Blu-ray, I agree with the reviewer from Blu-ray.com about the picture quality, particularly as the colors of Musetta's gown just leap off the screen.  As for the complaints before about lip-syncing, they've been doing that in movie musicals for years folks,  from South Pacific to Grease to Nine, and in opera films like Domingo and Julia Migenes in Carmen.

2450133,3,B000BZIT5M,"OK, my earlier condemnation was a bit premature. Being such a fan of Netrebo & Villazon I was compelled to revisit this Blue Ray film and was rewarded with some moving artistry so am revising this review.

As posted earlier I nearly gave up on this film. The opening scenes were dull and lacked Blu Ray quality although later scenes were fine and up to expected HD standards.  But the Dolby 5.1 audio was particulaly diasappointing and appears to not be the new HD format. The Stereo option is very flat and lifeless.

The costuming and sets are traditional but overall the film lacks the atmosphere of a live production although Netrebco and Villazon come across convincingly. I see some are put off by the miming but that did not bother me as the subtitles distracted close attention to it. The other artists and chorus are fine although there is no full cast listing and the conductor and orchestra remain a mystery.

But there are quite a few negatives: the 2.35:1 film format; the questionable sound quality already referred to (although to be honest my ears adjusted so it was not as big a drawback as on first encounter); odd distracting B&W sequences; the dull lighting of Act 1.

However the artistry is first rate so this disc is a bit of a curates egg with good and bad features. Note it is region coded, in my case A but that has nothing to do with the video quality as other region A discs here are fine.

So I'll withdraw my earlier condemnation but only recommend it with caution.",1265068800,2,1495,4.5390334572490705

Let's face it, Rodolfo and Mimi are often thoroughly boring, but this pair is so endearingly sung and characterized by Shicoff and Cotrubas.  The scale also seems right-- warm, ardent voices come out of people, who on the whole, look right for their parts, and the sets are cleverly deployed without Zeffirellian opulence.  The impression here is of a great ensemble piece with remarkable evenness of high quality throughout, rather than a star turn for two superstars.  So the young artists' horseplay looks and feels real, and sharpens the poignancy of the tragedy-- which seems like what Puccini intended.  A very sexy and funny young Tom Allen rampages through the proceedings as Marcello -- I wish there were an opera about him  (watch his face as he cons the landlord Benoit-- it's priceless).

I saw the previous of this version online and I liked very much, that is why I bought this DVD, even thought I have the one by Mirella Freni and Gianni Raimondi.
The cast was very good, in particular Anna Netrebsko and Rolando Villazon. It is not only that they are very good singers they are also very good actors; when an opera is going to be watched in the theater the most important thing is the singing , but in movies or in DVD the facial expression and body language is more noticed , it is very important that the acting is convincing , both artists have these qualities and great chemistry, which is important in this particular opera, that is expressed by moments of happiness, of sadness and above all, love.
The director's use of white and black in the beginning of 1st and 4th acts, as well as when Rodolfo and Mimi were left alone in the last act were very effective.  The director also added details like the scene with the key and the time they spent together before going to the caf&eacute;. These details enrich the performance by giving possible explanations to the events in the story.
The scenery, sound and of course, the direction were very good.
I enjoyed also the features that come with the production in particular the way the movie was made.",1264291200,3,1423,4.9789915966386555
2450137,4,B000BZIT5M,"It feels almost churlish not to give this disc 5 stars, but ... the very noticeable dubbing takes away from the enjoyment of the opera as opera. This is especially bothersome in the first meeting of the two lovers in Act I: the intimacy of the scene is marred by the non-directional origin of the sound. That said, this is a spectacular production, singing and acting superb (the latter better than any production I've seen), and the blu-ray picture quality superb (a very dark pallet, as befits a boy, a girl, and TB). My recommendation: start with Act II. Old-timers, listen to the DVD version and imagine it all in your head. First-timers, you really can't do better than this as an introduction to opera",1264118400,2,707,4.664

2450139,3,B000BZIT5M,"I love this video as an audio recording.  I generally get tired of Boheme because it is played so much and sometimes I force myself to listen to it too often because every time I turn around, another of my favorite singers has been recorded in it, so I feel I must experience it again.  This time, I did not get tired of the music or the singing.  It is wonderful to have as an audio recording, but so far, I have not gotten through the thing visually because the close-ups really put me off.  Also the acting is so over-the-top -  fine for on stage, but in a film, I find it macabre.  I saw many good things, particularly in the settings and the timing of the direction, but the close-ups and constant movement of the camera annoyed me, until I had to turn the video part off and just listen whilst doing something else.",1263600000,13,821,4.230769230769231
2450140,3,B000BZIT5M,"This was everything I expected and hoped for from a singing and acting perspective; however, I am a little disappointed with the directing.  First of all, I don't think the original libretto implies that Mimi and Rodolfo became intimate before leaving for Momus at the end of Act I.  Also, especially given the fact that no libretto or synopsis is provided, it would have been helpful for those not familiar with the story if a ""caption"" had been placed at the beginning of each act, stating its time setting.  Unless one knew otherwise, there is no way to know that Act II is on the same evening as Act I, nor that Act III is a couple of months later.  On a positive note, I thought the ""final shot"" was both inspired and effective.

2450141,5,B000BZIT5M,"I have seen and heard this opera before this, but this film out-performed all that I have seen and hear until now. A technical wonder for this film to match the music with the voices and acting. Moving the story line from the stage to outside sets was visually pleasing, as was the singing by all the characters. The sets provided a visual reality to the story line.

Any opera company, including the Met, will face difficulty matching this production",1262822400,3,451,4.6375
2450142,5,B000BZIT5M,"Unlike most opera DVDs, that are merely filmed versions of a stage production, this one is a ""real"" movie. What a difference it makes! The extra resources available to a movie director - sets, lighting, camerawork, close-up acting, etc. - add new dimensions of realism (especially important in verismo opera) and emotion to Puccini's glorious opera. It was a more moving experience, for me, than is usually obtained in even the best stage productions.

That is not to say the movie is ""perfect."" It was too-obviously shot on a movie set, so that although the interiors were realistically convincing, the exteriors were not. I found the performers' lip-synching, although unavoidable (you cannot get acceptable sound on a movie set), to be distracting; ditto a few of the director's ""tricks"" (he inserts a handful of black-and-white scenes, for what reason I do not know, into an otherwise all-color movie). The acting varies from excellent (most of the cast, including Netrebko) to needs-more-work (Villazon, although his singing makes up for it).

In spite of these quibbles, the fine singing, cinematic realism, and emotional sincerity of this DVD made it an instant favorite, and an easy recommendation.",1262649600,4,1206,5.211340206185567
2450143,4,B000BZIT5M,"This film version of La Boheme is gorgeous! The cinematography is beautiful and tasteful, and the singing is all top-notch, crowned by a performance by Anna Netrebko as Mimi. Her voice has luster and charisma, and her acting is right on the money. Rolando Villaz&oacute;n's only fault, vocally, is that he is not Pavarotti; otherwise, he is among the very best tenors today, having a beautiful, powerful, and passionate voice, and impeccable technique. His acting was just a tad over the top for a film, but it would have played perfectly in the opera house.

In a way, my review should stop here. I recommend this wholeheartedly to the most discriminating of opera lovers; and this is the first mainstream opera that I have seen on Blu-ray that can stand up to the competition in all formats. As always, however, there are a few caveats that perhaps should be mentioned.

This is opera as film, not simply a film of a staged production, although it was inspired by the two principals' on-stage performances together. The reader/shopper probably already knows whether or not he or she likes opera presented in movie format, so I will not discuss the pros and cons, except to make two observations specific to this film: (1) this is, for much of the time, not a lip-sync job for the principals, which is unusual for opera-on-film, and (2) the director used only very sparingly (twice, I think) the device wherein singers' voices are heard without their moving their lips (as is done sometimes for day-dream sequences). In this case the main use for it was to show Mimi's inner thoughts when she would have been too weak to have sung them in real life. Returning to the first point, however, lip-syncing was used for some of the characters, in which photogenic actors were seen but opera singers were heard. There is also some lip-syncing by the principals when it was impractical to record the voices on the set.  The bonus materials mention the difficulties inherent in keeping the singers in sync with the orchestra, which was recorded in a separate studio at another time. The final result, however, is excellent; and on the whole, I'd say that this transformation of opera to the movies is less jarring than most.

Among the 71 minutes of extras, the director, Robert Dornhelm speaks about several of the choices he made, big and small. The most important choice he made was to keep things traditional; there is no attempt to update the setting, costumes, or circumstances in order to pander to more modern, or simply restless, tastes. He wisely realized that straying from the original concept would have only taken it downhill. He had also made a version of the film in which there was somewhat extensive use of CGI and other special effects but ended up using almost none in the final cut. A few scenes are shown in black-and-white, an effect that mostly worked well and for which the justification was rather obvious; but there was one mostly black-and-white scene, in which a stand of flowers was deliberately singled out for color. While it was effective, and pleasantly reminded me of a famous scene from a Fellini movie, I did not feel that it was organic to the mood here--it was distracting, but only for a second or two, as it caused me to pause to contemplate its ""meaning""; on the other hand, it could be considered a good thing that the director threw us something additional to chew on. In any case this was a rare exception within a production that is distinguished by its lack of tricks, an homage to the time-tested genius of Puccini.

Musically, one could hardly desire more. In the beginning of the first act, the tempi may have been ever so slightly fast, and I was afraid that the conductor was going to take a somewhat business-like, let's-get-this-thing-over-with, tack; but that did not last long at all; there was plenty of good 'ole romantic wallowing in tears to come. Indeed, the quick pace of the first few moments was consistent with the vision of the film director, who conceded that the first act is the most difficult to bring off, and who opted to bring out its more humorous aspects; sparing us any unnecessarily-early hint of the pathos to come.

The only other nit picking is to mention a couple of minor (almost theoretical) shortcomings in the final product:

(1) The highest-tech soundtrack available on this Blu-ray is Dolby 5.1. (There is also ""Dolby 2.0,"" and I am not quite sure what that means -- 2-channel PCM encoded for Dolby Pro Logic, maybe, for the benefit of older receivers that cannot process a digital input?) Many operatic and concert DVDs provide DTS 5.1 as a sometimes preferable option; and of course Blu-ray often offers further enhancements to these formats, including the possibility of 5, 6, or 7 uncompressed audio channels. As something of a long-time audiophile and techno-geek, I have to mention this lack of state-of-the-art-edness; but I also have to say that it makes virtually no difference. Yes, it is conceivable that a more detailed audio could have been attained, but to what point? This Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is beautiful and perfectly fits the look of the film. For that matter, it would also have been possible to capture a more starkly detailed picture through the use of direct video, but the softer images of cinematic film better suit the mood. None of this, however, is to deny the superiority of the Blu-ray edition of this film versus the DVD; ""softness"" is one thing, a DVD's 5.5-times loss of detail is quite another, if one is watching on a large screen.

(2) Kultur provides no booklet, and the jacket almost requires one to use a magnifying glass to find the name of the orchestra and conductor (both of whom contributed greatly to the overall high standard of musical performance). The only readily visible credits are to Netrebko, Villaz&oacute;n, and Dornhelm. As to the absence of program notes, the justification, no doubt, is that there is an abundance of information in the rolling credits, as well as in the generous bonus features; and of course, the optional subtitles mostly do away with any need for printing the libretto. However, on this latter point, the subtitles were not perfect; and it would have been nice to have had a printed copy of the original Italian. In addition, there are times one would like to refer to notes rather than having to put the Blu-ray in the machine, wait for all the preliminaries to pass, and then scan through for the sought-after factoid.",1262390400,27,6478,4.788014311270126
2450144,3,B000BZIT5M,"First, I'd like to say that overall I enjoyed this film.  Widescreen, superb picture and sound, gorgeous principals with 2 of the top voices of our era, delivers much of what I'd hoped from this new, enhanced, blue-ray version.  Using the movie medium to show outdoor scenes of Paris, quick cuts to show happenings in different places at the same time added dimension and realism.  But, for every felicity added, the film managed to subtract something equally important.

For instance, when the men are horsing around upstairs, Mimi is shown hearing the raucus downstairs in her apartment, then purposely bringing a candle up the stairs and blowing it out to join the party.  A nice bit of motivation.  But then when she and Rudolfo leave his apartment to join the others at Momus, she leads him by the hand into her apartment, where they are shown undressed, making passionate love.  It is very physical and rapidly advances their relationship, but a bit of a shock to how they are able to fit this in, yet still make it to the festivities in time for dinner.  Arguably, an acceptable, although awkward, trade-off.  But, being a film, there are constantly issues that take away from our sense of involvement.

In many cases, the singers voices are slightly out-of-synch.  Similarly, there is cut after cut where the action doesn't quite match with the previous scene.  In some cases, there are excesses where one scene superimposes on another to give some sort of filmic, dreamy effect that takes away, rather than enhances our involvement.  There are also scenes, typical of many filmed versions of operas, where the singers are heard singing, but where on camera, they are just making love.  Adds to the sensual, physicality, but reminds us that we are not seeing this live, but watching a highly manipulative film.  The ultimate travesty, in my view, was the final scene of the film, where the producers used what I'm sure they thought was an artistic, symbolic device to give meaning to the film, but which I thought totally destroyed the impact.  See for yourself, your reactions may vary!",1262304000,44,2095,4.859154929577465
2450145,5,B000BZIT5M,"I saw this film on PBS for the first time last week (December 2009). In reading the reviews here, I find it amazing that there are some negative ones. Yes, the lip-synching was sometimes slightly noticeable, but so what? The rapid pacing enhanced it for me: not a single boring moment. The most important things, the performances and quality of the audio, were right on. At first I thought this film version could not hold the emotional impact of a live performance, but I think I was wrong. It's different, but just as effective. I hope the negative reviews do not discourage folks from getting this DVD. I'm definitely buying it.",1262131200,5,631,4.693693693693693
2450146,1,B000BZIT5M,"There are a few pieces that have been written thoughtout the ages that manage to transend typicall expectations and, through the creative team's art and brilliance create raised standards for all who follow in the given genre.  I have firmly believed that Pucchini's ""La Boheme falls into that category.

However, what I saw broadcast was a tired bus and truck version of a masterpiece.  Provided one closed one's eyes, much of the singing was more that satisfactory, but the performances, and at times the casting was so horribly intrusive as to cut the heart out of the piece, and opera verismo without heart can find no part or reason for existence.  I could nit-pick over various issues that never should have occurred (I guess the team working on the film couldn't bother reading the actually libretto, thus we wind up with Mimi living below Rudolpho, or introducing her before her lite-motif or for reasons I cannot fathom, the subtitles distorted to the translator's idea of ""well, that's what he WOULD have meant""  Pish-tosh.  Cafe Momus was suddenly upgraded to Maxine's for no discernable reason, other than I guess the set-designer thought it looked good.  Enough has been said about the bad lip-synking which is always totally distracting.  The ""acting"" generally stayed in the field of bad melodrama - a style of performing Puccini tried to move beyond with the Verismo form, but I guess the production team knew better.  I recall one particular horror where there was a double shot of Mimi during her first act Aria (Si, Mi Chiamino Mimi) where her hands were in front of her mouth on the closeup- but on a hand-banister for the middle shot???  Was this an indication of Schitzofrenic behavior or bad first year editing???  Don't get me wrong - I am by know means a rabbid traditionalist, but poor, or unsupported arbitrary choices only succeed in confusing and losing the audience and I for one, found myself quite lost, confused, and ultimately disappointed in so many unnecessary, shoddy and inexplicable choices.  I finally had to pull out the old Theresa Status tape to get rebalanced.  Between ""Boheme, The Movie"" and the Met's production of Tosca this year, one can only hope that Puccini is met with appropriate respect in 2010.",1262044800,19,2250,4.905013192612137

Netrebko is as beautiful as her voice, and Villazn is powerful, funny, loving, and heartbreaking in turn. Every other member of the cast plays his/her role to perfection, and the direction is sublime.
I'll be watching and listening to this one many, many, many times.",1261958400,6,397,4.605633802816901
2450148,2,B000BZIT5M,"The director, Robert Dornhelm (whose immediately previous contribution to classical-music filmmaking was a fine Karajan documentary released for the maestro's centenary), comes armed with many ideas about how to ""open out"" BOHME for cinematic purposes, and to put his stamp on it. During the opening Rodolfo/Marcello exchanges, we glimpse Mim in her room, eavesdropping. Dornhelm returns to her a little later as she considers her course of action. Later she lingers in the hallway, waiting for the other Bohemians to clear out. By the time she actually confronts Rodolfo, we understand she has had her cap set for him for some time. This idea would be unwieldy in a stage production, of course; but having seen it perpetrated here, I see no gain whatsoever, and am grateful it has not occurred to any director in my prior experience. Does Dornhelm imagine that Mim becomes more interesting and ""modern"" if she's made calculating and shrewd? Hasn't the first meeting in the dark between these two simple people always been touching in part *because* of the element of chance, and the heroine's sweet artlessness? Whatever the case, in Dornhelm's film, the two young lovers do make it to bed following their first famous duet. How long Rodolfo's friends are kept waiting at Caf Momus, and what the amount of time might say about our poet's prowess, at least are left to the imagination.

The inspirations keep coming. As Schaunard tells the story of his day, we see it in flashback (black and white except for the bright colors of the Englishman's ill-fated parrot). At the start of Act IV, the beginning of Marcello and Rodolfo's scene is moved to the street; they continue their conversation as they walk to their flat. There are more remembrances, adjustments, overlays, composites, even modest visual effects (ersatz clouds whizzing by, glimpsed through the loft's windows). The film is all ""touches"" and ""notions"" -- a surfeit of them -- and the finished product is clunky, labored, and ultimately unmoving, because more important work has been left undone. If Dornhelm has any gift at all for directing actors, it is well hidden here: with one exception, the cast's performances range from anonymous to embarrassing.

The exception is Anna Netrebko, whose physical performance as Mim is subtle, conscientious, and perfectly scaled to the camera. That beguiling dark lyric voice is in fine shape, and the part suits her well -- better than the florid music of the bel canto heroines she often essays. Her partner, Rolando Villazn as Rodolfo, pops his eyes, gestures broadly, and puts on a show of frightful overacting. He can be guilty of the same things on stage, and probably even in his daily life. But live theater is a different medium with its own rules and reasonable allowances, and Villazn has demonstrated for directors such as Vincent Paterson (MANON) that he can rein himself in when the material and the production call for it. Here, he's at his big-projecting stagiest against a would-be naturalistic milieu, with a female lead who is more camera-savvy, and it all makes for a terribly uncomfortable fit. I am not sure where the recording of the soundtrack fell within the chronology of Villazn's 2007 vocal crisis, his attempted comeback, and his 2009 vocal crisis, but knowledge of his struggles makes his tentative or hard-pressed moments stand out in sharper relief. His future remains uncertain at this writing, and it will be a great shame if this tenor, who began so promisingly, lives down to the gloomiest predictions circulating. There are long stretches of attractive and persuasive singing here, but he cannot be said to sound at his best, and he and Netrebko do not demonstrate their vaunted chemistry as much as one anticipates. Their passionate display near the end of Act I is a sterile and choreographed affair, not helped by the director's silly camera angles, which suggest a parody of a perfume ad.

Among the rest of the cast, Vitalij Kowaljow (a surly Colline) and Nicole Cabell (Musetta, more comic minx than alluring siren) do well with the Coat Song and the inescapable Waltz, respectively. George von Bergen acts the Marcello sung by Boaz Daniel; Adrian Erod stands in for Stphane Degout's Schaunard -- none makes a striking impression. The talented conductor Bertrand de Billy, leading the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, is only workmanlike here; it is not a reading long on poetry, affection, or individuality, nor one evincing the greatest sensitivity to the singers.

Technical shortcomings are as numerous as directorial gimmicks: post-synchronization is little better than that seen in Ponelle's opera films of almost 40 years ago. The blocking is rudimentary and the editing jagged, most of all in Act I. On the basis of this DVD, I would have guessed the film to be two decades older than it is; the quality is muted and dingy, and I hope it looked better in theaters. (If it did, the transfer has been botched by the DVD label, Kultur...which would be no surprise. I dread to see their name attached to anything I plan to buy, and have previously suggested their slogan be ""When You're Glad To Get It At All"" or ""Kultur DVD: Striving For Adequacy Since 1997."") The translation provided in the optional English subtitles is so heavily condensed as to be barely adequate. In protecting viewers from having to read more than a few words at a time, and neglecting to translate lines deemed ""nonessential,"" the responsible parties have deprived us English speakers of much humor, detail, and verbal nuance.

In fairness, there are things here that do work: I believe Act III comes off the best, because Dornhelm is at his least fussy there, Villazn is relatively restrained, Netrebko as touching as ever; and amidst this confluence, we hit one of several patches of Puccini that are close to bulletproof. Still, one can do better. For Netrebko and Villazn together, stick with the Virgin L'ELISIR D'AMORE or the DG MANON. For a film of BOHME, the 1967 Karajan/Zeffirelli (on DG) is more interestingly conducted and overall better sung (it even has the better Mim -- Netrebko is an exotic and intriguing visitor to this musical world, but the young Mirella Freni actually lived there). The 1967 too has shortcomings, but Dornhelm's film duplicates them all, with fewer compensations. For a DVD of BOHME in general, go with one of the Met performances available on DG, with the slightly later Stratas/Carreras having an edge on the Scotto/Pavarotti. An honorable mention goes to the 1989 San Francisco performance (Kultur again, alas), a late-career reteaming of Freni and Pavarotti in a beautiful and perceptive Francesca Zambello production. Dornhelm's film should have been able to stand alongside any of these, but it is a major disappointment: as artificial as Mim's embroidered flowers, and little more fragrant.",1261872000,21,6868,5.026338893766462
2450149,5,B000BZIT5M,"It is surprising to see the number of naysayers among the reviews of this filmed version of Puccini's beloved LA BOHEME singling out the very elements that allow stage works to become transferred to the film medium (lip syncing, closeups of cinematic details, uses of both black and white and color, etc).  What seems to be overlooked is this chance to see the two leading interpreters of this opera in wide distribution for those who cannot see them in person. As a film this version by Robert Dornhelm works wonders with the intentions of Puccini's bohemian lovers living on little but their love of the arts and for life in the Parisian garrets in the snowy wintertime.  He introduces moments of Paris in the snow in black and white, much like old animated daguerreotype, before the brief overture begins and keeps the flavor of the action moving seamlessly while adding additional elements of information using the same format.  He offers some visual information about the passion of the lovers that allows him to reference these moments later in the story when memory brings them forward.  All of this makes the opera more than opera: these elements make this a fine movie.

But the true pleasure of this film is the glorious singing and acting of Rolando Villazn and Anna Netrebko as the lovers.  They are gorgeous to look at, magnificent in their vocal interpretations, and extraordinary actors.  And close behind them is the camaraderie of the entire cast, especially Nicole Cabell as Musetta, George Von Bergen as Marcello (vocal by Boaz Daniel), Adrian Erd as an exceptional Schaunard (vocal by Stphane Degout), and Vitalij Kowaljow as Colline.  The involvement in the story is solid and wholly believable and this is a cast of 'minor characters' whose presence is constantly felt and appreciated. Bertrand de Billy conducts with a sure hand.  In short if anyone can watch this version of LA BOHEME with a dry eye, then perhaps they are not giving the power of Puccini a chance to be extended into the cinematic techniques required of really excellent filmmaking.

What a disaster! The video quality may be o.k. but it takes someone who is definitely not an opera lover to put up with a production where the singers are OBVIOUSLY lip-synching. (Pavarotti's Rigoletto with the incredible Victoria Vergera as Maddalena is an even worse example of a production rendered unwatchable because of the apparent idiotic presumption that the viwer would accept it because of the star power involved)

But the very obvious lip-sinking of their own voices destroyes the enjoyment for me; as does much of the camera work.  The editorial states that the director of the film wanted to stay with Puccini -- but the ending of the first act is definitely not Puccini.  For these reasons I did not like the first act, but remained to the end.  The second act almost saved it and alone is worth watching.  The rest is dreadful.",1261699200,15,529,4.46875
2450152,4,B000BZIT5M,"I do not have the DVD but watched it on PBS, so I cannot comment on the DVD picture and sound quality. I agree with operamarty on the lip-syncing problems.

Both Rolando and Anna sing well. My biggest disappointment is the transposition lower of the ""Che gelida manina"" aria. Somewhere I read that a lot of tenors transpose lower to avoid singing the high C in the original score, singing B instead. Rolando also did not sing the act one final ""amore amore"" in same tone as the soprano, seemingly sang the harmony instead. I would think that with the recordings done in the studio, they should make the effort to sing the original with its high C's. It is not like you are taking risks in a live performance.

I watched the movie with a friend who is big opera fan. He did not notice the transposition of the aria. I noticed right away in the transition music from ""cerce .."" to ""Che gelida.."". I am used to listening to the Gianni Raimondi DVD version which is sung in the original key. So the ""Che gelida"" in this movie does not sound quite right to my ear (my native lanquage is tonal, so I tend to notice these things). I still like the Karajan/Gianni Raimondi/Mirella Freni La Boheme DVD the best, despite its age. There is no compelling reason for me to buy this.",1261699200,2,1269,4.395744680851064
2450163,3,B000BZIT5M,"I'm glad so many people enjoyed this presentation but to me it was a definite disappointment due to lip syncing out of sync; lack of chemistry; lack of sincere emotion due to lip sync rather than live singing; actors mouthing singers; almost every mistake that could be made with the direction of a film of this opera seems to have been made.  I much prefer the Met production of the early 80's with Jose Carreras and Theresa Stratas for singing, sets, costumes and acting. Even Pavarotti's is acceptable.  The pair, Netrebko and Villazon, are two of my favorite singers and I loved their La Traviata from Saltzburg but again, that was a live performance not a movie. I thought the Musetta ""blah"", as was the Marcello.  I bought it upon release but will not watch it very often as the Met's two productions on DVD are both better than this film.  Anna did come across well in the acting dept. but Rolando still was ""too big"" in gestures and singing for film - great on stage.  The emotion was flat through most of the film and the ending was unemotional.  The director didn't notice that the great emotion comes from Rodolfo's grief and heartbreaking sobs of ""Mimi"".  I did not tear up which is the test of any good La Boheme ending.

The Met is filming such great productions in HD for broadcast into the theaters and DVD release that a movie no longer holds the best technology for opera performance.  The electricity and chemistry of a stage production will beat a movie just about any time ESPECIALLY if lip syncing is used.  These are professional singers and they should be allowed to sing not lip sync and badly.  Sets and costumes were ok and traditional.  I really wanted to love it but just too disappointed in the overall effect.  I've seen so many La Bohemes on stage that were so superior to this film.  Just a big disappointment.",1261612800,31,1843,4.562310030395137
2450164,4,B000BZIT5M,"While I agree that some of the technical issues could have been better,
lip-singing, subtitles, etc. the most important aspect of this
production is the continuous innovation and exploration of Opera productions.
The only thing that matters at the end of the day is that the music, the
message, the humanistic aspect of tragedy and comedy gets into the audience,
wherever the audience is, and this film achieves it.

The music and singing are beautiful. I do believe that some better use of the surround sound capabilities could have been utilized, still it is a powerful production and cinematography. As expected, Netrebko and Villazon are great in their music and acting. This is not for those wanting a classical staged production, but for those who want to love the music and be moved by this super romantic couple.

I recommend to everyone, who haven't done it yet, to see a DVD of this opera [with or without Netrebko and Villazon], where the singers do not just simply ""mouth"" the arias, are not hampered by the extreme close-ups, and sing through the whole opera in one singular time period. A lot is lost in the filming process!

2450166,4,B000BZIT5M,"This performance of La Boheme should please most people. Villazon and Netrebko certainly live up to the hype. If you looked at the packaging, you would think that they were the only two performers. They are featured on the front cover and written about extensively on the back cover. Oddly, there is no mention of the remaining cast members, all of whom give worthy performances. They include  Vitalij Kowaljow,  Nicole Cabell and  Stphane Degout. Kowaljow and Degout are amazing and at times almost steal the show. Cabell is a delightfully flirtatious and then sensitive Musetta. This DVD is a movie and it's one of the better film versions of an opera that I've seen. Occasionally, Robert Dornhelm opts for closeups when the singers are wide mouthed, which struck me as odd. He clearly loves Netrebko and she gets plenty of loving closeups when she's not singing.

This is definitely a worthy addition to any opera lovers collection, but the lack of notes and casting on the packaging is unacceptable.",1261612800,3,1003,4.9171597633136095
2450167,5,B000BZIT5M,"What a wonderful production! The main singers are top-notch and totally believable in their roles as the young lovers, and the supporting singers are equally fabulous. I was absolutely enthralled with their singing and acting skills. The weakest links in this production were the stage direction and the make-up department. Act I moved so fast that, even though I am quite familiar with the opera, I had trouble keeping up with everything that was going on. The director seemed so intent on being creative that there was a general frenzied quality about the entire production. The flashbacks and scene overlays were very distracting and quite unnecessary to the action on stage -- it actually took away from focusing on the opera itself. Even the clouds out the large garret window moved at a hysterical rate of speed.

The other problem, and I have to agree with the other reviewers, was the make-up. In Act I Mimi looked too robust for her condition. If she is on the verge of collapse, then she certainly couldn not be feeling very well, but she did not appear frail at all, and had the wrong make-up on to reflect her condition. She also looked quite underdressed for such a cold winter where artists are destroying their own work for a few seconds of heat. In Act IV, once again -- singers great, make-up awful. Now Mimi, in her last stages of life, comes into the room with so much black eye shadow that it looked leftover from Halloween -- not the effect I would expect to see in someone so frail. Again, she was inappropriately dressed for the cold, wearing nothing but a sleeveless blouse. I wanted to wrap her in a down comforter rather than worry about getting her a muff for her hands. But again, the singing and acting came through gloriously, and the conclusion was dramatically heartbreaking.

For personal reasons, it is too bad that there is not a fade-out after each act so you can catch your breath and get ready for the next act. After all, it is still an opera, even though it is in movie form. I show these operas to a local opera group, and it is going to be tricky to catch the end of each act so that we can have an intermission.

All in all, I recommend this production to anyone who loves opera, as well as anyone who has never seen one. I purchased it immediately after watching it, and I'm planning to use this production for my upcoming showing of La Boheme in the spring. A must-have.",1261612800,12,2415,4.534403669724771

He looked sicker than Mimi, at times the dark circles under his eyes made him look like a raccoon!
I did not care for some of the superimposed images used at times,very distracting, to the point that this production did not get me interested until the last act, which was very moving and better staged than the rest of the film.
I have nine other DVDs of La Boheme, and this not one my favorites, that is visually.
For a visually great filmed version of this great opera, watch Karajan's production with Mirella Freni and Gianni Raimondi with production and sets designed by Franco Zeffirelli.",1260921600,18,776,4.798507462686567

The atmosphere, the set, the actors, the singing... everything is perfect, breathtaking and tragic. Villazon continues to bring his charisma and tender charm to the world of opera lovers and Netrebko is at her tragic, immaculate best. The singing will soothe away the darkness.

The DVD features the film version of Puccini's opera (directed by Robert Dornhelm) along with a Making of La Boheme and interviews with several of the cast members.

I was highly impressed with the creativity involved. The four acts float by, fluid, flawless and there isn't one dull or trite moment. If anything, Dornhelm has helped to enhance some of the minor and least known elements of the opera, bringing more insight and colour to an already incredible piece of music. In previous versions of La Boheme I've seen, the minor characters always felt more 'minor' as as if the director simply wanted to focus on the tragic lovers whereas here, everything and everyone is essential. Dornhelm has a compassion directorial eye and I found myself moved even by the toy salesman and the people waiting at the gate in the cold.

A must have. If you loved Gianfranco de Bosio's version of Puccini's Tosca this is another DVD to own, cherish and watch on a wintery night. Best enjoyed in the company of pizza, wine, french bread and good opera-loving friends.",1260921600,55,1425,4.808163265306122

And Netrebko is entirely convincing, shyly beautiful yet passionate; the protagonists' passion is sincere and moving. The city streets and rooftops in the snow are a perfect backdrop to the tale, which alternates between joy and sorrow.

Their looks and considerable acting ability are further enhanced by the realistic settings of Dornhelm's production. I don't see any objection to the ""feature filmification"" of operas, though some purists despise it; after all, the costumes, stars and sets of opera in previous centuries must have had the same kind of impact on the observer then as the silver screen does today.

Netrebko and Villazon sing and act superbly; the Vienna sets are most convincing. The widescreen is great. The support performances are also first rate, especially Nicole Cabell as Musetta. It's a delightful emotional wallow!",1260316800,47,1008,5.184049079754601

2450178,4,B000BZIT5M,"I've seen a lot of Boheme's on video.  This one's pretty good.

Acting-wise (and vocally) I like Stratas a lot, though I find Zeffirelli's taste in sets over-the-top.  And the lighting and acting in the 1960's Karajan version are so bad as to be obtrusive.  I don't know if there's a perfect Boheme on video or film, but this one comes close.

This production has its shortcomings (including the tenor) but Cotrubas's acting, vocal and physical, make it deeply touching.

On the down side, the garret is overly bright and has an odd physical layout, though one the staging uses well enough.  The Musetta I find vocally shrill and a bit hammy (but isn't it always so?).

And the Rodolfo Neil Shicoff opens his fishface and screams inches away from Mimi's nose in a disturbing fashion:  he's loud, louder and loudest, and we never think he's a person, always an opera singer.  Not good.

On the plus side, Ileana Cotrubas effectively paints Mimi as a simple person--remarkably simple.  You get the idea that I think is in the libretto:  Rudolfo talks about poetry but Mimi IS poetry.  She's so simple, she doesn't know she's dying--even when it happens--and a fur muff can delight her, even in her last hours.

She even vocally portrays the death effectively.  It's difficult for a smart person to portray someone simple without mugging, but I think Cotrubas does that here.

There are other pluses.  Thomas Allen is handsome and youthful in this role, and it's nice to see him in something besides Mozart.  When he and Musetta fight, you know very well that it's all foreplay--a keen bit of insight.

The Colline and Schaunard are characterful and fun.  And musically, it's all good enough not to distract.

Usually I tear up a bit in the last act, maybe shed a tear during Rodolfo's last cries of anguish, but in this I was consistently just about bawling.  Maybe not the right yardstick, but it says something.",1233878400,4,1911,4.724242424242425

And it's really only a minor cavil, since I'm not an opera buff just an enthusiastic neophyte.  My problem was that the subtitles were insufficient - sometimes they were there, sometimes they weren't. Sure, they don't need to translate every ""Buon Giorno"" since we can all pretty much understand that. But there were whole passages which were omitted. It can be argued that it's for the music which we watch and enjoy opera(which we do!), but it helps us newbies if we can also know (rather than infer) what's being sung.

Neil Shicoff is one of the great tenors of his or any musical age, and his unfailing musicianship makes his singing beautiful beyond many others of more fabled estate. Perhaps no other singer (except Caballe and Ludwig) was more loved by orchestral musicians than Ileana Cotrubas, in equal measure for her impeccable musicianship and an unforgettable voice that carries a glow of tragedy deep in its emerald sound. She's a perfect verismo singer, though curiously few acknowledge it. With Cotrubas nothing is exaggerated, nothing out of pulse; she invests it all in actually singing, eschewing 'showing us' her singing - an unfortunately prevalent malaise. Thomas Allen's Marcello is bright and ardent, &the leaving scene with Rodolfo works up some vocal fire. Zschau exerts herself as Musetta, but not without delight. Gardelli marshals the Covent Garden forces with typical Royal Opera understatement and gets a huge ovation at the end. A traditionally staged Boheme recommended with passion to just about everybody.
