8553721,4,B00AMHFQI2,"They call this ""Glam Gore"" but by any name, it's a damned good take on the Italian giallo genre and unlike the slew of lame entries in that category, Last Caress fully delivers on its promises of nudity and gore.

It's also filmed with colorful style, in the spirit of directors like Mario Bava and Dario Argento, who mastered the art of murder movies and were poorly imitated in their time. So if you've delved into the second-rate giallos of the 1970s and been disappointed by their off-camera kills and overlong talkiness, get your black-gloved hands on Last Caress for the antidote.

This one actually diverts from the genre's standard premises because it doesn't present a mystery, but a situation involving a valuable painting and a gangster-ish killer who's searching for it in a remote estate visited by a group of fun-seekers. Seance-induced flashback sequences reveal the past presence of the witch whose portrait is the trigger for frequent and ambitiously-depicted mayhem punctuated by a driving synthesizer score.

This would get a full five stars if not for the closing phase, which somewhat lets up on the gore and conveys a less than compelling supernatural turn of events. But otherwise, Last Caress is fast-paced, looks splendid and leaves nothing to the imagination when it comes to the rending of flesh. For fans of euro-thrillers, this dose of Glam Gore is enthusiastically prescribed.",1451088000,4,1406,5.051724137931035
