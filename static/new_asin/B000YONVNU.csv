8233555,5,B000YONVNU,"I have been a fan of Mr. McKay's since I was ten.  Getting to see these shows again via the DVDs has brought back amazing memories of those days.  Surprisingly, I actually remembered some of the scenes from one of the shows after 57 years.  I am enjoying falling for the show and its star all over again.  I only wish I could find the other two sets of DVDs so I could see more of both.",1488844800,,386,3.9740259740259742
8233556,5,B000YONVNU,Love the show. Watched it in the 50's. The nostalgia overrides the questionable picture or sound quality. (I have the 22-disc set). Watch on small screen setting.,1439424000,2,162,5.037037037037037

8233558,2,B000YONVNU,the video was very patchy and poor quality unless touched up I could not recommend buying this product much dissapointment,1399248000,6,122,5.15
8233559,2,B000YONVNU,"Very poor quality. I do not suggest you buy this.

What I DO suggest is that you go online and download the original ""Adventures In Paradise"" theme music and burn it to a disk. Then purchase Gardner McKay's ""Journey Without A Map"". While you read the book let the theme music repeat on your CD player. That's what I did and it was nice. It was fun.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TV-Theme-Songs-Of-The-Past/dp/B002KYOTHO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TV Theme Songs Of The Past</a>

I loved this series as much as anyone. Maybe that's why I can't stand watching it in the condition it's in.

8233560,3,B000YONVNU,Love the show - but some of the epidsodes are 'missing' sound.  Not too happy with that.,1240358400,16,88,4.176470588235294
