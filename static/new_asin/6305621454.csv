7892139,3,6305621454,"Despite being a decidedly above-average action performer, Moon Lee is often overlooked as a second tier version of Michelle Yeoh. I believe this solely has to do with the type of vehicles she got: the woman has talent, but almost all of her movies tended to be small, contemporary, and largely unremarkable adventures that got repetitive when viewed in succession. ""Beauty Investigator"" is an example of this, but a pretty tolerable one: its main audience will be fans of Lee and costar Yukari Oshima, and it doesn't do many things you wouldn't find in a host of other Hong Kong flicks from this time, but it does them with enough flair to make for a reasonably memorable outing.

The story: CID agents (Moon Lee and Chi Gei Gam) go undercover as hostesses to find a murderer, uncovering a massive weapons-dealing ring in the process.

Lee has fantastic chemistry with her onscreen partner, and together, they fight their way through a goofy screenplay. Like so many Hong Kong flicks, this one features an inharmonious balance of comedy and drama, but the filmmakers went pretty gaga on the comedy. Fantasy sequences, crude sexual humor, and scatological gags abound in this one, making it weird even by HK standards. Most of it's harmless, but it's creepy how nonchalantly the film treats molestation, and this sort of undermines the premise of an action flick with female leads. Nevertheless, the enthusiasm of the performers is well-directed in many instances, allowing the characters greater dimension than they otherwise may have had.

The action picks up the slack where the otherwise unambitious story slumps. There's a foot chase, a car-motorcycle chase, and a big shootout, not to mention all of the fighting. With approximately 13 full-length brawls, this film features more than the average amount of karate, but the quality of the brawls fluctuates. Chi Gei Gam isn't much of a martial artist, but Lee's joined by the aforementioned Yukari Oshima (reuniting them for the first time since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iron-Angels/dp/B005C90S92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iron Angels</a>), Sophia Crawford (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sword-of-Honor/dp/B000FGFBLM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sword of Honor</a>), and Billy Chow (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iron-Monkey-2/dp/6305885141/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iron Monkey 2</a>) to pick up the slack. The surprise performance, however, belongs to lead villain Jeong-Il Choi, who is initially set up as a suit but then busts out some memorable fights against Chow and Lee. This isn't award-winning action, but for at least half of the time, it's more than serviceable.

Essentially, this is a watchable action adventure that will keep fight fans relatively entertained, but it's not something for most people to go out of their way to buy. As far as Moon's vehicles go, this is one of the better ones, and while that's a bit of a disappointment, the film itself holds up well enough for viewers who just want to see some kickboxing.",1426377600,2,3122,5.664529914529915
7892140,5,6305621454,"Not any kind of an Oscar winning material or an epic like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""....far from from it.  A production that is more comparable to the likes of ""Robot Monster"", this is absolutely one of the most goofiest movies I ever seen come out of Hong Kong and it is one of the two reasons that ""Beauty Investigator"" will be one of my all-time favorites from that region.  The other reason is that it is always a pleasure watching the beautiful and talented Yukari Oshima, whom I am in love with.  But to sum it up.......Moon Lee is playing a female cop who is a major airhead that is partnered with another female cop who herself is a bigger airhead, their boss has a constant case of at-his-wit's-end-itess with them just a peg below Herbert Lom's most famous character, Commissioner Dreyfess from ""the Pink Panther"" series (and I say ""a peg below"" given the fact that Dreyfess has tried numerous times to actually frag his subordinate, great job at making audiences sympathetic to the boss for a change but you all get the picture), then throw in the old-school bad dubbing that makes these old Hong Kong movies so fun to watch and it's guaranteed laughs.  The scene in which Moon Lee finds herself up against a dude who only gets aroused when she whoops his ass (""Oh, my God......you're a masochist!!!!"") and her partner is up against the other dude who dresses up like a Chinese Barney Rubble are just priceless.  My only complaint against ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" is that they never tapped the Hong Kong market.  This movie who would be a perfect place to start.  What's there not to love about it, unless you're a raging FemiNazi or some Politically-Correct liberal card-carry Democrat Party control freak who would ban guns, disband the Nra, and have people like Joe Bob Briggs and Rush Limbaugh put in concentration camps?  ""Beauty Investigator"" is really 5 stars plus in my book.  My only complaint is the same I have on all Yukari Oshima movies, which is the lack of Yukari Oshima nude.  I recommend this with no reservations.",1323388800,2,2054,4.696378830083566
7892141,2,6305621454,"Beauty Investigator is a movie about two female police detectives who go under cover to find rapist/murderer.  They soon get caught up in the main plot of this movie which involves Hong Kong gangsters and Japanese Yakuza.  The ganster plot is fairly typical and not terribly interesting.  In fact, there is not much about this movie that is all that interesting.  The female stars are all attractive, and there are a couple good actin scenes (including some unnecessary, but appreciated explosions).
This whole movie smacked of cheap production.  The plastic DVD case is warped (it won't lay flat or close properly), and the plot summary on the back is wrong.
The video quality is poor.  It is widescreen, but not animorphic.  It looks like a copy of a cheap VHS tape.  The picture is very muddy, and at times the color seems to go out of the picture (yes, it is on the DVD, not a problem with cables).  Other times the colors bleed all over the place -- in the final fight, one of the female villians is wearing a red shirt that seems to glow.  Did they do the transfer by pointing a camcorder at a TV screen?
There is another problem with the video, or more specifically with the fact that half of the movie seems to have been shot in the dark.  There are a lot of scenes where you can't see much of anything other than a few unidentifiable blobs moving around.  Maybe!
On the plus side, the dubbing was pretty well done.
You can definately better elsewhere.  If you want to see attractive female crime action, try Heroic Trio.  If you want to see awesome Hong Kong gangster action, look for Hard Boiled.  I cannot recommend this movie.",1008460800,9,1638,4.523809523809524
