5768053,5,B00D2UMHPG,"I could not sum it up any better than the first two reviewers. Trial and Retribution is simply an excellent and riveting series, brilliant in both the acting and directing. I still believe the Brits do it best when it comes to TV thrillers, which of course includes the fast action paced and brilliant MI5/6 TV series, Spooks! As a side note, I can't wait for Spooks to be also released as a complete collection now that it has sadly ended after 9 fantastic years (series 10 being the final). Treat yourselves with a multi-regional DVD player and order in these two brilliant shows. They are addictive! (Also, fast and efficient service from seller: RareConsoles - Australia / USA Direct) Thank you :>",1328400000,6,701,4.7073170731707314
5768054,5,B00D2UMHPG,"This really is, the best crime drama I have ever watched! The acting is second to none! I was so disappointed when it finished. It is however, a series you could watch again and again!",1299542400,4,184,4.285714285714286
5768055,5,B00D2UMHPG,"Many British Mysteries are not shown in the US.  I purcahsed a few DVD's and a multi-regional DVD player and Now I am in mystery, drama heaven!!
I ordered Trial and Retribution, the Complete Collection.  It is simiular to the Law and Order (US) but with a bigger punch. I like the way the
episodes are filmed, making use of the split screen which I found unsusal but captivating. I'm now a fan of the show, its actors and the creator Lynda LaPlante.

5768086,4,B00D2UMHPG,Top notch UK Murder Squad series. it's complex & intelligent and well worth watching if you can handle the very gritty cases and at least one I found deeply unpleasant. The head guy Walker does start to grate after a while. He's not particularly likeable and I found his domestic issues with his ex-wife & son to be over done. The chief female officers are much more likeable.  If you like gritty psychological Uk police drama's this is excellent.,1477440000,6,447,4.658227848101266

5768088,5,B00D2UMHPG,"Typical of all British crime dramas, ""Trial & Retribution"" is an outstanding viewing experience. When I add a series like this to my library---it's binge time! I'm into set three and am staying up later than I should at the tender age of 84! Lynda La Plante creates a winner every time! Even minus Dame Helen, this series is shoulder to shoulder with ""Prime Suspect""!",1473206400,5,367,4.661538461538462

5768090,4,B00D2UMHPG,"This set is an amazing bargain. 18 disks; 22 episodes; 51 hours of entertainment for $35. The stories are good, and the characters are interesting to follow through the series. I particularly liked the British courtroom scenes. I found the intensity and anger of the homicide team members a bit unsettling; I would expect such anger to eventually destroy the team. Somehow the series does not quite come together as well as the creator's other series (Prime Suspect), but the series is definitely worth the price.",1469145600,12,513,4.976744186046512
5768091,5,B00D2UMHPG,These are Grittty & Gripping Crime Dramas in the way only the British can convey. Tremendously entertaining.,1464220800,2,108,5.411764705882353
5768092,3,B00D2UMHPG,"Good show, but very last disk was cracked, which I did not discover until it was too late to return or get a replacement disk.  Very frustrating not to see the end!!

Otherwise, four stars.",1463529600,2,189,4.371428571428571

5768136,2,B00D2UMHPG,"This program is acceptable. The cinematography is different, lots of use of split screen shots.
 The crime investigations are interesting, the perpetrator arrests that then advance to the court trials are equally interesting. The constant competitive maneuvering by the individual investigators to advance their own careers is suitably slimy.
 Neither lead character; Investigator Walker nor Connor are very pleasant people, you get the impression that they just want to close the case and if they happen to arrest the actual guilty party, well, that's just gravy. Walker seems particularly corrupt (or maybe just inept).
 The insertion of the various squalid domestic dramas of the police investigators slowed the action. Author La Plante could have improved this crime to court drama by foregoing the tedious, tawdry off duty personal lives of Investgators Walker and Connor and company. Hopelessly dysfunctional families are not the stuff of entertainment and they are not indicative of ""exceptional writing"".
 The guest actors are very good and really add to the quality of this program. I really enjoyed watching them perform as various perpetrators and victims. They pretty much make the show worthy of viewing. All in all, it's ok, but not in the same league as LaPlante's Prime Suspect.",1455926400,2,1294,5.359605911330049

5768138,3,B00D2UMHPG,"It is such a shame.  This series is so well written, and well acted, except for the star.  He over acts.  His anger is too angry.  See Gloria Swanson in Sunset Blvd.  Should have put someone else in the starring role.  I've only watched the first 2 seasons, but every one is a great story.  As a reformed 50 year smoker, it's hard to watch all that chain smoking.  That, of course, is the part that he's playing, but he just overdoes everything.",1454803200,,445,4.27710843373494
5768139,5,B00D2UMHPG,"Great series, absolutely recommended, solid and entertaining. I ordered from Amazon in the States because the price was way cheaper than Canada, even with our low dollar it was still half the price. If you enjoyed Prime Suspect, you'll want to see Trial & Retribution, Lynda La Plante wrote both series. Great value as the entire collection has eighteen discs.",1453420800,8,360,5.016666666666667

5768145,3,B00D2UMHPG,"This Series is along the lines of a British Isle 'Law and Order' type Series.
Although the Series, itself is engaging, the Acorn Disks are a TERRIBLE quality,
and I had to use 2 machines and NUMEROUS tries for each disk to get them
to play.",1425254400,,240,4.239130434782608
5768176,1,B00D2UMHPG,"I really don't want to give that series even a one star but one must in order to write....nasty, mean, way too ""gritty"" for us. No good reason why it had to be so awful between the primary characters and the language, etc. is much too strong for enjoyment during the evening before sleep!
Wish we had never bought it and did not finish viewing the collection....it went into the trash where it belonged.",1424736000,4,403,4.45945945945946
5768177,5,B00D2UMHPG,Best Detective Series Ever. I watch all the BBC and Canadian detective series and this is the very finest. Full of emotion realism and candor. The writing is superb! The acting is superb. It's better than Foyles War or Detective Morris or even prime Suspect because the endings all take place in court - which is riveting.,1422144000,5,322,4.666666666666667

5768180,4,B00D2UMHPG,"I was so excited about this series at this price , started binge watching it immediately! The first few seasons have "" Pat North "" as the main female character & she is wonderful ! Then, tragically she is off & replaced by an abrasive horrible bully that SO annoyed me it was hard to watch ! I tried very hard to like this new "" DCI"" but she only gets more offensive with every season! ( the blonde dci) I've never had such a violent reaction to a character , but the thing that bothered me was I kept trying to see if maybe she was going to have a change of heart, etc that woukd add to the story- wrong! She starts in season 3 then by season 5 I can hardly watch anymore because her "" antics"" are so distracting to the otherwise great stories! Just keep hoping she will be replaced - this is honestly one of the best written series I've seen",1420675200,3,843,4.053892215568863

5768184,5,B00D2UMHPG,"La plante never fails with her balance of character and drama. Mind bogglingly good. At least as good as 'Prime Suspect'.The British continue to astonish us with their quality of actors and writers which put boring,mind numbing, plastically acted shows like CSI Miama in their forgetable place. Mind you.'Magic City',The Good Wife'and 'Mad Men' etc show that when Americans are given the chance,they can wrtie well too!",1417824000,3,419,5.268656716417911

5768212,4,B00D2UMHPG,"While i have enjoyed the programmes in the main I was dismayed to notice that as the series wen on the'feature length episodes' became shorter and shortr.  Also the gritty,gripping quality of the plot lines seemed to peter out ,and it was evident that Lynda La Plante was not writing some of the later episodes.  All in all though I enjoyed this series.  As someone who has experience with law enforcement it was interesting to see the exploration of the effects of violence on people and also the effects of 'justice denied.",1401926400,6,525,4.684782608695652

5768214,5,B00D2UMHPG,An awesome mystery detective series. Lots of twists and turns and you will be surprised how each episode ends up. The actors and actresses are well matched for their parts in this series. Good writing for the script. Interesting twists on relationships that take place during this series as well.,1379030400,8,296,4.94
5768215,5,B00D2UMHPG,"Set is a complex multi-faceted plot series. Intriguing investigation progresses with story carried to a verdict. 22 created since 1997.  Adult gritty fare, graphic scenes, language. ALSO: superb scripts and confrontational characters. Contemporary rapid change and split screen filming. Trial & Retribution is edgily compelling. Tough cops doing their job. Each episode is feature length so this set is a whole lot of entertainment cheaper than theater tickets for the same number of hours of viewing.

Team: DCSI Mike Walker (David Hayman) tough, bity, seasoned
DCI Roisin Connor (Victoria Smurfit -'Berkeley Square') hot hard body, an attitude, a risk
DS David `Satch'ell (Dorian Lough -`Notting Hill')
DS Sam Palmer (Vince Leigh)

SUBTITLES available
These episodes have been previously released in smaller sets, and yet available in that form, but not for the same cost.
This is adult entertainment due to graphic content, some nudity, and language.",1373155200,16,953,5.513698630136986
8588664,5,B00D2UMHPG,"The Region 2 set has two additional discs. Though the Region 1 says complete it is lacking the following - season 11 xvii. Conviction, and The Box. And season 12 xx Siren. The full series is 22 - 2 part stories.  So we are only given 19/22 in this boxed set. The first seven original series run about 4 hours per two-parter. The rest of the stories run 3 hours per two-parter.

My comments can be confirmed on the IMDB database.

Having said all this, an excellent series, worth the purchase despite the three missing stories.",1530662400,,526,4.458333333333333
