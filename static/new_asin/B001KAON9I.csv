I still remember many of them and loved Ranger Bill, Stumpy, and I think I had a crush on his nephew Chad!!! There was the time Chad and a friend climbed into a huge empty  water tank and the ladder fell down, stranding them inside, and then someone started to fill the tank! Then there was the one when a boy got caught in a bear trap. Lots of good memories!",1442793600,,505,4.05
