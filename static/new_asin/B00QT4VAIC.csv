6878841,1,B00QT4VAIC,I thought this was blues clues but it's the blues playroom stuff. My son (2) was very disappointed and now it sits on a shelf. Wasted $$. We didn't even make it thru all the disks. If I pick it up he says 'no want blues clues'. Was so excited to see this and how many hrs of blue my son would get... they need to just put out season blues dvds or something so we can buy all of them. It's my son's favorite show. I was mad as a hornet after getting my son all happy about this to turn it on and see it was the lame spin off with the costumes and puppets. Sad sad sad.,1431993600,28,567,3.7333333333333334

6878843,4,B00QT4VAIC,My boys used to love Blue's Clues but until recently my 3 year old daughter didn't really know who he was.  Well now we have over 4 hours of Blues Clues on three DVDs.  It is a set jam-packed with Blue's episodes previously aired from 1996-2005.  Lots of educational fun packed in there from ABCs to shapes to numbers and more!  I admit I am not a Blue's Clues fan myself but my kids do like it and there are good messages in the episodes.,1425686400,5,439,4.129411764705883

6878870,5,B00QT4VAIC,"If you are looking for great educational dvds and your child loves blues clues this is a perfect choice! For the price you get 3 full DVDs one on shapes and colors, another on alphabet and the third is numbers! The best part of all is that these DVDs are the same price as one that isn't even an hour long! I always try to look at the run time before I buy a DVD because my daughter likes to watch them before bed and I have to make sure it will play for as long as it takes for her to go to sleep. On the short DVDs she calls me into her room when they end and she is all pepped up all over again and wants to watch a different movie so we have to repeat our bedtime routine!",1449014400,3,676,3.767605633802817

6878873,5,B00QT4VAIC,"Sometimes, I just want to be able to have the gas burners on and be able to open and close the oven without having to worry about one of the kids running in and having a horrible accident. That is why I love Blue's Clues. I can pop one of these discs into the DVD player and Boom! instant peace. Mommy can get things done. Don't get me wrong, I love when I can involve the kids in what I am doing, but when there is a safety risk with fire or my daughter thinks washing her hands in the mop bucket is a good idea, I'll take the easy way out once in a while.

This is one of my 3-year-old's favorite things. Sure we'd have liked more Steve and less Joe, but so long as Blue is there, it's all good. She loves the interaction and naming the shapes and letters. She loves finding the clues and discussing what is happening as best she can. I love knowing that she is learning and that there is nothing that I'd object to her seeing. It's win-win.",1447113600,2,943,4.042780748663102
6878874,4,B00QT4VAIC,"Very happy with this. My two year old sings and dances to the same songs my little sisters did. Why the canceled this is beyond me. No other show i know grabs my sons attention nor gets him to interact with it. His knowledge of basics has gone much farther with Blue.
The only reason i am giving this a 4 star is because the inclusion of a few Blue's Room episode on one disc. Not a big problem but there was nothing in the description about this even though they are two completely different shows.",1445472000,,499,4.208333333333333
