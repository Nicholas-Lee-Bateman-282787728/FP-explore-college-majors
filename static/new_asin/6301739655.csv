355812,2,6301739655,"I ask this as a big Jerry Lewis fan who wouldn't miss his latest film in the 1950's and 1960's but did we really think THIS was funny way back then? I guess the answer is obvious. We did indeed although in retrospect the humor personally escapes me today. Either I've changed or the times have changed even more and severely dated this type of comedy. This is 95 minutes of mostly blackout sight gags, a lot of Lewis mugging, being irrerestible  to all the gorgeous young ladies, breaking things and shouting ""MA!"". All that is missing is ""Hey La-a-a-d-y!"" Maybe it plays better in France!

The good news is IF you still like this sort of thing this widescreen transfer from vibrant Technicolor elements is absolutely stunning as are the sets and art design. There is a commentary track by Jerry Lewis and Steve Lawrence (he's not in the movie but somebody has to come along to laugh I suppose), some outtakes and some trailers.

355905,4,6301739655,"The Ladies Man (1961) was Jerry Lewis' tenth solo film, and his second as director.  Lewis, then age 35, plays recent college graduate Hebert H. Heebert, who after having his heart broken, has decided to remain a bachelor.  After leaving New Jersey, Heebert is hired by a cook named Katie (Kathleen Freeman) to be a houseboy for Miss Helen Welenmelon (Helen Traubel), who unknown to him, has converted her huge mansion into a boarding house for thirty young single women.  Surrounded by a sea of females, Herbert gets an overdose of what he was trying to avoid.

While the movie features dozens of attractive women, perhaps the biggest ""star"" is the massive set for the interior of the mansion.  Featuring a cutaway view through several floors, stairs, and an elevator, the set represents an alternate to reality.

Lewis' style of humor typically features him making others the victim of his incompetence.  Early on however, there are few targets available, so instead Herbert assumes the role of victim, falling prey to circumstances, and being abused by various ladies.  Later the tide turns, and Herbert begins to do damage to others.  Buddy Lester appears as a suitor, and becomes an early victim.  When a production crew from a television program called Up Your Street, comes to the mansion to shoot an interview with Miss Welenmelon, it provides ample opportunities for Herbert display some of his many ""talents"".

While never known for being subtle, Lewis mostly keeps from going too far.  Smooth transitions between scenes, are generally not a trademark of Lewis' films, and there are many instances where various gags are just strung together, without a connecting thread.  When an awkward scene featuring Herbert and George Raft ballroom dancing abruptly fades out, it's not the least bit unusual.  Herbert also attempts to feed Miss Welenmelon's pet, perform a ballet, and engages in a wild dance number with Sylvia Lewis and Harry James and his orchestra.  Herbert doesn't have a main love interest, but Fay (Pat Stanley) is his closest friend.  The movie is a little uneven, but what makes The Ladies Man worth watching is the unique interior set, the thirty young women, and interesting scenes featuring large numbers of players.

The image quality of the DVD is quite good, and this release has some impressive extras, including deleted scenes, outtakes, and rehearsal footage.  According to IMDB, many more scenes were deleted.  Typical for his Paramount films, Lewis and his friend Steve Lawrence provide a commentary track.  Jerry doesn't appear to have any animosity toward the process, but his commentaries are not the most fan friendly.  At times Lewis seems somewhat indifferent, or perhaps too engrossed in watching the film to say much.  Occasionally, something onscreen will act as a trigger, and Jerry will come up with some marvelous gem from his vast treasure trove of memories.  Unfortunately, these occasions are rare.  While Steve Lawrence also gets lost in watching Jerry's films, but he does act as a facilitator, asking questions and trying to engage Jerry in discussion.  It's a pity, that he's not more successful.",1341273600,2,3150,5.081712062256809
355906,5,6301739655,"Of all the Jerry Lewis movies ... with or without Dean Martin .... this has to be one of my favorites.

355913,4,6301739655,"Another Jerry Lewis helmed effort, ""The Ladies Man"" is a sparkling comedy that demonstrates Lewis' strengths & weaknesses as a filmmaker.
Strengths: Nobody does broad bits of comedy business quite like Lewis.
  That enormous three-story set with the fourth wall shaved away so all the action can be followed is an impressive set indeed.
Weaknesses: Lewis' cloying tendency to undermine his humor with moments of self-serving pathos.
  Lewis' need to isolate certain gags and punctuate them, lest we miss the point (which seems to be his particular style).
As a love-spurned fellow who ""vows never to fall in love again""--and winds up at an all-girls boarding house!--Lewis gives himself all kinds of opportunities to mug, scream & tear about the large set. As with other Lewis comedies, the comedy is hit-&-miss, but it has its moments.",1260835200,,836,5.125
355914,1,6301739655,"How could anyone consider this funny?  I enjoy (mildly) some Jerry Lewis movies.  The Nutty Professor and The Big Mouth, to name a couple, get some chuckles and a few laughs out of me.  But this thing--The Ladies Man--is horrible.  Fancy sets and carefully staged pratfalls aren't what make a comedy funny.",1183334400,,306,4.826923076923077
355945,5,6301739655,"I loved Jerry Lewis movies as a kid, but naturally lost interest as I grew older and it seemed the movies simultaneously declined in quality while Jerry became increasingly annoying as a pontificating pseudo-intellectual.  However his early work was interesting as he tried different things (silence in The Bellboy for example) and he made a couple of fine comedies early on.  I have always found parts of It's Only Money and The Ladies Man hilarious. Many feel The Nutty Professor to be his best, and it has some good stuff, but I have always been partial to the all-out, anything-goes assault of gags in The Ladies Man, one of his best efforts.  Also the shmaltz and sentimentality that marred so much of his later films is, for the most part, thankfully absent here.

Comedy, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder, and you cannot fake a laugh.  You either find a non-sequiter throw-away joke like the bit with the door cited above funny, or you don't.  Likewise many of the non-stop gag setups and deliveries here will crack you up or they won't.  Of course it's silly.  It was meant to be silly.  Silly done well, is just fine.

There are some great bits here: the opening ""heartbreak"" scene (hilariously exaggerated); the butterflies; the other ""pain"" jokes (the toaster); ""baby""; the dance with George Raft; the surreal encounter with Miss Cartilage; the ""sound test"" with Doodles Weaver;  the intrusions into Mrs. Wellonmellon's TV show and so on.  And if none of the above make you laugh, there is the one certified classic routine of the ""hat bit"" with Buddy Lester doing his patented ""slow-burn"".

Jerry made good use of the elaborate set and his direction here is as concise and appropriate as possible.  As to the DVD, unfortunately, on the Commentary Jerry offers a few useful insights, but Steve Lawrence seems to be there just to say ""Great Jer"" after every bit.  Egregious, but I suppose they don't watch many DVD's, and fail to understand what a Commentary is about.  Take the 5 stars in context.",1175212800,6,2018,4.755747126436781
355946,4,6301739655,"It occurred to me that Jerry's character in this classic 1961 film, ""Herbert Heebert"" may have been inspired by the 1931 gaff when radio personality Harry von Zell mispronounced President Herbert Hoover's name as ""Hoobert Heever""....",1170028800,,233,5.5

355949,1,6301739655,"I've heard a theory why the French supposedly love Jerry Lewis. Their anti-Semitism is flattererd by seeing an obviously Jewish man act like such a total bumbling idiot. It's the same reason the Klan loved Amos 'n Andy and other stupid black characters back in the day. Let's put it on the table: Notwithstanding the untold millions he's raised for charity, on screen Jerry Lewis is an annoying, self-inflated, no-talent hack. He can't write and he can't direct. His movies are a mess of boring scattershot antics. He confuses mugging like a drunken ape for acting. Okay, The Nutty Professor was somewhat watchable (for Stella Stevens alone) and his blubbering on the MDA telethon back in the 1970s was pretty amusing. But the rest of the Lewis catalog is cinematic root canal. This horrible movie is no exception. In the commentary, we're supposed to be impressed that the Ladies Man set cost almost $1 million in 1960 dollars and took up two sound stages on the Paramount lot. We're supposed to be impressed that Lewis was the first director in Hollywood to attach a video camera for instant playback. We're supposed to be impressed that he constructed 30 dressing rooms for his female cast. We're supposed to be impressed that he hired a company to build a special crane to maneuver the camera around the gigantic set. We're supposed to be impressed that Lewis, the auteur, was seemingly in control of every aspect of this production. Fine, Jerry. But what matters is what ends up on the screen. Screaming, inane, badly timed, unfunny, dragged-out scenes that stumble one into another and go nowhere don't make a movie, no matter how many carpenters it took to build the set. (I could barely lay eyes on the kitschy set where Lewis delights in removing the fourth wall.) Perhaps it was his personal guilt over earning a fortune making fun of disabled people with mental and muscular afflictions that drove Lewis to his charities. It's a character that has been a trademark, but he doesn't play it well. Lewis is not stupid, and he doesn't play a moron well. He's shrill, grating, and obvious, and as director and writer there's no one around to tell Jerry to tone it down and yell ""Cut!""  He's over-the-top with it, and he's not believable. The movie stinks from the opening credits. At a graduation at his junior college, Lewis spies his girlfriend sitting on a bench. Suddenly she's kissing a rugged football player. Lewis is heartbroken. A funny scene would be the nebbish Lewis confronting the giant football player and demanding the girl choose between the two. (Think how Woody Allen would have handled it.) Instead Lewis falls in some bushes and has an attack of muscular dystrophy. It's a case study in his narcissism. Then he whines back to his parents and in typical Lewis fashion, we see Lewis in complete drag as an ugly woman. It goes down the toilet from there. For some real laughs, put on The Three Stooges or Laurel & Hardy--real pros--and leave Jerry to babble about his genius and how the Francophiles worship the ground he stumbles on.",1140307200,4,3058,4.780718336483932
355950,5,6301739655,"A big doll-house is the spectacular set of this stylished comedy, the second movie of Lewis as filmmaker, with the cartoon-style, sarcastic comicity, oniric visual imagination, calculated gag timing and technical curiosity characteristic in Lewis' cinematographic creations. The day of his college graduation, Herbert Heebert ( Jerry Lewis ) discovers that is being dumped by his childhood sweetheart. Heartbreaked and bored of women he decides to abandon his town and takes a job as servant in Miss Wellonmellon's house, a retired opera star, cheated by this and her housekeeper, only to discover the next morning he has been hired at an all-female boarding house.

There is a scene where he sits on a gangster's hat that is SO FUNNY- it made me laugh!

I am glad that Jerry is getting better (remember how bloated he had been?) and I hope he will make more movies soon, like this one. You know he was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize?

This says it's a new version, for DVD.  I will update my review when it comes in mail.

*Other JL faves I recommend are:  The Geisha Boy, Who's Minding the Store, Don't Give Up the Ship, The Nutty Professor.
**JL + DM  faves  are:  You're Never Too Young,  Artists + Models.
Frankly, everything JL+DM did were great fun, and Jerry's on his own are fabulous, but I haven't seen all of them.
__So go ahead, get a Collection and enjoy with the family. :-D

FYI:  Did you know Jerry Lewis taught Film-Making at UCLA?  Yep, he did.  The guy was multi-talented.",1505692800,,673,4.462809917355372

7814990,2,6301739655,"Jerry is jilted by his college girl friend and vows to remain a bachelor. He then takes a job in a womens boarding house, which serves as the setting for his antics. Over-the-top acting all around, but nobody can top Jerry at over-the-top acting. Continual physical comedy and an abundance of beautiful women. Its hard to recommend this movie. Some people like Jerry, and some dont. To me, his movies with Dean Martin were better than his single efforts. In this movie I found a few chuckles, but that was about it. Movie is dated and just too corny.",1473033600,,550,4.565656565656566
