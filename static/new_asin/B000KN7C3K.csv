8158234,5,B000KN7C3K,"There was no one real cause of the Civil War and there was never really one battle that was decisive to the outcome of the Civil War.

However this is a 50 minute documentary produced in 1992 that puts the battles, loyalties, religion and politics and their place in the account of history. It starts with 1639.

We get images (including portraits of the key players) and reenactments of many of the battles. We also draw on images from later wars to show the parallels. It uses appropriate background music and sounds. The narrator, Robert Powell,  is definitely English so one may need to adjust for the accent and pronunciation of certain words.

We get the key information from multiple interviews (not sound bites) with Dr. David G. Chandler of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst; do not be distracted by his English teeth. David Chandler places people into the English Military Pantheon.",1396137600,,895,4.868421052631579
8158235,5,B000KN7C3K,Remarkable to see film from a little known or cared about historical event.  A very good film to learn about the Spanish Civil War.,1362528000,,131,4.458333333333333
8158236,4,B000KN7C3K,"If you're expecting a full history of the Spanish Civil War, this is not for you. This documentary talks about the SCW from the sole perspective of the British International Brigade. You get firsthand accounts from both scholars and veteran British International Brigaders. The IB was made of of between 33,000-35,000 volunteers from about 52 different nations who traveled to Spain to fight on the side of the Republic (against Franco and the Nationalists) in the SCW. With this pointed focus in mind, this is a very good documentary, that also calls upon the art and many artists who participated in, died in, and/or created art inspired by the SCW.",1359331200,,651,4.927272727272728
8158237,2,B000KN7C3K,"I haven't viewed this product. In fact, from the descriptions and reviews, I can't tell what product is even offered for sale here. The title is the English Civil War (which is what I was looking for). But, the description says it's about the American Civil War. And the reviews are split between talking about the English Civil War and Charles I and the Spanish Civil War! How could such a confused and confusing web page have come to on Amazon? For shame!",1358985600,,457,4.518072289156627
8158238,3,B000KN7C3K,"I have not watched this film yet, but know something about the Spanish Civil war.  And most of those commenting here, don't.

In short, the republicans WERE fighting to save Spain against the fascist Franco who was aided by Mussolini and Hitler.

Spain at this period was a truly free, anarchist society of which we all sould only want to emulate.

The Communists later went into Spain after the fascists won the war and wrecked their own havoc.

Any real understanding of anarchist Spain would HAVE to be ""left wing"" because anarchists are not communists of the USSR sort, nor fascists!",1251072000,3,587,4.772277227722772
8158239,1,B000KN7C3K,"I bought 2 copies of this program accidently because I thought they were both different. One on amazon.co.uk and the other on amazon.com. They haven't yet made a decent program of this war, not that it's a very interesting war, but it's odd that no one is prepared to make a docmentary about the only republican government in England and the only civil war if you don't count the war of the roses, which was more a dynastic struggle. Please someone in England I know it's a banned subject, but can you make a program about this war worth watching.",1229817600,,547,4.48
8158240,3,B000KN7C3K,"This video is NOT told from an objective perspective but from a sympathizing point of view of the Republican forces and the International Brigades. The causes of the war are mentioned in a passing, very light, and superficial mannar. But in spite of some historical inaccuracies the chronological timetable narration is helpful to the viewer and mostly correct. The footage is repetative at times but helps visualize this tradegy. The interviews are a little unintelligible and lengthy but they provide a human face to the events of the war. I would recommend this video but caution to the viewer, this history seems more like hi story.",1227916800,12,636,5.009433962264151
8158241,5,B000KN7C3K,"Charles I: living in the past, stubbornly holding onto power, unreasonably religious, surrounded by evil counsellors, squandering his subjects' wealth. Sound at all familiar? Anyway, this DVD is an excellent, quite thorough explanation of the English Civil War (1641-1645), its causes, events, and impact on society. Reenactments, many contemporary documents and pictures, and some erudite dons provide a concise and entertaining history of this bloody and significant conflict.",1179705600,9,478,6.044117647058823
8158242,1,B000KN7C3K,"I have long been fascinated with the Spanish Civil War and bought this DVD with high expectations.  What a disappointment!  Rather than a history of the Spanish Civil War, it is mostly a look at Brits who served in the International Brigades, based around the memories of a few elderly members.  The overview of the war is weak with no coverage of the events that led up to the Spanish Civil War, little coverage of the political events during the war, virtually no coverage of daily life in the Nationalist and Republican zones, etc.  The focus is firmly on the battles fought by the International Brigades, but little attempt is made to place these engagements in the context of the war and the descriptions of the battles are weak.  Anyone not already familiar with the war would have been perplexed by this presentation.

As stated earlier in this review, the focus is on the Brits.  No coverage is given to so many of the interesting facets of this war.  The Requetes are not mentioned.  Neither is the Anarchist leader Durruti.  Jose Antonio Primo de Rivera and the Phalange are absent.  Franco is reduced to a figure in old newsreels and no background is given to him.  The only Republican leader to receive much treatment is La Passionaria, and this is largely in the context of memories of her by the Brits of the International Brigades.

As one might expect from the focus on the International Brigades, the tone of the presentation is overwhelmingly left-wing.  A British historian is shown sporadically, and he does his best to present accurate information on the war, but the narration and the rest of the presentation largely reduces this complex struggle to a leftist fable of good Republicans against evil Fascists.

From the credits I believe the film was actually produced in 1995.  If that fact had been mentioned, and if it had been emphasized that the DVD was mostly about the reminiscences of British members of the International Brigade, I would have awarded it two stars.  I think it would still be a poor piece of work, but I would have known what I was getting.  I give it one star because it was marketed as a history of the Spanish Civil War, and it is not.",1171152000,65,2185,4.660574412532637
