8423572,4,B004CSKD8K,"A film that seems to use the plot as a symbolic interpretation of life. The setting is both claustrophobic and liberated and the situations that the main character finds himself in are designed to show the diversity of life in all ways. The community is made up of individuals, each with their own desires and needs and we see how we adapt to each one of these. For 100 people we have 100 different persona.",1379894400,,407,4.44
8423573,3,B004CSKD8K,"Rather silly bit of soft-core gay erotica from the folks at Pride Video.  Like most all of their films, homoerotic episodes are linked together with a flimsy storyline that serves to string them together.  A young man is kept awake at by a crank caller who repeatedly telephones him during the night.  Unable to sleep, his mind wanders from one sexual fantasy to another (three in all).  The episodes vary widely in quality and effectiveness.  The first--a sort of underwater sexual ""ballet""--is far and away the best.  The second episode takes place in a vampire's lair, and is the weakest of the bunch.  In fact, it is downright laughable.  The final vignette, involving French sailors, goes on way too long.

Uneven in quality, with an atrocious, invasive soundtrack, ""The Disconnected"" is not a bad (nor a particularly good) way to spend 55 minutes, as long as you aren't expecting art.  But then, one should never expect art from Pride.  Lots of good -looking guys and some rather vague eroticism, and that's about it.",1317772800,2,1023,4.855491329479769
