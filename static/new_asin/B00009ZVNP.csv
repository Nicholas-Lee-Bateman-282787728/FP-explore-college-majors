1900185,4,B00009ZVNP,"I remember seeing ""Pontoffel Pock and His Magic Piano"" when I was very young (I was born in 1982), but haven't seen it in ages and the name of it slipped me for a long time (I always mixed it up with ""Oh The Places You Will Go!"").  I remember being young and liking the magic piano with the colorful buttons--it was like a player piano--to escape, he would push a colorful button and would fly away on his piano as it played a fanciful tune.  Wow.

I am really well-versed when it comes to obscure Dr. Seuss cartoons--and I love them all.  I had a boss several years ago who was a fan of the Lorax, but I haven't seen this one in years.

Finally I figured out the title!!!!  And I can remember liking this one.  I would love to see it again!!!",1147996800,4,743,4.082758620689655
1900186,5,B00009ZVNP,"The Lorax is one my favorite Dr. Seuss cartoons. Obviously Ted Geisel (Dr. Seuss) had many different things on his mind when he wrote The Lorax. While many kids enjoy this story, many of them, most likely, will not be able to see one of the messages Dr. Seuss incorporated into the story: Corporate greed.

The cartoon is very well done, but I noticed extreme color fadings on the cartoon. It's not as crisp and bright as the ones I've seen growing up. In fact, this is the worst presentation I've seen The Lorax in. There are also a few scenes where the color finally gets brighter, but then a few seconds later, it turns to dull coloring again.

I have not seen the second cartoon on this DVD but plan to soon.

In a nutshell, The Lorax is a fine cartoon. But the extreme color fading of the film is most likely the worst presentation it has been given in. It is still worth the buy.",1096934400,2,885,4.287425149700598
1900187,5,B00009ZVNP,"The environmentally conscious Lorax appears here in an expanded version of the Dr. Seuss book, where we see more about how the profit-minded Once-Ler destroyed the truffula trees. My kindergartener loved the book, and I happened across this tape at Wal-Mart in a bargain bin. Having seen it as a kid myself, it was a natural purchase. She's watched it eight times in three days, so it must have stood the test of time! The music is a bit dated, sure, but she won't care about that for a few years yet, and it's pure nostalgia for my wife and me. The story even strikes the correct balance between commercial interests and environmentalism: Just take care of nature while you're creating jobs, and all will be well. But if you don't.....yikes.

 The forgotten story included here is about Pontoffel Pock, a loser of a young man who can't get his simple two-step job right and gets fired. He is given a magic piano so he can ""get away from it all,"" and of course he fouls that up too, but eventually figures out how to rescue a damsel in distress. My little girl doesn't quite get the romance aspect of this story, but we both enjoy the fantasy. Not in the league of ""The Lorax,"" but cute.",1090454400,33,1187,4.465437788018433
1900188,4,B00009ZVNP,"As a child I loved the Lorax for the simple rhymes and laughed at the comical little Lorax standing up to the might of the Once-ler. I think from the standpoint that it is fun and interesting ryhme ranks it right up around the four stars mark because it got young children to read.
As an adult, I find the stance that the Lorax make for accountability to be a valuable lesson that adults can relate to children in explaining this story.
What I really like and thought it was well conveyed (despite the very dated background music and the liberal rewording to extend the poem) is that final stanza where Dr. Suess, through the Once-ler, lets us know that even with all the problems there is still a chance to better the world we live in but it will require great care and effort...",1079395200,9,780,4.386206896551724
1900189,5,B00009ZVNP,"I bought this for the secondary video, Pontoffel Poff and his magic piano. When I was a kid I would watch this over and over again. Now I am so excited that I can share it my nieces, nephews, and some day my own children.",1384646400,,221,3.933333333333333

1900194,5,B00009ZVNP,"I had purchased the classic Dr. Suess book The Lorax for my 5yr. old grandson and remembered the original short animated story, that followed the book almost exactly, from my childrens young days.  The new movie version is nothing like the book but this DVD is the same as the one I remember and my grandson loves it.  Pontoffel Pock & His Magic Piano was silly but didn't spoil my pleasure with my purchase.",1347926400,,408,4.5

1900197,5,B00009ZVNP,I've always loved the story of The Lorax and used it to teach an important lesson in a fun and friendly way to my children as they were growing up.  How great to find a newly remastered DVD copy to replace my old and worn VHS.  It's as great as it ever was!,1293580800,,257,3.830188679245283

1900200,5,B00009ZVNP,"Doc Seuss had ecological wisdom far ahead of many greedy timber companies of the day. I believe forest managers have finally realized that forest ecosystems are very diverse and that they sustain numerous species of flora and fauna, and protect soil and water resources for the benefit of all. This video should be mandatory viewing for all current foresters, students of forestry, entrepreneurs, and land managers. It only takes one person to mess things up, and it can take one person to make a positive difference. A similar video which has profound insight is ""The Man Who Planted Trees"". Both are excellent resources to use in group, family or school study and discussion. Thank you Dr. Seuss for revealing greed in its purest sense to wake people from their slumber to steward God's creation properly.",1259020800,,807,4.985185185185185
1900201,5,B00009ZVNP,I love this story and music.  I use it to teach 6th graders about the geographic theme of human-environment interaction.,1254182400,,120,5.0
1900202,4,B00009ZVNP,"The Lorax is a great story.  My daughter loves to read the book for bedtime, and she enjoys watching the movie as well.  While not exactly like the book (it's expanded, and some parts are omitted like paying the Onceler in the beginning, etc..), The Lorax DVD keeps the central message intact: care for the environment, and being greedy will get you nowhere.

I'd recommend it because it's a classic Seuss story and a very important lesson is contained within.",1245456000,,460,4.725
1900203,5,B00009ZVNP,Very cute movie for elementary-early middle school-aged children.  I use it in my 6th grade science class as a fun way to wrap up our environmental studies unit.,1238889600,,161,4.75

1900205,3,B00009ZVNP,The Lorax is a timeless moral lesson about human greed and its impact on our environment. This story book should be on every child's bookshelf. The two videos on the DVD were well received by my son although the music and animation are quite characteristic for its time (early 1970s).,1222992000,2,284,4.7
1900206,5,B00009ZVNP,Great!  The DVD came quickly and was able to be used in a classroom lesson re: the environment!,1215907200,,95,4.277777777777778

7994976,5,B00009ZVNP,"This is the classic 60s/70s~ ""The Lorax."" While it features great music, curious kids,  a noble Lorax and one, evil Onceler; one might find none of the beyond bright colors and marshmallows running rampant in the recently-released  version.",1491868800,,240,5.2894736842105265
