8549525,2,B00AB22C6W,"I admit that I'm spoiled living in Metro DC with a plethora of great belly dance teachers and guest instructors brought in to the studio I train with. From the title, I expected more on commanding a stage presence and really taking things to the next level for experienced solo artists. If this is your first time putting together a choreography or solo, perhaps it would be useful, but I didn't find it particularly helpful or ""stunning.""

The cons outweigh the pros on this DVD, so I say skip it unless you don't have much to choose from. There is minimal breakdown, and pretty basic combinations for a video that advertises ""stale to stunning."". There are no mirrors for the breakdown, Lotus faces you. Her verbal cueing is fine, but I think most dancers would want to see her from more than one angle. The set is bare bones; a black stage and black curtains for the first part, then some added mirrors and pillows for the next segment. There is no music for the breakdowns or drills until she starts teaching the choreography and you run it (yawn). Without music, and set to a drab, black background, it feels sleepy and uninspired.  I didn't find the combos ""fresh"" or ""exciting"" in any way, and I found her movements to be a bit short on technique. Her movements are not full or complete, and her foot and ankle placement are not the most graceful I've seen.  The ""floorwork"" segment is exactly one super basic kneeling posture.

The ideas for entry and posing are probably the only useful thing on this DVD. At the end, she has 4 different performers do an outline of the choreography you learned. If you are into that, great. Or you could just save your money and watch youtube clips. This will be a library donation DVD.",1382659200,,1729,4.54983922829582
8549526,3,B00AB22C6W,"I enjoyed Lotus's clarity when she spoke, her simple and effective way of using a loose skeleton for choreography, and the use of other dancers to show how they would choose to use or not use the elements taught in the video. I was hoping to see the instructor break down her process for coming up with a skeleton....such as musical analysis, phrasing concepts, and understanding what the dancer wants out of this dance (high points, tension, etc). I misunderstood the promotional clip and description for this production...that is typical of me when I look for videos. Lotus provides a very nice choreography that you can choose to use as is, or change depending on your own interpretation. I also like her personality and smile. She is easy to listen to and follow along with. So if you are looking for a choreography that you can use now, this is a very nice approach and piece to use. If you want to learn how to put one together for yourself and how a professional dancer approaches the music (her concepts, intention, thoughts, process, etc) this doesn't get into that part.",1370649600,,1080,4.689473684210526

Breakdown of moves:
Randa inspired turns
shimmy
choo choo shimmy with arabesque
Bicycle hips
Floor work
The only quarrel I had with this section was that she does not tell which direction she starts off with, and that may be because she wanted you to make the choreography your own. She also does not tell very often about direction in the choreography. All of the moves taught in the choreography are not in the movement breakdown section.  I would have liked more emphasis being put on posture but since I highly doubt by the content and minimal breakdown that this is a DVD for beginners I won`t find an issue with that. And that leads me to say , beginners may not be able to keep up with this choreography, If you have a good grasp of basic movement  and some choreography experience under your belt you should be fine. Lotus uses simple moves, but she has the ability to make a simple moves absolutely stunning.

Skeleton Choreography:
Part 1-9
You practice three times  the one particular section and then once from the top for each section
The whole choreography
The choreography is not broken down into counts. You have to listen to the music and catch the accents. The choreography is also broken down into sections not combo's. It involves a lot of transitions and a good amount of spins. There is an option to use the veil or not. I enjoyed section 4 the most.
Variations
Final pose-I enjoyed this section
Entrance-Different entrance possibilities to go with the music
The final pose variations are not broken down. They are demonstrations.  The entrance section movement is not broken down in any depth but a little more so than the final pose section. I like the fact that this choreo seems universal, you could take it restructure it and use it for a lot of different songs.
Performance
Lotus,
Samira Shuruk
Jahazaal
Makeda
and then split screen with all four dancers.
  What I liked about the performance section is that everyone added their own spin to the choreography demonstrating what Lotus said about making a choreography your own. I am unsure how I would classify this DVD. Nothing is spelled out for you, you definitely have to think how can I apply some of these principles to my dance. Even the back cover says that this is not a DVD to follow blindly. It requires you to think outside of basic dance DVD's and put yourself into the choreography

  I did not care for the music. But I did enjoy Lotus's interpretation of the choreography. I am not sure I got anything out of the DVD that I have not already ran into though. Some of the information about stage presence is on her drum solo DVD. As with most choreographies you get some nice combo's and poses.
I think the goal was to give you a loose choreography so that you had something to build upon , the little pointers given would then help you to stylize it on your own if needed and from there you could take the process of what you did to your own dancing routines. I believe I liked the concept but am not so keen on its execution, it took me a couple of tries to understand what the DVD had to offer.

I am giving the DVD four stars . It purpose was to give you ideas and  tips to put towards your own dance. Which it did and it also gave you some structure in creating your own  choreography from this very loose one. The camera angles were usually good except in the performance section with Jahazaal for some reason some of the beginning dance was shot really close up I could not get the full effect of what she was doing.
Lotus as usual is an excellent instructor, but I think some of the choreograph breakdown went to fast.

  I think getting this DVD will highly depend on where you are in your dancers journey. The movement base makes it above a beginner and the content would put it at beginner intermediate. I think this DVD would give tips to someone who is going into the choreography portion of their dance, both learning choreography and creating their own or maybe needing help improvising. Creating a loose choreography would be  a great way to smooth you into full improve.. This DVD was hard to rate because it is not a thorough learning to choreograph or improvise DVD  like say Combin-ography  or Nadira Jamal's series. Nor is it strictly stage presence.  It has small elements of both in a round about way.

Is it worth it? Maybe! This was one of those times were had I looked closely at what was being presented I might have skipped this DVD entirely and  again this was definitely one of those DVD's were I had to use it a couple of times to understand what it had to offer.. I already utilize a lot of these concepts in my dance.  I did like some of the combo's very much but  not enough  to warrant the DVD, so I don't know.

Buyer know that if you are thinking of purchasing this DVD the majority of it is a loosely based choreography meaning sometimes she tells you what moves to do and sometimes  she tells you what kinds of moves to do.. Let say traveling moves but she lets you choose which traveling move you use. It is a nice mixture. She doesn't even tell you which way to start say right, or left foot and there is no counting, she really wants you to put some effort into creating which can be a very good thing or not depending on what you are looking for. Basically instead of giving you a full choreography she is helping you create one. I am at in between about  not counting the breakdown of steps. Firstly because she uses very basic movements most of the time and I also think that it is good practice for learning choreo's,or even combo's without have a full structure but then it can be needlessly hard for some.
