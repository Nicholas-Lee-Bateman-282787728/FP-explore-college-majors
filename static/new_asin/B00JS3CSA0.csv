8653680,4,B00JS3CSA0,"I ordered this collection for one film only, Wild Women.  It is a 1970 made-for-TV western starring some mainly 50's and 60's film stars.  A group of female prisoners are recruited to help the army transport some ammo and a cannon across the Southwest to aid the army in fighting Mexican forces when the U.S. annexes Texas.  It is an enjoyable little western and at 74 minutes it doesn't last long but doesn't bore.  The DVD quality is good.  Recommended.",1509840000,,455,4.6375
