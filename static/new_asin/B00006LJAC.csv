7971989,3,B00006LJAC,JUST NEEDS TO BE ALOT HARDER BANDS. IT'S NOT BAD IF YOUR INTO THOSE BANDS. IT SHOWED ME A VERY LIGHT SIDE OF DEATH METAL IF THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL IT.,1299888000,,148,3.806451612903226
7971990,5,B00006LJAC,I bought vol vi prior to this so was expecting something a little different. But I was happy with what I saw - I have a broad range of music I like and I enjoyed nearly all the bands on this DVD - except Stratovarius - I don't what the hell kind of band they're supposed to be. Their song on vol vi was bearable but not on vol vii - it's vomit material.,1093132800,,353,3.7837837837837838
7971991,3,B00006LJAC,"Ok, ok, since there are some fairly far apart views on this DVD, here's the middle of the road answer.  There is definintely a lot of power metal on here given the title, not that power metal is bad but its not my favorite.  Standout videos are from IN Flames, Soilwork, and the Dimmu videos (Puritania is a overdub of live footage, and therefore pales in comparison with the actual live video on disc 2).  The live disc was more enjoyable (DEATH!!!!).  If you are into the live videos this is a good choice, otherwise the MONSTERS OF METAL DVD or DEATH IS JUST vol VI dvds are beter",1087862400,,583,4.321100917431193
7971992,5,B00006LJAC,"This dvd was pretty cool with all the hammerfall videos and live stuff. I think that anybody who would complain that this video has too much power metal, probably didn't take the time to read the track listing before purchasing it, and thus is a victim of their own stupidity.",1055548800,,276,4.54
7971993,1,B00006LJAC,"Death is just the beginning Vol. 7 , A title wich in itself brings hopes of ogre metal cave troll bashing riffs, but do you get it? No, ""Death is just the beginning Vol. 7"" Wich has cover art of skeletons and graves brings hope of gore metal hatchet to the head mentality but do you get it? No, what you get is extreme power metal with big fluffy hair, dragon-heart themed rock ballads wich where supposed to be dead and gone with the fall of the year 1989 and the rise of the 1990's. This DVD is a waste of time, well unless you like 40 year old men dancing around in leather and studs singing about taking over the whole world with their heavy metal, or unless you work in a steel mill.
With very few exceptions the bands on this DVD have as much talent as finger nail clippings so do their fans.  Thanks Nuclear Blast for making me smash my TV!
