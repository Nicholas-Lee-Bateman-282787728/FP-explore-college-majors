Just terrible. Save your money.",1222819200,,163,4.433333333333334

3052996,5,B0010X741E,"I can't say enough good things about the series Flight 29 Down. My kids and I watched the first season on broadcast television and loved it. The cast is outstanding. Discovery Kids decided to drop their affiliation with CBS, we anxiously awaited the release of season 2 on DVD.  In the first half of season 2, the castaways come together and make a lot of progress. However, midway through the season, D.J. Mchale introduces a catalyst into the story and turns up the fire. The relationships that were built among the castaways suddenly disintegrate, the group splits apart, and it appears as though everything is lost. Lots of action, suspense and peril. Season 2 ends on a cliff hanger that is resolved in the series finale movie Hotel Tango. Themes include the development of survival skills, leadership, team building, and the concept of democratic rule.

(Parental Note: one of the characters wanders around in a bikini in a couple episodes of seasons 1 and 2)",1212192000,3,965,4.842424242424243
3052997,5,B0010X741E,"I loved this dvd!!! I had to buy it after I got the first season and my favorite episode wasn't on it! This season had it which made me happy : ) The second season menu is better than the first one because you watch each episode seperately instead of it being like one long episode like in the first season.  Also, the dvd case is much better quality and the 2nd season is overall better. It's a great show and the cast is AMAZING!!! Buy it!!!!",1206576000,3,444,4.103448275862069

8238897,3,B0010X741E,"This was a fine series.  I am NOT the audience it was directed to, but I enjoyed it originally, and these deliveries.  One objection...  Too many 'Opens and Closes', with credits.  Season 1 seguied four episodes to each DVD.  An open at the start, a close at the end.",1396828800,,267,4.36734693877551
8238898,4,B0010X741E,"I've reviewed Season 1. This is more of the same. Good, clean, family entertainment with a slight, but unobjectionable, edge. ""Lost"" for kids.",1357344000,,142,5.217391304347826

8238900,5,B0010X741E,I have two boys ages 6 & 8 and we had a great time watching this entire series! There was a little bit of everything but it was still appropriate for young viewers. Even I got into it!!,1277337600,,185,3.8947368421052633
8238901,5,B0010X741E,"I use this on rainy days for my 4th grade class. We also read the chapter books. They love it, as most already watch the reruns on Discover Kids.  It has a lot of science in the episodes (tide, water cycle, plants, survival etc...)  they love the characters and can relate to them.  Not to mention the actors that are from Disney Channel (Nathan).  They are so in to the series, there is just something about it they can't seem to get enough of.  It is cheaper at [...] $14 but hard to find the other seasons anywhere.  I wish they still published it.",1267660800,,551,4.25
