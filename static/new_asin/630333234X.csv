7843997,5,630333234X,"Very well written episodes that still are kinda freaky. The best of the two is the first about two teen girls who believe there may be a vampire on the loss in their fair city. This episode is great, worthy of the adult series ""Tales from the Crypt"". The second episode is great that has the classic ""Crypt"" twist at the end. Good stuff.",1120953600,,337,4.28125
7843998,5,630333234X,"I remember watching this series in the early 90's when ever I could get the channel to come in good enough so I could see it. Luckily, a few years ago I was able to find these on VHS and bought three of them. This being one of the three.

Overall, these stories are great with a moral that the first episode teaches crime doesn't pay while the second, and my favorite, teaches to respect nature. With that said, I really do enjoy both of the episodes. I'm just glad I still have them so I can watch it anytime I want. Hoping for the day when they release this on DVD.",1120953600,,567,4.0625
7843999,5,630333234X,"I remember that when I was a kid this cartoon was on, now, seven years later I found two different videos of this show at the Rite id during the Halloween season. The first video was While the Cat's Away/Nature, and the second was the Gorilla's Paw/This Wraps It Up. I watched the tapes and fell back in love with the series. The creators did a great job translating the adult HBO series for us kids, and while the animation isn't great, its still pretty good by 1994's standards. Gorilla's Paw I found really great, its about a kid who wants to get in the ""cool"" gang but they won't let him, so he steals a magic gorilla paw from a strange new shop called 'Crypt of Curiosity' as a favor for them. Right away they change their minds and still won't let in him, so he shows them that the paw is real and can grant wishes. They let him in and it turns out that the ""cool"" gang isn't that cool, when the owner of the paw, a giant fierce gorilla, comes looking for is hand.
The second episode is good too, its about a school field trip to Egypt that teaches the only girl in the class that she is brave and smart. There's also a mummy of a long-dead Queen that punishes a pair of villians using the girl for her dreams (she knows how to navigate through booby traps and such) after the get sealed in the burial chamber with the recently awakened mummy. Great fun!",1013385600,,1360,4.21455938697318
