8299876,5,B001EXMPWS,"Good video.  I enjoyed especially the classic footage, and wished there had been more.  Much of the film is people recalling experiences or stories of Zeb.  The focus is on him, but also on schooner sailing and the maritime trade along the coast of New England.  Altogether well done, although it may not grab audiences who are not already interested in wooden sailboats, maritime history, schooners, whaling, Martha's Vineyard, etc.  For those of us who are obsessed with vintage sailing craft and the real men who commanded them, this film is a welcome addition to the library.",1237852800,3,579,4.927835051546392
8299877,5,B001EXMPWS,"An excellent narrative of Zeb Tilton & Schooner Life in the early 20th Century using never before seen archival film footage and serious interviews with maritime historians who know what they are talking about.

I was impressed by how the film links the commercial sailing past of the New England coast with the recreational sailing present.

An excellent gift for sailors and history buffs.",1219881600,2,391,5.09375
