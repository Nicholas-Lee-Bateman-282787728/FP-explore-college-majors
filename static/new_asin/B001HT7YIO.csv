8309549,5,B001HT7YIO,"This is the most comprehensive training video I have found on the topic of Botox injections. Many clients assume that Botox is extremely simple and requires little more than a couple of pokes here and there, which makes many unsuspecting clients quite susceptible to unqualified medical aestheticians that are not properly educated.

I have done a great deal of reading about administering Botox injections, but nothing has compared to the information that I've learned--and the techniques that I have learned and refined--thanks to this training course. Even someone like myself who is skilled in administering Botox can find something to gain here.

This course is taught by Delores Kent MD, one of the leading authorities on cosmetic Botox injection. When I saw that this video was instructed by her, I recognized her name immediately and knew that the video would be quality. She is a very meticulous and careful doctor and instructor, and her attention to safety and techniques for optimal results are incredibly fascinating to watch. This is how all Botox sessions should go.

Any licensed professional that already administers Botox or plans to do so in the future needs to watch this video.  Not only are reminders about guidelines extremely helpful, but this video will absolutely help you give clients better results",1428364800,,1326,5.182242990654205
8309550,5,B001HT7YIO,As a licensed skin care specialist I found this DVD very educational. The video is very informative and the cosmetic surgeon is clear & concise in demonstrating the techniques. She covers all areas such as injection guidelines and the anatomy of the neck. This DVD shows all the techniques that makes botulinum toxin injections easier. It is a great video...thank you Dr Kent.,1415145600,,376,4.984126984126984

8309552,2,B001HT7YIO,"I am a medical aesthetician and a massage therapist and although I know my anatomy well, I did not find this DVD very helpful.  I did learn a thing or two (more like a refresher) however not well enough to do injectables. Not comprehensive enough, not worth the money.",1353024000,2,268,4.469387755102041
8309553,5,B001HT7YIO,I was looking for a good video on botox injections so I could show my clients the procedure and also use as a reference. This video was exactly what I was looking for. It was very professional and well worth the price.,1241481600,11,218,4.214285714285714
