1449438,5,B00005JLJE,"First season of frasier was somethin i never could have imagined from a tv show. Season one set the ground for a series that was about to come propably the most loveable sitcom in the world.
Why frasier is so good?the chemistry between the""original three""(fras, marty and niley) is so spectacular that it alone would keep in front of the tv screen for hours. but it is just not that. fiery dialogs, amazing actors, both leading roles and supporting ones, full of remarks to history, culture, entertainment, human relationships, snoby lifestyle and much much more.
Its unbelieveable that after so many years frasier still keeps its fresh touch, and doesnt bore or make one yawn.
This dvd version is a biggest boon;) that can happen to all of us fras-a-holics.",1048032000,11,758,4.838461538461538
1449439,5,B00005JLJE,"Season One of Frasier, what a season it was. Filled with so many classic episodes that resonate emotionally and most importantly, comically. Some of the classic episodes included are My Coffee With Niles; where Frasier questions his happiness, Dinner at Eight, I Hate Frasier Crane, Here's Looking at You; where Frasier gets Martin a telescope, The Show Where Lilith Comes Back, A Midwinter Night's Dream; where Niles and Daphne are trapped in Niles' mansion on a stormy night, Author, Author and Frasier Crane's Day Off. All of the episodes mentioned above are classics in their own right and deserve to be remembered on a 4 disc DVD set. Hell, i could have written down all 24 episodes; there just the ones i think are a little better.",1046649600,16,737,4.811023622047244
1449440,5,B00005JLJE,"For those of us who love sophisicated, urbane comedy, Frasier has been our lightning rod for the last ten years. Far better than its predecessor, Cheers, it almost harkens back to its spiritual predecessor in Jack Benny. (It was no accident that Kelsey Grammer hosted a prime-time retrospective on the comedy of Benny.)
The merits of this show are almost too numerous to mention in a short review, but let's start with the cast. A strong group of ensemble players who are given free reign by the star (most refreshing that Grammer is not tempted to hog the limelight when confronted by this group) to define AND broaden their characters. No one remains static.
I realize that to go on is only to continue preaching to the choir. Those who have seen the show know all about it. Even those who have not seen the show have more than an inkling of what it's about. So let me now give you the most compelling reason to buy this DVD:
The only way to see the first season as it now stands is to watch it in reruns on various television stations. One also realizes on second or third viewing that more and more of the show is disappearing into the sea as more time is allotted for commercials. If you want to see it UNCUT and COMMERCIAL FREE at any time anywhere there's a DVD player and television handy, this is the only way you will ever be able to achieve that goal, and for fans of Frasier, it is a goal more than worth the money.",1046390400,63,1427,4.348314606741573

1449567,5,B00005JLJE,"I'm not sure why I procrastinated for so long about buying this show on DVD. I always enjoyed it during it's initial primetime run and afterwards watching many late night repeats. So, I finally bought the complete first season & I was not disappointed in the slightest. Just as funny now as it ever was. Great cast, brilliant writing, and it's hard to pick out any one or two episodes as a favorite--they were all funny.

Some more than others obviously, but the good doctor and his great supporting cast always bring a good time. Here's to Season 2 and a whole lot more...",1499731200,,573,4.509615384615385

1450275,4,B00005JLJE,"The Frasier show lasted several years, so obviously it did something right. Since I am somewhat like a real Frasier, I am not exactly sure what is funny about this show.  I do appreciate Niles and Frasier though Martin, Eddie, Daphne, and the rest are irritating more than endearing. By the time Cheers ended, it was a tired old wheezing horse looking for a cheap laugh. The Frasier show was a chance to start again. For at least the first season, the formula worked. Kelsey Grammer was more than capable of carrying the ensemble forward. Yes, I understand the average buffoon watching television wanted to laugh at anybody with intelligence, taste, and style.  And that is the basic theme behind the Frasier show. Jed Clampett gets even. As Frasier would say, ""ha ha."" But, there is a counter-insurgency theme too. Frasier's attempts at culture and intellectual stimulus are not entirely lost.  When Kelsey speaks French in appreciation of haute cuisine, I am thrilled.  When he appreciates opera and the grandeur of classical music, I am delighted.  So, there is something there that indeed works.",1482796800,,1099,4.951086956521739

1450454,5,B00005JLJE,"""Frasier"" is perhaps one of the most successful spinoffs in television sitcom history from the successful ""Cheers."" With the same creators and developers for ""Cheers,"" ""Frasier"" took one of the supporting actors, Kelsey Grammar and his character Dr. Frasier Crane and relocated him to Seattle, Washington with a new job, apartment, and home away from the bar in Boston, Massachusetts.

Frasier Crane's Kelsey Grammer was supported by a sterling cast of characters. His brother, Dr. Niles Crane, was played magnificently by David Hyde Pierce. His father, Martin Crane, is perfectly played by Steppenwolf Theatre veteran John Mahoney. His physical therapist is played by British actress, Jane Leeves, who I remembered her from ""Throb"" and ""Women in Prison."" Frasier's radio show producer, Roz Doyle, was played perfectly by Peri Gilpin. The extended supporting cast of characters included a memorable Harriet Sansom Harris as Frasier's agent, Bebe; David Hibbert as Gil Chesterton and Dan Butler as Bulldog Briscoe. Famous and recognizable voices visit Frasier's radio show especially his ex-wife Dr. Lillith Sternin (played perfectly by Bebe Neuwirth).

The four DVDs include every episode from the first season including a special feature from celebrity voices; the making of ""Frasier"" featurette;"" ""Frasier's apartment;"" and just a perfect DVD series. I enjoyed it all over again.",1481414400,,1381,5.540284360189573

David Angell, a creator and executive producer of the NBC series ''Frasier,'' died on Tuesday on American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston. He was 54 and lived in Pasadena, Calif. Mr. Angell was returning with his wife, Lynn, 52, to California from their summer home in Chatham, Mass., NBC reported. Flight 11 was hijacked and flown into the north tower of the World Trade Center in Manhattan at about 8:45 a.m. - yup even Frasier was touched by the atrocity of 9/11 ... sigh ... ;(",1481155200,,616,4.558558558558558

Strongly suggest watching and give it a chance, Season 1 starts off slow but builds to a better show.  If you are not liking it after Season 1 or 2, I would say you are not going to like it at all.

I had completely forgotten how much fun this show was to watch until I finally caught it on Prime.  If you liked Frasier on Cheers then you'd definitely want to check out this spin-off.  His humor is pretty much the same, except instead of a bar setting it predominantly takes place in either the recording booth for his show or his swanky apartment, and it revolves mostly around his interactions with his his father and brother.

Some of the Cheers cast mates also guest start periodically so that's pretty cool.",1465862400,2,659,4.5508474576271185

This DVD is totally worth the price if you are a fan of this show, or if you are just getting started and are in the mood for some quality entertainment. Also, it's nice they include the celebrity voices feature so you can see all those celebrities who cameoed as callers on Frasier's radio show, also, their is a short documentary about the shows inception, and a featurette about the dcor of Frasier's apartment.

Plus there's always a serious message somewhere in the underplay that grounds the show and gives the characters that touch of reality which makes them all so endearing. The first season is a must see because all the players are introduced and all their subtleties begin to unfold.",1463788800,,408,4.927536231884058

I didn't see Cheers I enjoy Frasier one thing I greatly dislike is that Daphne is suppose to a health care worker and  physical therapist and as a physical therapist it drives me crazy to see how her character acts in that capacity. However I do like the father son relationships though the Niles/Daphne thing at the beginning is mildly creepy. I like how the characters grow,1462406400,,406,4.638888888888889

It is also quite refreshing that the writers and producers didn't feel they had to pander to the masses and make every episode about sex as so many shows on TV today focus on. That being said, the show can be very entertaining and has something for everyone.",1436745600,,432,4.551282051282051

1457164,5,B00005JLJE,A nice ensemble of characters who are diverse and compliment each other as well as the story lines. Incredibly witty. This show represents a time in television history that no longer exists; a time when television actors rose to meet the demands of exceptionally written sitcoms. This show represents the best in t.v. in the late 90s and early 2000s.,1436745600,,350,4.85

1458010,5,B00005JLJE,"When Frasier was introduced to TV viewers in the early 1990s, I was working out of the country. I now have the opportunity to acquaint myself with the wonderful cast and quirky plots. Frasier gives a whole new meaning to ""family"" (dilettante brothers and psychiatrists Frasier and Niles, down-to-earth father Martin, cockney healthcare giver and live-in Daphne, producer Roz of Frasier's mental health broadcasts, and Martin's dog Eddie). There is a host of unforgettable characters, dilemmas, situations, romantic and professional liaisons, and misadventures. Watch an episode or two and you will be hooked. A favorite haunt and backdrop is a coffee house, the studio where Frasier works, and his tastefully and expensively decorated high-rise apartment in Seattle which features his father's ugly, out-of-place, duct-taped recliner. The episode with a Tango (Niles/Daphne) is one of my favorites.",1428105600,,898,5.610294117647059

I was surprised to find that it didn't make me laugh as much as I wanted but it was seeing an old friend.

1458288,5,B00005JLJE,Frasier is simply delightful. I don't know how to describe Frasier and his brother but they are lovable in a twisted way. They are both psychiatrists who live in a high class lifestyle way but their father(a former cop who got shot in the hip) is a down to earth and has differences of opinion with the sons quite often. Daphne is the hired help to Frasier and his father. She also thinks she is psychic. What a great comedy!,1426636800,,425,4.325

1458833,5,B00005JLJE,"I NEVER watched this show on TV.  Why?  I don't know why!!  I just never gave it a chance.  I finally saw a few re-runs on TV with my husband while on vacation recently and was hysterical, laughing.  It's a wonder we didn't get kicked out of the hotel room for all the noise!  I mean, 'LAUGH OUT LOUD, SIDE SPLITTING, LAUGHTER!!!!'  So, when we arrived back home, I ordered the First Season and I've watched it several times, yes... the whole First Season.  It has now prompted me to order MORE, MORE, MORE Seasons!!  There are 11 seasons all total.  The show is about a psychiatrist 'on the radio' with a younger brother, who is also a psychiatrist (but 'off the radio' and who makes fun of his older brother who is 'ON THE AIR' giving advice and talking about something that should only be 'one on one' in an office situation.)  But, that's only part of the problem... Frazier (originally from Seattle but moved to Boston and 'cried in his beer' (in that famous bar) over his failed marriage to another psychiatrist) had finally gotten divorced, moved back to Seattle (and to quote Frazier, ""Go Seahawks!!"") to begin a NEW LIFE,  only to find that his father, who cannot live alone due to an injury from being a policeman, is now going to live with him... and did I mention Eddie???  Eddie is the father's dog, who LOVES to SIT and STARE at Frazier!  It drives Frazier COMPLETELY NUTS!  Oh, and the 'live in' English physical therapist, Daphne, who tries to bring about harmony... 'in her own English way'.  It's one 'laugh out loud' moment after another and another and another at home and in the studio with Roz, his producer.  Why didn't I watch it when it was on prime time... who knows!  I'm now going to get each season (UNEDITED) on DVD's and through Amazon and... 'LAUGH OUT LOUD!!!'  The first 5 seasons WON an Emmy for 'Best Comedy on Television' and now I know why... and so do you.",1423267200,4,1895,4.4563953488372094

As with many shows, it starts off a bit slow so I am never the biggest fan of first seasons, although I have to admit they quickly moved the characters along.  In some cases it didn't seem to make sense.  But overall it is still a well written and well acted show, and it is a shame there is nothing of this caliber on TV anymore.  The pompous Crane brothers never fail to make you laugh and having characters such as Martin, Daphne and Roz keeps them under control, or it would all be a bit too much.  While I enjoyed other seasons of this series more, I certainly still recommend this first season.",1408492800,,635,4.214876033057851

The cast is truly one of the best that ever worked together (including 'Moose/Eddie'). Each of the episodes are just priceless. I will not tire of watching it again and again.,1400371200,,336,4.106060606060606
1460812,5,B00005JLJE,"Unfortunately, although everyone around me was talking about Fraser,  I didn't discover this show for myself until its last two seasons.and I absolutely loved it. I was able to catch it from the first episode and it just got better. This show was very original to me. There were many themes and situations throughout the show that are just part of adult life that were true and funny, especially the episodes about dating.",1400284800,,422,4.780821917808219
1460813,5,B00005JLJE,I watch Frazier to get a relief from a hard day.  I have a 3 year old and we watch his shows most of the te but I watch Frazier on my iPhone,1400112000,,140,3.242424242424242

1460815,5,B00005JLJE,I believe Fraiser to be the best show of the 1990's.  This first season is AA+ and watching it without commercials makes a world of difference.,1399420800,,143,4.5
1460816,5,B00005JLJE,"I've watched tons of sitcoms and I can say that Frasier is my top of all of them. I just can't find anything wrong with this sitcom, the characters mesh so well, they're hilarious. My only wish would be that they would be real. I would move to Seattle and try and be friends with them just to keep laughing my whole life long.",1399248000,,326,4.109375

The story is so witty and its unique, it revolves around the 2 psychologist siblings with a father which is the exact opposite of their personality. Frankly speaking, this series is way better than Game Of Thrones.",1398038400,,289,4.576923076923077

1460980,5,B00005JLJE,"These episodes of Frasier are comedic, easy to watch, and entertaining as sitcoms go. Every character plays a unique part. The prim and proper ettique of Frasier and his brother , Niles is what makes these so funny. Never gets old...",1396828800,,233,4.7073170731707314
1460981,5,B00005JLJE,The first time around I always enjoyed Frasier.  The writing is more sophisticated and the characters are well defined.  There is a bit of all of us in Frasier's characters and we are laughing at ourselves.  Even though the series aired years ago the topics are still relevant and amusing.,1396828800,,289,4.74
1460982,5,B00005JLJE,"Fabulous old TV show. Kelsey Grammer portrays the character perfectly. I don't much care for the acting style of his ""brother"" on the show. When it looks like ""acting"", it's pretentious. The individual who plays ""Niles"" really stinks. The people who play Daphne and Martin are priceless. If you need some laughs for the day, this is a great choice. Just close your ears when ""Niles"" speaks, lol",1396742400,,394,4.8088235294117645

1461082,5,B00005JLJE,"We love the writing, the humor is indicative of another level of society, but the character of Frazier presents a quandry. He is a fop! His ego goes beyond the insufferable. He is vain, pompous, and interfers with the lives of those around him to the point of destroying any confidence they may have in themselves. When he has completely fouled up their lives, he thinks that saying, ""I am sorry... I said I was sorry,"" does nothing to rectify the chaos he has caused. Sorry, coming from him, just doesn't get it! And his constant belief that any woman he chooses will jump into bed with him creates an aura of one incapable of true love. Niles is our hero!",1396137600,,657,4.43801652892562
1461083,5,B00005JLJE,"The only bad thing is there is no ""play all"" command.  At the end of each episode, the DVD goes back to the main menu and you need to press play to advance to the next episode.  Other than that, season one is hilarious.",1396137600,,219,3.9545454545454546

1461087,4,B00005JLJE,This was never one of my shows when it aired. Sometimes I'd catch an episode if I watched with some else but I sat down and really got into it and I like the comdey and the characters. My favorite character is Eddie the dog and Niles both hit the mark in the dry humor catagory. Frasier stays frusterated and is always trying to slove problems of others around him often finding the problems lie within himself. The writers are very clever at making him relize this fact.,1395532800,,471,4.363636363636363
1461088,5,B00005JLJE,"Charming, sweet, witty and so unlike all modern American sitcoms that heavily rely on silly and immature sex jokes to appeal to the audience. Frasier has class. Its one liners are never offensive and its set-up is always one smooth flow. Such an American classic.

Personally I have to thank Frasier, I learn all my fast and sharp remarks from thee.",1395446400,,349,4.721311475409836

1461150,5,B00005JLJE,"It seems like I missed so many of the Frasier episodes when they first aired on TV because I worked those evenings.  So it was with great glee that I ordered the first two seasons.

These actors are pros.  Their timing is great.  Even Eddie the Dog steals scenes, leaving Frasier, the hapless co-resident of Eddie, looking silly in his bi-ped predicaments.  I enjoy all these episodes, and will continue to order the next seasons.

Thanks!",1394841600,,439,4.7105263157894735

1461684,5,B00005JLJE,Pretentious...really? Is TV not a reflection of life and art. If you agree then all people in all situations have comedic merit. That is what a master sitcom writer will tell you. So why shouldn't the high society be represented. That being said. Few shows delicately weave the lifestyle we may wish to have with entertainment that we need to forget the life we actually live. For me; Frasier represents a little place where comedy and foolish Fawlty Towers inspired farce hood  abounds. Please don't over look the immense talent of the supporting cast as well. Gil Chesterton will forever be in my memories! A must purchase. Get it on HD. Get it on DVD! Get it on Bluray!,1388966400,,672,4.647058823529412

1461773,5,B00005JLJE,"Frasier is consistently well  written and well performed. Everyone knows their parts and they live their parts. Meaning they own it. In the whole series there are less than five episodes that I find a bit below their standards but the rest are top notch and hard to match. Anyone who loved his character on cheers will love watching the evolution of the character on this series. 11 seasons hardly seem enough. This is my second time buying this set, as the new sets have a single dvd case (hard case) and it fits on my shelf better and is well protected. It's definitely a series worth keeping and sharing.",1387152000,,607,4.5181818181818185

There are not many shows that we both enjoy but I am nearing retirement and my daughter who just graduated college is also a fan.  Every episode is not necessarily a classic but there are episodes that are hilarious, heartbreakingly romantic, struggle with real moral issues, and can give us a different perspective on life. A few of the episodes have a long set up then rapid-fire gags as all of the pieces come together.  Those stand up to repeat watching simply because they are so well crafted. Frasier is some of the best TV ever produced and for my money is always entertaining.",1386806400,,669,4.558333333333334

1461874,5,B00005JLJE,"I am and always have been a gigantic fan of the show Frasier and re-watching the first season just further cements my fandom. This is truly one of the funniest and wittiest shows that's been on tv over the past 20 years; although they occasionally revert to groan-inducing slapstick humor, the rest is typically high-brow and incredibly intelligent (a lot of allusions and references to philosophers, scientists, composers, artists, authors, etc.). And what really does it for me is the show's heart found in so many different places and characters. All of the growing moments Frasier and his father share are really moving, and better yet-understandable, believable, and seem to be a true part of the developing story line and not just a plot device.

HIGHLY recommend if you've never seen it; the 22-minute short episodes will always leave you wanting to watch the next one!",1386201600,,876,5.0

1462024,5,B00005JLJE,"Frasier is a great show. not just for 'Cheers' fans. as a spin-off, i have to say this is one of the most successful spin-offs in tv history. Kelsey Grammer dives deeper into his 'Cheers' character, the psychologist Dr. Frasier Crane, as viewers see whats going on after he leaves Boston, for his hometown of Seattle to start a new life. there is great use of language through out the show. the subtle things is what makes this show really entertaining, as well. the acting is really good. well, the English accent one character has seems a little forced at first throughout season 1, but i feel once she gets comfortable with it and her character, it might be believable, (mind you, im in the middle of nowhere usa, so its not like i hear a real English accent everyday.) and for you 'Cheers' fans, there's episodes where Sam, Woody, and Diane come and visit. and of course Lilith and Frederick are returning characters. BUT... in 'Cheers', Frasier explained his childhood, which doesn't keep in line with what this show explains. but, its worth the watch whether you're a 'Cheers' fan, or someone looking to watch something else.",1380844800,,1131,4.717171717171717

I love the dynamic between Niles and Daphne during the first several seasons of the show - the bumbling flirting Niles does around Daphne is hilarious.  These characters are people that you feel you could and would like to be friends with.  This show was one of my absolute favorites all 11 seasons that it aired and I still oftentimes watch the reruns when they are on.  The show is still funny no matter how many times you've seen them and to me that is one of the trademarks of a really good sitcom.,1380844800,,616,4.424778761061947

Frasier himself was a bit different in the first year from the later seasons.  He had more hair for one thing.
And he did not get involved with women right away, at least not in the first few episodes.
Writing was witty, funny, excellent.

It's a fun show, but the episodes in the first season can be hit or miss.  Occasionally the lines are a bit out of character, like when Niles says that their mother was lucky because she died before she had to put up with their father's eccentricities. It's a good show to watch when you've had a long day.

Having not watched Frasier until sometime into its long run, it always has been hit-and-miss on being able to fill in the missing episodes. Also, the very first episode methodically introduced viewers to all the players. This finally allowed my wife and I see how it all began. This series is fabulous and seems to be even funnier the second time around.

Niles is one of the funniest caricatures / parodies of sophistication and snobbery on TV. Hilarious dry humor. Every episode I laugh out loud at some line that surprises me, or goes to the core of human idiosyncrasy. The combo of the elite Niles and Frasier and their middle-America dad who can't figure out how he got sons that love opera not baseball and sherry not beer makes this show.

This show could only be rated good, better, and best...and only a few were just good...Most were excellent.
All of the actors (male & female) are extremely talented (even the dog).
:-)
While I don't think there will never be another character like Frasier. He really was, ""lovingly pompus"". (Roz said that to Frasier).

1463463,5,B00005JLJE,"If you are looking at reviews here, you've already seen that there are currently over one hundred reviews for Season One of ""Frasier,"" and you doubtless noticed that the overall summative rating for the show is nearly a perfect five stars. That's pretty rare, but it demonstrates what most people say about this show, and it's what I, too, have discovered myself as I've been reintroduced to the Frasier on these disks.

I can't add much ""substantive"" content than what others have already written, but I'll just pitch in a few of my own comments, for whatever they may be worth. ""Frasier"" is simply hilarious, so hilarious (a word frequently overused, but I assure you, correctly used in this case) that you will find yourself having to stop the disk because you're doubled over with laughter. It's an example of that rare combination of a unique set of actors, superb script writing, and a great story concept. I've seen a lot of shows in my life, and I was completely convinced that no one would ever ""top"" ""The Dick van Dyke Show"" because it set the bar so high), but I would have to say that this one is right up there with some of the very best ever made. As I write this, I'm thinking of some of the lines from Season One that simply had my CRYING with laughter, and I so wish I could share them here, but that would just spoil the experience of watching them yourself. Also, the humour does not come across in writing as powerfully as the production itself provides it.

Frasier is a psychologist in Seattle who has a call-in talk show for helping listeners with problems. His brother, also a psychologist, but with a more traditional practice, also lives in the city. Their father, a retired policeman, lives with Frasier in his somewhat upper-middle class (""The Elliot Bay Towers, on the Counterbalance"") high rise apartment. They have a live-in physical therapist, Daphne Moon, who is there to help Frasier's dad with his hip problem (who was injured by a gunshot wound while on duty and retired as a result). Frazier has a producer, Roz, a young woman who is always trying to find ""Mr. Right,"" but doesn't seem to be very successful in doing so.

Sound boring? Trivial? Of no interest? Unoriginal? Yes, that little description above might sound that way, but I can assure you, once you waded into the very first episode (one of those rare exceptions where the pilot is actually as good as the rest of the show: this thing starts right on Episode One), you'll see the reason why over 100 people rate Frazier with essentially a perfect five-star score. The fun starts on the first episode and doesn't let up from that point.

Frasier is one of those shows that requires you to think a little as you watch in order to catch all the jokes (it's a tad like ""The Simpsons"" in that aspect, although the two shows bear no similarity). And you have to listen ""quick"": the witty interjections that make up so much of the comedy can come at a blisteringly fast rate. Sometimes the interjections will catch you completely off guard, and it is some of these lines that will just knock you over with laughter.

""Frasier"" is a show that indeed requires you to think, but it pays off in spades. The show does not ""reach down"" to a low common denominator, as we see in so many comedies. If you like witty dialog, strange situations, and enjoy seeing how humanity intersects with humor, this is the show for you. The show assumes an educated audience, and that is that.

An easy five stars, but you already know that.

ADDENDUM:
After re-watching all 11 seasons of this show with my wife numerous times, I can still say it. This show is hysterically funny. When you are new to it, you get ""caught"" by the verbal gags and you'll have to stop the disk or you'll miss then next three jokes. Witticisms abound. Obscure references are not uncommon. And the fact that they could hold this up for 11 years is remarkable. It is said that the only reason that it did not keep going is because of the cost involved due to the very, very high salaries of the cast, and Kelsey Grammer may or may not have been the longest playing single character in TV history (spanning three shows), but none of that matters. We may be sad that we missed out on what unquestionably would have been another hilarious Season, but I guess we'll have to be content with 263 episodes. And do you know what is even more miraculous? As incredibly good as this show is--and it truly is--the show does not even showcase Grammer's greatest acting achievement. That achievement doubtless lays in ""Boss,"" a two-season show on Starz that anyone who grew up in Chicago will cleave to, and everyone else will be mesmerized by the performances (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boss-Season-One/dp/B005S97ULU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boss - Season One</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boss-Season-2-DVD/dp/B00B2TU1R0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boss - Season 2 [DVD</a>]).",1353369600,6,5015,4.858479532163742

1463467,5,B00005JLJE,"This is a continuation of Frasier Crane from Cheers, and it's by far the most perfect television show.  Frasier hits the bullseye on all elements of the show.

The casting is perfect. Frasier and his brother, Niles, are the perfect snobby people that you can't help but to like. Grammar and Pierce are cast perfectly.  They're always snobbish, but always trying to fit in ""with the common"" man, and never can. The father, Marty, is outstanding. He's the typical guy next door that you just want to have a beer with and watch sports. Roz and Daphnie are a nice addition to the cast. All of the cast members jell and play off each other in a wonderful way.  I love the character of Bull Dog.

The writing is outstanding!  This is hard to come by on a television show, and the writers nail it.  The dialogue is witty and funny and the joke keep coming at you. What makes this so funny is that the jokes are low key and not 'in your face just one funny.""  It's very rare when I laugh out loud during a TV show, but Frasier does it every episode.

1463558,5,B00005JLJE,"I don't watch much television.  I also tend to be a latecomer to a television series.  I watched ""Frasier"" from time to time when it originally aired, but it wasn't until this past year that I really started to take a serious interest in the show.  I have always enjoyed humor based on a psychological premise.  I particularly like neurotic characters.  For those reasons, shows like ""The Bob Newhart Show,"" ""Monk,"" and ""Frasier"" hold a special appeal for me.  I thought I would start buying seasons of ""Frasier,"" and I'm glad I did.  What a great show!

I really admire Kelsey Grammer's comedic skills.  His timing, his delivery of lines, his sensitivity, and even his diction, are truly exceptional.  He brings the character of Frasier to life.  I can't picture anyone else playing that part.

The actors are right in character from the first show.  I think Martin Crane is a bit too gruff in the first couple of episodes.  On the other hand, it was probably necessary to establish the underlying tension between Frasier and his father.  Martin softens a bit after the first few episodes.  I think the writers and John Mahoney found just the right amount of tension to present to the audience each week.

The episode ""Author, Author"" is a real gem.  Niles and Frasier decide to write a book together.  Their insecurities manifest themselves---the ones that go all the way back to Niles's crib.  Another gem is entitled, ""Frasier Crane's Day Off, ""which is about Frasier being too sick to go to work.  Of course, he comes to work with a fever, and, well, you can guess how he acts on air.  Finally, I enjoyed the season finale entitled, ""My Coffee with Niles.""  It is an episode that finds Frasier trying to decide if he is happy or not.  Many emotional twists and turns occur in that episode, but in the end he has an answer to that question.

There are good interviews with the cast members included in season one.  Also, there is an interesting segment dealing with the set of Frasier's apartment.

I have the first eight seasons of the series.  Each season has brought me much laughter.  Take this endorsement of the first season as an endorsement of the first eight years of the show.",1332460800,5,2190,4.64490861618799

By now, nearly everyone knows that ""Frasier"" is a spin-off of ""Cheers,"" the hit NBC comedy that ran from 1982-93.  Centering on Kelsey Grammer's Dr. Frasier Crane, ""Frasier"" combines witty, humorous storylines with insightful, dramatic family themes.

The sheer overall depth of the show continues to impress me.  After moving from Boston back to his hometown of Seattle, Frasier reconnects with his brother Niles, played brilliantly by David Hyde Pierce, and deals with taking in his father Martin, also well-played by John Mahoney.  The series' pilot episode ""The Good Son,"" sets up the inevitable culture clash primarily between the sophisticated Frasier and the down-to-earth Martin.  The pilot also introduces Roz Doyle, Frasier's producer on his radio show, and Daphne Moon, Martin's endearingly offbeat British live-in therapist.  The women are played with aplomb by Peri Gilpin and Jane Leeves, respectively.

Episode highlights for the first season are ""The Good Son""(an excellent pilot), ""Dinner at Eight,""  ""Call Me Irresponsible,"" ""Beloved Infidel,"" ""A Midwinter Night's Dream,""  ""The Show Where Lilith Comes Back,"" ""Author, Author,"" ""Frasier Crane's Day Off,"" and the season finale ""My Coffee With Niles.""  ""Frasier"" is an astounding spin-off series because it is not beholden to its parent series.  It is very much its own show, with light comfortable references to ""Cheers"" thrown in for story texturing.  Co-created by David Angell, Peter Casey, and David Lee, ""Frasier"" immediately announces its brilliance with a sterling first season.",1310169600,2,1570,5.5738396624472575

I want to see mannerisms, facial expressions, body language, costuming, sets, voice, and talented writers that all make for above average entertainment.  I don't necessarily aspire to be like anybody in this show, nor do I honestly believe I would fit in, should people as depicted in this TV show let me visit with them.  But from where I sit in my own home observing the Frasier fellowship of fools, I can't help but admire the series.

1463660,4,B00005JLJE,"It's hard not to like Frasier, and I've come to appreciate the show more now that it's gone off the air (except in syndication). I was fortunate to receive the first season as a gift this Christmas and really enjoy it.

For the uninitiated, Frasier is a spinoff of Cheers that follows Dr. Fasier Crane, a divorced psychiatrist who has moved back home to Seattle to start his life over as a radio psychiatrist. Unfortunately for him (and fortunately for the audience) his plans for a new life are thwarted when his father, Martin, a retired cop with a crippling injury sustained in the line of duty (played to crusty perfection by John Mahoney) moves in with him and hires a wacky live-in care-worker, Daphne (Jane Leeves). To complete the ensemble is Frasier's no-nonsense radio producer, Roz (Peri Gilpin) and his fussy psychiatrist brother, Niles (David Hyde Pierce). As Frasier tries to negotiate the dating scene, get used to his new roommates and rebuild his relationship with his brother and father, wackiness inevitably ensues.

This set includes all of the episodes from Season One, and it isn't hard to see why this series lasted 10 years - from the beginning, all of the elements that made Frasier a success are there: the perfect cast, snappy writing, and impeccable comic timing on the part of the actors. Though some of the facets of these early episodes ring hollow (for instance, Daphne begins the series as a pseudo-Bohemian clairvoyant, schtick which is dropped by mid-season, and Niles starts out as a passive-aggressive yuppie-type) these are modified by the end of the season. Frasier was always able to mix a high-culture smirk with a low-culture guffaw, and that mix is ever-present.

My only beef with this DVD set is that there are hardly any special features - the only ones are the listings which tell you which celebrity voices play the callers to Frasier's radio show, and one or two commentaries. However, these are easily overlooked, as the show itself is plenty entertaining - don't miss the hilarious ""Frasier's Day Off,"" for instance, in which Frasier, sick with the flu, is forced to turn his show over to Niles and...well, you've just gotta see it.

1463661,3,B00005JLJE,"(08/15/09) Obviously Frasier is a great show; I don't think anyone would order the DVDs if it hadn't been.  My complaint is the way the shows are formatted on the DVDs:  You can only watch one episode at a time; you have to push play again at the end of the episode, when you are automatically redirected to the menu.  I HATE this.  I have another TV show on DVD (Friends) and loved that I could put in the DVD, push play at the main menu, and watch episode after episode after episode (though there is the Episodes option if you like to only watch one episode at a time and then be redirected to the main menu after each episode).  I like to be able to do this so I can set the sleep timer on my TV and am lulled off to sleep by my favorite, commercial free, TV shows.  Not so with Frasier.  If I'm not out at the end of 30 minutes, I have to turn the TV back on and start all over... a process that usually wakes me up fully again.  For me, that sucks.  I won't buy another season of Frasier because of this.

UPDATE (10/13/09):  OK, I lied... but I didn't mean to... it's just that by the end of Season 1, which I began watching over breakfast, I was hooked.  So, I bought a few more seasons.  I think it's Season 3 or 4, I can't remember which, but a few seasons in and they added the Play All feature.  Yay!  I know this is a ridiculous reason (to some) to not give Season 1 five stars, but certainly I'm not the only person out there who sometimes needs to set the sleep timer or just wants to sit down, push play, and not pick up the remote every 20 - 30 minutes and hit play again.)  So, let me just say that the Season 1 show gets 5 stars and the DVD format for Season 1 only got 1 or 2 stars, thus my 3 star 'average' for Season 1.)",1250294400,10,1742,3.934285714285714

1463765,5,B00005JLJE,"""Frasier"" belongs on the short list of TV comedies  that were blessed from the very beginning. The show is blessed with perfect writing and the perfect ensemble cast. ""Frasier"" is perfect in every department.  Compare ""Frasier"" with any of the ""comedies"" on today and you'll quickly realize what a vast wasteland TV has become. On ""Frasier"", the humor comes from the characters and their relationships, but never at the expense of them. The situations are often riotous; the humor is sharp and witty, but never cheap. Creators Peter Casey and David Lee were, in fact, so successful the viewer is likely to forget that Frasier started as a supporting character on a little sitcom I never liked very much called ""Cheers."" Frasier (Kelsey Grammer) has left the Boston bar and returned home to Seattle, WA. to begin a new job as a radio show host, and bolster relationships with his prickly father Martin (John Mahoney) and competitive brother Niles (David Hyde Pierce).
  Martin, a cop who retired after he was shot in the hip, moves in with Frasier. And along with Martin comes his little dog Eddie, too, (the canine scene-stealer is played by a dog named ""Moose"") a beat-up recliner chair held together with duct tape, and Daphne Moon (Jane Leeves), a live-in physical therapist. Daphne is a good-hearted, working class British girl, who also happens to be ""a bit psychic."" The series is smartly divided between Frasier's life at home and at work.  When Frasier becomes too pompous, his bubble is regularly burst; at home by Martin, Niles, and Daphne, and at work by his sassy radio show producer Roz Doyle, played by Peri Gilpin. Roz can more than hold her own with Frasier. At the radio station, we meet several other interesting characters, including Dan Butler as sports commentator Bob (""Bulldog"") Briscoe.
  Kelsey Grammer and David Hyde Pierce were simply born to work together. When we watch them together, we are watching two comedy masters at the top of their game. The sibling rivalry between Frasier and Niles reaches absurdly hilarious heights in the episode ""Author, Author."" David Hyde Pierce and Jane Leeves have incredible chemistry, too. Niles, married to the unseen, mysterious Maris, meets Daphne in the episode ""Dinner At Eight"", and is immediately smitten/obsessed  with her. The Niles/Daphne attraction, a major plot in the entire series, is spotlighted in the first season episode ""A Midwinter Night's Dream.""
  Frasier's ex-wife Lilith (Bebe Neuwirth) returns in a funny and poignant episode appropriately titled ""The Show Where Lilith Comes Back."" Lilith tells Martin, ""Knowing your history with Frasier as I do; when I heard you had moved in with him, I immediately flipped to the Weather Channel to see if hell had, indeed, frozen over.""
Other outstanding episodes in this perfect first season are: ""I Hate Frasier Crane,"" ""Selling Out,"" ""Oops"", ""Miracle On Third Or Fourth Street,"" ""Can't Buy Me Love,"" ""Give Him The Chair,"" ""Travels With Martin,"" ""Frasier Crane's Day Off,"" and ""My Coffee With Niles."" Beginning with this first season in 1993, ""Frasier"" won the Emmy Award for ""Outstanding Comedy Series"" an unprecedented five years in a row! All well deserved, I'm sure.

The depth of the characters, though more enjoyable in later seasons, begins with season 1.  Learning how it all began creates more enjoyment in the later Emmy winning seasons.  I do not particularly care for Martin in the early episodes, as he portrays himself as hard nosed and unloving.  But, seeing him in this season helps you to appreciate his evolution throughout the series.  This is one of the best sitcoms of all time and made NBC a powerhouse in the 90's.

Each charatctor was special and the relationships and interactions between each set of characters was unique, Fraiser with Niles, Fraiser and Niles with their father and of course everyone trying to deal with the Crane brothers - the down to earth normalcy of their Dad, Roz and Daphne worked in great juxtaposition to the more high brow Niles and Fraiser.

Its blend of intelligence, humour, drama, love and life all mix together to create one awesome show! It is hilarious and in a very intelligent way; all the episodes are ingenious and well-crafted and all the characters are very interesting and are each essential to the show. Frasier, as the lead character, leads a life of interesting, hilarity, drama, and at times adventuruous oddity. Niles is the equally hilarious and brilliant brother who is absolutely in love with Daphne. Martin's the hard-nosed, retired father figure who, deep down, cares about his sons. Daphne's the British caretaker who always has a great quip to add. Roz is about as desparate as they come in terms of her love life, but she brightens the atmosphere with some very funny moments. And, Bulldog adds his hardcore self-pompous attitude that can be quite a scream! Plus, there's always something hysterical their dog Eddie does in every episode that just makes me belt out his name in laughter, ""Eddieeeeeee!"". Hahaha, a little tradition of mine while I watch Frasier.

1463847,5,B00005JLJE,"For me, FRASIER marked a very happy point in television (post Cosby Show), when we had something to look forward to in sitcom world.  In fact, I think that the series challenged the common belief that spin-off series are oftentimes overrated and not half as good as the original series from which they spawned.  FRASIER was actually better than CHEERS.  I was never really into the whole concept of a bunch of people, sitting around in a bar, chewing the fat about their lives.  Yet, one character, the neurotic, pompous and pretentious psychiatrist, Dr. Frasier Crane, was born on that show, and migrated to his old stomping grounds of Seattle.  Thus, inspiring this wonderful show!

We are reintroduced to Dr. Frasier Crane, here.  This time, he has found himself a job as a talk show host, serving out ""McSessions"" (in the words of his haughty brother, psychiatrist Dr. Niles Crane, played by the brilliant David Hyde Pierce) on KACL FM, with firecracker show producer Roz Doyle (Peri Gilpin).  Together, they play off of each other with a combination of perpetually annoyed and genuinely engaged banter.

What's more, Frasier doesn't know what he's got himself into.  He envisioned moving back to him hometown of Seattle, to start life anew, in the aftermath of a nasty divorce from Dr. Lillith Stern (Bebe Neuwirth), his uber-uptight ex-wife, who makes Casper the Friendly Ghost look like George Hamilton, the perpetually tan soap opera star.  (Numerous jokes are based on Lillith's white complexion and slightly subhuman behavior, to be diplomatic.)  Frasier Crane's hope is that the move will help him reignite his social life as a ""born again bachelor.""  Unfortunately, fate has other plans in store.  His elderly father, retired cop Martin Crane (David Mahoney) suffers a bad fall, and, due to a bullet in his hip, cannot continue living alone.  Martin moves in with his best friend, Eddie the Dog (Moose), and...shall we say...hell breaks loose for Frasier, and all of his aspirations of living fast and free are shot.  Enter Daphne Moon (Jane Leeves), a [slightly] eccentric, but very charming young healthcare provider from Manchester, England.  Low and behold, Frasier has yet another flat mate, and unwelcome addition to his bachelor pad/condo.

These early episodes are, in my opinion, the strongest of the series.  For starters, Kelsey Grammer obviously bases his comic influences on the late, great Jack Benny (minus violin).  His pregnant pauses are hysterical.  What's more, the banter between Kelsey Grammer and David Hyde-Pierce are priceless, and many of the episodes are reminiscent of another time and place, when comedy was really, honest to goodness, funny!

1463848,5,B00005JLJE,"I had heard about his show for seasons, and from outer appearances, scratched my head at its appeal, since, at first glance, it seems rather dull.  However, I happened upon an episode rerun one night, and I found this to be one of the wittiest, cleverest, original and gut-busting shows I had every seen.  And I continued to watch, sometimes Monday through Friday, and was rarely to never disappointed.  So, when the DVD came out, I plunked down 50 bucks (gasp!) to purchase the Season One DVDs.  I was introduced to new episodes I'd never seen, as well as reminded of gems that I'd seen before, and became familiar with backstory that I'd missed from watching the shows jumbled.

This show is obviously funny.  But what sets it apart is its daring in assuming that the audience is literate and engaged.  For example, in one episode Frasier runs off to save Niles' marriage when Niles and Daphne are stranded in his house during a storm.  When Martin protests that Niles would never cheat, Frasier says (paraphrased) ""A desperate woman, an unstable man, in a Gothic mansion on a rainy night...the only thing missing is someone yelling 'Heathcliff' over the moor.""  I roared.  And humor like that is so refreshing and sparse in sitcoms, not to mention television in general.

Yet, the show is also great in that it doesn't take itself so seriously. You would imagine that a show about two effete, snobby, long-winded psychiatrists would be sterile and stiff.  Far from it, the show is filled with sight gags, slapstick, and other ""lowbrow"" humor.  Also, the two are very flawed, creating some very humorous binds.  Also, their foils, are their father, the down-to-earth father, and Daphne, their salt-of-the-earth nurse and housekeeper.

It manages to balance the tone, and even sometimes really say something transcendent.  The season finale, My Coffee with Niles, despite its humor, still manages to be a reflexive and just a touch melancholy.  And the episode ""Author, Author,"" where Niles enlists Frasier to help him right his book, capably (though uproariously) delves into the complexity of adult sibling relationships, including the jealously, unresolved childhood issues and a sometimes ugly spirit of competition.

'Selling Out' introduces the sublimely unscrupulous and manipulative Bebe Glazer, Frasier's agent, one of my favourite characters (I wish she'd appeared more often).  'A Midwinter Night's Dream' is the episode where Niles and the dimwitted Daphne (can you believe it took her SEVEN years to notice that Niles was in love with her?), end up spending the night together in Niles's palatial mansion, his unseen wife Maris being away.  In 'Give Him the Chair', Frasier busy Martin a new chair (naturally he hates it) and his old one is thrown away, and Frasier has to go in search of it.  In 'Travels with Martin' Martin and Frasier are going on holiday in a Winnebago and Frasier desperately tries to persuade Niles to come with them.  ""Frasier, you're my brother"" Niles replies ""that entitles you to my bone marrow and one of my kidneys, but THIS is an imposition""  Naturally he changes his mind when he learns that daffy Daphne is also going.  In 'Author, author!"" Frasier and Niles are locked in sibling rivaly while trying to write a book about siblings.  And in probably my all-time favourite episode ""Frasier's Day Off"", Frasier is off work sick, and consumed with jealous paranoia when Niles takes over as presenter and is a great success.

This is one of the few shows that can make me laugh out loud even when I'm watching it by myself. For a spin-off to last eight years is testimony to the premire writing team and the chemistry of the cast. I love this show - LOVE IT! Every single cast member was given the chance to shine, not just Kelsey Grammer/Frasier. Sure, it was HIS show, but Niles came a close second to screen time. And Daphne, Martin, Roz, and even Eddie had their moments and it was glorious!! There has never been a more accurate depiction of pompous, arrogant, effeminate, peacocks than Frasier and Niles, and Kelsey Grammer and David Hyde Pierce should forever be proud of that accomplishment! This cast worked so well together, that they could convey a heck of a lot of dialouge with a smoldering look or arched brow, that words weren't neccessary to get what was on their mind across to the audience. But oh boy, when the cast had the dialouge to work with, it was spot on! In season one, Lillith to Eddie: ""Go away."" and he leaves immediately. Frasier: ""Now why doesn't he listen to me when I tell him to go?"" Lillith: ""Tone of voice. He knows I mean business."" Frasier: ""Are you saying you have a more commanding tone than I do?"" Martin aside to Niles: ""Hell, I took half a step back before I realized she was talking to the dog."" Oh my. The snappy writing, excellent direction, and superb acting has made this show a prime example of classic comedic tv. Two thumbs up from this fan!",1151280000,2,1583,4.406143344709897
1463946,5,B00005JLJE,"Frasier was on American Forces Network in South Korea throughout the 90s, and I remember seeing it from time to time. However, since my English wasn't that good then, I didn't pay any particular attention, and didn't get much in any way out of this brilliant sit-com either. So, all I remembered before I bought the DVD set was oddly funny images of Niles, his way of talking and his facial expressions, and written messages that divide the segments of each episode, as if in silent movies.

It didn't take me long to realize that I was watching one of the best (or, for now, *the best*)sit-coms. What is so amazing, and what is consistently called the ""intelligent"" aspect of the show, is that Frasier never makes a mockery out of life, which so many sit-coms do (one painful example, to me, is Will & Grace, a show with gay-embracing theme on the surface, but so openly and persistently gay-humiliating). Instead, it takes its humor from unavoidable, and often too painful, human condition: status anxiety, relationship (parent-child, spousal, romantic, workplace), mortality, failure, etc. Other sit-coms may do so too, but what makes Frasier special is its mature, intelligent approach to these important aspects of life, which rarely fails to deliver a certain *lesson* to its viewers, along with laughs.

Examples abound. To take one from the third episode (""Dinner at Eight"") of the first season: Martin, Frasier, and Niles have dinner at Timber Mill, Martin's favorite steak house, but a house of horror to these snobbish brothers. Frasier and Niles do not stop complaining and taking a jab at people who eat at such a place. (There's a lovely joke here, too, where to Martin who says ""Sometimes there's nothing like a good steak,"" Frasier responds: ""I wish this is one of those times."") Angry Martin leaves the place, after telling his sons that, while their sophisticated tastes may come from their mother, they did not take after one quality from her: ""She may have had fancy tastes, but she had too much class to ever make me or anybody else feel second-rate.""

This was the first moment, which is to be followed by many, that I knew the scripts of Frasier would indeed be the very best I can expect from TV. Martin's words so admirably, and in a nutshell, sums up what is wrong with so many middle to upper-middle class, overly educated, people who take pride in their impossibly refined tastes in everything. I've been watching Frasier for over a year, and with moments like these, I often thought that I may even someday write a piece called How Frasier Can Help Make Sense of Your Life. First season is only the beggining, all the successive seasons are equally brilliant.",1147392000,3,2688,4.801295896328294

1464053,5,B00005JLJE,"Along with Friends and Seinfeld, Kelsey Grammer's Cheers spin-off, Frasier, dominated the prime time television landscape during the 1990's. Grammer plays the role of Dr. Frasier Crane who, fresh off of his divorce from Lilith, moves back to his hometown of Seattle where he lands a gig as a radio psychiatrist. Frasier's father, Marty Crane (John Mahoney), a Seattle cop recently shot in an attempted convenience store robbery is in need of physical therapy. Frasier and his brother Niles (David Hyde Pierce) make an effort to mend their relationship with Marty whose plaid shirts and penchant for sports and beer strikes a dramatic contrast with their wine club, opera house culture. After a little prodding, Marty and his dog Eddie (Moose) move into Frasier's upscale apartment, and Frasier hires Daphne Moon (Jane Leeves), a housekeeper and physical therapist to look after the two cranes.

The entirety of the show takes place in mostly three places - Frasier's radio station where he works with show producer Roz Doyle (Peri Gilpin), Frasier's apartment, and the favorite hangout of Niles and Frasier, Caf Nervosa. A witty comedic exploration of the nation's clash of cultures (also illustrated by Frasier's run-ins with sports guy Bob ""Bulldog"" Briscoe), Frasier stands alone as one of the best-written shows in television history. Not a single episode can be considered a dud.

1464055,5,B00005JLJE,"Even with unlimited space, I don't think enough praise can be said about one of the finest sitcoms in television history.

I had been a fan of ""Frasier"" since the first episode aired back in 1993.  But my tape collections had focussed mainly on the second through sixth seasons which I had at the time considered the show's peak. And I had this inherent notion that most of the 1st season episodes delt with Frasier's relationship with his father to the detriment of the rest of the cast. But that idea was quickly quashed once I viewed all the episodes of this wonderful season.

The pilot episode, ""The Good Son"" benefits from having an enthusiastic audience and very sharp writing. The bickering between Frasier and Marty does dominate the first few shows, but that quickly fades and we get some classic episodes involving Bulldog (""Ooops""), Marty and his love life (the hilarious ""Guess Who's Coming to Breakfast?"") and the introduction of Frasier's agent Bebe (""Selling Out""). That particular episode has, in my honest opinion, the best radio comment by Frasier ever done in the show's history (it happens at the beginning of the episode and it's about a boat).

The best episodes are on disc 3, highlighted by Niles 'n Daphne's first encounter, if you will (the riotous ""A Midwinter Night's Dream"").  That episode has one of the funniest lines in the series history (I won't give it away, but it does have to do with the German name for a particular clock). And ""The Show Where Lilith Comes Back"", which rekindles the sparks Frasier 'n Lilith had on ""Cheers"".

Extras:
The commentary for ""The Good Son"" is okay, but nothing really inciteful.  The documentary about the first season is rather perfunctory with short interviews of the cast (the interviews appear to have happened during the tenth or eleventh season).
The art director for Frasier gives us a walkthrough of the set, but it is needlessly chopped up into different clips that send you back to the menu screen way too often.

All in all, if you're a fan of Frasier you must, Must, MUST begin your collection with this wonderful DVD set.  And while the 1st season may not be the best, it is probably much better than you might remember.

Trivia Bits:
- Originally, Lilith (Bebe Neuworth) was intended to be a regular on the show, but backed out early in the production process.  It's funny, but I remember thinking waaaay back in '93 before the first show aired that ""Frasier"" wouldn't be that interesting without Lilith. Boy was I wrong.

- The ""documentary"" feature neglects (probably due to editing considerations) that Lisa Kudrow actually won the part of Roz and she lasted a week before both she and the producers realized just how wrong for the part she was.

- Interestingly enough, Niles doesn't meet Daphne until the THIRD episode (""Dinner at Eight"") but he is smitten with her right from the start.

- Look for a young Brittany Murphy in the episode ""Give Him the Chair"". She appears in the ""play"" setting and is the only girl (other than the play director) to speak. She may be a bit tough to recognize since she's lost a pound or two since then, but her eyes are unmistakable.

- Does Niles' pirate shirt in ""A Midwinter Night's Dream"" look familiar? It certainly bears a strong resemblence to Seinfeld's ""Puffy Shirt"" from the same season.  For the record, that particular Seinfeld episode aired on Sept. 23rd, 1993 while ""Midwinter..."" was first viewed on Feb. 10th, 1994.

- All the ""stingers"" that appear during the end credits have no natural sound, only the ""Tossed Salad and Scrambled Eggs"" theme music sung by Kelsey Grammer. However, there are two exceptions during the first season.  In ""Sold Out"" the stinger continues the scene of Frasier holding his breath underwater while Daphne and Marty enjoy the hot tub.  At the end, you can hear Frasier's exhale as he pops his head above the water.  And in ""The Show Where Lilith Comes Back"" you can hear the jet engines of the airliner taking off as Daphne recovers from her ""psychic"" headache.",1108598400,8,4028,4.751793400286944
1464056,5,B00005JLJE,"Frasier is a witty, smart, sophisticated comedy that excels in intelligent dialogue. Much of the humor on Frasier is based on an Americanized version of British situational comedies such as No Sex Please We're British. The first several seasons of Frasier are classic TV comedy, and if you go back and watch the last couple seasons of Cheers you can understand why Kelsey Grammer was chosen to continue his role of Frasier Crane. I remember thinking when Cheers went off the air that I would probably not like any spinoffs that came from it. Other spinoffs such as Rhoda (after Mary Tyler Moore) were just not the same as the original. Wow, was I wrong ! I am eagerly awaiting the release of seasons 4-7 of Frasier on DVD.",1101254400,3,722,4.604651162790698
1464057,5,B00005JLJE,"I started watching the show when it went into syndication 5 - 6 years ago. I was never able to catch it during its regular time slot. The TV stations in my area did not show the syndicated episodes in order and mixed up episodes from different seasons.  So, unlike most Frasier fans, I had no context of episodes with their prospective seasons when I got my hands on the first two sets of Frasier DVDs.  I just assumed that all of the shows I saw on TV were recent and NOT FROM THE FIRST SEASON.  Boy, was I wrong.

This DVD set is absolutely amazing.  Most of the episodes I had seen before, but I had no idea that they came from the first season. Most TV shows are very ""green"" their first season and when compared with subsequent seasons, the ""greenness"" becomes even more apparent.  It's so easy to point out the first shows from the later ones due to weaker writing, character development, and acting. Even weaker set designs and costumes/wardrobe are tell-tale signs of a TV show's first season. However, Frasier hit the ground running and was on mark from the very first show, ""The Good Son"".

This show demonstrated an enormous amount of development within it first 24 episodes.  I agree with another Amazon reviewer who said that the show's success was due to the writers/creators/producers taking only the name ""Dr. Frasier Crane"" and his basic personality from ""Cheers"", but developing a whole new setting and set of characters for ""Frasier"".  To me, this is why the show had such a strong first season. Due to this desire to set itself apart from ""Cheers"", ""Frasier"" developed a strong sense of ""self"" rarely seen in a first season.  However, Frasier never attempted to sever its ties to ""Cheers"".  It just refused to become Cheers, part II.

Although, I love Frasier, I was taken aback when I first laid eyes on his younger brother Niles.  Niles is definitely my favorite character.  This leads me to another reason for the show's excellent first season.  Its star was surrounded by highly talented actors with well-developed characters.  Sure, Frasier, by himself, was a delight to see, but without Niles, Daphne, Roz, Martin, and even Eddie the dog...where would this show had gone?  Even minor characters at Frasier's radio station (KACL) are unforgettable (like Bulldog, Gil, and Noel). These supporting characters were powerful in their own right, but never overpowered Frasier's star billing.

So, this DVD set is definitely worth getting and unlike other TV shows that are now on DVD, you don't have to wait until the second, third or even fourth season DVDs to come out before getting the best shows.  Frasier is worth getting from the very first episode onward.  It's brilliance came through from the beginning and if such a thing were possible, each episode and season that followed improved and built upon the previous.  It's rare for a show to do that and this is why Frasier will be spinning in my DVD player for years to come.",1100908800,4,2953,4.728515625
1464058,4,B00005JLJE,"When Kelsey Grammer and ""Cheers"" parted company no one could have foreseen that the actor's next television venture, ""Frasier"" would be more prolific and satisfying than his stint as the imminent bar room psychiatrist. Taking a tip from other spin offs, which have tried in vane to recapture the essence of their original's glory, the producers of ""Frasier"" assumed the responsibility of concocting an entirely new setting and cast of characters for the series, retaining only the name Dr. Frasier Crane and departing in almost all other aspects from the celebrity status of ""Cheers."" The result: a witty, urbane and ultra sophisticated spin off with far more polish and charm than ""Cheers"", populated by an inspired cast of veritable scatterbrains and screw ups.

In 1994 ""Frasier"" debuted with all its magic in place. We were introduced once more to the neurotic Dr. Crane (Grammer), his even more neurotic and insecure younger brother, Niles (David Hyde Pierce), their father, Martin (John Mahoney) and his physical therapist, Daphne Moon (Jane Leeves). The imminent psychiatrist was now a radio celebrity with a show programmed by the calculating hard knock girl with a heart, Roz (Peri Gilpin), living in eclectic luxury inside a penthouse apartment overlooking Seattle's breathtaking skyline. Then the troubles began. Martin moved in to Frasier's apartment, Daphne began having psychic premonitions and Frasier's ex-wife, Lilith (Bebe Neworth) attempted reconciliation.

Inspired by gifted performances and shoot-from-the-hip writing, the show was an instant smash hit. Paramount's new DVD, Frasier: Season One aptly delivers all 24 episodes of this trend setting comedy in a deluxe four disc box set. Highlights include the riotous pilot episode in which Martin moves in and affectively wreaks havoc on Frasier's comfortable life style with his dilapidated arm chair and monstrously playful dog, Eddie. Also in Season One is the episode in which Niles and Daphne are forced one rainy eve to spend the night together in Niles' gothic mansion while his wife is away, the episode where Frasier contemplates having an affair with a much younger woman, and, the hilarious return of Lilith which leads to a night of distasteful pleasure racked in Freudian guilt.

Paramount DVD has done a nice job on ""Frasier: The Complete First Season."" For the most part colors are accurately presented with a subtle muted palette, good contrast levels. Blacks are deep and solid. Fine detail is nicely realized. Unfortunately some of the episodes suffer from edge enhancement and shimmering of fine details that generally distracts. Certain episodes tend to have a slightly hazy look to them. Several episodes suffer from color imbalance in which tonal quality and brightness seem to shift - not only from scene to scene but shot to shot. Overall, these are minor imperfections that although discernable are nevertheless forgivable. The audio is stereo and very nicely balanced. Extras include a brief but succinct featurette on the creation of the series, a benign ""Frasier's Apart."" sort of game that one has to access by toggling on the remote, short snippets that illustrate all the guest star cameo voice overs used as Dr. Crane's call in guests and audio commentaries on selected episodes. If you're a fan of this television series I highly recommend this box set.",1092873600,5,3358,5.249534450651769

1464147,4,B00005JLJE,"I never liked the show until right around the time when it was taken off of the air. Like I said before, there aren't many spin-off's from other series that end up being successful. A take-off of Frasier Crane from Cheers, this sitcom lasted 11 long seasons that was loaded with Emmy awards. The first season is just as funny as the final season, unlike some of the other shows that are funnier in their more recent seasons, like The Simpsons. Here are a few brief descriptions of the more notable of the 24 episodes included in these four discs.
I Hate Frasier Crane: 8/10: Frasier is irritated with Eddie's habit of constantly staring at him. Niles brings an editorial to Frasier by someone who claims to hate Frasier. They exchange verbal insults, and a fistfight is insinuated. Martin encourages Frasier to fight, instead of backing down, like he did 30 years ago.
Call Me Irresponsible: 10/10: Frasier begins to date someone that he met unethically. He talked to the woman's former boyfriend on his show and told him to break off the relationship. He is torn between ethics and being happy. The crew takes a Christmas picture on October 21.
Death Becomes Him: 10/10: Martin's doctor dies suddenly at the age of 41. He was always a health freak, and this sudden death worries Frasier, because he is the same age. The funny part is when Frasier goes to the funeral and when he hears about how healthy this man was, he questions whether he is really dead.
Oops: 9/10: Rumors fly that someone at the radio station is going to get fired. When Bulldog's name is thrown around as the potential guy getting fired, he quits his job before he is able to get fired. Of course, he wasn't ever going to be fired in the first place.
A Midwinter Night's Dream: 8/10: Niles and Daphne get stuck together alone and Frasier worries about what will happen, because Daphne isn't yet aware of Niles' crush on her.
We hear a lot about Maris, but never see her.",1087516800,6,1943,4.570200573065903

As a bonus, the speacial features incude a little documentary where you learn, among other things, the identity of the ""First Runner Up"" for the part of Roz.

I didn't start watching it until it came on in the daily rerun block on our local cable station.  I can't believe I missed all these great shows and all the laughs!  When I realized it was on DVD I decided not to let the laughs pass me by again.
Frasier-The Complete First Season DVD set is fantastic.  It is full of hours of laughs from the 24 episodes it contains.  The laughs start with the pilot episode The Good Son and don't stop until the last episode My Coffee with Niles.  Each episode is full of great acting and writing.  This cast fits together so perfectly you forget they are acting and the characters they portray aren't actual people.  Kelsey Grammer is wonderful as Dr. Frasier Crane, David Hyde Pierce is excellent as cutely nerdy Dr. Niles Crane.  John Mahoney is right on in the role of the sensible, down-to-earth father Martin Crane.  Jane Leeves is hilarious in the role of kind-of-psychic health care specialist Daphne Moon. And last but not least Peri Gilpen adds the finishing touch to the cast as Roz, the producer of Frasier's radio show.
I must add I even love the non-character character Maris, played by...no one.  This non-role adds such comedy to the show.  It is hilarious to hear of Maris' problems and issues.
Ok..on to my favorite shows on this set.  My favorite is Frasier Crane's day off in which Frasier is sick and must stay at home.  I laugh until I cry everytime I watch this episode.  It must have been so much fun to make!  I have seen this episode several times on TV and now on the DVD and it doesn't loose it's laughs.  My other favorite, seen for the first time on this DVD was Guess Who's Coming to Breakfast.  In this episode Frasier sees his dad in a new light when Martin's lady friend spends the night and show's up in the kitchen at breakfast.  Nothing Frasier says comes out right.  I laughed until I cried watching this hilarious episode.
I love everything about this series and could go on and on.  I can't finish though until I say I love the Niles/Daphne storyline.  It is so sweet the way Niles has a crush on Daphne.  This whole storyline provides a ton of laughs.
This DVD set is a must have for anyone who loves comedy.  If you've never watched Frasier buy this set--you'll love it.  And if you already love Frasier buy this set to have in your collection.

It's great to get whole series in one compact box set to watch over and over again, whenever an evening calls for a dose of Frasier watching.  There aren't many comedies that can withstand repeated viewings and still manage to be funny - but this is one of them.  There also aren't many comedies that can run for so many series and not get stale and boring, or over-the-top stupid - but with Frasier every episode manages to entertain, and every series keeps this standard up.  Of course, everyone has their favourite episodes over the years - I just wish the DVDs were released quicker than just two a year (I'd happily buy a series each month until I'd got the whole set!).

1464152,5,B00005JLJE,"I found myself a while back with a gift certificate in hand and nothing in sight on which to spend it. I chanced upon a copy of Frasier's first season on sale and, since I had always liked it when I had watched it sporadically throughout the years, I went ahead and bought it. I am glad I did. Frasier is an intelligent sitcom alternative for those disillusioned with the crap you so often see on other comedy shows. It has incredibly talented actors, the best writing on TV (this was before Aaron Sorkin came on the scene, anyway), and its blend of family and workplace comedy allowed the show to try out many things, which meant that things never got boring.
The leads and supporting cast are uniformly excellent. Grammer is one of the best comic actors ever and he is always great in his signature role. David Hyde Pierce steals many scenes as Frasier's uptight, snobbish brother Niles. John Mahoney's Martin often plays the straight man to Niles' and Frasier's antics, but he has perhaps the best dry humor of anyone in the cast. Jane Leeves and Peri Gilpin both brighten up the show as Daphne and Roz, respectively. One of the strengths of the show, though, is the strength of the supporting cast. I personally love the character of Bulldog, the grating, cheuvenist sports show host. Gil Chesterton is also featured in one episode of the first season, his character is the hilarious but devious food critic. Frasier's manipulative agent Bebe shows up here, as does Lilith, and both are fabulous. Simply put, the support cast is so strong the cast can feel like an ensemble at times.
The first season's highlights include Frasier and Niles going out to dinner with Martin at a decidedly non-fancy establishment (Dinner at Eight), a touching Christmas episode (Miracle on Third or Fourth Street), a return by Frasier's ex, Dr. Lilith Sternin (The Show Where Lilith Comes Back), and an episode revolving about the titular ""My Coffee With Niles,"" in which Niles admits to his attraction to Daphne. That attraction was the cause of many funny moments in the first few years, when Niles and Maris were still together.
All in all, this show has always been funny and literate and successful; it shows that there is a market for smart TV out there.",1073779200,58,2245,4.7150127226463106

This DVD set is a must-have for any Frasier fan.
Extras:  The commentary behind the pilot was fascinating.  I wish there had been more commentary and/or interviews with the actors, but I hear this is coming with Season 2 (due out in early 2004).  The features with the guest callers (celebrity guest voices) was pretty neat too.  The packaging is really nice and sturdy.
Biggest complaint (and the reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5):  No sub-titles.  The closed-captions are there, but on many TVs it's impossible to bring those up without muting the TV, which somewhat defeats the purpose.  That said, though, the audio is generally very easy to understand and I wished for subtitles only on a handful of occasions.

1464245,5,B00005JLJE,"One of the all time best sitcoms, and probably the best ""spinoff"" ever!  The fist season is an absolute laugh-a-second!  The first couple of episodes, the first one in particular, introduce you to everyone, with side-splitting, belly-aching laughter -- some sadly lacking in most of today's TV Sitcoms.  Thoughout the season, they take you on one riotous adventure after another. Ah, that unseen Maris!
There are only a handful of shows that I laugh just as hard at the second, third, and hundreth time as the first.  M*A*S*H and All in the Family are two of them; Frasier is another, and rivals any sitcom past or present.
The DVD extras are there (the identities of Frasiers callers are sometimes pleasantly surprising), and are certainly better than most of the genre, but could have been better.  How about some bloopers next time?  Show them filming an episode! More cast interviews!  The possibilities are virtually endless.
Kelsey Grammar and David Hyde Pierce are simply exquisite in their roles, and the casting of this show has to be the best on TV. The chemistry is evident from the get-go and is directly responsible for the outstanding quality and success of the show.  Who else could make buying a Barcalounger so funny?

The sound is fine but seems to be louder than other DVDs - I have to set the volume down on my TV compared to most movies.  Maybe this is something to do with my particular DVD player?
The discs are light on extras - most notably, the DVD is missing a ""play all"" feature - you have to go to the remote to start every episode.  I would like to see this feature in the next release.",1053993600,19,675,3.9703703703703703

1464341,5,B00005JLJE,"Big Frasier fan here. Been one for awhile. In fact, the TV show has been a staple in my television diet since it's premiere way back in 1993. After the ending of Cheers, it was hard to imagine that anything could be as funny! Enter Frasier, revamped, making a new life in Seattle, reattaching himself to his family. Let the hilarity ensue.
The release of the first season of Frasier on DVD is a masterstroke. Finally, you'll get all the wonderfully hilarious episodes of season 1 at your fingertips to love and enjoy all over again. See the first spark of Niles and Daphne. Meet agent Bebe for the first time. Watch Eddie tormenting Frasier ruthlessly. It's all there, and many, many, many laughs. In fact, laugh out loud laughs.
You know you watch TV and you see something and you go, that's funny. But you don't laugh. Frasier makes you laugh out loud, even if sitting alone. Wonderful writing, expert directing, and the acting all lend themselves to your enjoyment.
To be honest, it's the performances of the main cast that really stand out in this selection too. Kelsey Grammer's comedic timing is impeccable. David Hyde Pierce's everso fussy Niles plays off Kelsey's Frasier like a pair of matching bookends. John Mahoney is wonderfully gruff as Martin, while Jane Leeves plays a more cockney-ish version of Daphne, which would get more toned down later. Peri Gilpin, as one of my favorite characters Roz, has her edge back and biting.  It's fun to watch these characters and actors as they started, and to realize how far they've come.
Frasier always was a comedy for the thinking person. I think these DVD's are superb, and for the price you get quite bit. It's well worth your investment of time and money. Invite Frasier into your home, and enjoy!",1053734400,12,1756,4.719869706840391
1464342,5,B00005JLJE,"I am a newbie so to speak having burned Seinfeld out just about completely in reruns. I decided to start taping reruns of a little show called Frasier after having ""accidently"" taping it once, watching it and thinking, ""Wow, this is actually witty, and not just by television standards."" Ok, so I was paraphrasing those thoughts, but that's the genesis. Anyway, I have yet to ""get into"" the new ones currently running, thought I'd get a heaping helping of backstory; enter this boxset (which I only heard about THE DAY BEFORE release! I was SHOCKED!) I like the sparks here, the little things. I see already Niles is deathly afraid of bugs, moths and bats, I find that to be amusing. I love picturing him as a child trying his best to avoid such things. Frasier is of coarse the anchor. Marty often the catalyst and of coarse there's Roz. I like watching these because as opposed to the reruns they are in order and I have a context for this little show called Frasier. With its superb writing, handsome box, clean picture, nice artwork, and superb sound it seems sad to think of how many people there out there (just like me) who would enjoy this show... if it were promoted ""right"". No, strike that. ""AT ALL"".

1464343,5,B00005JLJE,"After Cheers went off the air in 1993, NBC spun off a new series starring Kelsey Grammer who continues his role as Dr. Frasier Crane.  Instead of keeping Frasier in Boston, they moved him back to his hometown of Seattle (although that is never mentioned as his hometown in Cheers, but Seattle was the trendy, cool city in 1993). Frasier has taken a job as a host of radio talk show on KACL where he will dispense psychiatric advice.  The show's pilot episode finds the newly divorced Frasier settling into his new job and new lavishly decorated apartment ready to enjoy life as a bachelor.  This set up is disrupted when his brother Niles (David Hyde Pierce) informs him that their father, Martin (John Mahoney), can no longer take care of himself (the fact that Frasier has a father is a bit of creative memory loss on the part of the creators because in an episode of Cheers where Frasier's son is having his bris, Frasier mentions that his father has long been dead and that he was a scientist, thus even his job was different.  He would mention that his father was dead in subsequent episodes as well.).  Martin is a former policeman who has hip problems that resulted from a gunshot wound he suffered in the line of duty.  Frasier reluctantly agrees to take his father in after Niles says that he can't do it and a nursing home would be wrong.  This is more than Frasier bargained for as not only does his father bring his dog, Eddie, but his wacky physical therapist Daphne Moon (Jane Leeves) and a tacky green, beat up old recliner that is his favorite chair and clashes with Frasier's high end dcor.  Niles is an even more hauty, prissy and uptight than Frasier and Martin is nothing like either of his sons.  He likes simple things like ballgames and beer as opposed to opera and fine wine.  The show employs a trick used on Cheers where like Norm's wife Vera, Niles' wife Maris is often mentioned and talked about, but never seen.  Daphne is from Manchester, England and is a psychic.  At the radio station, we met Frasier's producer Roz Doyle (Peri Gilpin) who is a brassy, man chaser.  The show came up with a great gimmick to incorporate guest stars as callers into Frasier's radio show.  Frasier would intone his now famous line of ""I'm listening"" and the guest voice would detail their problems and Frasier would respond.  First season guest voices include actors Mary Tyler Moore, Christopher Reeve, Christine Lahti, Carl Reiner, Mel Brooks, Ben Stiller, Joe Mantegna, Jeff Daniels and Elijah Wood and non-actors Eddie Van Halen, Timothy Leary, Patty Hearst, Tommy Hilfiger, Dominick Dunne, Jay Leno, Rosemary Clooney and Gary Trudeau.  Dan Butler's overtop character of Bob ""Bulldog"" Butler who hosts a sports talk show on KACL is also introduced and supplies big laughs every time he appears.  Bebe Neuwirth was the first Cheers co-star to guest star on the show as she appears in sixteenth episode as Dr. Lilith Crane who comes to Seattle to try to reconcile with Frasier.  A young Brittany Murphy has a guest role as a high school student in a hilarious episode where Frasier throws out Martin's chair and goes all over Seattle to find and it ends up it is being used in a high school play.  Frasier is a rare spin-off that matched its parent series success.  The show was an instant smash with the critics and in the ratings.  The show has won a record number thirty Emmys in its ten year run and the show won five Emmys at the 1993-94 awards ceremony including the first of its unprecedented five consecutive wins for Outstanding Comedy Series (Cheers won four times).  Mr. Grammer had been nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for his role as Frasier twice before (he was also nominated once for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series in 1992 for guest shot he had on Wings playing Frasier, the Emmys for some reason included one-time guest appearances in with the continued roles, but wisely changed the guest shots to a separate category), but he finally broke through with a win for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.  Frasier's first season had the advantage of being created, written and directed by the people who performed the same duties on Cheers.  But instead of becoming a clone of Cheers, Frasier developed its own distinctive voice while maintaining the high standards set by Cheers.",1053475200,27,4355,4.7
