8527358,5,B008FQYP1Q,"If you really want to be healthy, try following the Nourishing Traditions traditional diet. It is not a fad diet. It is based on what people ate around the world before industrial agriculture ruined our food. Have a healthy body, healthy teeth and healthy children. By the way, fat such as lard, butter, and other animal fat are good for you.",1422662400,3,342,4.622950819672131

If you have been to any of the Weston Price meetings here in the states, you really need to see the speakers presented in England.  Many of their presenters are valuable resources to learn from and enjoy new information about nutrition.",1347494400,7,320,4.907407407407407
8527361,5,B008FQYP1Q,"No need to go to London. These DVDs are professionally done and the content is amazing. I was especially fascinated with Dr. Weston A. Price's work in the 20th century. More people should be aware of his amazing work. We have so much to learn about health but it boils down to obeying mother nature. Dr. Price traveled the world and discovered what was essential in diets that created health for the indigenous peoples who had not been tainted by white flour, white sugar and vegetable oils. I highly recommend this set. You will want to watch some presentations more than once and you will definitely want to share the DVDs with family and friends.",1347062400,7,649,4.6521739130434785
