3964109,3,B002P8LKB8,I ordered this video with the Julianne Hough video and I thought this one was a lot harder.  They go over the moves very quickly.  If you have do dance experience it can be a little difficult.,1267574400,,192,4.162162162162162
3964110,3,B002P8LKB8,"After reading the reviews others wrote, I debated returning the video.  I kept and like the majority of the buyers was disappointed.  I didn't think it got my heart rate up at all until Lacey's freestyle section.  The latin section was mediocre, and the tango was just a bunch of walking around from each segment.  I will continue to use it but definitely on my easier workout days.",1266796800,,382,4.573529411764706
3964111,1,B002P8LKB8,"These people cannot teach, the dances are boring, and in general, the dances on this DVD just aren't a lot of fun. And they should be, because besides a workout, that's what dance DVDs are for. They should be fun, just challenging enough to keep them exciting, but not so challenging that you're spending more time standing there confused than dancing. But this one just doesn't have it.

Let's start with Kym's section: she seems to confuse talking slowly with teaching well, which is kind of ridiculous. She talks very slowly and calmly, then she does some complicated step without explaining it all--in one instance, she just states the name of a move again and again and does the steps really fast, like all of the audience knows exactly what steps that move entails. Another instance she takes a move too fast when it would've been so much simpler to just slow it down/break it down to explain it, then speed it up.*That's* how you teach people to dance. Also she keeps talking about ""the core"" over and over again...it's like, we get it. You're trying to point out that this is good for your stomach muscles. You're obviously trying really hard to justify this DVD, but it's not working. It's just annoying. And the other two women doing the dance with her look like they think they think they're too good for the DVD or something; the one has the snottiest face the whole time and they're just unpleasant to watch. I guess they couldn't find back up dancers who were fun and seemed to be enjoying themselves. Is that really too much to ask?

Then the next dance, with Dmitry, is just boring. It's not active enough or fun enough to get into; I couldn't even finish it out. I didn't feel like I was working out at all. He teaches a bit better, but he frustrated me by constantly using the phrase ""take it from the top"" without clarifying what ""the top"" was...because it was hardly ever the beginning of the dance, but rather some recent arbitrary point. I wanted to say to him, ""Look, you can't say 'take it from the top' every few minutes and start at a different point. It just doesn't work that way.'"" Instead, I thought to myself, ""Who cares? This is boring anyway,"" and went on to the last dance on the DVD.

I found the last dance on the DVD boring and the moves kind of silly. And it was weird; she would refer to moves done in the earlier dances on the DVD but then do them differently. It was confusing. And the worst part was I didn't even feel the least bit tired or sweaty after finishing up. I almost always get sweaty and tired doing dance DVDs but this one just left me feeling like I could've gotten more of a workout from a walk.

And one more complaint, this not just about this DVD as about too many dance DVDs out there: people buy these to practice in their homes. Now maybe I'm in a tiny minority, but I just don't have the room in my living room to be flying all over the dance floor like they do. You'd think people who choreograph these videos would take that into account but they never seem to. It makes it a lot harder for me to get into a dance when I have to stop halfway through the steps because I ran out of room or stumbled into the couch. Just saying.

Anyway, if you're trying to get fit through dance, I would definitely not recommend this or any of The Dancing With the Stars series (I have one other that's as bad as this one). I do have a hip-hop DVD that I really like called 10 Minute Solution Hip Hop Dance Mix so I would recommend that to anyone who's looking for a good dance DVD.",1266624000,2,3531,4.335854765506808
3964112,2,B002P8LKB8,nothing exciting. it will teach you basic salsa steps. no one even smiles. it will get your heart rate slightly elevated if you don't normally dance.,1265846400,,149,4.769230769230769
3964113,1,B002P8LKB8,"This video is hard to follow for me, because I have no background in dance. They are telling me moves to do, but for the life of me I can't follow along. This video would be SO much better if they would take the time to show you how to do the moves slowly before they start bouncing across the stage. I was hoping this would be fun, but instead I'm just frustrated. Don't waste your money on this unless you're already a good dancer.",1264809600,,433,4.105882352941176
3964114,1,B002P8LKB8,"I have done other dancing videos and love the cardio dancing with the stars.  This one however is awful.  They spend twice the time trying to explain the complicated steps then actually working out.  I did this work out this morning, and then had to do another one just to feel like I worked out.",1264723200,,296,4.345454545454546
3964115,3,B002P8LKB8,"I borrowed this DVD from the library to preview it before I purchased it.  Some other reviewers commented on the lack of a warm up and the type of instructions given.  I do have to agree with these comments.  The DVD does have a cool down, which is a plus.  First up is Kym, who leads some Latin-style moves.  Not too inspiring, just a lot of hips swaying; I wasn't sure if it really counted as a dance or a workout.  This segment was quite disjointed.  Next was Dmitri, who leads a tango style routine.  His instructions are clear and he does go slow- at least 3 times so you get it.  His routine is more of a routine, but I didn't feel too challenged.  Last is Lacey with Freestyle.  Now, while I didn't care for this style of dance, sort of hip-hop/jive/bouncy, it IS the best workout.  First, it's VERY aerobic and secondly, it is a whole little routine from start to finish.  She breaks it into sections and builds upon what was done.  Then she goes through the whole routine several times.  There's some jumping, so it's not quite low impact.  Of the 3 dances, this one made me feel like I was working out.

All in all, I was disappointed and a, glad that I did not purchase this DVD.

What I do recommend is the DWTS Latin Cardio with Maks and Cheryl.  It's not perfect and sometimes her instructions are a bit fast, but you feel like you've exercised.  There is a nice warm up and cool down and 4 dances to choose from.",1262822400,2,1427,4.253731343283582
3964116,2,B002P8LKB8,"I was quite disappointed with this video.  I workout on a regular basis and was hoping to add dance into my routine to change things up.  However, this was not the DVD to start with.

The other reviews did a good job of explaining the different sets on the DVD so I won't talk to much about those.  i will say that I feel like I got the best workout from the first routine, the Latin routine, which was focused on abs.  The other two didn't do much for me.

But the real issue I has was not being able to keep up with the steps.  I am no a dancer at all, but my sister has been dancing all her life and is in a show choir now and she had a hard time keeping up with the steps.  Often times you only see the steps once before you do them at tempo.  I also felt like I needed a lot more space than would be available anywhere in my home.

If you want to learn the dances this may be a good DVD for you.  If you are a beginner or are looking for a good workout I would suggest skipping this video.",1262476800,8,994,3.8
3964117,4,B002P8LKB8,"I purchased this with the other DWTS DVD. I definitely prefer ""Dance off the Pounds"" to the ""Dance Body Tone"" DVD.

However, it was hard to go into DVD with an open mind since I loved ""Dance Off the POunds"" so much, but if you do, you will find that it is actually a good workout, if you put the energy the instructors have for these moves into it.

The first section was Latin dance with Kym. It's called an ""ab blast"" but honestly, I didn't feel as though I was doing anything really strenuous. There is Rhumba, Cha Cha and Merengue here. The moves are pretty good, not fast paced and easy to get down on the first try. But that was the problem I had. It felt more like I was swaying my hips continuously for 15 mins and that's all. I was a little let down with this section and worried that they were reverting back to the older DWTS DVDs. But I was pleasantly surprised that the next day, my abs and hips did feel like they were worked, albeit not sore exactly, but ""stretched out"". So this section DID serve it's purpose.

Second up was the Tango/Argentine Tango section with Dmitry. This section was a lot of fun and I felt sexy doing it. I didn't work up a huge sweat since the tango is not a fast dance, and the moves are broken down slowly. But doing the leg flicks you see them do on the show was a lot of fun. Great little section but I really didn't think it was toning anything. Well here I am the day after and let me tell you, was I wrong! My legs and butt are a little sore and I am really surprised. The thing with this section is, you are doing a lot of lunges and steps that you ""sit in"" so you are doing a lot of thigh and glute work! And you don't realize that. So it was a really pleasant surprise.

Last up was the Freestyle section with Lacey. Like a previous reviewer said, this was the only section that had a routine all the way through and broke down the moves as you go. This section was a lot of fun and had some cute moves. It got my heart rate up since it was pretty much straight on cardio. This was really the only section that made me tired.

Finally there is a 5-6 minutes cool down and stretch to top everything off.

Overall this is a good workout. As I was doing it, while it was fun, I wasn't extremely impressed. And I wasn't nearly as exhausted after doing this as I was after the ""Dance off the Pounds"" workout. But I did feel it the next day, so that was a plus. It's nice to know I didn't waste 50 minutes on a workout that did nothing. I think the key here is to REALLY get into the moves and execute them correctly, otherwise you will not get any benefit from this.

While I won't reach for this DVD nearly as much as I will the ""Dance Off the Pounds"" workout, this is good for those lighter days when you don't want to workout but really want to do SOMETHING.",1261353600,15,2807,4.0650994575045205
3964118,4,B002P8LKB8,"This dancing workout is different from all of the other DWTS workouts.  I was expecting it to be like ""DWTS: Dance Off the Pounds"" but it was totally different.  While in ""Dance Off the Pounds"" each of the three dances was a full routine, some of these dances were not full routines.  Yet, they weren't just moves taught to you.  Let me explain. . .

There is no warm-up so you go directly to the first workout.

Latin-This 15 minute workout is divided into three 5 minute workouts.  The first one is Rumba, the second Cha-Cha, and the third was a Cha-Cha/Merengue mix.  The back of the box said to expect Mambo, but I didn't really see any Mambo steps except for maybe one.  Maybe.  The Rumba is easy and beginners could probably do it.  Cha-Cha is a bit quicker and it slightly resembles the Cha-Cha routine on the ""Cardio Dance"" DVD.  The Cha-Cha Merengue was nice, but it features some moves that are more ab toning and less dance.  Kym Johnson leads this, and she is a better instructor than in the other video.  However, this section just seemed too feminine.  There were no male backups and the moves were a little slinky.  Focuses on toning abs.

Tango-I LOVED this section!  Led by Dmitry Chaplin, it had the same format as the Latin with three 5 minute workouts.  The moves were SO fun.  The music was GREAT!  You really felt like you were really dancing!  Unfortunately, this routine has no real purpose except for teaching some really fun steps.  It is not cardio at all, and while it tries to tone legs, it fails.  At least it does for me.

Freestyle-This routine, led by Lacey Schwimmer IS a full routine.  It has NO toning whatsoever, but it takes Jive, Latin, and other steps and adds a hip-hop style to them.  This was a lot of fun, and it was the one routine on the DVD that really got my heart rate up.  It is the only routine on the DVD that I could actually call a workout.

Cool Down-Once again, there are no male dancers-not even Dmitry.  I dunno, I think Cal Pozo (the director/choreographer) was going for just women on this DVD.  The stretching wasn't that great.  It was more of just relaxing moves.  You don't stretch ANY muscles except the glutes, and for a split second the hamstrings.  Great choreography in this video.  Unfortunately, it only has light cardio/toning benefits.",1260230400,31,2308,4.506053268765133
3964119,4,B002P8LKB8,"I won't break down the sections as that is already done nicely here. REgarding the no warm up complaint many had I used the cool down as a warm up and it worked nicely. You can repeat it again at the end or do your own cool down.

The Latin section was a little boring for me but it is a good ab workout. The Tango section with Dmitry was lots of fun and interesting steps.  Although I did not break a sweat with either of these I will do them on a low energy day.

Lacey's section was the most fun and did actually make me break a sweat. It's a nice, quick little aerobic workout. Some have complained that she did not break down the steps enough but in my opinion that would have ruined the flow of the workout by making it too slow and tedious There was really nothing difficult and most people should be doing it smoothly by the end of the workout. I have shelved many workouts because there was TOO MUCH breaking down so by the time you were doing the steps up to speed it's over and making the workout extremely boring and so slow it's not a workout any more.",1389571200,,1065,4.086124401913875
3964120,2,B002P8LKB8,"I suppose this ""workout"" would be fun if it weren't so frustrating.  I'm admittedly not a dancer, but I'm not a dunce and I am able to follow instruction.  Before jumping into a move, oftentimes, the more challenging moves were only shown one time, and sometimes at a rapid pace.  I struggled to learn the moves.  They spent far more time explaining the step touch (as if anyone couldn't master that one) than ""the cookaracha"" or other more advanced dance moves.  It would have been nice if they would have slowed down the pace on the instructional part so the viewer could get the move down before having to learn a brand new move and when ready to advance, go into the music without instruction section of the work-out.

For me, a very inexperienced dancer, this was a complete waste of money.  I've wanted to get into it and pulled it out determined to figure out the moves several times, but to no avail.

I can't speak much to the intensity of this work-out.  I didn't get far enough into it to know if it was possible to ""feel the burn""",1310515200,,1042,4.4136125654450264
3964121,4,B002P8LKB8,"This exercise video is a lot of fun but challenging enough that I'm still not bored with it.  It's been at least six months since I bought it!  The freestyle dance segment is a bit too modern for me but the other two segments (latin and tango) are right up my alley.

The instructors speak to you in a normal way; the volume is not too loud or too soft and their pace is not too slow or too fast.  You can select to do the workout without the instructor's voice if you want to.  You can also select which of the 15-minute exercises you would like to do and in what order you would like to do them for a customized routine.

The down side to this exercise video is that in some cases the instructors don't break some of the faster moves down for you.  I used the pause-step function on the DVD to watch them in slow motion but sometimes it was still hard to see their feet because all of them are wearing loose black pants.  Another downside is that there is no separate warm-up segment in this particular DWTS video; it's in the latin segment in the guise of a rumba.

People with knee or hip problems shouldn't use this video.  You have to be able to balance on the balls of your feet while doing a lot of very quick movements; this can put a lot of pressure on the knee and hip joints until your muscles grow strong enough to hold yourself up properly.

I think this video has been worth the money I spent on it.  It really strengthened my quadriceps and core.  I definitely recommend it to anyone interested in dance.",1309564800,,1520,4.2
3964122,3,B002P8LKB8,It was too difficult for me to catch on to the first time so now I'm not interested. Maybe if you are really motivated and keep trying or if you have dance experience it would be fine.,1308614400,,184,4.0
3964123,3,B002P8LKB8,"You really need to know somewhat how to dance to this.. It's very fast paced, with little instruction.  I picked it up easily, but if you don't know basics, It may take you a little bit to pick it up.  The 'one-on-one' instruction really does help, so that's a bonus.. Over all, i'm glad I got it on Amazon instead of paying a massive price at Target for it.",1286150400,,358,4.173913043478261
3964124,4,B002P8LKB8,"I have all the DWTS workout videos and they are all good and they get you to sweat and burn off so many calories while having fun and doing something I love...dancing.

The reason I give this one 4 stars is because it isn't as high energy as the other ones and even though you do burn calories not as much as the other videos, but that might be because it is to tone and not a cardio workout. But it is still awesome.

The one other thing I didn't like it that they split the routines into tiny pieces and never really put the whole thing together so it isn't like a Choreography except for the freestyle section.

But overall I highly recommend this DVD if you love dancing, are a fan of DWTS and want to burn and tone up.",1280707200,,723,4.077464788732394
3964125,1,B002P8LKB8,"Somehow the creators of this DVD managed to find BORING latin dance music! IMHO a difficult task! Other than that, reviews by Rayna, B.Glass and Justin Bailey said it all. Wish I had: 1) read these reviews before purchasing and 2)spent the $ on a few downloaded tunes instead.",1278460800,,276,4.653061224489796
3964126,4,B002P8LKB8,In reading the reviews I see that a lot of people are comparing this to the Dance Off the Pounds DWTS DVD. I don't think this DVD is designed to give you a hardcore workout but to maintain your weight and tone. I don't have Dance Off the Pounds so I can't compare but I love this DVD. It provides me with exactly what I am looking for in a workout. I don't want to lose weight but just maintain my weight and tone muscles. I like Dmitry's tango section but here is what I do. I don't have a lot of time to work out so the 15 minute sections are perfect. If I can do all of them great but if I can't then I do Lacey's freestyle routine first and then if I have time I do Kym's latin routine as a cool down. Lacey's freestyle works just about every muscle in your body but it doesn't exhaust you. I really like this DVD and would recommend it to anyone looking for a workout to maintain weight and tone muscles. You don't have to be any kind of a dancer to do these workouts which is good for me because I am not. I can't say enough good things about this DVD!,1278374400,,1058,3.925581395348837
3964127,4,B002P8LKB8,"Like others have said, this is not really a good video for someone who hasn't had any dance training. You by no means need to be a pro, but it helps if you know basic steps like a pas du beurre or ball change as they don't really teach it. One thing that's important...some have claimed that this DVD doesn't really tone, but keep in mind that it would be very possible to do this whole DVD w/o working out at all if you don't use the right muscles to do the moves. i.e., In the Latin section, Kym reminds you often to keep your abs/core engaged. You can do the whole thing w/o engaging your abs, but you won't see any results. Same with the glutes and thighs in Dmitri's section.

Pros: The latin parts are really fun. I like that they instruct mirror image (i.e., when they tell you ""left foot"" they use their right foot so it's like looking into a mirror). A lot of workout videos don't do that. There's a cool ""custom"" option that allows to you select parts of the DVD so you can customize your workout (very basic, but a nice touch). Also, you can select to ""mute"" the instructors' speaking, which is nice once you learn the routines and don't want/need to listen to the chatter.

Cons: No warm up and a terrible cool down. The ""freestyle"" section doesn't seem to go with the latin/tango dance parts. Dmitri is fun, but he has a really bad habit of not giving a proper ""5, 6, 7, 8"" before starting moves; he frequently just does the moves or isn't clear if you are going to start from the top or just do a single move. Until you've memorized the routines, you miss a lot of steps.

Bottom line: I wouldn't make this my only workout DVD, but it's a nice, fun addition to my collection.",1271116800,,1689,4.255451713395638
3964128,3,B002P8LKB8,"Very basic menu of each of the dances (custom) or play all (with or without instruction)
No warmup.
Latin (15 min)
Kym Johnson  & 2 backup women -
she starts & does the most of the Cucaracha (figure 8 w/step out), also goes over Rumba step, pada berets w/seductive single hip roll, Cumbia, cha-cha variations like the New Yorker & a tight double step twist step & Merengue w/hip roll. Those who never had lessons or haven't tried other Latin dance dvds w/instruction may get lost as she never goes slower then normal tempo & the camera will move away from the feet often. This is mostly lean a step & practice & kinda build into a routine, but I like the practice style more then needing a routine.
Tango (15 min)
Dimitry Chaplin w/2 women & 2 men -
More a balancing/very easy toning, it's slower movements, you won't increase your heart rate. There are almost no leg lifts, just a lot of pointing out & some turns. The music was better here, but the moves felt more like for those with little balance ability, very basics & bit dull. Dimitry actually shows you the moves in 1/2 time once, & what to expect which is refreshing after Kym's lack of teaching.
Freestyle (15 min)
Lacey Shwimmer w/2 women & 2 men -
This is a modified easy combo of some of the moves from the previous sections as well as Hip Hop, Jive, Latin, Broadway, etc. with three different song beats, some more rock & roll, some more Jive, etc. Lacey explains the move beforehand once & shows it in 1/2 time 1x like Dimitry which helps a lot.  This one is the least dull because there is less emphasis on tight control, more looseness & faster tempo in music.
Cool Down (5 min)
Lacey Shwimmer & Kym Johnson  w/2 women -
Basic head & should rolls, chest contractions/rolls, body sways/folds, ballet style side bends, hip bumps & figure 8s, standing fwd bends, yoga seated twist, etc.

This series really needs the option of different music or NO music (consumer can play music through other system or headphones w/instruction) & separate section of teaching the moves so the main part is mostly 1/2 tempo & full tempo practice.  Again, the music here & everyone seems very bored/stiff still except maybe Lacey in Freestyle. You don't need fake banter/talking, but you do need to sense the instructors/dancers ARE enjoying or least getting into the moment of the dance even some spontaneity & in the moment comments. THAT'S waht motivates/seems fun to us. This is best for people who know the dances above or can learn them at least semi-easily & looking for a very mild workout for an easy day.

Only good for experienced dancers- definitely not beginners.  it's shocking to think these are teachers- they don't know how to break down steps and instruct- they just tell you what to do and start doing it- Kym is the worst.

8376754,1,B002P8LKB8,"I want to add a dance day into my weekly work out routine and saw this for cheap. My parents are Dancing with the ""stars"" fans and I've watched the show with them occasionally. I've noticed that the ""stars"" do tend to get pretty fit and shed a few pounds while being contestants so figured I'd give this work out video a shot.

These professional dance instructors (none of which I even recognize from the show) have NO IDEA how to teach a beginner video dance class.

You would think in a beginner dance video they would first slowly demonstrate how to do a move just so you know what to do, then tell you to do it with them slowly so you get a feel for the move, then do the move again together at a normal speed for the dance. NOPE! First they do the move slowly to show you what it is they want you to do then the instructor asks you to do that move with them (for the first time ever) at normal speed, no slow practice round for you! You're just flung straight in. Sometimes the camera will even cut away to an odd sideways angle of the background dancers while you're trying the move (for the first time!) so you have no idea how to follow along. Worst of all, the DVD does not allow you to rewind a move if you miss it--you can only start it all over again from each of the three 15 minute dance segments.  So you could be 8 minutes into a segment, miss a move and have no way to rewind it so you can focus on that move. You're only options are to either roll with the punches, awkwardly trying to imitate the fast paced professional dancers with the move that confuses you or start the entire dance section over from square one. Bad bad BAD!

They're favorite phrase is ""okay from the top"" and it's confusing as hell. From the top of the 15 minute dance segment? From the top of the move we just learned? From the top of the 3 moves ago? Specifics people!

The music is weak, the instruction is weak and frankly the work out is weak of you're looking to tone anything. If you really get into it you can get your heart rate up but most of the time you're just trying to figure out the moves and follow along without tripping like an awkward baby giraffe.",1423440000,,2161,4.147971360381861
