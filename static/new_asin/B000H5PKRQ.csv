This video is a compilation of ladies during the 1990's to early 2000. (The copyright says 1997, so DVD's were not quite ready at this time.) It's a remake of the original VHS series. From the looks of the girls, they seemed to be college girls trying to make some extra money on the side, or possibly wanting to get into the ""nude modeling"" industry. The title pretty much sums up what is on the DVD is, a lot of girls nude inside and outside someone's home. There's shower scenes, stripping scenes, and then scenes where their just goofing off in the nude. (Playing with their pet cat, taking a real phone call, dancing to a song, etc.) Don't expect the best quality video since it is a VHS port. There are a few moments where you see some color distortions and odd blurry moments, but overall not the worst video I have seen. The video lasts about 40 minutes or so and has 10 ladies to watch. The DVD does include a scene selection so you can go straight to the girl you want to see.

I got this video very quickly for standard USPS service. (About 5-6 days) This DVD is only for whose who don't mind the VHS quality video and also familiar with similar work of this style of videos. Adults only.",1374192000,9,1432,4.359550561797753
