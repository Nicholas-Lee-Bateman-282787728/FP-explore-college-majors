377432,2,6301801652,"I anxiously ""popped"" this video into my VCR (having not seen it in almost 10 years!) and was a little disappointed.  I thought the main story was good.  But it was almost like the Daleks were just ""Thrown  in"".  This story didn't need them, and frankly would have done better  without them.  It was rumored that the Daleks were actually added after the  original script was done, just to make it a little more flashy.  Unfortunatley, it all ended up in a little overkill.  If you want a truly  wonderful Dalek story, check out GENESIS OF THE DALEKS, OR DESTINY OF THE  DALEKS...your money would be better spent.",956534400,6,611,4.564814814814815
377433,4,6301801652,"14 Doctor Who teleplays have featured the Daleks and only ahandful were written by someone other than their creator, TerryNation. When Louis Marks wrote this teleplay in 1972 his story omitted the Daleks, but producers insisted they be included to boost the ratings. The result is one of the best stories in the Dr Who saga. The only serious detraction from the production is the incidental music by Dudley Simpson which seems attuned to the pain receptors of the brain (an unfortunate accompaniment to most of the Pertwee era). Jon Perywee's Doctor is a post-sixties construct, one part super-sleuth (a derivative for Austin Powers complete with ruffled shirt and velvet jacket) and one part moralizing scientist. The resulting paradoxical characterization is intriguing, made further captivating by Mr Pertwee's charismatic persona. Jo Grant, the doctor's assistant tags along on this one just for kicks. (How she is of assistance to the Doctor we are never quite sure) The Pertwee years set the standard for the male/ female companionship utilized throughout the series' run. Beneath the formal relationship lies an unmistakeable sexual tension which neither party fully exploits. Nevertheless, Ms. Grant has a teenage flirtatiousness that attracts the male attention, a fact made more pronounced by her less than ample mini-skirt. The Doctor may be a man of action but he is also the soul of propriety. This production is enhanced by knowing its own limitations and not trying to exceed them either technically nor artistically. Thus the narrative sustains the viewer past the moments of low tech effects and bare-bones production values. The acting is thankfully better than is usual for Doctor Who. Aubrey Woods as the Controller is especially effective. END",949881600,6,1764,5.2811387900355875

It's not a bad UNIT story and all around are very good. it's just the staging, dialogue, voices and realisation of the Daleks in this serial that fail.

377435,5,6301801652,"Operating on a shoestring budget with actors, technicians and writers who were largely second-raters, the BBC series, Doctor Who, nevertheless manages to find its niche. Clive Barker, among others, expresses his admiration for less sophisticated fare which have a ""gnarly"" texture, exhibiting all the sutures,zippers and wires absent in the hollywood-style productions offered through the CGI technicians. There is a counter-cultural element which prefers this abstract approach employed by older sci-fi productions which rely more on the imagination of the viewer than that needed with the absolutism of modern special effects which  offer visuals designed to project a more polished style. Day of the Daleks is typical of the former approach. Ogrons jackboot around in facial prostheses that are ill-fitted and comical. At first perusal of a clumsy Dalek manuevering with all the dexterity of an oversized wheelchair one must either conceed to the absurdity of it or turn the channel. It doesn't take long for most to reach that decision. But Day of the Daleks is better than most in that it is backed up by a story with merit. It succeeds despite its limitation in production and some may even say because of them.
Whether or not one wants to be pidgeonholed, the unmistakable charm of such productions as Doctor Who lie in their simplicity, which demands the viewer be inherently accepting of the visual form in order to appreciate the underlying narrative. In short one will know within the first moments of viewing whether the interpretation is one suitable to the individual's taste. Hence, opinions on the show's merits tend to be poles apart; rarely will one find a middle of the road opinion. No amount of prose will sway the either opinion once it has been formed. And yet there is something malicious within the psyche that compels some to vent their spite against that which others embrace and for which they have no appreciation. Many such reviews will be encountered on any perusal of the online forums relating to this series. A peculiarly cynical attitude considering that this show was primarily intended for the enjoyment of younger viewers. Some people are obviously not content to allow even them their moments of unmolested enjoyment.",948585600,6,2256,5.130434782608695

Personally I love both versions but the special edition story really improved the original story and got rid of the annoying non-Dalek sounding voices used in the original.

Surprisingly, it is difficult to tell the modified and new scenes from the original filming and one of the extras included goes into how the achieved matching new to old so well.

377471,4,6301801652,"The Daleks make their return to Doctor Who make their first appearance in about five years in this episode as Doctor Who's 9th Season kicks off.

It begins by presenting the Doctor and Jo an intriguing mystery of a diplomat who was attacked by a man dressed as a guerilla, who is found by UNIT, and then disappears from the ambulance.

Overall, it's an intriguing premise that does bring back the Doctor's old enemies as the Daleks have now discovered time travel, but they aren't the ones who cause a time paradox that only the Doctor can fix it.

Pertwee has to carry this story in a few places. He's great, particularly in the action bits. In one scene, he's attacked while carrying a glass of wine, takes out his attacker and then returns to his wine. Now, that's poise. Aubrey Woods also pulls off a memorable performance as the Controller, a collaborator with the Daleks who is a strong character.

The weak spot here are Jo Grant, who is played as very, very dim and finds herself a dupe of the Daleks. The Dalek voices are also pretty bad and would be replaced by the next Dalek series in Season 10.

The ""Specially Shot Sequences"" didn't do much for me until I went back and watched the original, turns out they add more than I thought.  What makes it interesting is that they are subtle.

377475,4,6301801652,"Growing up in the UK in the era before home video I used to read Doctor Who novelizations all the time and my favorite was always ""Day of the Daleks"" which I must have read several times over the years. In this adventure the Daleks have discovered the secret of time travel and use this ability to ensure their future conquest of the Earth. The story is well constructed and I only recently had the opportunity to watch the original serial. Although the special effects are somewhat lacking and budget constraints obvious in the Dalek ""army"" consisting of only three Daleks (the special edition corrects this), I found this adventure featuring third doctor Jon Pertwee to be highly enjoyable and entertaining. The updated CGI effects seemed to be used thankfully sparingly and fit in well with the original footage. Recommended.",1392249600,,828,4.921428571428572

377487,5,6301801652,"Daleks.  A dark future.  Time Travelers trying to stop the future that they started...confusing, no?  The story is simple.  World War Three somehow happened, started by a peace conference gone wrong in the 20th Century.  The Daleks, of course, invade Earth.  Again.  And now human freedom fighters are trying to change the future into something better by coming back to kill the DOCTOR.  HA!  Didn't see that coming, did you?  Well, yeah, they think he is somebody else but it still almost happens.
The feel of this story out-weighs the sad special effects.  The plot and many themes help support a wonderful story about trying to save the future or trying to change the past.  It depends on your point of view.  The scenes of future Earth make me thing of 1984 and the Ogrons are an interesting idea as allies...er..thugs for the Daleks.  They ARE loyal.  Which helps the Daleks as there is only three of them on Earth.  Oh, I mean millions of Daleks.  Yeah, right.
It is also kind of nice to see the Daleks for the first time, in color, even if they don't really look that interesting.  The Day of the Daleks Special Edition also makes for a wonderful extra - the remaking, with better effects - of the WHOLE story!  There are other extras and, frankly, I loved the set.

377488,4,6301801652,"I was a ""Doctor Who"" fan from somewhere in the late 70s until the mid-80s, getting into re-runs of Tom Baker, Peter Davison, and Jon Pertwee episodes via PBS.  Lately, I've seen some of the new ""Doctor Who,"" and gleaned that the show and its conventions were popular once again, so I decided to revisit one of my favorite stories from the old days.

I don't really like the new episodes. They feel wrong to me. I think that Matt Smith does an outstanding job with the title role--he's probably one of the best ever to play the part--but on the whole the stories are too slick, too busy, too overstuffed. Maybe that opinion says as much about me as it does the show, but I don't care.

And I'm happy to report that I had an absolute blast with ""Day of the Daleks."" Was it cheesy? Yes.  Did it occasionally have a cheap, shot-on-the quick feel?  Yes.  Did it always make sense? No.

But did it bound exuberantly from one setup to the next, from one scene to the next, with a glee that you can't buy with all of the high-budget SFX in the world?  Yes.  Yes.

Watching this felt like going back in time.  That's my Doctor Who - the Doctor and his companions lounging around on supposedly futuristic pillows sipping wine from a vaguely bong-like container, or rushing to start up a completely incongruous and unexplained pull-start three-wheeler ATV in the middle of the 22nd century, or using ""Venusian Aikido"" to subdue a foe.  And throughout it all, storytelling spirit shining through the cheap backdrops and sketched-in effects - a low budget production wearing its heart on its sleeve.

It's brisk, light, slightly cheap, maybe a little too dated for some.  But it's fun.  A ton of fun, and I will be revisiting it sooner rather than later.

I have regretted some of the purchases I've made for the sake of nostalgia.  This is not one of them. I literally loved every minute of it.",1325030400,11,1882,4.504424778761062
377489,5,6301801652,Doctor Who Day Of The Daleks written by Louis Marks first aired January 1st - 22nd 1972 and featured the Daleks for the first time since The Evil Of The Daleks which aired all the way back in 1967. The story deals with rebels from an Earth in the 22nd Century who have been conquered by the Daleks so they manage to travel back in time and try to stop events leading up to Earth's eventual fall. Some people in fandom have found a few faults with the story such as the Dalek voices and the fact that the production team only had three Daleks to use but these things never bothered me that much. I know Jon Pertwee for years called this one of his least favorites although he changed his opinion of it after re watching it shortly before his passing. This edition  includes the original as well as a reworking of the original episodes with new effects and voices along with all the usual excellent bonus features that come on Doctor Who dvds.,1323820800,2,941,4.346590909090909

377491,5,6301801652,"The special edition on the 2nd disc is worth the price of the set.  Day of the Daleks has always been a great Who adventure, excellent plot, let down by the actual lack of Daleks (even their voices are not right), and some cheesy visual effects.  The special edition improves on that.  New Dalek voices, and tasteful effects that fit the period in which the story was originally produced.  There is an interesting making of.. documentary about the special edition too.  On the 1st disc you get the original version of the story and some more extras.  The main disappointment is that Katy Manning (Jo Grant) is not on the audio commentary.

377492,4,6301801652,"""Day of the Daleks"" is that rare Doctor Who story that actually dares to fiddle with time travel. As script editor Terrance Dicks notes in the making-of documentary included in the Special Features menu, the series tried to steer clear of time travel as much as possible. If the Doctor could change history (or the outcome of a story) merely by taking the TARDIS back in time to alter key events, paradoxes would pile up and stories would never really ""end.""

""Day of the Daleks"" has no such qualms: Guerrillas from the future travel back in time to 20th-century England to kill a key British minister who is organizing a world peace conference that will trigger a world war leading ultimately to a Dalek conquest of Earth. In addition to the return of the ever-popular Daleks, who had been out of service since the Patrick Troughton years, the story also features the slow-witted Ogrons, slaves of the Daleks who are hot on the guerrillas' trail to prevent them from interfering with history.

""Day of the Daleks"" suffers from the usual constraints placed on any story featuring the Daleks, namely the limited number of machines that could appear on camera at any one time and their inability to travel over uneven ground. And the witless, slow-moving Ogrons add nothing to speed up the battle sequences, which had to appear epic to succeed in a story as sweeping as this one.

Despite these limitations, ""Day of the Daleks"" is fondly remembered by many fans as the story that first turned them on to Doctor Who, and nostalgia has often colored their memories of the story to make it seem grander than it really was. This is where the second disc comes in handy: It includes a special edition of ""Day of the Daleks"" with updated special effects and re-recorded Dalek voices with analog technology. This makes them sound better than the originals (which were particularly bad) but not as pristine as the digitally mastered Dalek voices in the new series.

Also featured on the second disc is Part 2 of ""The UNIT Family,"" a documentary tracing the history of the organization (Part 1 comes with ""Inferno""), and ""The UNIT Dating Conundrum,"" which examines the problem of trying to place historical dates on the UNIT adventures. (I'd never thought of this, but to some people it's actually a big deal.)

One last thing: Kudos to Aubrey Woods, who turns in an effective, if stagy, performance as the Controller, a high-ranking political official who collaborates with, and ultimately betrays, the Daleks ruling 22nd-century Earth. Viewers may remember him for his quite different role as Bill, the candy-store proprietor, in the 1971 film ""Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory.""",1321228800,,2673,4.878854625550661
377493,5,6301801652,"In the 20th century a well repected man of the United Nations Sir Reginald Styles is considered the most hated man in the 22nd century.

  With that said this Pertwee era dvd is jammed packed with so many extras that its worth the price and watching no less then two times. The version with commetrey and the movie version with updated effects and voices. Of all the Pertwee era this one takes the cake. So sit back and watch Day of the Daleks.",1320192000,,1351,4.396
377494,5,6301801652,"Like my other reviews, I'm not going to give a synopsis of this story, or ramble on about the history of the show.  There are already a plethora of these presented here and elsewhere.  Instead, I'd like to focus on what else makes this worthy of your purchase.

Finally 2|entertain added some bonus features that were worth viewing.  There aren't many on the first disc, but the quality made up for quantity.  And the second disc contains special features that are pertinent to the special edition, as well as U.N.I.T.  The text commentary is the typical mixed bag of nuts, but I always take the time to read these, and the audio commentary was as wonderful to hear as it was sometimes disheartening, due to the fact that producer, Barry Letts, is one of the commentators, and I still feel his loss as he passed away in October of 2009, while I equally love hearing his take on the show,

The other mixed bag of nuts is the revised version on the second disc.  In all honesty, the Dalek voices in the original release are... need I say it?  But this version features Nicholas Briggs, the current voice of the Daleks, with an updated performance.  Funny enough, when watching one of the special features on the making of this version, it was stated that part of their efforts was to make them sound true to the original Daleks, rather than the manic version of the new series.  Yet, the first two episodes were more like the new series Daleks.  Fortunately, that was toned down by the third episode, and finally, they sounded proper to how they should have.  It's just too bad that they didn't realize this and rerecord his performance for the first two episodes.  And as far as the new visual FX, well, I can't be a hypocrite and cry, ""The sanctity of purism has been violated,"" since I appreciate the revised Dalek voices, while saying that the revised visuals are a no no.  I'll let you, the do that.

My bottom line is, if you're just looking to purchase this for the sake of having the DVD added to your collection, fine.  But if you're the type who loves to spend a whole day scrutinizing every aspect of this release, including the commentary, extras, etc, then this is definitely a must for you.",1317513600,6,2202,4.52020202020202
377495,4,6301801652,"I'm surprised that it took so long for ""Day of the Daleks"" - a pretty good Doctor Who story - to see the light of day on DVD. Perhaps the folks at BBC Worldwide and 2entertain were waiting for CGI technology to advance, to the point that they could produce a cheap but good-looking special edition (which is what you get on the second disc of this DVD two-pack).

Generally speaking, I don't care for special editions; new special effects or new scenes that are shoehorned into old productions tend to look distractingly out-of-place, in my eyes. For example, like much of the world's population, I dislike George Lucas' special editions of the Star Wars movies, for their anachronistic use of computer effects and pointless tinkering with minor plot points (such as whether Han or Greedo ""shot first""). And previous special edition Doctor Who DVDs have tended to look a bit ... well, lame, as they featured often-primitive CGI that barely improved on the original special effects.

But with ""Day of the Daleks,"" the BBC has finally produced a special edition that looks really good, and is (somewhat) worthwhile. They have added many new special effects to this story, and even a handful of new shots, primarily to make the battle scenes more exciting. Wisely, the DVD producers decided to make the new special effects retro-looking, so they fit well into a 1970s production; for example, when the Daleks zap people in the special edition, their victims turn into skeletons, which is cool but also in the same pleasantly goofy vein as ""Mars Attacks!""

While all this effort to ""improve"" the story is impressive, this is still ""Day of the Daleks,"" and if you've seen the original version you've basically seen the special edition as well. As a piece of Doctor Who, this holds up pretty well; Louis Marks' script is a somewhat intelligent exploration of time paradoxes, and there is some good characterization of the human villain. Still, I've always regarded ""Day of the Daleks"" as a little *flat*. To be more specific, the direction lacks pizzazz, the music score stinks, and the political dimension of the story is underdeveloped. These are not the sort of problems that can be addressed by the addition of new ray beams.

Still, I kinda like this story, and I appreciate the work that went into the special edition. The DVD is also impressive on other levels, as it features a wide array of documentary features covering both this story and the Jon Pertwee era as a whole. Like all Doctor Who DVDs, this product is a labor (or should I say labour?) of love by a small group of dedicated fans, and it makes for a worthy addition to my Who library.",1315958400,18,2649,4.752173913043478
377506,4,6301801652,"When I discovered that one of my local public libraries had a massive collection of Doctor Who on VHS a few years back this was the first story I checked out. After all it had my then favorite Doctor and the Daleks in it plus it had what looked like an intriguing story. So having seen many times since I find myself asking the question (which is also the title of a very good 1942 World War II film incidentally): Went the day well?

Well let's start by looking at the main cast members. Jon Pertwee gives as good a performance as the third Doctor as any other story, especially with some nice character moments in episode one. Katy Manning gives a nice if not adequate performance though she seems to fall rather too easily into the traps and machinations of the Controller. Nicholas Courtney, Richard Franklin and John Levenne all give adequate performances but nothing special about them here. In fact that could easily summarize the main cast members: adequate but nothing special.

The supporting cast favors much better. In particular the performance of Aubrey Wods as the Controller stands outs as his character makes a fascinating journey thanks to a crisis of conscience. Anna Barry, Scott Frederick and Jimmy Watson give believable performances as the guerrillas on a desperate mission to change history. Wilfrid Carter gives a fine but sadly underused performance as Sir Reginald Styles, the diplomat at the center of the story. There's also a nice cameo from real-life BBC reporter Alex MacIntosh in the final episode which adds some realism to the story. This story is one of the rare occasions where the supporting cast is better then the main cast.

The story is perhaps known as the return story of the Daleks after their apparent extinction in The Evil Of The Daleks back in 1967. Sadly though this was far from a grand return. the problem really is that the script wasn't written for the Daleks originally and it shows. For the first three episodes of the story the Daleks do little else but sit in a room issuing orders and then they finally move in episode four the results are less then great, particularly in the finale. Exacerbating the problem is the Dalek operation seems limited an unimpressive as a result. Worse yet is the voice work. The Dalek voices of Oliver Gilbert and Peter Messaline are by far the worst of the entire original series. I'm sure I'm not the only person who was overjoyed when it was announced there would be new voices for them in the special edition version for the DVD release. This story wasn't the Daleks finest hour and the story is hurt by that fact significantly.

Also other aspects of the production don't help. Dudley Simpson's music for the story becomes almost unbearable to listen to at times due to its volume and overuse of electronic elements in it. the editing of the story is a mixed affair with some really slow segments going on for too long (especially the sequence with the Doctor and Jo at Styles' house). The story's biggest problem is direction of Paul Bernard which comes across as the director being uninterested most of the time. These elements all hurt the story and it never really recovers from these faults.

There are good aspects to the production though. The Ogrons are not only well designed but well acted as well, making them strangely more effective then the Daleks in this story. The design work of David Myerscough-Jones makes for nice sets which are complemented nicely. Then there's the script by Louis Marks.

If anything can be said about Day Of The Daleks it is that it has a fine script behind it. Marks deals with the issues of time travel paradoxes intelligently years in advance of other science fiction shoes and blends them well into a story about the world on the brink of World War III. When the story moves to the 22nd Century is becomes a familiar tale of a handful of people fighting to free themselves from oppression. While this has some echoes of The Dalek Invasion Of Earth in it and lacks the depth of that story, it still makes for some intriguing viewing. The script does have two problems: the Daleks (discussed above) and the fact that the ending leaves a few interesting strands of the plot loose. Those flaws aside Day Of The Daleks has one of the finest scripts of the Pertwee era.

With adequate performances from the leads, a nice supporting cast, poor Dalek usage, an overly loud score, slow pacing and uninspired direction plus well used Ogrons, well designed/lit sets and one of the best scripts of the Pertwee era we return to the question at the start of this review. So went the day well? The answer is yes, but it should have been better.",1308787200,4,4667,4.670316301703163
377507,5,6301801652,"This is hands down one of my favorite stories from the classic series.

This is one of the best Jon Pertwee episodes, easily one of the best Dalek episodes (with or without Davros... He is not in this one) and one the best Overall Doctor Who episodes (of any Doctor) ever made. Louis Marks script is so smartly written and paced that you never lose interest. The story takes place over two different time zones in Earth's history: Present day on the verge of World War 3 and 200 years in the future where the Daleks have enslaved humanity. Marks ""Time Paradox"" concept is mind blowing/boggling and will keep you thinking long after the final credits roll.  Pertwee has completely mastered the lead role by this point and the Doctor/Companion relationship with Jo Grant is brilliant. This was the first time the Daleks ever appeared in color (on TV that is) and it did not disappoint then nor will it almost 40 years later. Be sure to watch for The Ogrons who are the servants/henchman for the Daleks in future and past. They are one of the best aliens ever created for the program. Their costumes, mannerisms and dialect make them completely believable as aliens (Petwee himself admitted in several interviews that they were the best alien he preformed with/against). In short if you ever wonder why the Jon Pertwee and Tom Baker Era are considered the ""Golden Age"" of Doctor Who than this episode is exhibit A (or B, C  and D)......Are you still reading this review? Stop immediately and pre-order this episode.
Enjoy the Show!!!",1306540800,9,1570,4.684782608695652

A great story that is both thought-provoking and action-packed. Highly recommended!",1267747200,2,248,5.073170731707317

377511,3,6301801652,"Like a lot of the 1972 pertwee stuff this was flat and had a lot of extra scenes of running around and Pertwee action which was lame and snoozer boring.  The Three-wheeler(3-wheeled motorcycle called a ""rover"" in Europe I think) was not a novel Idea and not inovative or high tech with the added sound effects(a mini moog or some such.)  Yet you see it a lot and Pertwee and Manning straddled to it(Mister Rogers Nieghborhood style nudge nudge) the running around and dodging bullets gets boring after the first few episodes.  Personally I liked the first Pertwee season(1970) 71 being second on my list for quality. The others were just filler crap.  But if you like the James Bond style DW it is better than the current excuse for Who???",1125360000,,739,4.6183206106870225
377512,5,6301801652,"Here is one of the top doctors (in my opinion) - Jon Pertwee - in his spendid mixture of impishness, imperiousness, seriousness and all at a slight remove from direct involvement in the ongoing situation. And with a very vivid script for Jo Grant, as well! This episode combines a number of real-life preoccupations with an invasion by Daleks allied with humans while subjugating humans. The good points are just packed in and make this a prize among Doctor episodes. And watch for a classic comment from the Brigadier ""...all of them!""",1118275200,11,536,4.836956521739131
377513,4,6301801652,"Nice tight story this without much of the waste that characterised a number of the Pertwee third Doctor Stories.
I like this adventure quite a bit despite the obvious shortcomings. It begins with a mysterious military figure disappearing into the night and scaring the wits out of our fearless diplomat. UNIT gets involved due to the impending demise of the peace conference but the Doctor does not want to know despite his affected noncholant view of politicians.
Soon he and Joe are caught up in an inter-temporal assassination attempt with the diplomat Styles attaining notoriety as the harbringer of a nuclear holocaust where the reality is quite different. The slimy, smooth canniving controller in the future dupes Joe into providing information which he then passes on to his Dalek masters.
There are some digs here too. The slave population of the future are housed in tower blocks which is a very nice touch considering the social problems they were to be held responsible for in the ensuing years. The off the cuff remark made by the Doctor too about the well stocked larders of the political class uis well made as is his use of the same.
The temporal paradox causes a bit of confusion but not half as much as the Dalex ownership of a method of time travel again.
On the whole though there are some redeeming features notably the controller's recantation of his help to the Daleks. It moves along well and keeps the attention. One of the better adventures.",1034121600,2,1467,4.8023715415019765
377514,4,6301801652,"Five years after the fall of the Daleks on Skaro in Evil Of The Daleks, the Daleks reappeared on the small screen in Day Of The Daleks, which was also their third time in colour, counting the two Aaru films.
The international situation from The Mind Of Evil has gotten worse, to the brink of World War III. However, Sir Reginald Styles, vain to the point of arrogance, is the last hope in reconciling the Russians with the Chinese. While working late one night, a guerrilla from the future tries to kill him, and that's what draws UNIT in. The man is later attacked by a brutish Ogron, one of many ape-like humanoid servants who are ""as loyal as they are stupid."" A trio of other guerrillas try to succeed where their comrade has failed, and capture Jo and the Doctor, who have spent the night at Styles' place. Of these, Anat, the leader, while sharing the fanaticism of her comrades, is civilized. When Boaz, who looks a bit like Tony Curtis, tries to shoot Jo and the Doctor, she says, ""We're soldiers, not murderers.""
Jo Grant is wearing what I consider a classic Jo Grant outfit--plaid red and blue blouse, red tie, denim skirt, and white go-go boots. As this was the first story of the ninth season, maybe Katy Manning had a few weeks on the beach in the interim. She appears tanner here and more radiant as a result. It also extends to her good charity when sneaking Sgt Benton some wine and cheese.
The Doctor is seen as quite a gourmet, as he helps himself to Sir Reginald's Gorgonzolla cheese and a red wine which he describes as ""good humoured... a touch sardonic, not cynical. A most civilized wine.""
Although not specifically stated, the Controller's monotone female staff may be a vast improvement on the Robotization process (Dalek Invasion Of Earth).
The notable guest star here is Aubrey Woods (the Controller), who played the goldsmith in The Abominable Dr. Phibes but is probably best known as the candy store owner Bill in Willy Wonka. His defense to the Daleks that ""for every guerrilla cell that's destroyed, another takes its place"" reminds me of what Israel faced in the 1980's against the Palestinians.
One goof in Episode 1 is where the Gold Dalek talks slower, enunciating each syllable. Fortunately it gets better in the remaining episodes--maybe he hadn't taken his Dalek pep pills then. BTW, one Dalek speaks in a lower register (not a goof) while the others are more shrill. Maybe he sings bass in the Dalek choir.
Another is the guerrilla Shura putting his gun down and trying to contact headquarters. When an Ogron jumps him, his gun is back in his holster.
A third is the Doctor and Jo seeing their future selves while the Doctor is fiddling with the TARDIS. Hopefully, the ending would have had them seeing their past (when they were fixing the TARDIS.) It is included in the novelization, but I guess there were time constraints.
A classic Daleks story, and the first of three Dalek encounters by the Third Doctor. UNIT maintains its credibility as an effective fighting force, and Jo Grant has never been any prettier than here. Be sure and tell your friends if you like this video, and don't forget to tell it to the marines.",1016582400,7,3163,4.65
377515,2,6301801652,"An incredibly ambitious and overrated story that suffers from the inclusion of the Daleks themselves. Had the Daleks NOT been included, and the production team just invented a new alien/monster and/or villian, it  might have been more of a success. The main cast is just fine, with a  little UNIT humor thrown in for good measure, ""Rank has its  priveledges..."" The Controller isn't too bad, but why does he and his  girl assistants have an unhuman glow on their faces? Certainly can't be  from stress. And then the Daleks. These Daleks are probably the worst in  the entire series, with the most aggravating voices, the silliest staging,  and the most pathetic line of formation when they attack Aubrey House.  Believe it or not, the Ogrons are better realised in this story than the  Daleks. Incredibly disappointing, though it's not without merit, ""The  Day of the Daleks"" is only infamous for nostalgiac reasons.",959040000,7,916,4.967105263157895
