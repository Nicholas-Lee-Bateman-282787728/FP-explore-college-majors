8382324,5,B002VPVDJY,A huge success story in the 1970s in the UK on BBC2-Love it,1413676800,,59,3.6153846153846154
8382325,5,B002VPVDJY,"The Lotus Eaters was originally screened on BBC2 and then BBC1 in the UK and for me represents the very best of British television. The back drop is a bar owned by a couple who are British 'Expats' on the Island of Crete. This first season introduces a whole host of well-known British actors, of the time, starring in a series of vignettes, where each episode is given over to their narrative - there are a total nine stories in each self-contained episode.

The quality of each of the productions is top notch. Ian Hendry as Erik Shepherd is at his best here, maybe because the screen character is an alcoholic, and this problem was one he had in real life. Actress Wanda Ventham as his wife Ann - she is superb in role, as she copes with her husband's drinking and other indiscretions. There is also a good supportive cast, but for me Police Chief Krasakis played by Stefan Gryff really excels in his role.

This is excellent drama regardless of which decade it's seen in.

Yes the transfer from film to DVD leaves a lot to be desired.
Could there have been more in terms of extras? Yes there should be.

Never the less this is British drama television at its very best.",1406764800,,1173,4.441860465116279

SOME OF THE MINOR ACTORS WERE POOR BUT HENDRY AND VENTHAM WERE EXCELLENT",1388275200,,144,4.576923076923077
8382328,5,B002VPVDJY,"A very well done British Drama from the 1970s, first shown by the BBC. A very atmospheric series, this is Series one, and is longer in length then series two. The quality of the production is top notch.
This series one was more about other characters associated with the Tavern. In series two the plot concentrates on the owners, and the espionage plot line comes to the forefront. Excellent drama regardless of which decade it's seen in. Yes the transfer from film to DVD leaves a lot to be desired.please do not this put you off. Could there have been more in terms of extras? Yes there should be. I would strongly recommend both series one and two, real quality.",1347408000,3,665,4.55
