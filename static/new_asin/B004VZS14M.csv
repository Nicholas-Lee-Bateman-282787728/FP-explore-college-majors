A dialogue-based piece, this movie truly challenges viewers to think about our own beliefs about difficult topics such as God, sexuality, politics, and prejudice.  The soundtrack is incredible and the actors/actresses are both believable and likeable!  You really become attached to them during the 1.5-hour movie, and want things to work out for each of them!  This would be a great movie for a hangout night with a bunch of friends; and, it is also great for watching repeatedly as you can see and think about something a little different every time you watch the film.  To top it off, the writer has a great sense of humor and the movie and characters still have me laughing out loud numerous every time I watch the movie.  I highly recommend ""I'm Just Saying""!",1302393600,,858,4.842465753424658
