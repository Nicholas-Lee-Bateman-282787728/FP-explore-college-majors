4509399,5,B004ZKKL0U,"I saw the DVD and was not disappointed, it was very funny from the beginning to the end. I encourage you to buy it.",1348617600,,115,3.8333333333333335
4509400,4,B004ZKKL0U,"I admit I had to laugh during Deray's stand-up routine, but I didn't find his humor over powering. He starts his routine out with discussing rappers in jail. He switches to homeless people then Tiger Woods. From Woods it is an easy jump to discuss relationships and the differences between the sexes.

The audience was howling at his jokes.

4509401,5,B004ZKKL0U,This dude is off tha chain. Funny till tha end. You won't be disappointed. Had me rolling through the whole stand up. He is telling the truth and dropping knowledge at the same time,1334275200,,181,4.352941176470588
4509402,5,B004ZKKL0U,I could not stop laughing! Love it! You should really add it your comedy collection. DeRay Davis is great! Kuddos,1332547200,,113,4.7
4509403,5,B004ZKKL0U,I saw a little bit of this stand up on Showtime one evening and knew from that point on that I had to find me a copy of it. It is impossible to find in the stores so I ordered online. His style of funny is similar too many comedians out now. He uses jokes pertaining real female problems and everyday relationship problems and makes the problems hilarious. A person who has those problems would find them hilarious. I believe that he hits the females perspective well. I have probably watched it a total of 10 times within 2 weeks. It's worth the money. I can guarantee that.,1327017600,,575,4.333333333333333
4509404,5,B004ZKKL0U,"Being a native of Chicago I had to see Deray's standup.  I remembered him on college circuits when he first started out and he was funny then.  But, he's even funnier now. I have to say he is a natural fool in this, sooooo funny and was sooooo worth the money spent.  I would recommend this DVD to everyone especially people from the Chi.  Sure the content is racy and the language explicit but, most of the topics he talks about will resignate with the viewer.",1324080000,,461,4.325581395348837
4509405,4,B004ZKKL0U,"This DVD is hilarious. If you're a DeRay Davis fan he will definitely keep you laughing.
If you like raw, uncut humor.... this is a DVD you'll enjoy.",1321833600,,149,4.357142857142857
4509406,5,B004ZKKL0U,"I stumbled upon this stand up on a boring Saturday while flipping through Showtime on Demand. June had been a pretty rough month and July wasn't getting better.  I was thinking I was going to get a little comic relief while watching it and I was wrong!!! This standup had me literally crying laughing.  I hadnt noticed it had been so long since I smiled, it made me appreciate life a lot more and taught me to remember to smile even through diversity. Not to mention, Deray is just a fool!!! #SALTS",1317427200,3,498,4.4021739130434785
4509407,5,B004ZKKL0U,"I LOVE Deray Davis. I hadn't heard of him until this summer, when I saw Power Play on Showtime. (it's no longer available there). I have a particular taste when it comes to comedy, and although I like a good many comics, I hadn't found any I *LOVE* in recent years, until Deray. (I also just discovered Bill Burr, who I now love, but that's a different story).

I have watched Power Play four times, and showed it on two separate occasions to my brother, and then to my friends, who also all loved it.

I googled for any other comedy shows he's been in, and he's been in a few as a 'one of many' guest. But he definitely deserved his own special!

I think I have to buy Power Play. If I've seen it this many times and love him more every time, I should just buy it. To quote from his own show... ""Deray got it crackin'!""",1312416000,5,820,4.1125

4509489,5,B004ZKKL0U,"Out of all the comedy shows I ever seen, ""Deray Davis Power Play"" is the most funniest I've ever seen. I can practically watch it over and over and laugh even more than the last time I watched it. My sisters and I loved watching it on cable because I recorded it on my DVR. Then when I found out it was on DVD I was extremely excited.",1359244800,,334,3.926470588235294

8450006,1,B004ZKKL0U,"I wanted to like this. I did. But much of this comedy is predictable and therefore not funny. It's even worse in the beginning of his ""How to be Black"" special.
