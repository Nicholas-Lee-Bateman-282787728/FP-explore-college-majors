8761741,5,B01FXMAYA0,Great anime!  We sat down for a couple of episodes and ended up watching the whole thing in only a couple sittings.  This is a great series!  Seller was also prompt and we received the blue ray exactly as expected,1514419200,,213,4.275
8761742,5,B01FXMAYA0,"The new version of the anime is excellent. It could be even better if all season 1 were in a single package, but it doesn't make less enjoyable watching the episodes. Amazing visual and high quality animation.",1500595200,,209,4.675675675675675
8761743,4,B01FXMAYA0,"There is only one reason I gave it four stars. The English dubbing is crap. No seriously, I cringed the entire time. Thankfully there is a Japanese option. If that was the only option, I would give it five no doubt. The animation is rather beautiful, but the story is what entices you. While the first episode may seem rather boring to some, it is imperative to the plot later when the young prince grows up and goes off to battle for the first time. True, most of Arslan's companions are Gary Stews, absolutely perfect, but it is Arslan's development that is most important, as he develops into a competent, kind, and most importantly, merciful leader and learns the games of politics. Any short comings Arslan has can be contributed to his age and lack of knowledge which he rectifies as the series goes on.

The storyline itself is your typical prince trying to regain his thrown story, but I feel Arslan does a good job making it fresh as battles aren't won by brute force (though you feel Daryun could possibly take an army by himself), but military strategy. I quite enjoyed this series and watched it multitudes of times. I do wish it was the complete series due to it's expensive price though.",1487376000,,1201,4.586046511627907
8761744,3,B01FXMAYA0,"I've been a huge fan of the OVA and novels, and now the manga and TV anime. The anime itself is fine, a faithful adaptation of the manga. My issue here is with Funimation's release. I was extremely disappointed that there was only a Japanese 2.0 version, whereas the English Dub (which you couldn't pay me to watch) is in 5.1. Very disappointing, especially as Blu Ray #2 only has a handful of episodes; they could have easily been spread out so that the two blu rays could accommodate the 5.1 version of both.",1473552000,6,510,4.4361702127659575
8761745,5,B01FXMAYA0,have not got to watch this as of yet but the manga is great,1473292800,,59,3.2857142857142856
8761746,2,B01FXMAYA0,"Based on great source material, this adaptation is very weak and does not do the story justice. The animation is terrible as well. It is unfortunate.",1469664000,,149,4.769230769230769
8761747,5,B01FXMAYA0,"The kingdom of Pars is a wealthy and powerful kingdom that sits in the middle of an important trade route. Arslan is the heir apparent, but he is young and untested, still struggling with the responsibility his rank entails. But his worth is tested when the mighty Parsian army falls to a invading Lustanin force and the entire kingdom falls into chaos. Arslan will have to learn his own worth if he is to succeed in standing against the invasion of his homeland.

I was really excited for this show and I was not at all disappointed. Arslan is a great character, who starts out likable, though naive, and grows into a  still likable, but strong character. There is plenty of politics going on and though Arslan is a pretty smart kid, he learns the hard way that he still has much to learn about people.

The supporting character don't get as much attention, but they are all interesting and most get growth of their own. I was especially pleased with Daryun (the strong warrior character). Based on his character type, I wasn't expecting much from him, but he surprised me and I ended up liking him a lot.

The first season (of which this set is part one, containing episodes 1-13 out of 25) only covers part of this story. The anime is based on a series of light novels by Yoshiki Tanaka, who also did Legend of the Galactic Heroes (epic sci-fi series) and Tytania (also sci-fi, but never finished), with the character design done by Hiromu Arakawa (the author of Fullmetal Alchemist). The second season is due to start airing July, 2016, but it will only be 8 episodes :(

Still, this is a really interesting and well done series, so I consider it worth watching despite its unfinished ending. In fact, I liked it so much I would gladly watch it again. And I will.",1466380800,9,1767,4.5266457680250785
