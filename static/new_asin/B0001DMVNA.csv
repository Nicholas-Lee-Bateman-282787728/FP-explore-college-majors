8011021,5,B0001DMVNA,it's a pearl. the feeling of abandonment and powerless is poignant and intense as it is the stubborn optimism of the mother. it strikes close for some of us.,1398124800,,157,4.448275862068965
8011022,2,B0001DMVNA,"This movie reminded me of nothing so much as the old ""after school specials"", dramatic presentations of various situations: bullying, divorce, learning disabilities, etc. Just with more cussing.

In this case, Tessa is the daughter of Christine, a single mom with a boyfriend who has just lost his job. Before long, the boyfriend grabs his stuff (I assume it was his stuff) and takes off, leaving Christine to pay the rent on her cashier job at the local grocery. They are already months behind, and soon enough are evicted.

The main issue here is that there's not really much in the way of new presentation of the story. The script hits all the classic ""down and out"" notes: indifferent (and later, lecherous) landlord, bad job, teen facing the haves/have-nots dilemma, complete with fabricated life for her friends' benefit, later to be found out, and more...finishing up with the expected ""it's hard but we'll get through it"" moral. If something bad could happen to these two, it probably will during the course of the movie.

The acting wasn't all bad; Tessa and Christine are played particularly well. But in today's society where we have all too many people in situations like these, and if you're not one of them, you have a good chance of meeting or knowing one, having a movie show us the same situation without offering any sort of fresh look at it, it's just not that compelling.",1397088000,,1391,4.7875

you should check them all out",1392422400,,105,3.5652173913043477
8011024,4,B0001DMVNA,"Very good acting by the young actress. Nice handheld camera footage for its time.
The last part of the movie proceeds in a rather uncomfortable direction.",1391472000,,154,4.961538461538462
8011025,5,B0001DMVNA,"This is one of the most realistic stories I've seen. I rate this movie as a five, in spite of the poor quality of filming.  The fact is that there are tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of people in very similar situations in this sad condition. The scary part is that when someone gets that low, usually drugs, alcohol, and prostitution are the usual coping choices. However there is real hope to be found in Jesus Christ. There is also hope in family and many organizations which help women and children. I would have really liked to have seen that kind of hope in this movie. Granted most people don't want to turn to hope in Christ, if they must give up control. This is my personal opinion; I counsel people everyday who have similar problems. With Christ all things are possible.",1372982400,2,798,4.503448275862069
8011026,5,B0001DMVNA,"I watch a lot of movies, and appreciate the process and work involved in making them, even when they are done on a shoestring budget. This film definitely falls into the category of so low budget it's on a home-movie level, as far as actual film/video quality is concerned. However, the writing, the directing, and the acting are simply superb. In fact, because of the way in which this film was shot, it actually seemed to bring the viewer closer to the action, as if we were the ones shooting the footage as we eavesdropped on the lives of the mother and the daughter as they struggled with abandonment, homelessness, and pride while they attempt to pick themselves up by the bootstraps and get their lives back on track. There was so much truth in this story. No 1-dimensional characters, but fully-fleshed-out real to life characters that the viewer never once would think: ""Oh, come on! This is so not believable!""  The way the story juxtaposes the wealth and snobbery of the more affluent friends, coworkers, and various other San Diego residents against the turbulent and often scary situation that the two protagonists are facing makes for great tension throughout the film. I recommend it to those who like indie films and are forgiving of low budget video. The story is complete, it has a beginning, a middle, and, most importantly, an end (as so many current indies have decided NOT to do). It's also a real piece of fiction, as opposed to the pseudo autobiographical indies of 20-something film-maker-wannabes that seem to have filled up the Amazon Prime and Netflix streaming lists lately which have just enough plot for about 20 minutes of story, but spend the rest of the time forcing us to watch people wander in the woods ""thinking"" or driving down the road ""thinking"", or listen while the ""friends"" say such 'hilarious' things, but that don't move the plot forward (so I think, ""okay, this writer's friend said this in real life, they all thought it was a laugh-riot, so they just HAD to find a place for it in their movie""). Bottom line: First, Last, Deposit is worth a look.",1361145600,5,2094,4.736986301369863
8011027,1,B0001DMVNA,"do not waste your money. horrible quality. low grade, poor story line. bad acting. should not have paid for this cheap.",1357257600,,119,4.714285714285714
8011028,4,B0001DMVNA,"Excellent story, very strong cast, and well written to the point where you are able to develop an empathetic connection to the characters.

Sidenote: ""Skater kid 1"" should receive an Academy Award.",1329091200,,197,5.15625
8011029,5,B0001DMVNA,"it is really refreshing to see a film centred around the lower class that doesn't linger on familiar themes like substance abuse and prostitution.  this film holds strongly onto the bond between mother and daughter, and fiercely defends their dignity, though they encounter some challenging economic and social problems.

the genuine performances, the style of photography and the perfect casting choices contribute to this astonishing piece of cinema. watching this film, one desperately wants a glimmer of good luck for the main characters. the conclusion isn't neat and tidy, and doesn't make for a happy ending, but most of the time that is a more realistic portrayal of life, then, isn't it?",1165104000,4,696,5.205357142857143
