1. ONLY 1 SECOND OF DINOSAURS!

2. TOO LONG!

3.1 WORD...... BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

4. WASTE OF MONEY!!

DON'T BUY THIS UNLESS YOU ARE A BIG FAN OF EYEWITNESS!",1117929600,,218,4.944444444444445
7863278,3,6304165277,"This Eyewitness video, like the couple others we have viewed with our preschoolers, is interesting for us adults, but not at all entertaining enough for young children.  Too much talking!  Not enough action!  <G>
The cover shows a wooly mammoth, but I don't remember seeing a mammoth in the video, unless I was distracted by one of the kids at just that moment.  I guess when I think of prehistoric times I think of cave men and sabre tooth tigers and wooly mammoths, not the beginnings of the earth.  This video covers the whole of prehistory, all 4.5 billion years of it, in 1/2 hour.  So not much time is devoted to the subjects we are familiar with or that kids are interested in.  A lot of time is spent on the ""primordial soup"" stage ...And the entire dinosaur age is covered in about 10 seconds, showing just 1 of the many species.  But I do recommend the video to more mature audiences who are interested in a brief overview of the developments during those 4.5 billion years.",1044230400,3,984,4.48876404494382
