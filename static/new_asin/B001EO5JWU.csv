8299028,5,B001EO5JWU,"The second in the NATKD set of Arnis DVD's these focus on the Baton, Whip and Knife. The techniques are once again presented in clear terms allowing the viewer to understand and practice them. Again this DVD is aimed at both the novice who would like to simply see the techniques, and the more experienced martial arts enthusiast who has already mastered the body mechanics and wants to see techniques with enough detail to integrate them into their current set of skills. Anyone interested in Arnis, Escrima or Kali should have this DVD and the first in the series as well.",1224547200,,574,4.693069306930693
8299029,5,B001EO5JWU,"I have attended North Austin Tae Kwon Do Seminars that have featured Mr. Valdez, and his mastery of whips, knives, escrima and hand-to-hand techniques are mesmerizing and informative.  Aside from the self defense value these techniques provide, Mr. Valdez provides detailed instruction on how to best utilize these techniques for both offensive and defensive use.  You will not likely find this quality of instruction anywhere else.",1223856000,2,432,5.53030303030303

I'd recommend this DVD to any stylist who wants to learn more about Joint Locks, Chokes, Knives and other weapons. Hard style TKD and Karate stylists will be able derive many techniques to add to their self-defense curricula.",1223856000,,334,4.87719298245614
