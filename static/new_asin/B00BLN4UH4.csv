8570482,5,B00BLN4UH4,"The documentary portion is about 45 minutes and is a great chronicle of Benson Henderson's career.  The fights are great as well and what makes this dvd worth buying.  The fights and my rating out of 5 stars for each fight are

Disc 1:
  - Ben Henderson vs. Anthony Njokuani, 4/5
  - Ben Henderson vs. Shane Roller, 4/5
  - Ben Henderson vs. Donald Cerrone, 5/5

  - Ben Henderson vs Frankie Edgar, 5/5
  - Ben Henderson vs Frankie Edgar II, 5/5
  - Ben Henderson vs Nate Diaz, 4/5

Overall, a great set from the UFC.  Also, my 5 star rating has to do with the shipping, as I get it a day earlier then expected, pretty much the day after I ordered it (I ordered it on a Saturday night around midnight and got it the next Monday around 1).  Great DVD, and I highly recommend it to any hardcore/casual UFC fan.",1387756800,,1060,4.255102040816326
8570483,5,B00BLN4UH4,Comes in a two-disc set . 'Benson Henderson: Rising Up' beautifully showcases Henderson's successful career from when he fought in the WEC to the present UFC,1371254400,,157,5.076923076923077
8570484,4,B00BLN4UH4,"Putting the full fight library of Benson Henderson's WEC/UFC fights on the special features was a masterful stroke, and to be honest, what me and my friends enjoyed watching a lot more than the documentary itself (admittedly we're all pretty big fight fans).

The biggest weakness of the main doco is that Bendo himself isn't the most interesting dude. Sure, he trains inredibly hard and (especially now that I've watched all his old fights) he's certainly an incredibly skilled fighter, but a good Christian boy who loves his mum and teaches taekwondo to kids isn't exactly the makings of an earth shattering narrative.

I can't honestly recommend this dvd to anyone who isn't a big fight fan, but Bendo's technical, flashy style (particularly in early WEC) and the fact that they've been kind enough to include his full fight library made this enjoyable enough for me. Here's hoping for an Aldo edition...",1370390400,,907,4.9605263157894735
8570485,5,B00BLN4UH4,"I'll be honest, I'm a bit surprised that Benson Henderson is getting a documentary DVD already. Typically these sets are saved for fighters who have had a lengthy career in the UFC, such as Matt Hughes and Forrest Griffin.  While I believe this set may be early (especially given how the lightweight division is the one weight class in the UFC that has the highest turnover rate of champions) it is a very good set.  If you've been following Henderson since his time in the WEC you know that given the right opponent he's easily one of the most exciting fighters to look out for.  The best example would be his fight with Donald Cerrone from WEC 43, which was voted as fight of year and is easily one of my favorite fights ever. His style just seems to mesh well with a fighter more often than not.  That has been proven many times in the UFC as well.  All you have to do is look at his fights with Jim Miller, Clay Guida, and Frankie Edgar (the first fight).  Once you've watched these fights it becomes easier to see why the UFC would wanna push for a set involving Benson Henderson.

The documentary portion of the set is only about an hour long.  It's not bad and was reminiscent of Forrest Griffin's.  I guess the only thing I didn't like (which is a personal preference) was that the documentary lacked any in depth discussion regarding some of Henderson's more pivotal fights in the WEC, specifically the Cerrone fight from WEC 43 and his title capturing effort over Jamie Varner.  Of course, the Pettis fight from WEC 53 is mentioned and given some focus but it is the only fight from Henderson's WEC career given any worthy mention.

The first disc, along with the documentary includes all of Henderson's WEC fights which include:

WEC 38: vs. Anthony Njokuani
WEC 40: vs. ShaneRoller
WEC 43: vs. Donald Cerrone I
WEC 46: vs. Jamie Varner
WEC 48: vs. Donald Cerrone II
WEC 53: vs. Anthony Pettis

The second disc contains all of his UFC fights (with the exception of his title defense against Gilbert Melendez, which was only a month ago, way past production wrap up):

UFC 129: vs. Mark Bocek
UFC Live: Hardy vs. Lytle: vs. Jim Miller
UFC on FOX: vs. Clay Guida
UFC 144: vs. Frankie Edgar I
UFC 150: vs. Frankie Edgar II
UFC on FOX: vs. Nate Diaz

Again, it seemed like an early choice but as far as fight quality goes you're not likely to find a better set of fights than here.  I'd say that this set comes highly recommended, and even if you're a casual fan these are the kind of fights you could put on boring afternoon and end up getting fired up over.",1368489600,8,2566,4.416135881104034
