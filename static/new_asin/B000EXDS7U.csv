8199881,5,B000EXDS7U,"Deke Dickerson deserves some kind of award for doing this DVD which is a labor of love if there ever was one.  For those of you who have never heard of Deke, in addition to be a talented guitar player and one of the world's nicest guys, he is a dedicated musical historian with a special interest in Southern California based guitar players of the 1950's - 1960's.  For several years now, he has been hosting a ""Guitar Festival"" which features both original artists that are still alive and younger tribute acts which play near ""note perfect"" versions of the music from that period.  This DVD is from the 2005 festival.  Although there are at least 2 cameras, this is not a big budget production, but what it may lack there it makes up for it in the quality of the performances. When you are looking for something different and are tired of ""corporate"" slick music DVD's without soul, then check this out and it may open up a whole new world for you.

Its great to see inventor Dave Bunker play his dual neck touch guitar.  Del Casher was pretty much unknown to me, but he is a great Les Paul style player.  Jeremy Wakefield is a younger and amazing talent and it was great to hear someone try to pull off Jimmy Bryant - Speedy West material (not an easy thing to do, trust me).  Brian Lonebck, who I have never heard of before, absolutely channels the great Joe Maphis and NAILS it with tone so authentic its scary (and once again, that is hard to do as Joe Maphis played about as fast as the speed of light). T.K. Smith and Big Sandy are great.  The tribute band Ventersmania are fun and when they are joined by the real deal, Ventures lead guitarist Nokie Edwards, you can tell they are having so much fun they could explode.  Then the legend Dick Dale then plays a great (and probably VERY LOUD) set and then Deke closes the show.

I just love stuff like this.  If you are a fan of electric guitar, you need to own this DVD and you need to support Deke Dickerson, who is a national teasure.
