4465843,2,B004TJWDJY,"They did try for a good and deep plot, I'll give them credit for that. And the origins of the box as explained did make sense. The idea of finishing Pinhead off was imaginative and well-done. The cast they chose were well-acted. There was gore, some creative kills, dark lighting (and blues depending on the century), effective settings, sex and nudity, attractive leads, and Pinhead with his book of quotes tagging along. So what was the problem here?

 For one thing they carried on the error from Hell on Earth. Pinhead gets the limelight when he shows up. He isn't in the first half of the movie until later on but once he's there he dominates the show. He has his creative wording, his laugh lasting a bit too long and at inappropriate moments, as well as overdramatizing everything. Some of the ploys in dialogue were obvious. For example -- when the two guards are there with the confrontation it's apparent that they were given one dialogue sentence that made NO SENSE in order for Pinhead to have the opportunity to begin spewing off at the mouth. They threatened him with, ""Don't make us put some pain in you."" Now have you ever heard someone say that when threatening to shoot? Does this make any sense at all? And of course then Pinhead goes off and says ""How dare you speak to me off pain? Look at my face! Gentlemen, I AM PAIN!"" Ooh, when he speaks they have foggy smokey stuff coming out of his mouth at the same time and a close up of his face.

 His temper is also pretty trigger happy here. (Like part 3) Where this sudden rage comes from I have no idea. Although it is fun to see him get really pissed and blow his top -- Doug Bradley acts the scenes very well but there is just no reason for Pinhead to get so mad so fast at some of these moments. Its obvious they cause him to get mad just because they think the audience likes to see his pins steam a little. Here he was in the ""present"" century wanting something from the merchant, and over one stupid error he kills him right off. Tsk, tsk.

 But Pinhead isn't the only star present. We now have Angelique, a sort of ""princess"" from hell - or at least that is a pet name from Pinhead for you. She was animated in the skin of another woman through magic and now has brought sex appeal to a whole nother level. Personally I didn't find her that attractive but many men did. Ah well no matter to me. She does her part well but her scenes with Pinhead when the two are collaborating are kind of corny and dramatic.

 The ""making"" of the twins was just brutal. I didn't particularly enjoy it. Another good death was the mirror death but it's just not the same thing. Something's missing from it in the terms of violence.

 What they did in terms of plot was begin in the future. In space, on a spaceship. The lead man (who is trying to destroy Pinhead) is captured and begins to tell his story. We then go back to the past century where the box was created and Angelique was formed, ect. Then it skips to the future briefly, and then the present, and then the future, and then the future AGAIN (during the same night) for when he was captured. And now we are finally in the present moment again. While this isn't that hard to follow if you add in everything else it can get semi tricky at times, and your brain just isn't in the mood to attempt to keep facts together.

 A really cool addition was a cenobite dog! Yes, you heard me, but it's not as ridiculous as it sounds. They went all out and the dog is cool as hell and menacing to boot. He isn't always there but when he is effective. In a way he brought back some nostalgia when he chomped his teeth together, reminding me of the lovely sound Chatterer used to make in the first two. Ahhh memories :)

 The lighting in this movie is kind of dark, especially in the past centuries. It's almost foggy at some parts.

 The movies very ending was great. The way he was killed and the cleverness of it all was satisfactory. Unfortunately the director did not agree. When he saw the final of this film he used the Hollywood scapegoat pseudonym Alan Smithee and signed off.",1379635200,,4091,4.321148825065274

4465848,3,B004TJWDJY,"At the end of HELLRAISER III: Hell on Earth, Joey Summerskill finds herself at a construction site where she immerses the puzzle box into a slab of wet concrete, sealing it off from ever being used and causing harm to anyone ever again. The final shot of that movie shows the building that was subsequently constructed on that site is decorated with artwork and designs influenced by the designs on the box. It's an ominous final shot, and one that pays off in the next sequel, 1996's HELLRAISER: Bloodline. And that's not all the fourth movie in the series revealed.

There are three stories at work in this movie, past, present and future, with the earliest story set in the 1700s and showing the construction of the box by toymaker Phillip L'Merchant as a work-for-hire project by the rich and depraved Duc de L'Isle. The old man is using the box to summon a demon whom he then plans to control for his own purposes, but when L'Merchant discovers what the box's true purpose was, he plans to steal it back and construct another devise that will destroy the demons. When he returns to de L'Ilse's house, however, he finds the old man murdered by the demon he'd summoned, Angelique, who is now under the command of de L'Ilse's servant, Jacques (played by Adam Scott, yes the one from STEP BROTHERS and ""Parks and Recreation""). L'Merchant is killed by Angelique as well, but before he dies he tells his wife to save their baby, with whom she is pregnant.

Cut to 200 years later, New York City in 1996, and famous architect John Merchant is celebrating the construction of his latest skyscraper--which brings us back to the building seen at the end of HELLRAISER III. In the present day story, Angelique is still alive and kicking in Paris when she sees an architecture magazine with John Merchant on the cover. Recognizing the bloodline of the toymaker L'Merchant, she comes to America to seduce him in order to get what she wants, a permanent gateway between Hell and Earth. Once in NY she finds the puzzle box locked in a concrete pillar in the basement of the building, then uses it to summon ""Pinhead"". The cenobite priest tells the demonness that temptation is not nearly as powerful a tool as terror and that he'll gain Merchant's cooperation by kidnapping the architect's wife and son. However the device Merchant is working on, and the one he unleashes upon Angelique and Pinhead is not one to open Hell's gateway forever, but rather one to destroy them. He doesn't destroy them, but he does manage to lock them back into the box, but not before having his head lopped off.

And now we're on the space station, which is where the movie opened (the past and present sequences are shown as flashbacks as Dr. Paul Merchant relates the events of the box and its occupants to a space marine who has come aboard the space station Merchant designed and hijacked to arrest him) and the latest in the Merchant family line is doing the thing his family had set out to do centuries before. By constructing a machine of perpetual light, Merchant has constructed a device that uses lasers and mirrors to keep the light going forever, somehow destroying Pinhead and his other cenobites. How this works is never really explained, but it was 1996 and it was Hellraiser so that was apparently all they needed.

When I first started seeing advertisements for HELLRAISER: Bloodline on the back of my monthly comics in 1996 I was pretty excited. Horror, Clive Barker, lemme at it. Granted, HELLRAISER III had left me under whelmed, but so did A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 2, and I still went to the theater for part 3. And when I learned the fourth Hellraiser movie would go into the creation of the box, I was even more excited. This sounded like an awesome movie. The execution however was not so much. I have three words for where HELLRAISER: Bloodline truly went wrong--in my opinion: Pinhead IN SPACE!!!!!

There's just something so incongruous and wrong about a creature as black and . . . industrial (let's face it, if Nine Inch Nails music came to life, it would look like Pinhead) being in space. One of these things is not like the other, you know? However, this is not the film's only flaw. It's a big one, in my opinion, yes, but far from the only.

The film itself is cobbled together from pieces of a much larger script that, so I have read, answered all the questions it asked. I've read that there is a 110-minute version out there somewhere, while the one I saw was only 84 minutes. I am very curious as to what I was missing. I know the original director, Kevin Yagher, was so disappointed with the studio cut of the film that he took his name off it and instead used the pseudonym Allan Smithee. While I only recently discovered this, I always knew there was something missing about this movie. The first act, in the past, definitely feels shortened--hacked to death, in fact--while the present story comes and goes like just another typical Hellraiser story, with little fanfare and even less sense of danger. One thing that made the first two movies so effective was, as bad as the acting and effects were, they still exuded danger, like juggling knives. This one is just a series of bad 1996 hairdos and clothing choices--all regrettable--wrapped up in a Hellraiser package and then drained of all hint of the sinister.

HELLRAISER: Bloodline was the last of the series to earn a theatrical release, and rightfully so. I think a lot of moviegoers back then felt the same way I did about Pinhead IN SPACE and word of mouth kept the casual viewers away. HELLRAISER: Bloodline was not a good movie. Even if the story hadn't been IN SPACE, the production just looked so cheap it ruined the effect. And the characters...we're not shown enough of the individual stories to care about any of them. Adam Scott's character had huge potential (he is shown 200 years later, still alive and young and using Angelique as his slave--until she kills him 5 minutes later) while John Merchant's wife, played by Kim Meyers from the aforementioned A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 2, was practically a non-entity. She shows up in a few scenes and says some dialogue, then suddenly at the last minute manages to find an ounce of strength and tries, unsuccessfully, to turn that into something like screen presence. The other female co-lead, Rimmer, the space marine, is equally useless, while Angelique, the demonness who has been seeking the toymaker and his bloodline for centuries, is certainly an evil btch and probably has more screen time than anyone. Valentina Vargas does manage to take a thinly-written character and infuse some personality into it, but it's hardly enough to save this movie. And anyway, she's countered the whole time by Bruce Ramsey in all three Merchant roles, and that guy's got the baconey stench of Canada all over him. Not to mention some REALLY bad wigs.

I give HELLRAISER III credit for causing the series to take its first really bad nosedive, but I have to lay the blame of burying the series deep underground straight at the feet of HELLRAISER: Bloodline. If it had just been a lackluster puzzle box origin story, or a cheap and unsatisfying present day story, that would be one thing, or two things. But Pinhead IN SPACE. I just can't wrap my head around it nor can I find anything at all that justifies it. He doesn't belong there, the very idea is absurd. I'm sure back in 1996 the idea of space seemed like the obvious, logical choice--the Leprechaun would go there himself a year later, and Jason Vorhees would take his spacewalk 5 years after Pinhead--but I assure you, it was neither logical nor obvious and it didn't work. And I say this for all future generations as well, unless and until a huge chunk of the population is living on space stations, the only time it's ok to set your slasher movie in space is if that slasher didn't get his start on earth. In ALIEN it worked; the killer was an alien, from space. But for the Leprechaun, for Jason, and certainly for Pinhead who is from HELL, which is about as far from space as you can get, and it absolutely did not work. Next we'll see the Ghostface from SCREAM in space. Or rather, IN SPACE. And that's not gonna be good for anyone.",1343779200,8,8215,4.62962962962963
4465849,3,B004TJWDJY,"What's it about?

Spanning three generations, Hellraiser 4 follows the story of the Merchant family bloodline and the history of the puzzle box. From Phillip L'Merchant's humble beginnings as a 19th century toy maker whom creates the puzzle box unbeknownst it ends up in evil hands and the gateway to hell is open. Now in the year 2127; on board the space station `Minos', scientist Dr Merchant must succeed where his ancestors failed and close the gateway forever, to once and for all destroy Pinhead and his army of `Cenobites'.

Is it any good?

Pinhead in SPAAACE!, as bad as that sounds `Bloodline' isn't all that bad considering director Kevin Yagher abandoned the film due to some backstabbing at Dimension Films. Hence the reason it gets the `Alan Smithee' trademark, a name given to films that are disowned by their director. Unfortunately the mixed direction is obvious and disastrous, giving it a made for TV kind of feel in certain scenes. `Bloodline' delivers best during the 19th century scenes, staying true to the original with gothic resonance, the 20th century scenes deliver some substance while the future space stuff is great fun with some nice effects. The acting is mostly good; bug-eyed Bruce Ramsay is overly dramatic at times but delivers as all three Merchants. Doug Bradley's Pinhead shows his usual brilliance, fans (like me) will enjoy his dark dialogue and cold demeaner. If you like gore, sado-masochism and plenty of Pinhead, then `Bloodline' is for you.

Best bit?

Pinhead's pet Hellhound with chattering teeth gives the film added bark!

If you love the Hellraiser series, definitely do watch this. If some of the goofiness of the second movie put you off your Pinhead, rest assured that this movie actually plays it relatively straight, even in the outer space scenes. One thing you shouldn't do is pick this one up without watching at least the first movie and probably the next couple as well.

4465867,3,B004TJWDJY,"A nice change of pace as the franchise reviews the past and future of the Puzzle Box in this anthology of sorts.  This franchise remains worthy through the fourth film, even if pale in comparison to the first two films.

Jason X (2001) took Jason Voorhees to space, as did Leprechaun 4: In Space (1996).  I think we can all agree these were bad, but fun and campy ideas.  Thankfully Pinhead's (Doug Bradley) legacy retains some value as this film actually rights its swervingly uncertain path in the wake of Hell on Earth (1992) and returns the franchise to a more worthy storyline than Pinhead on a killing spree or simply giving us ""Pinhead in Space.""  Yuck.  If you want Hell in space, you want Event Horizon (1997).  Period.

Entering the fourth installment of the franchise, Bloodline opens on a 22nd century space station where Dr. Paul Merchant (Bruce Ramsay; Alive, Continuum) uses what I can only describe as a 1990s Nintendo PowerGlove operating a robot to open the Puzzle Box.  A team of space marines manages detain him (after he opened the box), and he reveals that the Puzzle Box has been in his family for centuries and he must put an end to its lineage of terror.  As he explains, we are told of two past generations in his bloodline that possessed the very same infernal artifact.

I was most pleased with the very different approach in storytelling in this movie.  This film is essentially an anthology in which the space station story wraps around two other stories within, all three being of different time periods.

Merchant explains (in the first encapsulated story) that in the 18th century, his toymaker ancestor Phillip L'Merchant (also played by Bruce Ramsay) commissioned the Puzzle Box for a twisted cultist magician who, along with his young assistant (Adam Scott; Piranha 3D), used this device to summon a demon.  They skinned a young woman as a sacrifice such that the demon Angelique (Valentina Vargas; Faces in the Crowd) may inhabit her skin and walk the Earth.  Contrary to past Hellraiser canon, if you summon a demon you control that demon ""as long as you don't stand between the demon and Hell.""

Part 3 (Hell on Earth) ended with the Puzzle Box being dropped in wet cement, which was revealed to be the foundation of a business class skyscraper with the interior decorated with the famous Puzzle Box design all over the walls like modern art.  Accordingly our second encapsulated story advances Angelique and her master to present day (1996) as she senses the presence of the Puzzle Box and is drawn to America where another of Merchants ancestors has been inspired by the designs of the box.  She makes some temptations and summons Pinhead.  As usual, Pinhead wants the box.  Merchant successfully thwarts Pinhead, Angelique (now in Cenobite form) and their newly created Twin Cenobites but the box remains in the wake to threaten future generations.

I was pleased with the stories underlying all of the Hellraiser films so far.  Even though Hell on Earth felt too much like an action horror with some silly troped-up components, I remain pleased with it as it refrained from the all too often exploited cartoonishness of 90s horror.  It remained dire and creepy with a rich story leading up to the ""Pinhead action sequence.""  A major fault of Hell on Earth was the blatant over-exposition.  While this fault did not keep me from enjoying the movie, it is a bit frustrating nonetheless, and we find this fault here in Hellraiser IV.  Directly paralleling the degree of over-exposition is the drop in acting quality of these two movies.  I find the acting completely forgivable, mind you.  It's worst in the opening space station sequence and becomes more tolerable later on.

An interesting notion in this story is that the rules continue to change from film to film.  Or, if they haven't changed, then they're not being properly explained.  In 18th century Paris, he who summoned the demon controlled the demon.  I'll bet Hellraiser's Kirsty wished someone had told Pinhead that in 1987!  And, like in all the sequels, innocent people grow less safe with each movie.  In Hellbound the Channard Cenobite goes on a mental patient killing spree, in Hell on Earth Pinhead tries to kill EVERYONE, and now Pinhead continues to kill without reservation once summoned and converts Cenobites at will.  Back in the original Hellraiser, Pinhead couldn't touch anyone unless he at least believed that their ""desire"" was behind opening the box.  My, how times have changed with now a fourth director and set of writers for as many films.

Our story finally returns us to the space station where Pinhead now wanders.  The effects remain entertaining and gory. The Cenobites have a more traditional appearance again, except for the Cenobite dog (where did that thing come from; did Cujo open the Puzzle Box and go to Hell?) and the franchise mythology continues to expand our interest in the Puzzle Box.  In the end Pinhead is perhaps permanently deported to Hell in an interesting and clever story development involving the space station itself, which Merchant designed.  Lucky for us, this is about 200 years in the future.  So were good for as many sequels as they want to make until then.

Perhaps nothing in comparison to the first two films, I consider that this film (and part 3 as well) remains worthy for viewing pleasure.",1438300800,,5358,4.8428571428571425

And that is exactly why this stands as the second best ""Hellraiser"" movie next to the original for me.

It's 2127, and we see the sole human on a space station donning some VR gloves and with the help of an android opening the infamous puzzle box. Just as the box is opened, a group of space cops bust in and arrest him. The man tells the arresting officer that his is the last in a family line, a line that first created the puzzle box, and that it is up to him to stop the evil his family has brought to Earth. We flash back a couple hundred years to the French Renaissance and meet a toy maker who has been commissioned to build a puzzle box by a wealthy aristocrat. Using dark magic, the aristocrat and his assistant sacrifice a young woman, and summon a demon to possess her skin. We then flash ahead to 1996 and we see that the toy maker's descendant, a famous architect, is responsible for the building seen at the end of the third film, and that the demon summoned by the French aristocrat hopes to reunite with the family responsible for creating the puzzle box.

There are a ton of plot holes, and if you are looking for tightly written film, then keep moving. (There is a reason this film has a director's credit of Alan Smithee) And yes, there are some head-scratching moments sprinkled throughout this film as characters drop in and out with little to no reason, and we are never quite sure why some of the characters do what they do, but the film is never dull. It's got a mixed bag of production values, for instance the space station scenes are fantastic for a low budget film, and the new ""twins"" cenobite is pretty cool, and the gore F/X are really good. On the flip side you have the goofy rip-off of the ""Ghostbusters"" demon dog and the haunted skyscraper hallways that looks like a display in a Halloween store.

Overall this movie is able to overcome it's poor script with decent production, and great performance given by Doug Bradley as ""Pinhead"", getting more onscreen time here than in the previous 3 films put together. This is a fun entry in the series, and clocking in at just over 80 minutes, it provides a brief and bloody entry into the series.",1413244800,,2638,4.446280991735537
4465883,5,B004TJWDJY,I like sci-fi and horror and Hellraiser IV: Bloodline combines elements of both.  The film covers centuries of  the puzzle box history from its creation to present day and into the future where it resides on a space station.  An interesting movie and my favorite in the series.

4465889,3,B004TJWDJY,"It was 1987, Hellraiser and Clive Barker were being mass marketed in America's larger malls. Huge card board cut outs of Pinhead were featured at the theatres, and copies of The Damnation Game were sitting at the front of Walden Books. Horror fans who had not heard of Barker previously, were very curious who this man was that Stephen King was giving praise to.

 Alas, Hellraiser released, and I was treated to one of the few horror movies out there that were more than blood, guts, and jumps, but were also about an evolving and intelligent script, characters that grew on you (for better or worse), imagery that you just couldn't drop from your head, and well... just plain awesomeness, awesome, and unlike anything I'd ever seen before...

...then sequels followed, part 2 being a worthy follow up. Almost true to form entirely, spirit, flow, and all.
 Three followed that, and almost pulled it off, till the new Cenobites hit the street with their silly one liners, reducing the franchise and what could have been an almost perfect movie, to the stuff lesser ""horror"" flicks are made of.

 And finally we come to part 4. When I first saw 4 I was mortified!!! Pinhead, in space?! Seriously! After being let down by part 3, I figured that they were just trying to rub in the point that they could run this franchise into the ground and there was nothing I could do about it.

 Well years passed and the sequels got worse and worse and worse. ZERO effort was put into any of them, none at all. They are merely created so that the mother company can retain the rights to the name. It's all business and politics, a far cry from the vision and passion that the original and it's sequel were born from.

 That being said, I began to long for a quality Hellraiser experience again. Granted, I could always return to the first two, but I wanted more. Needless to say this led me to watching the first four films over again back to back. I will spare comments on the previous films here and save them for their own reviews, but now that I've came back and re-visited part 4, I have to admit that like part 3, it is an almost perfect movie, even more so than 3 in fact. What and awesome story...
well had Kevin Yagher been allowed to complete this film as he intended.

 This film is for the most part very well put together. You can pretty well tell where the studio moved in and forced changes to the script, but if you can fan edit those moments out, or just block them out mentally, this film does end up delivering, and had not some of the story elements been cut, would have provided as a sort of Hellraiser Bible. Sadly though some points were left hanging, and not tied up as the original director intended.

 It's sad though, to think that the final legit Hellraiser in the series was left hanging like so many of those plot points. In regards to the movies, they really should have just stopped here, though as for the comic books... I have to admit that what I've read of the new comic story arch has been everything I could ask for from a proper movie sequel and more!

Anyhow, bottom line, give this puppy a go, or a second chance if you hated it years ago. After all this time, it is interesting to see how they at least tried to keep the story line interesting and strong, but alas studio heads had to stick their fingers in the creative pie once more.",1392508800,3,3363,4.410339256865913
4465890,2,B004TJWDJY,"While I liked Hellraiser IV as a movie, the blu ray version is very lacking in video quality.  The blu ray version has way too much noise and seriously needs to be remastered.

Bloodline has been my favorite. It tells an interesting story. It shows you more cenobites than ever including the making of some.

This one is the only one to give me nightmares back when I first watched, making it even more epic.

Unfortunately in modern times, if you make a kid watch these movies it'll probably make you look really really bad. Which sucks.

Also I believe this is the last movie to be truly good. 1-4 are the best. But the rest are simply awful. Including the 2018 hellraiser.",1522108800,,580,4.342592592592593

The visuals were good, not great. There wasn't much gore in this one. The characters were well-defined and written. So Id say it was a solid movie for the franchise. Definitely one to see if you're a huge fane.",1507939200,,440,4.641025641025641
