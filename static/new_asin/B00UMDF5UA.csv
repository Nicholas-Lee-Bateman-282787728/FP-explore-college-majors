7052184,5,B00UMDF5UA,"I was slow in picking up on this series. Its another cop show and the primary character is key to the success of the series. For season four, comprising 3 new stories, Kenneth Branagh (Shakleton), who plays Inspector Kurt Wallander, is back as good as ever. Its been 4 years since season 3, and the series began in 2008. Branagh is the only character around for all 4 seasons, 12 episodes. Richard McCabe is back as Nyberg having played that part in 11 episodes; and Jeany Spark returns as Linda Wallander. Barnaby Kay returns in 2 episodes as Mattson. These are all seasoned fine actors that do a smashing job and keep it feeling real.

Setting is southern Sweden, beautiful by the way, near Ystad, and the views are stunning. Thats where the filming took place. Each episode, like previous series, is a feature-length story unto itself. The crime is bizarre for such a picture perfect location (much like Englands Midsomer Murders). Henning Mankell wrote the books the series is based upon, but Ive not read any of the novels. Likely the series is different. Book adaptations usually are, and both can be great for the media they are.

Wallander fans will enjoy, and newer viewers like me can do the catching up by buying the previous season later. New or gently used, its worth the DVD investment.",1463097600,5,1300,4.697368421052632

7052212,5,B00UMDF5UA,"Excellent story, beautiful countryside settings, well done.  I've watched the whole series, and will probably watch it again someday.  Finally, a show where there is a crime solved per episode.",1496707200,,193,5.4
7052213,5,B00UMDF5UA,"Kenneth Branagh returns as melancholic police detective Kurt Wallander in ""The White Lioness,"" ""A Lesson in Love,"" and ""The Troubled Man.""  This series was the fourth and final one for ""Wallander,"" originally broadcast in the U.S. on PBS in May 2016 and in the UK on the BBC in May and June of that year, and this DVD set contains all three 90-minute films.

These films see Wallander in his familiar Sweden but also in South Africa solving murders, and facing challenges that come with being a policeman at an advancing age and a health problem that draws his career to a close.  The writing in these three episodes is just as good as in the first nine, and the cinematography, as always, is top-shelf.  There is a short bonus feature discussing the production of the show with both Branagh and Wallander author and creator Henning Mankell interviewed.",1496361600,,853,4.743243243243243

7052215,5,B00UMDF5UA,"My daughter is a Kenneth Branagh fan, ever since he appeared in the Harry Potter movies. This last installment of this series was spot on, with a twist for the end of the series we didn't expect.  It's a dark investigative series, but the entire series really held our attention. Very good!",1493683200,,290,4.576923076923077

7052217,3,B00UMDF5UA,I missed the supporting cast of the earlier series. This one wasn't as good but Branagh is always easy to watch. I thought the first episode set in Africa was the weakest. The stories work best in the Swedish setting a bit like Woody Allen doing his best work in New York. The last episode was not a total surprise as the hints were there but it was still quite moving. I hadn't read the book not that you needed to to see what was coming. Branagh was very good in the final episode and the scene on the beach near the end was powerful. Over all four series Wallander is well worth watching and Branagh was entirely convincing as the policeman always close to finding happiness in his private life but never quite reaching it. A flawed character but an interesting one.,1490659200,,769,4.384615384615385

7052240,4,B00UMDF5UA,"The stories are well done, though half the fun is comparing the Scandinavian and U.K. versions of the stories.  Kenneth Branagh does a good job, but I prefer Krister Henriksson's Wallander.  He seems to be more 'damaged'.",1482796800,,221,4.945945945945946

7052244,5,B00UMDF5UA,"A superb rounding off of this outstanding interpretation of Mankells books. Thanks to this series we have become hooked on Nordic Noir.
If there is any criticism it is that they could have used mainly Swedish cast for the roles in the series - afterall Swedes do speak excellent English.
Branagh is, as ever, outstanding. This series and his interpretation of the central character makes this as much a deeply personal human drama as it does a crime thriller.
The last two episodes of Season Four are without doubt some of the finest Human Drama to be portrayed on TV.",1479513600,3,568,4.69
7052245,5,B00UMDF5UA,"Branagh maintained the standard right to the end. I can't rate the various Scandi versions of Wallander against the English language Branagh versions, they all have their own merits and are all of consistently high quality.",1478822400,,223,5.222222222222222
7052246,5,B00UMDF5UA,"Simply the best. This series is absolutely the best of a police procedural, up there with Prime Suspect. Very few series attain this level of great, but Kenneth Branagh has achieved it. It is beautiful, moody, beautifully acted, emotional, sad and thought provoking. Awesome!",1478476800,,275,5.2727272727272725
7052247,5,B00UMDF5UA,Kenneth Branagh does justice to this flawed by driven character in the final episodes that he has brought to television through the BBC and PBS.  His humanity and pain comes through as he attempts to solve his final cases and we will miss his dour countenance as the series is completed.,1477958400,,287,4.627450980392157

Most of the actors from the first three seasons did not return. I haven't been able to read the entire series of books so I don't know if they end the way the movies have, but everything was wrapped up in a way that you know Kenneth Branagh isn't going to change his mind and bring Wallander back.",1470873600,2,436,3.9101123595505616

7052298,5,B00UMDF5UA,"Really great detective DVD set in Sweden. The spoken English is very understandable. Much better than some British mysteries.

There are no other stories written, produced, acted as well as these 4 seasons ...about the rapidly changing postmodern, declining, political economic of  global deterioration and the human condition as Mankell writes... and Branagh acts .Everyone  and every detail is perfection. To see these humans trying to make a more ethical and moral world is wonderful every second no matter how many times one watches them. Are they delightful ?  Yes!

This last year is a profoundly depressing end.  It would have been better if they had just let is end with year 3.  The stories are not up to the quality of the previous series.  The final episode was just purely depressing.  I cannot think of a single redeeming thing to say about this last year, except that Kenneth Branagh remains a great actor.  Even HE couldn't save this one.",1466726400,4,522,4.244897959183674
7052361,4,B00UMDF5UA,"Benjamin Caron's production shifts the action back to Kurt Wallander's (Kenneth Branagh's) home turf of Sweden, and the quality of the episode improves dramatically as a result. There is something peculiarly apposite to the mood of the series about the setting, with its anonymous-looking gray stone buildings and seemingly permanent bad weather.

The criminal aspects of this case are relatively insignificant. A young girl (Mia Goth) goes missing, and Wallander is summoned to investigate a case involving a group of bikers, a highly protective father (Clive Wood), and a taciturn son (Hugh Mitchell). What matters more is our growing awareness of Wallander's deteriorating mental state. Now in his mid-fifties, he suffers from diabetes as well as occasional moments of dizziness. Dr. Oberg (John Lightbody) offers brief moments of reassurance, but we gather that something is really wrong when Wallander forgets leaves a loaded gun in a caf and receives temporary suspension from the police force as a result.

Caron's production uses repeated shots of Wallander driving alone on deserted roads to emphasize his isolation. He has a daughter (Jeany Spark), and a granddaughter (Kitty Peterkin) who both love him, but he cannot admit to them about his true mental state. He gamely tries to carry on his work; but it's clear that his aptitude for it is not what it was. Wallander's isolation is further emphasized through aerial shots of the deserted Swedish landscape, with Wallander's car appearing almost like a speck on the horizon.

Branagh gives a low-key performance; his facial expressions rarely change, but it's clear that he is a tormented soul desperately trying to keep his true state of mind hidden from public view. Outward show matters - especially for a high-ranking police officer - and he works hard to sustain his sang-froid. Yet perhaps the task proves beyond him; in the final shot of his episode we see his face encased in a mask as he is about to endure an MRI scan; his surreal appearance denotes something of his true state of mind.

""A Lesson in Love"" is a low-key episode in which situation assumes as much significance as plot. There are occasional longueurs, but the viewer's patience receives its due reward in the end.",1466640000,,2250,5.072972972972973
7052362,3,B00UMDF5UA,"ok, wish there were more as with KRISTER HENRIKSSON.

7052363,4,B00UMDF5UA,Kenneth Branagh playing Kurt Wallender has to be an outstanding theatrical experience. it is easy  to criticise this TV production because it does not represent exactly the  way in which Mankell describes Wallender as being part of the team of the detectives and it is only in the finale when Wallender is confronting the baddie in a life and death struggle  that  the hero is Wallender. Branagh plays Wallender on the basis that Wallender is less the superhero but more a frail mortal individual and Mankell did both  in the Wallender  novels and in his other his writings created characters who do have the characteristics which Branagh depicts in his portrayal of Wallender.,1466380800,,677,4.946902654867257
7052364,5,B00UMDF5UA,"i saw it by a german channel, now on bbc one. it is much better in english. branagh is simply the best actor for that role. i liked krister henrikson as wallander too, but he did not play the same stories, so i can not compare both actors. branagh played the novels, henrikson other stories.",1464825600,,291,4.3090909090909095
7052365,4,B00UMDF5UA,"The forth season of Wallander brings the series to a close with three episodes. The first episode is The White Lioness, loosely based on the 1998 novel of the same name. Henning Mankells final Wallander novel The Troubled Man has been adapted into A Lesson in Love and The Troubled Man, though it appears that most of the material from the book is in the latter. Previous series of Wallander have featured a largely angst-driven, often dysfunctional detective who strained credibility. Perhaps because Wallander has developed physical health problems in the latest series, his mental health problems are downplayed. His illness is not depicted realistically, especially not in The Troubled Man, but its better than his usual paralyzing neuroses. Kenneth Branagh reprises his role as the Ystad police detective Kurt Wallander. Jeany Spark returns as Wallanders daughter Linda, and Richard McCabe is pathologist Sven Nyberg. There are three 90-minute episodes. The quality is better than Series 3. The episodes are:

Kurt Wallander travels to Cape Town, South Africa to attend a police conference in The White Lioness. A local police officer asks him to speak to a frustrated Swedish national whose wife has recently gone missing. Axel Hedeman (Alex Ferns) and wife Inga (Tessa Juber) are in South Africa on a faith-based mission to help the underprivileged. Wallander succeeds in calming Mr. Hedeman and, curiosity aroused, decides to do some investigating. A disturbing discovery in an abandoned stock farm near the route Inga took the day she disappeared doesnt inspire optimism. But Wallander expiates his anxiety by striking out on his own, when fingerprints of a local young man named Victor Mabasha (Lemongang Tsipa) are found at the scene. This leads Wallander and investigating police officer Grace Mthembu (Bonnie Henna) into the heart of political intrigue.

A Lesson in Love marks the beginning of the end of Wallanders policing career, as he finds himself increasingly troubled by dizzy spells and memory lapses. Erica Hjelmqvist, a widowed mother of teenaged daughter Hannah (Mia Goth), is found dead in a ditch in a field, stabbed and then drowned. Hannah is missing, and Wallander sets out to find her, beginning with inquiries at a farm the family owned, now occupied by a group of bikers whom Erica was trying to evict. The leader of the group, an ornery ex-con named Gustav Ericsson (Clive Wood), resents the police attention and doesnt hide his feelings. Meanwhile, an old flame of Wallanders is in town for a visit, and Wallander plays the doting grandfather to granddaughter Klara (Kitty Peterkin). Wallanders personal challenges in this episode are his own physical limitations, which is an improvement over neuroses of the past.

The final episode of the Wallander series is The Troubled Man. Wallander has received a pessimistic diagnosis that explains his recent memory lapses and erratic behavior. His daughter Linda (Jeany Spark) asks her father for help when her father-in-law, former naval commander Hakan von Enke (Terrence Hardiman), goes missing from the woods, where he was taking his Sunday morning walk. Wallander agrees to look into it, and the local police detective welcomes his help. Wallander begins with only a birthday card, now missing, that upset Hakan and Hakans recent preoccupation with a Soviet submarine incursion into Swedish waters during the Cold War for clues. Thinking this will be his last case and concerned that whatever befell Hakan may endanger his daughter and granddaughter, Wallander frantically follows the trail of evidence.",1464307200,8,3587,5.2565445026178015
7052366,5,B00UMDF5UA,"The series is rather ""dark"" and gloomy as that is the life Wallander lives.  All through the series he eats badly, sleeps in his chair and all types of routine that would being regret later.
In the final series he plays out the story in perfect form.
Start from the beginning and you will understand why it is so good.",1464134400,,318,4.3
7052367,1,B00UMDF5UA,"This is the final and most morbid season yet. this season seems to be a desperate attempt to put one more season out there, no matter what the quality. The first episode is comically weak with little plot and no explanation as to how the crime is solved, even though Wallander shows up in South Africa and magically solves a crime that the local black police force is too simple to solve. The episode has a good plot but it is lost in the fumbling of the deficient Wallander. It is very slow moving and grim in its outlook.
Not worth the cost of a purchase. Best to watch on TV for free somewhere if you want to be depressed.",1463875200,5,625,4.216666666666667
7052368,3,B00UMDF5UA,"After watching the last three shows of Wallander, we have mixed feelings about this series. Besides the scenery, we are wondering why we continue to watch. Kenneth Branagh is a very interesting actor, so he is not the problem. The problem is, like many, many other British series on CD. The SOUND IS TERRIBLE!  Too much music, too much wind, too much echo of anything outside of a door. One cannot hear the actors. Maybe that's why we always buy the CD when it comes out, so we can READ the story.  Maybe this is why the last CD is so inexpensive. Sorry to see Wallander go, but so be it. I'm surprised PBS doesn't give their input into productions with terrible sound. So I am giving it here, PBS the sound on British productions needs to be greatly improved.",1463875200,3,760,4.421428571428572

I enjoyed his characterization of a detective who is passionate about his job that he  sacrifices  his family life  & his wife & daughter have difficulty coping with him.

It has complicated plots (good for the mind) but promotes a recognition of our weaknesses. It has made me reflect quite often.

Good plots , excellent dialogues , perfect timing, nice sceneries & soothing background music .

I was first exposed to the Swedish version ( with  Krister Henriksson) before trying out the English version. Both are good with slightly different slants - I find the English version more intense . I enjoy both versions.",1524700800,,737,4.785714285714286
