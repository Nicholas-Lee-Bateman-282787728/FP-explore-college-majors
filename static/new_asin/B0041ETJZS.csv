4241626,3,B0041ETJZS,"Imran Khan is a guy who just dates for the heck of it and refuses to fall in love because he hates love stories but works for a film director whose forte is making romance flicks. He is assigned to assist Sonam Kapoor. She is already engaged to someone and then you can guess what would happen next......
This is another movie from the factory known as Dharma Productions. It has unarguably has some of the best songs of 2010 but not enough of a story. Sonam Kapoor and Imran Khan manage to sail through their roles but the going gets tough as the story increasingly resorts to cliches.
The songs kept me awake because I own the soundtrack and I wanted to see their filming. I loved ""Bahaara"" but that is all there is for this movie.....The first half seemed promising but the second half breaks that promise. Enjoy the songs and keep the remote nearby....three stars ( The songs get two of these stars) 10/7/10",1286928000,,911,4.461077844311378
4241627,2,B0041ETJZS,"'I Hate Luv Storys' is a story about story--the process of story, why stories matter, the truth about life found in them. It's a defense of love stories, even as it pokes fun at their corniness. But this love story is a pale, muted version of the great Bollywood love stories of old, and while it aims to romanticize, it ultimately disparages.

Jay (Imran Khan) hates love stories. He wants to be a film director and he's working as an assistant to a big-time Bollywood director, Veer (Samir Soni), who is famous for his love stories. Jay hates his job, but he needs to pay the bills and pad his resume. Since his heart's not in it, he's always screwing up and on the verge of getting fired. Jay also hates love in general--he doesn't believe in relationships and he sleeps around.

Simran (Sonam Kapoor) loves love stories. She's an art director working on the same movie as Jay. She loves her job and is quite good at it. She has a picture-perfect relationship with her lovey-dovey boyfriend, Raj (Sameer Dattani), a button-cute investment banker, although there's clearly no real physical passion or emotional intimacy between them.

Obviously, Jay and Simran do not get along. Their respective professions inform their characters and their viewpoints on love. As an art director, Simran is concerned with the appearance of love, its beauty, the enchanting surface of it. As a hopeful director, Jay objects to love and love stories because he sees them as predictable plots. Likewise, Jay criticizes Simran's relationship with Raj because it's boring--there's no challenge, no conflict, no risk--none of the things that make a good story, or for that matter, a meaningful life. Of course, they represent all of those things to each other without realizing it. They're both fixated on the outcome of love stories, with different feelings about it, instead of what it takes to get there. They're both scared of what real love demands and they're trying to avoid it in different ways. Their love story has a promising start and could have appropriately ended halfway through the movie--instead it drags tediously through the pointless second half.

The film is filled with actual clips from romantic classics, recreated scenes from romantic classics, and songs and lines from romantic classics--to the point of overkill--as if these alone could carry the film. The irony is that 'I Hate Luv Storys' was produced by Karan Johar, who has been involved as a producer, director, writer, and actor in many of those same classics. He's helped define the film conventions that make Bollywood love stories so loved. But here, those conventions are reduced to a list of clichs--a literal list that one character checks off as the film progresses. Has Johar finally internalized what his detractors have been saying all along? Or is he not a romantic at all, but rather, a jaded wizard behind the curtain? 'I Hate Luv Storys' is as disillusioning as it is dull.

4241628,3,B0041ETJZS,"Am I in a bad mood or something? I've liked every film I've seen featuring Imran Khan, starting with JAANE TU YA JAANE NA down to even LUCK. And maybe I should've avoided I HATE LUV STORYS because this is where the streak snaps. This is a romantic comedy that, at first glance, promises to be something different. The premise revolves around that good old ""opposites attract"" theme, but what drew me was the way the premise was presented. Happy-go-lucky Jay (Imran Khan) absolutely loathes those sweeping love stories. Sucks for him then that he's assistant director to a Bollywood film-maker known for crafting really popular, really mushy romantic films.

And then there's Simran (Sonam Kapoor) who wallows in mushy. To further develop Simran's dreamy-eyed state, her perfect fiance is named Raj - and if you know your DILWALE DULHANIA LE JAYENGE, then you get the nudge in the ribs. When Simran shows up as art director for that very same film-maker, and she and Jay right away get off on the wrong foot... well, you can figure the rest out.

And that's the big bad about this movie, that you can figure the rest out. It starts out promisingly with Jay's voice-over narrating his utter disdain for love stories while the screen cuts to fleeting clips from classic Bollywood romances (DILWALE DULHANIA LE JAYENGE, HUM TUM, etc.), and so you assume that the romantic spoofing is on. Or I assumed, anyway.

It turns out, I HATE LUV STORYS is about as subversive as a ham & cheese sandwich. It doesn't take long at all before the story - with its most threadbare of plots - falls back into traditional tropes, and the parody soon blurs into the very thing it's parodying. Thirty-five minutes into it, and I started drifting, even with the camera falling madly in love with Sonam Kapoor who is damned gorgeous. Imran Khan, I don't think it's his acting as much as it's the script that makes him out to be such an irritating louse. The sequence in the movie theater in which Jay just wouldn't stop harassing Simran got on my nerves. As the film progresses, Jay does become less boorish, more likable, but it's lost me, by then. Of course, it doesn't help that plot points are lifted from similar movies like DIL CHAHTA HAI. And I say ""similar movies"" because, when you break it down, I HATE LUV STORYS, it turns out, ultimately worships at Yash Chopra's feet. And Imran Khan, he out-Shahrukhs Shahrukh Khan.

There's a towering chance, of course, that I seriously misread this movie from the get-go, that it never had an intention at all of lampooning the mush. If so, and if you go into this, expecting the same-old weepy love story, then you just may like it. Pine away, friend.",1284508800,,2677,4.665254237288136

8412644,4,B0041ETJZS,"This glossy romantic comedy might appeal to those who are relatively new to Hindi cinema, but the deeper enjoyment awaits those who are very familiar with the big romantic hits of ""Bollywood"".  The in-jokes start right away, and it's quite fun to keep track of how many references you can spot to other movies.

The plot is fairly simple: Jay (Imran Khan) is a production assistant to a famous Bollywood director known for making sappy romances.  Simran (Sonam Kapoor) is an art director for the same studio.  Jay hates his job - he can't stand romantic stories, he doesn't believe in love...you get the idea.  Simran loves her job - she lives in a perfect world in which she has the perfect boyfriend, perfect family...you get the idea.  Jay and Simran meet, Jay and Simran hate each other, Jay and Simran fall in love with each other.  The predictability is beside the point; the point is the fun in getting to the predictable ending.  And there is indeed a lot of fun to be had.

Imran Khan has noticeably matured since his first film (Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na), both physically and as an actor.  He has a very chill, understated acting style which I quite like - no cheesy, over-the-top emoting from him.  He's also quite adept with comedic little facial expressions and physical comedy.  Sonam Kapoor is delicately gorgeous, but also stiffer than Imran, though that might have been due to the nature of her role.  She spends the first third of the movie frowning, the second third in gratuitous glamor shots with wind blowing her hair, and then the final third mostly frowning again.  But she's sweet and beautiful, and the scene in which she initially gets rejected is heartfelt.

The music is consistently great - the title track will make you want to dance, and the love theme ""Bahara"" really is quite beautiful.  For me, however, the best part is the way the movie manages to make fun of every other romantic movie while unashamedly sticking to the very plot lines it's making fun of (or as Veer says to Jay: ""Yes, your love story really is as filmy as all that"").  There are hilarious little touches - the insider jokes mentioned above: whenever the director speaks, he's accompanied by the strains of a famous Hindi film song (""Maahi Ve"" from Kal Ho Naa Ho); the film set that Jay and Simran are constructing evokes innumerable other movies.

The movie falters most at the very end; you get the sense that neither Sonam nor Imran really buys into the final cliche.  However, that didn't detract much from my enjoyment of all that came before.  I would give it 3.5 stars if amazon allowed half-stars.  In short, it's definitely worth checking out, especially if you're familiar with lots of other romantic Bollywood movies.",1303516800,,2729,4.6911764705882355
8412645,3,B0041ETJZS,"The whole movie is full of cliches, straight and indirect lifts from the better Bollywood fare and very stupid or illogical scenes that make you go - how bizarre!

You'll only get to wonder what sense the film made, after the screening gets over because the whole time the movie is on...there's so much fun, half the time you're laughing, half the time, well you're smirking! With the very contemporary dialogues and fresh -in-your-face- sarcasm, the film's comedy is pure pleasure. Period.

The music is not breathtaking but catchy and fun! There are a lot of adult jokes cracked so no taking your kids for over-sensitive parents.",1300406400,,631,4.88785046728972
8412646,5,B0041ETJZS,"Excellent movie - very fun. Great cast, very attractive (important in a romance movie). Five stars all the way.

Loved the movie, kept me laughing and smiling. It's a romance, so you've got the traditional storyline, but they really present it in a refreshing way. Also a nice change of pace from the crap they make in the United States. I watched it in Hindi with English Subtitles (I hate dubbed movies) and this is definitely a movie I could see watching on a date or an anniversary, or even just with a group of friends.",1298678400,,524,4.458333333333333
8412647,5,B0041ETJZS,"This movie is a must see movie. And for the packaging and condition, it is great! the movie came with the SOUNDTRACK and I just love it! the movie is super dooper Good!",1295568000,,168,4.121212121212121
8412648,5,B0041ETJZS,"They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and this movie applies. It pokes fun at Bollywood love stories, ripping off (on purpose) many of Bollywood's biggest hits and yet it is, itself a love story. I think it demonstrated perfectly the dilemma every fan of Bollywood has. The movies are at time unrealistic and over the top and yet we can't stop watching!

Jay hates love stories but works for a Bollywood studio. Simran loves everything Bollywood, most especially love stories. So much so that her life resembles one. When the pair are forced to work together sparks fly before they form an unlikely friendship that threatens her perfect life. Could it be possible that the very thing Jay hates is exactly what he needs?

This film is great. If you are a fan of Bollywood and have seen many of its biggest titles (Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge being two prime examples) you will get the many jokes and jabs of this movie. If you are a casual viewer and not up on the big sweeping love sagas of Bollywood, much of it will go over your head. This film is definitely worth the two hour and fifteen minute ride. I loved Imran Khan in Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na and he delivered in this film as well. For enthusiastic fans of Bollywood romances this a must see!",1292976000,6,1283,4.45531914893617
