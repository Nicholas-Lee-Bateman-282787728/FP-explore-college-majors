5020020,5,B006UKX65K,"I had a wonderful time watching this goofy alien versus red necks film. The script is an original bending of bad Sci Fi drive in movies.  It is gory and has some over the top, bad taste humor so I cannot recommend it to people with kids.  The film is part grind house and part B movie spoof.  No Oscars for the acting but the cast looked like they were having a great time.  Every character is a stereo type but the film takes these folks and twists them into something interesting.  There are some genuine laugh out loud moments in the movie.  The body count is high.  Most of the characters die in some unique and entertaining way.  This is a really great rainy weekend film.",1346112000,2,677,4.275590551181103
5020021,3,B006UKX65K,"Alien Opponent is an action/sci-fi/comedy that is pretty stupid, but it does have its fun moments. There's some gore, a lot of violence (the body count is very high), and a cool alien. Unfortunately, the film has many problems. There is only one likeable character in this whole movie. All of the other characters are greedy backstabbers. Also, it ends up being more about characters killing each other than an alien killing them. I wanted to see this cool alien do some damage, but we don't really get to see as much of that as we get to see the greedy gusses killing each other. This is a pretty fun time, but it could been so much more.",1343779200,,639,4.423728813559322

8504557,2,B006UKX65K,"Alien Opponent was made for the Chiller cable TV channel, and it's about as direct to cable/video as you can get. Shout Factory!, never one to shy away from presenting B and C-movie titles in it's best light, released a uncut version for all of us to enjoy. I use to term 'enjoy' subjectively, because I think you have to have a certain love for a certain kind of film to enjoy this. Alien Opponent is a blatant attempt at putting as much creative deaths as you can in one setting. It's a snuff film through and through. The plot is pedestrian and only there to give an excuse for the spectacle. The acting is.... well not really acting. More like adult pretend time. The special effects are low budget, but seem to be a positive highlight of the film in spite of that. If you like mindless mayhem and high body count this is your film.

The plot is ridiculous. A rich junk yard owner is killed by his wife. An alien crash lands into said junk yard and the wife devises a plot to blame the death on the alien and place a bounty on its head. So now all sorts of people.... ALL sorts... come running to claim the bounty, or more to the point die trying. When I say high body count I mean it. People are dying everywhere. It's not just your standard men and women getting slaughtered. Children are being cut to pieces and decapitated. Pet dogs' necks are being snapped. Nobody is safe. And the dying can come at you in so many ways. Land sharks, razor wires, killer slugs a la The Creeps, killer robots, flame throwers, hand tools, you name it. I can see this is a  tongue in cheek level of violence, but it's still over the top for me and in poor taste.

The characters and acting are pretty much a throwaway. All the characters have issues and make it hard to root for anybody. The only two you do want to root for are because one is kinda dumb and a pretty boy while the other is a fearless Lara Croft lookalike who has the best choreography in the film. While she has style you will end up hating her in the end.

While the script, acting and mayhem aren't anything to crow about the practical and special effects do impress. The alien costume is straight up cool looking. The way they shoot the alien and how it moves also lend to the coolness. Those little Creeps slugs I mentioned actually don't look bad at all either. While you can tell they are CG animations they interact well with the environment, are shaded and textured nicely and all around look better than what you would expect. Other special effects are a bit of a throwaway to me like the animated gore and some of the other creature traps in the film. Still you can tell in some twisted way that this film was a labor of love. Stick around for the end credits to see some of that love.

I never saw this film on the Chiller channel so I don't know exactly what's new in this uncut DVD. The video looks pretty good and if you have an upscaled player the movement and detail almost get into semi-HD/PAL level video quality. Sound is Dolby 5.1, but I didn't really notice much surround sound type audio effects. You do get a fair number of extras with the disc too. Here's the rundown:

Audio Commentary - This is the real meat of the extras. Commentaries come mostly from director Colin Theys, but you also get a good chunk of the production staff to chime in as well. Lots and lots of details on production and such.

Deleted Scenes - About six minutes of stuff.

Outtakes - Actors and staff cutting up. Nothing really funny, but it's short enough to give you the impression the crew had a good time making the film.

Image Gallery - Stills of the film.

Theatrical Trailer

Alien Opponent is hard to love, or even like. But I admit it's not hard to see why somebody else may love it. You have to really be into dark humor or movies with a body count to enjoy this. Otherwise you may end up like me thinking the film goes too far off in that direction for way too little in return.",1383523200,,3947,4.284563758389262
8504558,4,B006UKX65K,"This is a bad movie and doesn't pretend to be anything else. Think Attack of the Killer Tomatoes meets Shawn of the Dead. It is hysterical. If you want an Academy movie this isn't your schtick HOWEVER, if you want a blast of funny with aliens, rednecks, and ditzy blonds thrown in you will love this. If MST3K were still around it would be a strong candidate.",1370390400,4,359,4.373134328358209
8504559,4,B006UKX65K,"Plenty of good humour with action to go with it.

8504560,3,B006UKX65K,"Alien Opponent (2010) is a science fiction ""slaughter comedy"", where a profit minded group of alien hunters, are dispatched in a variety of ways, while attempting to claim a cash reward.  The kills are probably the high points, as story is as solid as Jell-o, and characters are a strange bunch, with few who are likeable.  The special effects aren't spectacular, but used judiciously, are generally effective, and mildly humorous.

Meghan Mazurski (Ashley Bates), a hot young blonde, is caught with her lover Bradan (Cuyle Carvin), by her husband Tom (Kevin Shea).  When the old buzzard gets violent, Meghan's mom (Hilma Falkowski) slams a hammer into his skull, making her daughter a widow.

Events take place on rural junkyard, where an alien craft has apparently just crashed landed.  Seeking to cover up the crime and inherit Mazurski's estate, the trio concocts a story that Meghan's hubby has been killed by an alien, and go on TV to offer a $100,000 reward, to anyone who can recover Tom body.  This brings a flock of interested applicants to the salvage yard, including Paris (Jessica Alexandra Green) a waitress, Father Melluzo (Roddy Piper) a priest, Linnea (Adrienne LaValley) a dancer in a men's club, and Brooklyn Davis (Jeremy London), an all around slimeball.

The movie follows the activities of the enterprising reward seekers, as they wander through the property confronting alien worms, killer robots, and a large extraterrestrial, who resembles the Predator, and seems to get off on killing humans.  Various ""hunters"" fall prey to the aliens, while others are murdered by other contestants.  Meghan's mom decides to increase the pressure on the contestants, which leads to a falling out with her daughter in the kitchen.

Directed by Colin Theys, Alien Opponent attempts to entertain by showing people meeting their end, in shocking and creative ways, like being frozen solid, or being sliced up by a robot.  For a low budget affair, production values are surprisingly good.  There is a good deal of gore, and the very cheesy special effects, add some nicely humorous touches.

Destined to become casualties, many of the participants are not around for very long, and are presented as mostly dumb, greedy, crude, or some type of freak, and even the main characters are obnoxious, or hard to like.  Played mostly for laughs, the acting is not at a very high level, but if you are in the mood for a quirky splatterfest, you might give this a chance.",1360886400,5,2468,4.985365853658537
