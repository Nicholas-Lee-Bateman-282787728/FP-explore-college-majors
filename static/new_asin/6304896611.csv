8215690,1,6304896611,"This film is only 20 minutes long.  The video quality is sorry.  Some of the information is inaccurate (Bruce Lee is a ""Karate"" fighter?--NOT!)  It advertizes itself as primarily a Bruce Lee documentary but it only gives Lee about 4 minutes of film.  It does have some info that most people don't know about in terms of the pioneers of karate in the US--should have been much longer though!",979689600,4,390,4.608695652173913
