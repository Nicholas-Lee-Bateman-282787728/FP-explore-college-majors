8492820,5,B0064RBZ2K,"Scotto was in voice at the time and is superb.  But four years before when the production debuted she was even better.  Too bad they waited for the next time she sang the role.  Il Tabarro has an excellent cast supporting Scotto; Cornell McNeil, the tenor are right on target.  Scotto's acting in Suor Angelica is beyond reproach and all the business while she prepares the poison well done.  Her death is unmatched by any other soprano.  Gianni Schicchi is a lark and lightly performed by the soprano.",1488499200,,502,4.6477272727272725
8492821,5,B0064RBZ2K,So glad this was placed on DVD.  I remember when this was shown on PBS.  A triumph for Miss Scotto.,1483574400,,99,3.9
8492822,5,B0064RBZ2K,Great acting. Very well done version of this opera trilogy. But don't be fooled by the resellers here. This DVD is not out of print and can be found elsewhere for a fraction of the cost.,1426636800,,186,4.194444444444445
8492823,5,B0064RBZ2K,"Perhaps I should say right off I love Puccini.  I bought this DVD at the urging of other reviewers, though I am a late comer to the Renata Scotto fan club.  I took their word for her and am so glad I did.  Wow.  I'm suspicious of words like """"transcendent"" or ""ravishing""  when trying to praise a performance.  If I don't feel it in my gut, forget it.  These performances passed that test with flying colors.  I confess to being a bit annoyed during Suor Angelica with the persistent cough of someone in the audience, but I finally forgot about it - the portrayal of the hapless sister was so intense and real.  While many consider Gianni Schicci  the gem of the lot, I find it rather tiresome and silly.  Excessive mugging does not do much for me.  The cast was having fun though, and I guess that counts for something.  But the music, the music, the music.  It held me captive from beginning to end.  It will be one of my favorites from now on.",1368057600,2,946,4.295454545454546
8492824,3,B0064RBZ2K,"First: are you missing from your collection a  DVD of this Pucccini classic?

Second: do you like the music of Il Trittico?

Third: do you care much if the production is dull?

If the answer to two of the three is ""affirmative""...then it should be part of your collection of opera DVDs.

8492825,5,B0064RBZ2K,"I have seen Sour Angelica a few times on the stage and I have every production of it on DVD and I must say that no other singer in this part has moved me like Ms. Scotto was able to.
She proved to be a real singing actress.
It was a truly spellbinding performance. Just to see Sour Angelica is worth the price of this DVD, and more.

I liked how the ending was done, no angels bringing a child or other tricks, just Angelica ""imagining"" that she's holding her child in her arms.
The only thing was that I did not think that The Aunt was at the same vocal and dramatic level of Scotto, however their confrontation was powerful and the Senza Mama moved me to tears.
Brava, Brava, Bravissima!!",1341878400,9,690,4.2272727272727275
8492826,3,B0064RBZ2K,"""Il trittico"" had its world premiere at the Metropolitan in 1918, and this 1981 revival was the first time the three heroines of the triptych were taken by one soprano at that theatre. And a tour-de-force it certainly was for that prima donna. In the dour ""Il tabarro,"" we have Cornell MacNeil, Renata Scotto, and Vasile Moldoveanu as the ill-fated love-triangle. MacNeil is a glowering presence, absolutely commanding in voice and appearance. Scotto is incomparably vivid as the unhappy Giorgetta, searing and pathetic in her panegyric to city-life. Moldoveanu is here much better than in ""Don Carlos"": The histrionic demands are far less in this work, and his voice has no difficulty in surmounting this vocally-demanding role.

Bianca Berini is splendidly Italianate as La Frugola, as both singer and actress, and is paired well with the veteran Italo Tajo. This is one of Charles Anthony's finest performances on video, as the dissipant, Il Tinca. Fabrizio Melano's staging is ordinary, but canny.

""Suor Angelica"" has a legendary performance in the title role by Mme Scotto. From the start, she is marked by sorrow and seeming resignation. When a guest arrives at the Parlor, she is almost beside herself. When she finally questions her aunt, the Princess, about the son she was forced to abandon seven years earlier, her release of pent-up emotions is almost unbearable to watch. Her despair at the news of her son's death leads her to a false exaltation, and the immense regret at the taking of her own life. All this is conveyed in singing and acting on the very highest level of accomplishment.

Betsy Norden is very fine as the cheerful Sister Genovieffa, and Jocelyne Taillon is very good as the Princess, but Scotto would have required a fiercer adversary as her cold aunt, like the great Dunja Vejzovic, in the 1983 performance on DVD, from the Teatro alla Scala.

Melano's staging in the first part of the opera is jittery and frivolous, not rightly representing a monastery where, perforce, composure reigns. The Marian Miracle at the end, however, is handled in an arresting manner. Instead of actually showing the arrival of the Queen of Heaven, with Angelica's child in attendance, Melano has only Angelica seeing the Vision, which is in accordance with the theology concerning such manifestations. One wonders how effective it was in the theatre, but here, with Scotto as the tragic nun, it reaches the heights of sublimity. We see her pantomiming seeing the Virgin, and receiving her child in her own arms, at last. Then, repentant and forgiven, we see the life force slip from her. In truth, this is an unforgettable performance.

""Gianni Schicchi"" is not a performance worthy of the other panels of this triptych, unfortunately. Comic opera is often the venue for the worst acting imaginable. The production of ""The Bartered Bride,"" discussed elsewhere, is proof this need not always apply. But here, we have to endure ""funny walks"" and gross exaggerations, especially in the secondary roles. It is sad that Melano encouraged/tolerated/allowed such antics. Gabriel Bacquier, Scotto, Taillon, Tajo, and Philip Creech lead the ensemble cast. Bacquier is very fine, but is obviously giving us ""M.Bacquier's Schicchi,"" divorced from the rest of the production. Scotto is charming, and gives us the movements of an elegant, young woman. Creech gives a sympathetic account of himself as the romantic Rinuccio. Norden also remains above the clowning as Nella, a role quite the opposite of her usual ""sweet"" characters.

A word about the English subtitles on these Met DVDs. It has seldom been remarked upon, but these are not adequate. Libretto questions are asked, answers not given, and vice-versa. While one cannot expect--or desire--full translations, what we are given from the Met are usually simplifications; interpretations of what is really being sung. It is both condescending and tiresome. This is a particular problem in ""Suor Angelica,"" where everything has been simplified, and sometimes deliberately giving false impressions of what is sung. The Latin texts for the angels who herald the advent of the Blessed Virgin Mary were carefully chosen by Puccini, with Jesuitical aid. They are partially from the prayer, ""O gloriosa virginum,"" which our translator renders as being the text of the ""Ave Maria."" This is but one example of the arrogance and laziness involved. In ""Gianni Schicchi,"" friars are mistaken for monks, etc.",1325289600,18,4454,5.145027624309392
8492827,5,B0064RBZ2K,"I attended a performance of this opera many years ago and it was burned in my mind and always wanted a DVD of it.  Well, the MET has come through once again.

Scotto has achieved an artistic milestone in the portrayal of each of the heroines
of all three operas.  Her sensuous Giorgetta of ""Il Tabarro"" shows a sign of her great acting skills we have seldom seen...her scenes with Vasile Moldoveanu are ""hot"".  Cornell MacNeil is up-to-par as her husband who knows what's going on and is no fool.

The part of Lauretta in ""Gianni Schicchi"" is actually small but Scotto delivers the aria ""O Mio Babbino Caro"" as a sweet loving daughter who knows how to get to her father, wonderfully sung and acted by Gabriel Bacquier.  Otherwise Puccini manages to keep Lauretta out of hilarious nonsense of the wonderful ensemble in this production.

I saved the best for last...""Suor Angelica"", which is actually the second of the three operas.  This is one of the most effective characterizations Scotto has done.  Just make sure that you have plenty of tissues on hand!  I absolutely love this opera and so will you.

Audio (DTS 5.1) and Video are excellent.  There are English sub-titles!

Again, my thanks to the Met for releasing this beautiful production.",1322352000,22,1247,4.744186046511628
