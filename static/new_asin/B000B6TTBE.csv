2403805,3,B000B6TTBE,"I have just began Disc 2 and noticed no laugh track for at least 3 episodes. Granted that's not what makes the show, but it sure leaps out at you in spots. Was this a symptom of a rushed DVD? I would rather Paramount take their time, do it right and throw in some extras than get a scaled down version lacking even a laugh track...I'm very disappointed thus far.",1132876800,6,362,4.185714285714286
2403806,5,B000B6TTBE,"Upon boot-up of this set... low and behold the PREVIEWS and the EPISODES have their OWN menu bubbles! Finally! Was that so hard Paramount? I may even watch them now that I'm not FORCED TO. Anyway, there just isn't much to say about this set that hasn't been hashed out already. Though I should mention the packaging is the best yet. The theme is of the Mayberry newspaper and each case is housed in a facsimile as such. I find this brillant and also looking forward to seeing what Season 5 will bring.

The show is in full-swing here in Season Four so if you've ever liked the Andy Griffith Show... now you'll LOVE IT!

**I wrote the above before noticing the absence of a laugh track (at times). I have to agree it makes the episodes sometimes painful to watch. Can't quite explain why but MASH has a option to ""go without"" the laugh track and on the surface it seemed like such a great idea... for about 2 minutes. These shows shouldn't need a laugh track but they do.**

I must say, it is a real treat to watch these unedited after having watched my copied VHS from channel 11 for about 5 years and know every nuance except... on these dvds where they snipped to cut for commercials; and that includes beyond the tags; there is a GREAT scene with Barney and Thelma Lou in ""A Date for Gomer"" in which Barney is trying to convince her that Gomer would be a great match for Mary Grace... ""He's 6 feet tall and everything Thel"" (Barney says) or something like that. This DEFINITELY wasn't in the TV version. CLASSIC!!
I guess if they release this set with ALL laugh tracks intact I'll have to rebuy it. I'm wondering how people are saying they are going to take theirs back? The stores I go to will NOT let you take something back except if it is defective and then you can only exchange it for the same thing.",1132617600,3,1809,4.330383480825959
2403807,5,B000B6TTBE,"Got the set today at Sam's club - have watched the first four episodes and they're just great - The episode ""The Sermon for Today"" only clocked in at 24 minutes but the others are all over 25 minutes.

I noticed that there was no laugh track for ""Opie the Birdman"" - don't remember it that way - I know it's a somber episode but it has it's share of hilarious moments -

Alas, no sponsor spots on this set, but picture and packaging are excellent -

""new comments below""

After 2 weeks, have to chime in on all this whining about the 4 missing laugh tracks.  Puhleeze!!!  To quote the guy from the episode ""Man in a Hurry"" - ""You people are living in a dream world""-

Oh, but to long for the good old days of Columbia House VHS videos with inferior picture and tapes that wore out.  And, if memory serves me right, the price was $19.95 for 2 episodes.  Let's see now, that would come to over $300.00 for this season, only about 1,000% higher.  Yep, those were great times.  Now, we have DVD's that last longer (with proper handling and care), take up less space, look better, sound better, and cost approx. 1/10th of the cost.  You would think that would make you people happy, but NO.  You want all that and perfection too.  Your probably expecting Don Knotts and Andy Griffith and Ron Howard to do audio commentarys on every episode, plus outtakes, storyboards, 3-D glasses and personally autographed script copies.  And all for around 30 bucks.

For the record, I do hope they do a better job of making sure these things don't happen, but to throw this whole set under the bus because of 4 missing tracks is ludricous.

Hopefully, the people at Universal are getting their own ""laugh tracks"" at reading this incessant whining from these negative reviews!  If the only disappointment you people have in your lives is this, you must lead charmed lives.",1132531200,4,1853,4.497005988023952
2403808,5,B000B6TTBE,"All the reviews keep omitting reference to what is one of the funniest bits of Season 4 and maybe the entire series.  In Opie's Ill Gotten Gain, Barney tries to recite the Preamble to the Constitution from memory -- classic.",1131580800,9,224,4.6
2403809,5,B000B6TTBE,"I personally rank season four of TAGS as a close second to season five, which I consider the best this classic show has to offer. Season four is when Gomer really comes into his own as a character, later proven as he departs Mayberry for his very own five-year run as Gomer Pyle, USMC. This season also marks the true beginning of Andy's deepening relationship with Helen, and further cements Don Knott's brillant performance as Barnard P. Fife as one of TV's great comic icons.

 My five personal favorites from this strong season:

5 -Ernest T. Joins the Army - Other than the 'Education of Ernest T. Bass' from season 5, this is my favorite Ernest episode. Howard Morris was a true genius...

4 - Up in Barney's Room - I love every episode where Barney gets 'gassed'...this time the culprit is sweet cidar turned 'hard'...

3 - Gomer The Houseguest - ""No count mule, sittin' on mountain, all day long...' Classic Gomer..

2 - The Shoplifters - Barney at the top of his game.  Ben Weaver at his grumpiest.  Asa the 'Rip Van Winkle' of security guards.  All this and the 'little old lady' who 'klanks'...Extra bonus: Barney and his infamous 'duck walk'...

1 - Andy Saves Gomer - My all-time favorite episode where Barney is absent.  The scene where Andy discovers Gomer napping while the garbage can smolders is classic...just watch Gomer spaz out! Also, the ending is priceless 'Andy battled his way in...""

There are many, many others that bare mention: ""Hot Rod Otis; Barney's Sidecar ('checkpoint Chickie'); Opie the Birdman'; it goes on and on.  The show was truly hitting its peak.

I truly hope there are no 'edited' episodes this time around, and cannot wait for seasons 5,6, 7 and 8.  Afterwhich, I hoping to see a quality DVD release of 1986's 'RETURN TO MAYBERRY' just to finish off the complete series.

Just remember...'WE DEFY THE MAFIA!!!'",1128729600,14,1856,4.717391304347826
2403810,5,B000B6TTBE,"Paramount is really putting out these TAGS seasons quickly. Keep them coming UNCUT (INCLUDING THE COLORED SEASONS PLEEEASE). After reviewing the episodes, I don't consider season four as one of their best.  There are not many stand-out episodes, but there are not many poor ones either.  This season marks the last we'll see of Gomer, the first we'll see of Goober, plus returns of the Fun Girls, the Darlings, Malcolm Merriweather, and Ernest T. Bass.  Five of the episodes are often listed among TAGS top 20 fan favorites, although they are not favorites of mine.  Here's what you get:

Opie the Birdman:  All TAGS seasons opened with a story about Opie, and this one may be the most famous one (and usually a top 10 fan fave).  Opie tries to raise three baby birds (Winkin, Blinkin, and Nod) after inadvertently killing their mother with a sling-shot.

The Haunted House:  This episode inspired Don Knotts' film The Ghost and Mr. Chicken.  Is it just the moonshine or is there a haunted house in Mayberry?

Ernest T. Bass Joins The Army:  I'm not a fan of Ernest T. but for those who are, this set offers two of his episodes.  This one has him trying to join the Army so he can get a uniform.

The Sermon For Today:  A visiting preacher comes to Mayberry and preaches a sermon of taking it easy (probably the last thing that needed to be preached in Mayberry). The folks take this sermon in an entirely different direction.  Usually a top 5 episode.

Briscoe Declares For Aunt Bee:  The Darlings are back and Briscoe decides to court Aunt Bee.  Bee is not so keen on the idea.

Gomer the House Guest:  Gomer loses his job at the filling station and moves in with the Taylors.

A Black Day For Mayberry:  This is one of the funniest TAGS episodes ever (in my personal top 20 list). An armored truck filled with gold is expected to arrive in Mayberry.  It's supposed to be a guarded secret but, when it arrives, a crowd of people with a banner ""Welcome Gold Truck"" is there to greet it.

Opie's Ill-Gotten Gain:  I could never understand how Helen could make such an error but, she gives mediocre student Opie straight A's by mistake.  Andy is so proud of Opie's report card that, when Opie finds out his real grades, he's afraid to let his pa down.

A Date For Gomer:  Thelma Lou wants to find a date for her plain cousin.  Andy and Barney decide on Gomer and they each explain to the other how ""nice"" their blind dates will be.

Up In Barney's Room:  Barney is caught cooking in his room and his landlady, Mrs. Mendelbright, evicts him.  Barney becomes further agitated when he learns ""Mrs. Bendelmright"" is about to marry an old codger who just arrived in town.

Citizen's Arrest:  This ep. is usually listed among TAGS best.  I don't really like it that much.  Gomer makes a ""citizen's arrest"" on Barney for making an illegal u-turn.  For PR reasons, Andy insists Barney write himself a ticket.  Barney becomes so angry he resigns.  Barney acts like a real jerk in this one.

Opie And His Merry Men:  Opie and his friends get some bad ideas about law enforcement from a hobo.

Barney And The Cave Rescue:  Thinking Andy and Helen are trapped in a cave, Barney organizes a rescue mission.  A good example of Andy doing whatever he can to help his deputy save face.

Andy & Opie's Pal:  Opie is jealous when Andy pays special attention to Opie's new friend.

Aunt Bee The Crusader:  A local farmer is about to be evicted and Aunt Bee organizes a protest: ""Just like the tree that's standing by the water, we shall not be moved.""  This one is one of my favorites.

Barney's Sidecar:  Barney gets a motorcycle and sidecar and endangers the lives and sanity of the Mayberry residents.  A top 5 episode on most TAGS fan favorite lists.

My Fair Ernest T. Bass:  Andy tries to pass off Ernest T. as a sophisticated fellow at a high society party.  Includes the famous line ""How do you do Mrs. Wiiiiley"" and Barney's observation of the women at the party: ""Fly a quail through here and every one of `em would point.""  A top 10 episode on most fan favorite lists.

Prisoner Of Love:  A female jewel thief pulls at Andy and Barney's heart strings while she's incarcerated in the Mayberry jail.

Hot Rod Otis: Otis and wheels do not mix.

The Song Festers:  The revelation that Gomer has a beautiful singing voice jeopardizes Barney's solo.

The Shoplifters: Weaver's department store is being robbed blind and Barney spends the night there and works under cover as a mannequin to crack the case.

 Andy's Vacation:  Andy is supposed to be relaxing reading the National Geographic but, with Barney and Gomer in charge, there is no rest for the weary, even when Andy camps out in the woods.

Andy Saves Gomer:  Andy saves Gomer from a little fire in the filling station and Gomer is so appreciative, Andy can't get rid of him.

Bargain Day:  Clara convinces Aunt Bee to buy tons of beef from a meat wholesaler, bypassing her friendly butcher.  When her freezer breaks down, she panics over the cost of repairing it causing Andy's famous advice: ""Call the man!""

Divorce, Mountain Style: Charlene Darling Wash divorces husband Dud and comes into town hoping to snag Andy as her new hubby.

A Deal Is A Deal: Opie and his friends get stuck selling worthless salve, but Barney and Gomer have a  plan.

Fun Girls:  The Fun Girls are back and Helen and Thelma Lou are jealous.  Goober makes his debut and this marks the only episode where Gomer and his cousin Goober appear together.  Goober also shows off his impersonation of Cary Grant: ""Judy, Judy, Judy""

The Return Of Malcolm Merriweather:  The Brit on the bike is back and tries to make Aunt Bee's life easier...maybe too easy.

The Rumor: Another episode where Barney starts the Andy getting married rumors; this time to Helen.

Barney and Thelma Lou, Phfftt: Barney makes a remark that he has Thelma Lou in his hip pocket.  When she hears about his, Thel dates Gomer to make Barney jealous.  The kiss a girl you have to get married thing is really silly.  Not one of my favorites.

Back to Nature:  Barney brags to Opie's camping buddies about what an expert man of nature he is and then gets lost in the woods with Gomer.

Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.  Where Gomer leaves Masyberry and Jim Nabors' new sitcom begins.",1127088000,172,6256,4.556756756756757
2403811,5,B000B6TTBE,"Just wondering after two wonderful releases if Paramount will continue to give us edited episodes, as with the release of Season Three?? This was such a great disappointment after waiting so many long years for uncut and complete episodes. Especially when as others have mentioned that some of these edited episodes have scenes included on TV Land that are missing from Paramount's Season Three release!! This is shameful!!

The series never placed lower than seventh in the Nielsen ratings and ended its final season at number one.

In 1964, daytime reruns began airing, The show was retitled Andy of Mayberry to distinguish the repeat episodes from the new episodes airing in prime time. As of 2016, the show has been seen in syndication for 52 years. This show is like MC Hammers, ""You can't touch this"".",1481241600,2,781,4.700729927007299

2403909,5,B000B6TTBE,"As one who grew up watching Andy Griffith, I thoroughly enjoy watching the first five season again ... and again.  It just never seems to get old.  I never really cared for the series after Don Knotts.  The magic in the show seemed to be a chemistry between Andy Griffith and Don Knotts that is quite rare.  Watching these episodes brings much laughter - it is no wonder that Don Knotts won several Emmys during his time on the series.  But the episodes also bring several tender moments.

There are many life lessons taught through these episodes, including the ever present theme of ""believe in others.""  In a world of TV today that seeks to tear down, destroy, ridicule and rule over others, a show where the main character spends time defending and protecting his bumbling sidekick, sometimes laying his own reputation on the line, is amazing.  And when Andy saved Barney's bacon and solved the problem, Andy would almost always give the credit publicly to Barney.  Not sure you'd see that in too many sitcoms today.  You can watch this show and feel good when its done.

The lessons for raising children should not go unnoticed. In one episode Andy gets upset with Opie who gets very mad at others because Opie did not win a race and is a ""sore loser.""  Andy teaches Opie that it's not about losing, but how you react that is more important.  Contrast that to what we teach kids today - everyone is a winner, everyone gets a trophy - there are no winners.  In today's world of finding someone else to take the blame or helping others find a way not to take responsibility, this series stands in stark contrast.  It teaches us to own our mistakes and failings while understanding it's not the end of the world and moving forward with the support of others.

It's amazing how much my young grand daughter enjoys watching Andy Griffith.  She enjoys the sophisticated kids shows of today, but she will ask if she can watch Andy Griffith, and then sit entranced by the show.

The quality of these DVDs is great, especially considering the technology that was used to originally record them.",1479600000,4,2090,4.617886178861789

Andy Griffith was a talented actor and from the accounts I have read a kind actor who helped Ron Howard. He was a singer as well as musician.
He was on stag and appeared in many sit com shows of the day, later became executive producer of one of the spin off shows of Andy Griffith show.
Don Knotts to many including me was a comic genius, him and Tim Conway starred in many Disney movies together and were an amazing comic team. He won 5 Emmy Awards for the Andy Griffith show 3 in the first 5 years of the series.

Ron Howard started his career at a mere 18 months old! He was a young 6 years old when he started the role of Opie Taylor. Ron's father insisted Ron attend normal public school and in high school he started dabbling in 8mm film making.

It was not the first role for any of the actors but it certainly was a GREAT ONE that still holds a special place in the hearts of many including me.

In earlier seasons, there are a fair number of episodes where Barney ends up with lipstick all over his face, surprisingly, but people would have to be pretty sheltered to find fault with this.

That being said, I am not real happy that I bought all these seasons, only to have Amazon Prime then go ahead and make them available as a prime member.  I have been a prime member for several years now, and these shows were only available for purchase or rental. I own the Amazon Fire TV, as well. I am just not happy with Amazon Prime doing that, with out issuing refunds to those prime members who purchased these shows and movies that are then added to the prime line up.

2404341,5,B000B6TTBE,This is perhaps my favorite season of one of the best sitcoms of all time. Jim Nabors as Gomer Pyle is featured in many episodes and his interaction with Don Knotts is especially memorable. This season also has the classic episode where Opie raises some baby birds after accidentally killing they're mother. Great memories here and well worth the investment to add to your collection.,1435968000,,384,4.923076923076923

Like Andy Griffith said once, it was a show that was based on love and they made sure that on every episode, there was a lesson to be learned. And there was. They don't make them like this anymore and that is a very sad thing. Entertainment being what it is today, where everything is at the extreme, and the censors don't have the authority they once had, people crave what is vulgar and lewd, and the fact that today's actors and television writers are not  of the same quality, these shows are something that will never be seen again.",1398211200,,606,4.315789473684211

Barny and Gomer get smarter in the later seasons.  They portray a life without diversity, so that is the only thing that can be annoying.  This is a simple show with simple plots and simple dialogue. I find the show to be relaxing and I watch it on my Kindle when I want to escape from the complexities of modern life.

Incidentally, the need to view some Andy Griffith show came up after I nick-named my son Barny Fife for chasing after his sister all day with a Nerf gun loaded with, you guessed it, one Nerf dart.

Other classics include (101) Opie the Birdman, (106) Citizen's Arrest and (112) Barney's Sidecar.

The addition of secondary characters like Gomer Pyle, Ernest T. Bass, Daphne and Skippy creates additional plot variety and opportunities for Andy, Barney, Aunt Bea and Opie to shine in new ways.

But even at the end of the series, I still enjoyed the episodes. The black and white years were the best. Also when Barney left, that was when the series stared to really loose it's fan base.

2404544,5,B000B6TTBE,"I was born and raised in Germany and still live there. But in 2007 I got the chance to go to the U.S. for four years to work there for my company.

One day I was zapping through the channels and suddenly I stopped because I thought I had just seen ""Matlock"" as a young man. There he was, Andy Griffith in black and white and sooooo young. I wondered because in Germany he is only known as Matlock, who is grey-haired and old already. The Andy Griffith Show has never been published (aired) in Germany or anywhere in Europe as far as I know. I did't know that Andy Griffith had a career before ""Matlock"".

I was done zapping and watched The Andy Griffith Show for a while and I really liked it. Soon I set up my VCR to record all episodes. I was simply hooked! Of couse I bought all my favorite 5 seasons over Amazon already, I really don' t like the colored ones and I miss Barney there, just isn't the same anymore. I wonder if Don Knotts ever regret to part from the show?

I find it amazing that I became such a huge fan, I mean I didn't grow up in the States, I don't know anything about the Sixties and the American lifestyle and mentality back then, but to me it is the most wonderful tv - series for the whole family, a treasure, just timeless! I would move right into Mayberry if I could!

My stay in the U.S. was in the South so I got used to the accent very well, however I cannot share my obsession for this tv - show with anyone of my friends or family here in Germany because the Southern accent is just too difficult to understand for them and there is no German language (synchronisation) available and never will be. I understand about 90 % of what they are saying and I wish there would be subtitles available since we don't have CC in Germany. At least then I would be able to read the words that I don't understand and then get the meaning or look them up.

So you guys here are the only ones who understand my passion!

Unfortunately, Andy Griffith died last week, so I guess only Ron Howard is left.

'''' R.i. P. Andy Griffith ''''

and thanks for hours and hours of your everlasting and never dying work that (now thanks to Paramount) will be in our living rooms as long as we live!

2404548,5,B000B6TTBE,"The Andy Griffith Show really hit its stride in the third and fourth seasons, as the creative, original, and highly funny episodes in this set clearly show.  The superb ensemble cast is on full display, as many of Season Four's episodes feature Gomer Pyle, Otis, Ernest T. Bass, the Darlings, the Fun Girls, and Malcolm Merriweather, who all have prominent roles when they appear.  Andy and Barney have their roles down to an art form by this season, playing off each other like experienced musicians.  And, Season Four has some of the funniest episodes in the show's history, including Ernest T. Bass Joins the Army, Gomer the House Guest, A Black Day for Mayberry (a.k.a., The Gold Truck), Citizen's Arrest, Barney's Sidecar, The Shoplifters, Andy Saves Gomer, and many others.  A couple of classic dramatic episodes include Opie the Birdman, Opie's Ill-Gotten Gain, and Aunt Bee the Crusader.  Sadly, Floyd doesn't appear until later in the season due to Howard McNear suffering a stroke, and he is noticeably affected by it when he does return.  Different as he seems from previous seasons, he's still one of the funniest characters on the show, and in TV history, as far as I'm concerned.  Finally, this season is the last for Gomer, as it concludes with the pilot episode of Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C., introducing the hilarious character, Sgt. Carter, and sending Gomer off with one of the funniest shows of the season.  If you like the show a lot, or even a little, you can't go wrong with Season Four.",1315612800,,1504,4.824902723735408

There are some exceptions (""Briscoe Declares For Aunt Bee"" or ""Prisoner of Love) but even the occasional mediocre story has its classic moments. My favorite episodes are ""The Haunted House"", ""Barney's Sidecar"", ""Up In Barney's Room"" , ""The Shoplifters"", ""Fun Girls"" and the hilarious ""A Date For Gomer"".",1267401600,,471,5.2105263157894735

Barney is useless, he's stupid, he lies and he hollers and screams all the time.  When the G Men come in and tell Andy that a truck of gold was coming through, and it was to be kept completely secret, Andy goes right a head and tells Barney, knowing that Barney can't keep quiet about anything.  Well, of course, Barney never listens to a word Andy says, and goes right ahead and starts talking.  Goober is no better.  His lips are never sealed, and they all talk, talk, talk all the time and soon the whole town knows.

For those who say to wait until the perfect set is released....They can wait and even if they make a perfect set these people will still not be happy about something.

2404580,5,B000B6TTBE,"I'm so glad these DVD box sets exist, because they gave a twenty-something such as myself the opportunity to become acquainted with one of America's finest television programs...

The story is set in the fictitious little town of Mayberry, North Carolina during the early 1960s. Sheriff Andy Taylor (played by Andy Griffith) is a widower with a small son. He asks his Aunt Bee (Frances Bavier) to move in with him and Opie (Ron Howard) as housekeeper and surrogate mother.

Many of the storylines center upon Opie's childhood dilemmas and coming-of-age situations. While Andy is quick to discipline his son, he is also understanding of the gray areas a child might encounter, and no matter the outcome of a situation, he strives to enforce in Opie the need for kindness and truth.

Other storylines focus upon Barney Fife (played by Don Knotts) as Andy's cousin and the town's deputy sheriff. Thanks to Barney's false pride and need to appear all-knowing, Andy spends much of his time trying to straighten out various situations that might otherwise have never occurred. Still, it's apparent that Barney has a good heart, and his sense of humor more than make up for the trouble he often stirs up.

Mayberry also includes a number of unique residents, such as Floyd, the kindhearted but vague barber; Otis, the town drunk who is trusted to let himself into his cell as needed; rock-throwing hillbilly Ernest T. Bass; and Barney's ever-patient girlfriend, Thelma Lou. In this season, goofy hillbilly auto mechanic Goober is also introduced - he's the cousin of Gomer (Jim Nabors), who left the show after only one season for his own spin-off, ""Gomer Pyle, USMC.""

If you haven't ever seen an episode of ""The Andy Griffith Show,"" give this box set a try! You'll soon be searching for further seasons.",1164499200,,1798,4.901315789473684
2404581,4,B000B6TTBE,"This set was originally released without laugh tracks on the following four episodes:

Disc 1
""Opie The Birdman"" and ""A Black Day For Mayberry""

Disc 2
""Opie's Ill-Gotten Gain"" and ""Up In Barney's Room.""

2404582,5,B000B6TTBE,"One of the most beloved shows in television history, The Andy Griffith Show takes its viewers back to a simpler time of small town America, apple pie, and black and white television... The trademark whistling theme song is one of the most recognizable in history, and the duration of the show in syndicated reruns is unrivaled by its peers. The Andy Griffith Show follows the exploits of the small town of Mayberry and its family values, no nonsense sheriff Andy. Widowed, and father to a small boy named Opie (Ron Howard), Andy is joined in Mayberry by his sidekick Deputy Barney Fife, his relative and housekeeper Aunt Bee (Frances Bavier), and a host of other eccentric characters.

But the show stealer is Barney Fife (Don Knotts) who plays the role of a sometimes incompetent, kooky deputy always in over his head. The onscreen dynamic between Griffith and Knotts is truly magical. Both men would go on to heralded careers in show business with Knotts starring in numerous roles, such as Mr. Furley on Three's Company, and Griffith as the title star of Matlock. And Ron Howard (Opie) would go on to establish himself as one of Hollywood's most well-known directors...

The Andy Griffith Show (Season 4) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Opie the Birdman"" in which Opie becomes the adoptive father of several orphaned baby birds after he inadvertently kills their mother with his slingshot. Developing a personal attachment to the birds, Opie struggles with the notion that once they're grown, he'll have to set them free... Other notable episodes include ""Barney's Sidecar"" in which Barney acquires a sidecar for his motorcycle a local auction, but his daily antics quickly have all of Mayberry up in arms, and ""Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C."" in which Gomer Pyle joins the Marine Corps in order to become a man, but he's failing miserably until Andy convinces the drill instructor to take Gomer under his wing...

2404590,5,B000B6TTBE,"Mayberry's about as close as you can come to heaven on this Earth, and Season Four of The Andy Griffith Show (1963-64) takes you back for 32 glorious episodes with all of our old friends and a few new ones, as well.  I wouldn't say Season Four was the best season, but every single episode is still a definite good'un.  I could talk about all 32 of them, but I will force myself to pick and choose a few from among them all.

This season includes two of the official top ten favorite TAGS episodes, but I have several favorites among the others.  Citizen's Arrest is probably the biggest fan favorite episode of them all, although Opie the Birdman can also claim a spot among TV Guide's list of the top ten episodes in television history.  The latter is a quintessential coming of age story in which Opie learns that his actions can have huge consequences and that he must take responsibility for the mistakes he makes.  I would have to put The Haunted House among my own personal favorites, though - as Barney's and Gomer's adventures inside that spooky old house are hilarious (and if you want more of the same kind of side-splitting comedy, just check out Don Knotts in The Ghost and Mr. Chicken).  Ernest T. Bass fans will be happy to know that he comes down from the mountains in two Season Four episodes.  First, he tries to join the army because he wants a uniform to impress the ladies - that doesn't work, and Andy ends up trying to reform him and pass him off as a gentleman at one of Mrs. Wiley's socials.  Barney delivers what I consider the funniest line in television history in this particular episode.  You also get two episodes featuring the Darlings.  First, Briscoe Darling declares for Aunt Bee, much to her chagrin; then, later on, Andy comes dangerously close to marrying Charlene after he accidentally helps her get a mountain-style divorce.  And the Fun Girls - how could I almost forget the Fun Girls?  They prove to be only one source of trouble to Andy's and Barney's relationships with Helen and Thelma Lou.  Even good ole' Gomer, who just had his first bona fide date (with Thelma Lou's cousin) in A Date for Gomer gets himself caught in a lovers' triangle with Barney and Thelma Lou.

There are plenty of vintage Barney shenanigans going on throughout this fourth season: Citizen's Arrest, Barney's vintage motorcycle/sidecar for catching speeders, lots of great Barney-Otis interactions, several criminals allowed to escape (temporarily) - yet Barney still comes out a hero (thanks to Andy) in episodes such as Barney and the Cave Rescue and Back to Nature.  For his part, Gomer really came into his own in this, his final, season on the show - Season Four's finale is essentially the pilot for Gomer Pyle, USMC.  Taking his place at Wally's filling station, of course, would be his cousin Goober, who makes his first appearance in this season's Fun Girls  episode - and it's quite a memorable one, thanks to his Cary Grant imitation.

Well, as you can see, all kinds of good times are waiting for you right here in Season Four - and this is one television show you could watch every day for years and years and still heartily enjoy, no matter how many times you've already seen a given episode.  Once you've been to Mayberry, you know that The Andy Griffith Show isn't just a television show; it's a way of life.",1138665600,5,3344,4.616554054054054

The picture keeps fluttering and is especially noticable on the episodes I have watched so far like...BARNEY'S SIDECAR, PRISONER OF LOVE and HOT ROD OTIS.

It's actually sad that Paramount has the rights to The Andy Griffith Show, and released it like this. Of course, I'm complaining about the sloppy production of the DVD box set with missing laugh tracks and strange editing.

The missing laugh tracks give the episodes an eerie atmosphere, and the sloppy editing is just plain annoying.

Viewers should and will be outraged at the chipping away of pieces of what is the equivalent Hope Diamond of vintage television.

If the executives quell their thirst for short-term corporate profits, a real attempt can be made to restore the episodes and release them in their pristine original condition. C'mon Paramount, with this release you've proved that you're greedy pigs at the money trough. Can't you see if you did this properly your sales will be higher over the long term.

Paramount, if you don't want to do it correctly, let someone else do it who will.

Of course, you can call me a sheep because I like the show so well that I would have bought it anyway even if I didn't receive it as a gift.

Rated: 5 stars for the show, 1 star for the feeble DVD attempt.

Season Four is my least favorite of the five seasons Don Knotts starred in (despite the appearance of the absolute classic episode ""Opie the Birdman""), so Paramount would have had to release this perfectly for me to give it four stars.

The Andy Griffith Show is brilliant. Like The Twilight Zone that appeared at the same time, The Andy Griffith Show represents the finest writing and acting television has to offer. It's been 45 years since The Andy Griffith Show debuted, and yet I can still watch -- and love -- these episodes over and over again.

Point: Paramount has an obligation to treat these DVDs with the respect they deserve. Moreover, they have an obligation to the millions of fans of the show to do the best job they can possible do.

Recommendation to Paramount: PLEASE do a better job next time around.

Recommendation to Amazon: PLEASE tell those from whom you buy product that you won't accept anything slipshod or defective. Demand the very best and you may get it.

One has been mentioned in reviews already, and that is the absence of laugh tracks on several of the episodes. To me, it smacks of unprofessionalism and a cavalier attitude toward TAGS itself. Also,in the graphics inserts that accompany the discs, each has a different Mayberry theme - Floyd's Barber shop, Camping in the woods, etc. But the insert that is supposed to depict the often-discussed town diner, is called the Snappy Lunch diner. The diner in the show has always been called The Bluebird Diner as far as I know, so what gives? Is this just another example of Paramount's careless attitude? I mean, how hard is it for them to check something like this out? To TAGS fans, this is not just a small detail that doesn't matter. It's further proof that Paramount could give a you-know-what about this classic series, and just is out to make money off of trusting, loyal fans.",1135641600,13,998,4.6440677966101696

But this time, Paramount has stretched even my patience. What were they thinking? How can you take out the laugh tracks in not one, but FOUR of the episodes? What ""suit"" approved this? As I have been reading other reviews, I have to agree that some type of compensation is in order, though money is not the factor as to why we have purchased these DVD's in the first place. This particular boxed set of Season Four needs to be returned to Paramount, and a corrected version needs to be sent back to all of us.

 That said, what's going on with this set? I noticed it was missing from Amazon for a few days. I thought perhaps the missing laugh track problem was going to be corrected and maybe Amazon was returning the originals.

Without the laughter I found it easier to focus on the character's expressions and boy when Andy tries to put Barney in his place I had never noticed the really ugly looks Barney gives him.  In this way the absence of a laugh track changed the show in a subtle way I did not like at all.  Made some of the humor seem almost mean-spirited.

My thanks to ""RowMan (Torrance, CA United States)"" for the corrected laugh track replacement disc program info.  I placed my letter with proof of purchase in my home mail box on 06.13.06 and received via DHL my replacement discs on 06.23.06, a mere 8 business days.  Major kudos to Paramount for taking corporate responsibility for the missing laugh tracks debacle.  The transfers are still subpar but at least they are complete.  But I still say...vvv

What kind of QA/QC does Paramount Home Video have anyway?  I noticed on the 4th season of the Brady Bunch, some episodes had striations (scatchy lines)  indicating to me a rush, rush release job.  And now this mess with the missing laugh tracks on TAGS #4.  Is Paramount trying to compete with Universal Home Video and Disney Home Video for the CQA (Crummy Quality Award)?

Now I haven't seen a single set in the retail market and my 2 week old order from Amazon still is pending.  Is this a sign that perhaps Paramount has fixed the problem?  Also Amazon now says the set usually ships in 24 hours.  I will definately update if my set is correct.  Otherwise, I say a class action suit is in order; not for free DVD sets but for getting what we paid for.

UPDATE:  12/13/05

Okay, my set finally came yesterday and everyone is right; the missing laugh tracks ARE no laughing matter.  Watching ""Opie, The Bird Man"" without the canned laughter is just painful.  This ommision is ""paramount"" to leaving out the musical score.  I can't figure how such a gross error in production could happen.  Some incompetent dummy at Paramount needs to lose their job over this.

Paramount may have unwittingly or willingly violated the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 by violating the Digital Rights Management of the original author.  Tampering with Intellectual Property Rights is a federal offense. I have just written Paramount on behalf of all regarding the issues at hand and will update if/when a I receive a response.

Update - 8 weeks later and still no response from Paramount to my letter.  I'll gamble 39 cents and try again and let you know.

2404603,5,B000B6TTBE,"This 5-Disc DVD collection of ""The Andy Griffith Show: The Complete Fourth Season"" spans 32 black-and-white episodes, with the conclusion of this season marking the halfway point in the show's eight-year TV network lifespan.

Like all of the previous ""Andy"" DVD full-season boxed sets issued by Paramount Home Entertainment, this 4th-Season batch dishes up outstanding video quality, along with fun and stylish packaging for the assortment of discs.

But Paramount goofed by letting four of these TAGS episodes slide out the door without the laugh tracks being included on the DVDs. An odd omission, especially since it affects just a small handful of shows. But I'm certainly glad it's not more than that, because to my ears, an ""Andy"" show just doesn't sound quite ""right"" without the artificially-induced laughter in place. I'm accustomed to it being there for each show. You can tell something's amiss, and the dead-quiet that follows a funny gag or joke just seems....wrong.

And it IS wrong too. I had thought that perhaps ""Opie The Birdman"" was originally broadcast without a laugh track, due to its subject matter being a bit more serious in nature than most TAGS shows. But I've cross-checked the ""Birdman"" episode via a print recorded off of TV-Land, and the ""canned laughter"" IS on there. So it should have been included on the DVD. I also checked alternate TV prints for each of the other three episodes that are missing the laugh track on this DVD set (""A Black Day For Mayberry"", ""Opie's Ill-Gotten Gain"", and ""Up In Barney's Room"" -- all of which are on either Disc 1 or Disc 2 of this set), and each of those shows is definitely supposed to have the laughter on its soundtrack as well.

I also discovered a small portion within another episode where the laugh track is missing too -- the epilogue segment for ""The Sermon For Today"" contains no laughter on the DVD (and a small part of that show just prior to the epilogue lacks the laugh track as well). However, the laughter IS there for the bulk of that program on Disc #1. Very strange.

This laugh-track manufacturing blunder by Paramount is certainly not a good thing. It's akin to an ""edited"" broadcast in my view, because the laugh track is designed to be placed into certain portions of each and every Andy Griffith program; and there's an awkward ""feel"" when the laughter is not in the proper locations throughout the shows.

A TV show's laugh track is an integral part of the ambience and background of each episode. And while laughter from a live studio audience is always much better than ""canned cackles"", TAGS needs those laugh tracks to make each show ""complete"", IMHO. It's as if a sound effect or the background musical bridges from the show suddenly went AWOL, to my way of thinking. And who would want the sound of Barney's gun accidentally going off to suddenly be silenced on the soundtrack? Not me.*

Any Edited Scenes? --- I don't think any of these episodes have been trimmed or edited in any fashion (time-wise anyway). But, I can't quite figure out why the ""Sermon"" episode only runs for 24:08 here -- although it appears to me that nothing has been edited out (save the laughter for the epilogue). Several episodes, in fact, within this set have running times under 25 minutes. But the epilogues are all intact. So, if some small snippets of some scenes are absent, I haven't been able to spot what they are. Plus, there's no disclaimer printed on the Season-Four packaging (as there was for the third-season DVD set) saying ""Some Episodes May Be Edited"". So that fact should be a good sign that we're getting every last second of each episode here.

When this Season-Four set is fully examined, and despite the missing laughter on four (plus) episodes, I would still definitely recommend purchasing this otherwise very nice Andy Griffith Show DVD collection.

The video looks great here. All of these episodes have excellent picture and sound. Although it looks to me as if the ending credits for many of these episodes have been taken from prints that differ slightly from the prints used for the ""body"" of each show. In many instances, the closing credits look darker than the rest of the show (and a little bit more ""dirt-filled""). But, overall, Paramount has provided some fine TAGS prints for this DVD set (as has been the case for all of the previously-released seasons of TAGS on DVD as well).

Note re. the Opening Credits -- The Main Titles that we see used for all of these Season-Four episodes couldn't possibly have been filmed during the fourth year of the series (because Opie is way yonder too little here). It looks like the exact same opening that was used for Season #2 and Season #3. But, I think that the syndicated prints of Season 4 use this same ""Younger Opie"" title sequence too. So, perhaps CBS just didn't film a new opening every season. I am not certain. Anyway, that's not an Earth-shaking matter to be overly concerned with, IMO. Just some Andy main-title food for thought.

ABOUT THE EPISODES:

When perusing this fourth-season compilation of Andy Griffith entries (which originally aired in 1963-1964 on CBS-TV), several episodes stand out as true ""classics"", including both the first and last programs during this season, which provide a very fitting set of ""bookend"" episodes for this wonderful campaign of Andy shows -- ""Opie The Birdman"" and ""Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C."".

The ""Birdman"" episode (September 30, 1963) kicks off the fourth year of the series in fine fashion (despite the missing laugh track here), in a show that gives us the best example yet of young 9-year-old Ronny Howard's tremendous acting abilities. Ron was probably the best ""kid actor"" I have ever seen, and that talent can easily be seen in the ""Birdman"" episode, which has Opie (Ronny) accidentally killing a bird with his slingshot, and faced with the consequences (and grief) of his actions. A truly memorable and heart-warming program.

The season draws to a close with ""Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C."" (May 18, 1964), which served as the official ""spin-off"" episode for the TV series of the same name, which debuted on the CBS network on September 25, 1964, and ran for five seasons and 150 programs, including several ""T.A.G.S. crossover"" episodes, with Andy, Opie, and even Aunt Bee popping up at ""Camp Henderson"" to visit Gomer (and to aggravate Sergeant Vincent Carter).

The popularity of the ""Gomer Pyle"" character (played to imbecilic, dim-witted perfection by Jim Nabors) can quickly be assessed by the fact that Gomer was able to secure his very own spin-off TV series after appearing in ""The Andy Griffith Show"" over the course of just one-and-a-half seasons.

Some of the funniest episodes during this season of ""TAGS"" revolve around the simplistic (and hilarious) gas-station attendant, Mr. Pyle. Such as: ""A Date For Gomer"", ""Gomer The House Guest"", ""The Song Festers"", ""Andy Saves Gomer"", and the very funny ""Citizen's Arrest"" (which features Barney Fife's hysterical impersonation of Gomer). Plus, of course, as previously mentioned, the season finale, which represented the ""pilot"" for Gomer's new series.

Some of my other favorite shows from this Andy Griffith campaign include: ""The Haunted House"", ""Barney's Sidecar"", ""Hot Rod Otis"", ""Up In Barney's Room"", ""Fun Girls"", ""The Rumor"", ""A Black Day For Mayberry"", and ""The Sermon For Today"".

There are no bonus DVD extras included in this set. Nary a single ""Sponsor Spot"" (i.e., the type of cast commercials that accompanied the DVD sets for seasons two and three). But, perhaps the cast didn't film any commercials for Season 4. I'm not sure about that.

PACKAGING:

The 32 shows are spread out over five single-sided DVDs, with either six or seven episodes placed on each disc. The discs are held inside three individual plastic ""slim"" cases, with the first two cases each containing two DVDs. The three plastic cases then slide into a nice outer cardboard box (slipcase).

There's a ""Mayberry newspaper"" packaging theme used for Season 4, with the back cover of each slim case designed to represent a page of ""The Mayberry News"". The episode titles are shown as if they are a part of this widely-circulated North Carolina newspaper. :-)

Plus, there are some photos and TAGS-related articles integrated into the ""newspaper"". It's a fun, clever, and nice-looking packaging design used here. (Although, I believe Mayberry's local paper is called the ""Gazette"", rather than the ""Mayberry News"". Oh, well. No matter. The cases look cool regardless of the newspaper's moniker.)

The front of each slim case sports a different TAGS image, relating to a show that can be found on one of the discs inside that specific case. And the spines of these plastic cases are all different colors (unlike the first three Andy DVD sets), which adds a nice, colorful touch to the overall look of this package.

Episode information is located in three different places on the various pieces of Season-Four packaging. There's a very handy roster of all of the shows listed on the back of the outer slipcase box (laid out in disc-by-disc fashion). Episode titles are also shown, as previously noted, on the back of each of the three slim cases; plus a more-detailed description of each disc's programs can be found on the inside of each plastic case (underneath each DVD).

Another small (but nice) thing I might mention with regard to this Andy set is the fact that the DVD ""security tag"" device has been changed from the sticky black tag to the loose ""paper"" type of theft-preventing thing-a-ma-jig. Every Paramount TV-DVD boxed set I've purchased prior to this one has had that dang black tag glued to the cardboard cover on the innards of the slipcase (which was pert-near impossible to get off without ripping the box). I was very glad to see this much-better paper security tag used for this boxed set. Hopefully the ""no sticky tags"" trend continues for future Paramount DVD boxed sets. (Of course, the ""sticky"" ones wouldn't be a problem to deal with either, if Paramount would simply put them inside one of the plastic cases, instead of insisting upon attaching the things to the outer cardboard case itself.)

MORE DVD INFORMATION/SPECIFICATIONS:

VIDEO -- Full Frame; 1.33:1 (the originally-aired TV aspect ratio).

COLOR OR B&W? -- All episodes are presented in their original ""glorious black-and-white"". ;)

AUDIO -- English only (in Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono).

MENUS -- Silent. No animation. No Sub-Menus. The Main Menu serves double duty as the ""Episode Selection"" Menu. .... And: There are no forced or semi-forced trailers to deal with at the start of any of these DVDs, which is nice. Paramount, this time 'round, didn't make its DVD ads part of the automatic disc load-up. Instead, the viewer gets to choose either ""Previews"" or ""Main Menu"" just after Disc 1 loads up. (Which, actually, is still semi-silly in this case, as it was for the Season-Three TAGS set as well, because there's a ""Previews"" option also available from Disc One's Main Menu. So the DVD advertisements can still be easily accessed even if you go straight to the Main Menu. The total run time for the three DVD Previews included on the first disc is 2:48.) .... The Paramount logo and the proverbial FBI Warning are still disc-loading nuisances that the studio won't allow anyone to avoid...but other than that, I have no complaints about Menu structure at all. A nice job overall, Paramount. :)

""PLAY ALL"" FEATURE? -- Yes.

CHAPTER STOPS ON ALL EPISODES? -- Yes (five chapter breaks per show).

SUBTITLES/CAPTIONS -- No DVD Player-created subtitles are included on these discs, but English ""Closed-Captioning"" is available for all episodes.

BOOKLET/INSERT INCLUDED? -- No.

------------------

In A Nutshell.........

This is the fourth excellent ""TAGS"" season in a row -- and although I'm not pleased with Paramount's obvious boo-boo regarding the omission of some of the laugh tracks, I'm fairly certain that DVD collectors who are partial to Andy, Barney, Opie, Aunt Bee, and the rest of Mayberry's funny inhabitants will still want to acquire the rights to a copy of ""The Andy Griffith Show: The Complete Fourth Season"". The AWOL laugh tracks notwithstanding, this otherwise-spiffy DVD collection from Paramount Home Entertainment should satisfy nearly all Andy Griffith fans.

Although not as bad as the pitiful offering of some edited episodes in the Season Three set, this ""The Andy Griffith Show: The Complete Fourth Season"" box set has a missing laugh track on four of the episodes.  How does this happen?  I can almost picture a board meeting room full of stuffed shirts tossing out ideas on new and unique ways that Paramount can drive fans of ""The Andy Griffith Show"" absolutely nuts!  Someone says ""Hey!  How about if we leave off the laugh track on a few shows?""  The President then claps him on the back and with a big smile on his face says ""I love it!  How about a 20% pay raise for that great idea, Johnson?""  However, I guess I'll have to give them the benefit of the doubt that it was in fact an error.

As some other reviewers have pointed out, it's true that it really isn't THAT big of a deal.  However, it still was highly avoidable and is very annoying!  Whoever is in charge of quality control at Paramount Home Entertainment should be given a serious talking to about the way that the TAGS DVD's have been handled lately.

On the positive side, at least the episodes ARE complete this time.  There are no missing clips or epilogues in any of them.

Update:I returned my set then ordered it again.. Why? because I have waited so long for this series to come out that I'm going to accept this season 4 without laugh tracks, thank you Paramount for nothing. You kinda forced me into this because I own all the other seasons and have pre-ordered season 5 so what good would this be without season 4, I'm not laughing

update:to all those that think the missing laugh tracks are no big deal, first no I don't need to be told when to laugh that is not what this is about! If you allow this then what next? Missing dialogues? I know these episodes word for word (as it appears so do others) so I guess it would be ok if Paramount left out some of the dialogue ""after all"" we all know these episodes line by line. So go ahead and encourage poor products to be produced. If it was an option like MASH then so be it, you had a choice but this wasn't this was poor production of a classic that encluded laugh tracks! Shows that didn't use laugh as mention in other reviews well dah! How can you miss something that wasn't there, the laugh tracks however were on these but now they are not = poor production. And finally yes there were only 4 episodes BUT pretty much all on one disc, do the math poor production. Good Night and Good Luck

Altogether a good season that many of us hold dear now and for many years to come.",1525219200,,354,3.863013698630137

8082720,1,B000B6TTBE,"5 stars for the show but only one star for the packaging of the DVDs.  As I proceeded to unwrap it part of the cover broke off in my hand and, when I opened the box, the dvds were not secured inside.  This wasn't the case when I purchased seasons 2 and 3 a few years ago.  The price of the boxed sets have gone down considerably since then, so the cheaper construction shouldn't have been surprising - but it was disappointing nonetheless.",1513900800,,439,4.265060240963855

8082722,5,B000B6TTBE,"The Andy Griffith Show is unique in a sense that it started out fun and has all the standard encounters and stories that most TV programs had but it has never deteriorated or got so left field, as to lose its appeal. Every show is entertaining and usually carries a message.

A lot of other programs spun off from the characters that played in this series. And you always think that Opie Taylor (Ronny Howard) is always young. Everyone knows that they issued Deputy Barney fife ""1960-1965"" (Don Knotts) one bullet that has seen a lot of action in his pocket. Too many people to name here.

This series will bring back old memories or can also create some new ones.",1506643200,,664,4.479338842975206
