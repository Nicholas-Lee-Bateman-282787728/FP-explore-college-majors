6308266,4,B00J0IQISG,"Almost a decade ago, on Christmas Day, as many Americans celebrated or worshiped with their families and tore open presents, the few and the proud headed to their local multiplex to watch Wolf Creek, a controversial and ultra-brutal suspense film imported from Australia concerning a lone-wolf hunter whose well-honed Crocodile Dundee exterior, used to woo wayward travelers, disguises a brutal taste for rape, murder, and mayhem.  I was among those who saw the film opening day.  The late Roger Ebert gave it zero stars, saying it gave him the urge ""to vomit and cry at the same time.""  I found it frightening on a genuine, almost profound level and therefore a rousing cinematic experience, however grim, however hard.

Now there is a second film, and it is available on demand in advance of a very limited theatrical release next month (an illumination of a major shift in the way most modest genre films are released in this day and age).  In my opinion, it is almost on par with the first.  It is a faster-paced film since there is no longer a great deal of mystery encircling the antagonist (once again played with foul, sunburned glee by John Jarratt):  we know his masculine shrimp-on-the-barbie charm is bull, and we know his presence will always result in death and destruction.  To be honest, this reduces the apocalyptic, to-the-bone impact which set the slowly burning, yet indelible part one apart, but this film compensates by functioning as a nonstop, gore-coated popcorn entertainment.  Car chases, foot chases, eleventh-hour escapes, body-bruising fights.  One gives way to the other and then again in this feature-length game of cat-and-mouse, and the noose of desperation tightens each time.  Beneath the label of horror, this is as exciting as nearly any action film.  And once again the entire enterprise is elevated by the locations:  Australia's vast and unforgiving deserts are shot in such a way as to convey an enormous, organic hostility, as if this is a place several miles beyond conventional understandings of humanity and society.  The sunsets are as beautiful as they are foreboding.",1397865600,,2116,5.043103448275862
6308267,5,B00J0IQISG,"Holy crap, I am absolutely amazed and thrilled to see a horror movie sequel that is actually GOOD instead of being not so great or even worse. Let's go back to Wolf Creek 1 when it was first released in 2005, this horror movie was actually an instant classic with true horror fans since this movie was not loved by all because I'm sure the non-horror fan audience was expecting more of a SAW like movie but what's so unique about Wolf Creek 1 is the fact that it is actually based on true events. Now Wolf Creek 2 has been getting a ton of great positive buzz from several people who saw the movie at festivals and such. I wanted to buy Wolf Creek 2 from Amazon but for some reason Amazon didn't allow anyone to rent the movie on 4/17 because it was nowhere to be found but I was easily able to find it on my living room television through the cable provider and rented it for $9.99 which includes 48 hour rental as well. Anyways, this movie delivered exactly what a horror sequel should be and I seriously hope directors/writers/etc are taking notes from the director Greg Mclean because he absolutely delivered. The best part about this sequel is that the director didn't rush because this sequel came out 9 WHOLE years after the first movie which is perfect. Honestly, I am not a fan of rushed sequels because even though the excitement is there but the actual film will most likely fail or even worse by going straight to dvd. I personally believe it's best to wait awhile before releasing a sequel because it can create more interest, more buzz and hopefully deliver a good film as well because by the looks of Wolf Creek 2 so far, it's been doing very well! I cannot wait for the 3rd movie if it ever happens and you will see what I mean after you watch this film! Once again, RENT THIS MOVIE! Please support this awesome horror movie for true horror fans since the horror industry is actually blowing up these days and it can be hard to get a decent horror film every now and then. Oh make sure you watch the first movie before you watch this one, trust me it's  perfect! The best thing about this sequel is the lead character, Mick Taylor who is played by the talented John Jarratt since he absolutely delivers a truly horrifying performance!",1397865600,16,2250,4.408653846153846

6308269,5,B00J0IQISG,"This is by far the best horror/slasher film I have seen so far this year and have a feeling it will make my top 5 of the year. In this sequel the action and gore start 10 minutes into the film unlike the first one where as it took almost an hour. It has one of the most brutal and realistic dismemberment scenes I have ever witnessed in a slasher film plus decapitations and the good ole ""head on a stick trick"".

Mick is at it again ,ridding Australia of ""tourist vermin"" and he let's no one get in his way,no one is safe from his vile actions. Whether he's in his hunting truck,stolen semi,horseback or on foot.

 The original is a classic but I believe this will be as well. The pace of the film is perfect and we get a lot more action and a lot more kills and gore in this film.if your a slasher lover its not to be missed.",1397433600,26,827,4.030487804878049

6308296,3,B00J0IQISG,"Judged by body count alone, Wolf Creek 2 is hardly the most cutting-edge serial-killer horror flick out there.

Aussie helmer Greg Mclean treats us to only eight on-screen killings in this effective, harrowing sequel to his stunning 2005 sleeper hit.

What distinguishes Mclean's work is the sheer level of soul-crushing nastiness, gore, overall grue - and slapstick humor - that each murder imposes on the viewer.

The latest entry in the (sickly) rich redneck-psycho-killer-on-the-rampage subgenre engendered four decades ago by The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Mclean's picture continues the story of Mick Taylor, a fiercely nationalist Australian who wants to cleanse the continent of all foreigners. Also back is Mick's trademark weapon, a massive Bowie knife that he deploys with passion, love, and poetic tenderness as he stalks, hunts, and guts backpackers, killing the men and carrying off the women to his underground lair.

John Jarratt is terrific as Mick, a garrulous, back-slapping Outback hunter who chats up tourists with an oily bonhomie that camouflages his evil intent.

In quick order, Mick dispatches two highway patrolmen, a young German couple, a truck driver, and an elderly couple. But he's bewildered when his next target, English surfer Paul (Ryan Corr), evades him.

After being treated to an intense and perversely pleasurable game of cat-and-mouse, we finally get to see the pair mano-a-mano inside Mick's dungeon, which is filled with the broken bodies - some dead, some half alive - of more than a dozen emaciated women.

Paul is not a tough guy. He can't fight. But he fascinates Mick when, on the verge of death, he begins singing bawdy English and Australian limericks.

That's when we enter Looney Tunes territory. Mick breaks out the whiskey and draws Paul into a wicked, twisted game of Jeopardy!

Mclean has a no-nonsense approach to horror. Wolf Creek 2, which is based partly on several Australian serial-killer cases from the last three decades, is a fast-moving, lean killing machine that will delight genre fans.",1478476800,,2052,5.2317073170731705
6308297,2,B00J0IQISG,"I love horror.  The first Wolf Creek was so creepy that I had to have the second.

6308302,2,B00J0IQISG,"Finally I got to see Wolf Creek 2 tonight and sadly I thought it was massively disappointing. I loved the first film especially the tone of it and after the opening scene in this with the cops I was excited but it went down hill for me pretty quickly.

 Nearly ten years between movies and this one felt like it was written in an afternoon. The storyline was disjointed, the casting horrendous, the gore way down to the point of being implied (my copy is MA) and McLean basically turned Mick Taylor into a cartoon character. I was cringing at the over the top ocker stereotype he's been turned into to appeal to international audiences reminiscent of Steve Irwin's shtick.

 Unfortunately I didn't appreciate much of this uninspired slap dash hodge podge affair which reeks more of a financial decision to try and create a franchise (left open for a sequel, two origin books, possible TV series etc) rather than a genuine desire to honour the brilliant first movie.",1463702400,,965,4.6923076923076925

Taylor's ocker nature has a morbid charm to it as he hacks the flesh of his victims and comments on some of its quality. The cinematography captures some of Australia's unique landscape and this sets distinctive scenes for the film's shallow plot. The urgency of trying to escape Taylor provides some intense situations and this ensures the movie has its share of gripping moments.

6308328,1,B00J0IQISG,"One of the stupidest non-movies I've ever seen, and I've seen some pretty stupid excuses for horror movies. It's a non-movie because there is no story and no character development of any kind. It's mostly filler (the drawn out car / truck chases, the quizz game, etc), in between pointless torture porn scenes.

The ghouls among you will enjoy the realistic looking gratuitous violence. Anyone with a brain will cringe at the appalling dialogue and attempted humorous one liners from the lead villain, who is actually one of the worst over-actors I've ever seen. Not to mention his being retarded enough to let his prey escape every time, then magically appearing against all likelihood in the wide open spaces of the outback to recapture them.

Cultural cringe is heavy in this. I know the writers / directors were trying to be meaningful by making some statement about xenophobia but it was so hamfisted. This villain, despite the violence, is too utterly ridiculous to be threatening (cut those stupid sideburns off if you make another one of these abortions, please.)

While admittedly scary and suspenseful in certain parts, and better than most movies in this genre, that's almost outweighed by heavyhanded (almost suffocating) gore and grisly, hard-to-watch violence (especially the NR version).  An ideal scary movie would be one with more shocks and fear of the unknown (there's no mystery here, no puzzle to solve) versus what would even make a general surgeon queasy.  And although it sounds odd, this movie's sense of humor is hard to find, unlike, say, ""An American Werewolf in London,"" which contained just the right mix of suspense, humor, and violence to leave the viewer wanting to see it again.  This movie will likely not leave you wanting more (I can't imagine someone possibly buying a copy of this movie or getting it as a present!).

He actually takes one of his projects ""home"" to have some fun and a few tankards of high octane whiskey.  Mick's digs make Ed Gein's place look like House Beautiful.

These types of movies need to follow one important rule, they should be no longer than 96 minutes tops.  They are not rocket science and most people will eventually think two things , one this is impossible and wouldn't happen and two most people aren't into watching people get tortured for that long. Having said that though If your a fan of the original I totally recommended watching you won't be blown away but you will get something from it.

6308387,4,B00J0IQISG,"It's almost sad to say but this is probably the best horror movie sequel that I've seen in the last few years.  So many horror sequels are given over to no-talent, 'never directed or even watched a horror movie' directors that try to do too much or too little.  At least Greg McLean did what was needed and directed, co-wrote, and co-produced his own sequel.  I loved the original Wolf Creek and it's probably one of the best horror films of the last decade.  Wolf Creek 2 is not on that list but it's not bad for a sequel.  It has plenty of action and gore and spends little, but enough, time with character development.  Afterall, this is a horror movie, not an award bound drama.  I recommend this movie to any fans of the first film but it's more of a rental than a buy.  John Jarratt makes a great villain and the fact that his character is believable for being so simple just shows how good of an actor he is.  He pulls it off flawlessly.  Whether non-horror fans want to believe it or not, it does take talent to do a good job at portraying a horror movie villain.  A large percentage of horror movies are worthless just because the bad guy is not good at being a bad guy.  They often try too hard to be scary and therefore, aren't scary at all. Anyone that's seen Jarratt in other movies where he plays a completely different role can verify that he's a well-rounded actor, as well.  Anyway, you should know by now if this looks like a movie for you or not.  If you're into horror movies, check it out.  It may not be the best movie you watch this year, but it won't be the worst either.",1413676800,,1595,4.235099337748345

I liked the opening scene where he shoots and kills a cop and then torches the other but after that the movie goes downhill for me.  Mick is angry that a surfer boy from England stopped to save one of his targets so even after he kills the intended victim he continually chases the man throughout the movie in a semi, on horseback and in his underground maze of tunnels.  While some of the jokes worked especially with an eye popping scene involving a semi and kangaroos the rest of the movie just kind of coasted to a real disappointing finish.

6308461,5,B00J0IQISG,"Even after having bought and seen the first of this ""mini series"" of Wolf Creek, I was more, much more, surprised at the content of this one, Wolf Creek 2. I think that the movie has gone over the top in portraying what is supposed to be a movie based on a true event.
I live here in the Northern Territory, as the crow flies, not all that far from the scene of the crime, Wolf Creek. Don't get me wrong, I do recall the ""true story"" actual event. A series of crimes of this nature really did happen. However, the films hierarchy have taken it upon themselves to upgrade this event to something of an impossibility. You see, the actual event was similar (in some ways) to that portrayed in this movie as well as the first movie.
Both of these movies lead the viewer to ask, ""How could so many people disappear and die without the culprit being caught?"" The scale of death and destruction depicted in the two movies is NOT reality. It has been made this way as a huge attention getter. In truth, I loved the first movie and definitely loved this one.

In the original Wolf Creek which l accidentally happened upon without ever hearing of, the audience gets plenty of that, as well as tons of suspense. This version doesn't even allow suspense to build. It's the equivalent of watching a mentally deranged spree killer on the loose in a town with very little law enforcement. Sort of akin to watching a Friday the 13th movie. The realistic feel is somehow removed, turning this into just another slasher flick. How disappointing.",1405987200,4,631,4.798165137614679

6308478,4,B00J0IQISG,"There is a common misconception that Mick Taylor (John Jarratt) was a real person. In fact the character was created from the stories of Australia's most heinous criminals. While the crimes themselves are real, they were committed by a variety of people, not just one man. What made both films work, was the character of Mick Taylor, who while being a horrific serial killer, was still very likeable. Taylor is charismatic and most important of all very funny, and audiences in 2005 ate it up. After the success of the first film, a sequel was immediately planned, but put on hold due to the fact that some of the crimes portrayed in the film, were still being prosecuted in court. The legal issues delayed the film eight years and kept it out of theaters, which is a shame because it was better than the first and received almost no exposure. In the second installment of Wolf Creek, Mick isn't just torturing victims at his dungeon, he's chasing a man through the outback, and when they finally meet, they come to discover that they aren't entirely dissimilar from one another. Ryan Corr (Saw 3D) plays the runner and is just as witty and entertaining as Taylor himself. The chemistry between the too was terrific and gave the series a whole new dynamic, which elevated it to another level. Wolf Creek 2 is so much more intense and at the same time comedic, compared to the first film. It was definitely a risky move by Writer/Director Greg McLean, that really pays off. The Wolf Creek films are no different and no less predictable than any other slasher film. What makes them unique is a character that encompasses the personalities of multiple serial killers and gives the audience the rarest of bad guys, the one that you root for. Even if you don't like slasher films, you may enjoy John Jarratt's extremely strong performance and get a few laughs in between the carnage.",1405900800,3,1878,4.693939393939394

6308481,4,B00J0IQISG,"Done in a different style to the original film, I actually found the sequel to be more entertaining. It's not a big group of teen/early twenties backpackers being weeded down one by one, this time it's done a bit more like it happens in real life, one or two come across by the killer at a time. Being a movie there's obviously a couple of victims over a couple of days/nights but other than that sped up timeframe, that's what happens in the real world. In the real world a bus load size groups of kids going missing gets noticed and attention, and a lot of public pressure and police resources thrown at it, whereas a couple or a single traveller, by the time it's noticed they haven't been heard from, they could have disappeared from anywhere.

Mild spoilers - The movie claims to be based on real life events and one of the targets for the serial killer resembles the couple which resulted in the Peter Falconio disappearance where his girlfriend escaped to tell the story and ultimately the killer was convicted. There's also similarities to fictional tales such as there's a scene that pretty much follows the ending of the movie Duel. The isolated possible salvation house has been done numerous times before too. But that doesn't mean those unoriginal scenes don't make a fun horror movie in conjunction with the rest of the film.

I did find it surprising that they used a Rolf Harris song in a scene being that he's been recently convicted and jailed for crimes against children. Obviously the film would have wrapped up filming before that occurred but the accusations were around. Did they add that song to make the Mick Taylor character more creepy and his victim more intelligent for trying to lower the guard of his tormentor and bond with him by singing it in the first place knowing that Taylor would probably see Rolf as another predator?

Like most horror movies there are times when you yell at the screen at the stupidity of the victims, why are you doing that? Why aren't you running away? Why don't you just go off road since you're driving a jeep? Stuff like that, but I think this formula is in horror movies as yelling at the stupidity of the victims lets us think that if we were in this situation, we might survive. We might have a chance.

I understood what happened in the ending but not why it happened? That was the only major thing that let the film down overall.",1405468800,3,2397,4.554524361948956

6308483,4,B00J0IQISG,"Nine Things about the Movie Wolf Creek 2 [Australia, 2014]

1. Made eight years after the first Wolf Creek, this movie continues the adventures of Mick Taylor, the awkwardly charming but brutal serial killer with a nerve-grating chuckle.

2. Like the first movie, this is inspired by true events, which means it was partly inspired by two famous Australian killers. But this story never happened.

3. There is a pretty obvious anti-tourist element in the plot of this movie. I might take visit Australia off of my bucket list.

4. The first movie was about two European backpackers that are stalked by a killer in the outback. The sequel is about two European backpackers that are stalked by a killer in the outback.

5. Director Greg McLean broke some rules of horror films in the first movie. He also breaks some rules of horror sequels in this movie. So despite having the almost exact same setup, this movie goes in a wildly different direction than the first. It does a pretty good job of subverting expectations and surprising you, at least for awhile.

6. The first half of the movie seems determined to be more violent than the first one. Its pretty extreme. But it runs out of creative steam about halfway through, and then settles down into your more traditional terrorize the captive sequences.

7. Like the first film, the acting is better than you usually find in these kinds of movies. Ryan Corr is really good as the British surfer unwillingly brought into the drama. And John Jarratt guarantees that the Mick Taylor character joins the hall of fame of truly evil villains.

8. There is a very dark and macabre sense of humor to the movie, which lends a somewhat surreal quality to the film. A lot of it comes from Mick Taylor muttering to himself, so unless you are an expert at understanding Australian accents and slang, make sure you have the subtitles on.

9. This isn't better than the first movie, but its not really worse, either. There are some very memorable scenes here. If you are a fan of the first film, youll like this one, too. And if you weren't a fan of the first one, well, this won't change your mind.",1404777600,,2136,4.614775725593668

6308506,2,B00J0IQISG,"I just watched this much anticipated sequel to Wolf Creek and was seriously let down by what I saw. Mick Taylor (John Jarratt) is back for round two and doesn't disappoint with his trade mark chuckle and facial expressions.
This installment has many of the same scenes that helped to make the first movie so good with its gobs of tension, terror, blood and gore, sexual depravity and torture. However in this movie the way it was written and shot it looses more than it gains and comes off a little lackluster.
I would love to go into detail, but it wouldn't be fair to the ones who haven't seen the movie yet. I will say when you see the chase scenes you will understand what I am talking about and I'm not just talking about the vehicle chase scenes. Another area of disappointment was during the victims captivity and the aftereffects?
Much of the movie just makes little sense for the actions that Mick and his victims take towards one another and for what happens to his last victim in the movie. Its not that its hard to understand whats going on. but rather why they are doing what they are doing.
I will give this 2 generious stars only for the gore, torture scenes and cgi with the kangaroo's.
This installment was void of nudity, but does have clothed sex scenes. It has a fair amount of blood and gore and enough cursing including the F...word. WARNING THERE ARE SCENES OF KANGAROO'S BEING  STRUCK AND RUN OVER !!! I think the scene was shot using CGI effects.",1403740800,,1471,4.4684014869888475

Car chases: Way too much time is spent on pointless car chasing and exploding vehicles. This is utterly unexciting, unimaginative, and a waste of screen time. In movie making, when you have time to fill and don't have the cleverness to actually add something original, you insert a car chase. The scene where our ""hero"" eats soup is by far more tense and interesting than the car chases.

Realism: None. Guy in jeep gets rammed by 18-wheeler, goes over cliff, airbag saves him, he walks away fully unscathed.  If Disney made graphic horror films, this would be one of them. All that was missing was for the signing to start.

Violence: The one and only slightly enjoyable aspect of this movie is the graphic violence, which is overall very well filmed. The first two victims die particularly well, and gives the illusion the movie will actually be worth watching.",1403568000,3,916,4.8152866242038215

That's something I expect in this genre and too many directors in modern times are to chicken s*** to deliver the goods and stick to boring zombie/vampire/werewolf movies for fear of not making it to the big screen.  Mick has definitely established himself as a horror icon and I look forward to another movie.  Of course, at some point he is going to have to get caught and either find a way to weasel out of being vanquished or maybe get devoured by dingos in the wilderness to call it a career.  It would be nice to write a script where Mick has the tables turned on him and see how that plays out.

6308522,4,B00J0IQISG,"Wow, what a change this is from the first movie! I was not a fan of the first one, I found it drawn out and boring and pretty overrated, however this one turned up the gore and laughs and made it a much more enjoyable movie. You could also say it's a fun thrill ride to watch. Mick is back again, and this time he is even more psycho than ever before. It takes a nice new approach to having victims show up and be done with quickly until the last guy, so it's not that typical boring group of friends who get in trouble and the passing local or two get involved thing.

It get's away from that boring nothingness scenery where you could be lost anywhere and no one will find you to much faster paced surrounds and a bit more action scenes to get the adrenaline going. The opening scene's finale gives you a satisfying taste that this movie will get a bit gory with no cut away or stupid shadow shots to supposedly ""make it better"" through your imagination.

The humor in this one is turned up too. It's not silly campy humor, no it's still going for a classic horror tone, it's not trying to make fun of itself just yet, but I could not stop laughing during a chase scene between a 4WD and Mick chasing him down in a semi and a group of wild Kangaroos wanna play chicken.

The film has some great memorable quotes. The acting is decent, the sound is fine, and for an Aussie flick it does have a lot of that typical outback and tin shed in the bush thing that is is 90% of Australian movies because its cheap to film out there, but this one utilizes it well and doesn't take away anything from the film. (I am Australian, and sometimes that cheap scenery irritates me as it's done for overseas audiences, but this film was utilizing it fine)

If you like horror, check this one out. It reminded me a little bit of Joy Ride 3, so if you have seen that, you should like this, and vice verse. If you like horror but didn't really like the first one, give this one a go, it's much better than the first one.",1403049600,,2002,4.165374677002584

The gore in this movie will get to some people, and that's understandable.  It's gore along the lines of Hostal.  Very graphic, but VERY well done!

A serial killer in the Australian outback returns to terrorise backpackers.

What did I think?

If there was a gore comedy genre this would fit right into it. Whereas the original Wolf Creek was a thriller featuring a tireless psychopath, the second offering has chosen to paint the sociopath as a wisecracking xenophobic racist. Hes still relentless but much more sadistically slapstick. It helps that the victims make so many stupid choices you're almost cheering for the killer but it doesn't change the fact the sequel is far lighter and inferior. The based on true facts is a bit of mishmash of loose claims but if you're going for entertainment rather than history you probably won't be disappointed.

Not quite horror, not quite comedy, not quite torture porn. But attempting to make the main character more likable AND the poster child for anti-immigrant protesters? That could be the most horrific call of all.",1401667200,,936,4.980769230769231

Now, what I can't figure out is why in the heck were two people out in the middle of no where anyways. If the car broke down they should have hitched a ride back into town. The best way, I can somewhat sum this movie up is think of the movie ""Joy Ride"" the only difference is, you've got suspenseful in that movie ;because you couldn't see the person who is the psychotic killer.

6308552,2,B00J0IQISG,"Nearly a decade has passed since Greg McLean's Aussie horror cult hit, WolfCreek, a film both reviled and beloved for its unspeakably ugly depths. While critics here in the U.S. mostly despised it (notably Roger Ebert gave it 0 stars), it became notable for the lead performance by John Jarratt as the Outback's grungy slayer of tourists, Mick Taylor. Taylor is back with his trusty hunting knife and sniper rifle in Wolf Creek 2, a tired, unwanted sequel that should have been left Down Under.

The problem that arises when a character such as Mick Taylor becomes popular is the unnecessary desire to make him bigger, more animated, and thus more crowd-appealing. It's the Hannibal Lecter scenario; watering down the character by injecting comedy or making victims more despicable. Where Mick used to exude a quiet, horrifying menace out of every single pore, now he's a prattling jokester thrown into any number of ridiculous scenarios. CGI kangaroos are a thing in this movie. Really.

The problems start right off the bat with Mick dispatching a pair of bullying cops in extremely ugly fashion. Hey, they sorta deserved it for acting like a couple of jerks, which immediately casts Mick in the weak position of anti-hero. A normal balance is restored in his murderous pursuit of lost German tourists (Phillipe Klaus) and Katarina (Shannon Ashlyn). He's rugged; she's cute and kind of perky in the way inevitable female victims tend to be in these movies. Sure enough, after a brief run-in with Mick from which they fortunately escape, they end up camping right where he can find them. It isn't long before the pig-killing bushwhacker has moved on to another target, Paul (Ryan Corr), who stumbled into Mick's unfortunate orbit by the worst luck ever.

To be fair, the chase between Mick and Paul has a great deal of fun energy to it, but is Wolf Creek 2 really supposed to be fun? Isn't it supposed to make your skin crawl with fear? Instead, there are a lot more laughs than chills during their cat-and-mouse routine, which includes Mick hopping into a semi-truck and barreling through the previously-mentioned kangaroo. It's a squirm-worthy visual that will make you feel more for them than any of the human characters, but there's also something desperate about it. For all of the struggles McLean went through getting this movie made, was running over kangaroos the best he could come up with?

No, he also has the bright idea of forcing a captured Paul to fight for his life by answering a series of trivia questions on Australian history. It's as boring and lacking in tension as it sounds, only memorable for the use of the Aussie anthem, ""Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport"", used by ex-WWF wrestler Outback Jack. Huge body counts aren't really the point of Wolf Creek 2; it's the desolation and hopelessness inspired by miles of bare desert, making for a natural cage from which there is no escape. There are brief moments of excessive gore but no real sense of dread, and without it Mick Taylor is a forgettable slasher and Wolf Creek 2 a forgettable sequel.",1400976000,3,3064,4.83047619047619

Greg McLean's Wolf Creek 2 returns to follow xenophobic psychopath Mick Taylor as he hunts for new victims. Unlike the original WC, this sequel picks up on action immediately and it continues to pack in the drama all the way through. Much of action follows Paul, a British tourist as he runs from Mick.

The thing that I like about Wolf Creek 2 is that it is realistic. This isn't to say that it is accurate to history but rather that it is quite plausible. This alone makes it terrifying but adding in Mick's predatory character and you have an incredible film. The Aussie History scene between Mick and Paul brilliantly calls to mind Bilbo and Gollum's high-stakes game in The Hobbit. The realism may not be a soul-crunching psychological kind of some horror films but it's enough that I turned every light in my house on.
