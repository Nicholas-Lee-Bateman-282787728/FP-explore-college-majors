7127549,4,B00WAJ8NU8,"Season 9 is definitely not as good as season 8 but I will keep buying their DVDs because I miss seeing the boys on TV. Seems that we've been friends for a long time!

Still no mention of the baby that Lucy had with Randy.  I still really like Don/Donna.  There was way too much J-Roc in this season and he didn't even really sing.  It was good to see everybody.  Not feeling the Jacob & Corey best friends thing.  Did not like Private Leslie Dancer or that ham of a grumpy senior citizen.  The talkative baby goat was cute.",1433635200,,523,4.17

7127561,3,B00WAJ8NU8,"The post-Mike Clattenburg Trailer Park Boys aren't quite as funny..... The first 7 seasons were awesome. The first 2 seasons developed the characters and found its way to become a cult classic comedy series. Seasons 3 and 4 had ""The Boys"" hittin' their stride with their wacky brand of comedy......Episodes like ""Closer to the Heart"", ""Microphone Assassin"", and ""The Green Bastard"" show how funny and creative this series could be....... Seasons 7, 8, and 9 are still very funny, but lack a certain ""je ne sais quoi"".

Season 9 started out very slow, but ended in the grand tradition of vintage TPB.

Viewer Alert: Do we really need to see Mr Lahey wearing an open bath robe and nothing else?.......I think not!.......",1486598400,2,718,4.877049180327869

7127632,4,B00WAJ8NU8,"The boy still got it!  Season 9 is by far not my favorite season but all-in-all it's pretty darn funny and it's great to see the boys still at it after all these years.  Any new TBP material is better than nothing so knowing that one day it will eventually come to an end, I'll continue to enjoy whatever new material comes out as long as I can and then probably end up binge watching old episodes like I do all my old favs from the 90's and 00's from that point on.

As far as the ins and outs of Season 9 as you probably already know there's no Trevor (I don't expect we'll ever see Trevor again on TPB) and no Ray.  I'm probably more upset over the no Ray than I am the no Trevor.  Seeing that they left the door open for a Ray return in the third movie when they revealed that he wasn't dead but actually living in Florida on his $11K in insurance money. I was hoping he would come back eventually but unfortunately he has not as of season 9.  Ray was definitely one of my favorite regulars and I'm holing out hope that he comes back in season 10.

All-in-all if your a true TPB fan you'll enjoy season 9 well enough.  Can't wait til season 10 comes out.",1439164800,4,1158,4.048245614035087

7127635,5,B00WAJ8NU8,"It is great to see the Boys are off and running with their series. This season starts a little slow, with the boys at a low ebb as they get out of prison and discover that Leahy and Barb have turned the park into a Senior Citizens' paradise. No drinking, no swearing and an ex military man guarding the park's entrance. After a couple episodes, the show takes off and is back to its old craziness. Also Samsquanch makes an appearance!",1436918400,,434,4.37037037037037
