8574464,5,B00BV8HJ2M,"I am glad I purchased this DVD back when it was still available on Amazon. It is now my yearly (visual) trip to Mexico City to see the Tilma that has the Holy Image of Our Lady of Guadalupe. And the added bonus of seeing the people who travel long distances to go and visit our Holy Mother on Her Special Day. And I get all this yearly now without leaving my living room.  I want to say thank you to the people who made this DVD, and I hope someday it will be made available again for those who do not yet have a copy.",1449878400,,518,3.8867924528301887

It manages to capture video that isn't rehearsed or staged, and that spontaneity gave me such an authentic feel and insight into just how joyous and honest the pilgrims' experience was.
