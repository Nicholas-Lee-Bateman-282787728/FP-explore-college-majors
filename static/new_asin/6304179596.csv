7864007,2,6304179596,"This was interesting, but obviously trumped up.

They're saying that they hit something so devastating that the entire ship is disabled-- but not a single person is hurt? Anything that can disable most of a ship's systems, should at least kill anyone near them at the time since it would cut through them as well.

Also some ship-systems should be able to function independently, since the designers weren't stupid enough to put all their eggs in one basket.

Even with warp and impulse gone (highly unlikely), they'd still have batteries.

Also the notion of ""communications being out"" likewise defies logic, in that the comm-badges should at least be able to communicate directly with each other; Kirk's communicators could do this, so there's no excuse on Picard's ship.

Finally, just because the turbo-lifts don't work, is no reason they can't access hatches, ladders and crawl-ways-- also the doors should definitely be able to be operated manually even if the power is out. Is this the Enterprise, or the Titanic-- where they also didn't take basic precautions because they thought nothing could go wrong?

Any ship is supposed to have back-ups, reserves and safeties against this-- but they weren't even addressed.

Another obvious oversight is where there's a fire in Dr. Crusher and Geordi's area-- but is noticed only when one of them feels ""the wall is hot--"" Geordi can see into most of the E-M spectrum, so he should have noticed it immediately via his visor.

Likewise, when Dr. Crusher says to ""take a deep breath and hold it"" in a vacuum is pure suicide, since this would cause them to die instantly from severe air-bubbles in their blood at the very least (more likely they'd explode from ambient air-pressure); surely a space-physician could never be so stupid as to have such a poor understanding of the principles and procedure for rapid decompression.

This could have been made more realistic, but it's clear that the writers either didn't have a clue, or a care-- they wanted a ""Poseidon Adventure"" and so the devil with the details-- which is just plain cheap thrills. So then they gussied it up with singing Gilbert & Sullivan and ""Frere Jacques--"" which only made it worse... while Keiko's ""delivery scene"" was just icing on the crap-cake.",1180310400,,2266,4.942105263157894
7864008,5,6304179596,"Excellent, another favorite in my 10 top favorites.  Plot:  Everyone is relaxing (first sign of major trouble coming), Keiko is very pregnent (guess what happens later?), Geordi singing for a play for Dr. Crusher (I don't think this is really a sign of trouble) and Capt. Picard has to give a tour to some brilliant kids for their science projects (a really big sign of trouble).  Suddenly, the Enterprise hits a quantum filament (according to the Star Trek Encyclopedia, they don't know what it is either, except it isn't a cosmic string) and is totally disabled.  Everything is wrecked, with people killed and injured.  Well, Troi is on the bridge and left in command with the ship about to have a warp core breach (a nice way of saying, ""engine is about to explode"") and Keiko is going into labor...and Worf is the only one who can deliver the baby.  Will everyone survive?

A great episode since it deals with how everyone has to deal with something they don't have as much experience at in major league crisis situation (Picard with the kids, Worf with Keiko going into labor, Troi in command, Geordi dealing with exploding walls...not that anyone is used to that).  It's also neat because they show scenes with everything NOT working and at different angles that aren't usually used.  Plenty of humor (especially with Worf and Keiko, and Riker working with Data's head), a definite 5 star-pushing 6 episode.",1157500800,,1413,4.805785123966942
7864009,5,6304179596,"The Enterprise NCC-1701-D is waiting for its next mission.  While the crew take a few days to rest the Enterprise is hit by a quantum filament.  This has some of the best lines in this season (i.e. Worf to Keiko ""You may now give birth."" and then Keiko shoots back ""That's what I've been doing!"").  Also in the this show Troi is in command which is somthing Ro doesn't approve of.  Riker atuck with just Dats's head (Good lines come from Riker while he is fooling around with Data's head)after Data's body is damaged.  Picard stuck in a turbolift with three children and then has to climb up a turboshaft with them.  La Forge and Crusher stuck in a cargo by full of explosives that explode when it come in conact with radiation and there is a plasma fire in the bay to with is releasing radiation.  Great episode for a star trek fan",1011744000,,832,4.363636363636363
7864010,5,6304179596,"""Disaster"" is definitley one of the best episodes in all of Star Trek history.  It was a surprising episode, with all the sparks and damage.  Usually Voyager takes that beating, but I kind of liked it when they showed the Enterprise taking that damage.
Well, the story starts out with a party in the mess hall, all because of Keiko's baby, and then while Picard is tallking to some children, one of the kids looks up at him without talking, puts his head down and then they're struck by a quantum filament.  Then, with most of the ship's power gone, the crew tries to survive.  Do they survive?  If you want to find the answer, you'll have to watch this exciting episode that is perhaps as good as Voyager.  But I warn you, this is a scary episode in a way!",1006041600,,757,4.333333333333333
