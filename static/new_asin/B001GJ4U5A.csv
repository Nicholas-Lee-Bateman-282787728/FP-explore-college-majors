3611429,5,B001GJ4U5A,"My husband and I love reading Henry James so when the DVD's came
out we knew we had to get them and we were not sorry because they were
excellant very well done.",1235779200,6,161,3.909090909090909
3611430,5,B001GJ4U5A,"From the inexhaustible pen of American author Henry James (1843-1916)and the well preserved archives of the BBC,two adaptations at 80 min, one at 3 hr, and two at 4 1/2 hr. The stories are laid in England and Italy, involving moneyed characters with very scrupulous attitudes, and some with manipulative and predatory cunning. Marriage is sought as the Earthly Grail, but the more the talk, the longer the delay, the worse the prospects become. The outcome is loss and resignation. ""The American"" is the most sensational, including a brief scene of brutal sex and a needless death in a duel. ""Spoils of Poynton"" concerns disputation over the contents of a house between a young man's mother, his fiancee, and a second young woman who would be a better choice. ""Golden Bowl,"" referring to an objet d'art with a rather obscure flaw, explores a quadrangle relatonship: daughter and father are overattached, she marries an overcharming Italian count, her father marries her scheming ""friend,"" who then resumes an amorous relationship with the count. Both ""Wings of the Dove"" and ""Portrait of a Lady"" include principal characters who are deathstruck (in Portrait, Richard Chamberlain giving a fine performance), and their generosity does not bring happiness to its recipients. In Bowl and in Portrait, note the actress Kathleen Byron whose modulated, humorously weary delivery, here and there sliding up to a musical note, is so engaging--happily, you can also see her as the nun who goes berserk in ""Black Narcissus."" To end, the Henry James Collection is splendid and a great buy.",1233878400,100,1577,5.116279069767442
3611431,1,B001GJ4U5A,"There are issues with these discs so  beware.  The Golden Bowl is double sided, but on th copy I received BBCAmerica thoughtfully put a label on it thus ruining the disc.  What were they thinking?",1478217600,,196,4.542857142857143
3611432,4,B001GJ4U5A,"I don't know anything about this disc set, but I do remember seeing ""The Golden Bowl"" and ""The Spoils of Poynton"" when they first aired and I still think about them both. I have read all the novels in this set, also, and can say the two I watched were excellent adaptations.  It is ironic that James considered himself a failed playwright,  as his novels seem especially easy to adapt to film. I'll bet the production with Chamberlain was the least impressive.  The acting on the old Masterpiece Theater adaptations was outstanding and he wasn't exactly Kenneth Brannaugh.",1477785600,2,572,4.816326530612245

3611434,2,B001GJ4U5A,One must remember these are older films and inexpensively done.  They use the same background over and over again in several of the films.  It's mostly dialogue and Henry James I found to be a bit on the dark side.  Didn't like the sad endings.  The acting is ok.,1473206400,,263,4.3061224489795915
3611435,5,B001GJ4U5A,I rented this DVD from my library and really loved it.  I wanted my own copy and bought it at a very reasonable price.,1469664000,,118,3.9166666666666665
3611436,2,B001GJ4U5A,"Two of the five disks are defective in this set: Portrait of a Lady; The Golden Bowl. I cleaned the DVD players and properly cleaned the disks with professional cleaner. They are both faulty at Episode Three. The disks show scratch lines though new. I returned and bought another set. Same problem with same disks. both from Two Thumbs Up fulfilled by Amazon. I love the BBC and Henry James, just want a collection that plays throughout. Who wants to miss anything?",1466294400,,465,4.682926829268292
3611437,4,B001GJ4U5A,"I've watched ""The Golden Bowl"" which 2/3 thirds through started breaking up badly.  I was able with difficulty get past it to finish this brilliant adaption.  The DVD, ""The American"" played without any problems.  I will shortly return the collection and ask for a replacement.",1466121600,,276,5.088888888888889
3611438,1,B001GJ4U5A,Two of the movies were unplayable. To return the item one must have printer. So I am out of money for an inferior product.,1465862400,,122,4.125

3611440,3,B001GJ4U5A,"Of the James adaptations in this set, only ""The Golden Bowl"" is fully satisfactory, with subtle, fleshed-our performances and truly marvelous narration by the great Cyril Cusack. It makes the whole set worthwhile.",1445904000,,213,5.484848484848484
3611441,4,B001GJ4U5A,"Theatrical stage plays....not what I expected, very stiff acting, Richard Chamberlain worth watching in

again very stage like,  .

3611444,5,B001GJ4U5A,"My remarks are mostly directed toward the fine version of The Golden Bowl featured in this set.  I have just watched it for perhaps the fifth or sixth time. (I make it a point to do so every summer now.)  I never fail to be enthralled by the perfectly-nuanced performance Ms Gayle Hunnicutt delivers as Charlotte Stant.  She truly brings to life this role created by that most subtly-nuanced of writers, Henry James.  Ms. Hunnicutt, at the time of this performance, was truly one of the most beguiling, beautiful women to ever grace the Earth.  She was also perfectly cast as Irene Adler, the only woman to ever seduce Sherlock Holmes, in the premiere episode of the Granada Series, ""A Scandal in Bohemia.""
  This set also features the finest version of Portrait of a Lady ever filmed with Rachel Gurney as the definitive Madame Merle and James Maxwell as the finest Gilbert Osmond (although Barbara Hershey and John Malkovitch both acquitted themselves well in these roles in the 1996 version).  Spoils of Poynton and Wings of the Dove are also fine, although The American, as others have noted, is less refined and therefore less faithful to its author.",1437264000,3,1155,4.797979797979798
3611445,5,B001GJ4U5A,Great,1433289600,,5,5.0
3611446,4,B001GJ4U5A,"A mixed bag. Some of the older dramatizations are too much like plays videotaped, but over all they capture James's  penchant for paradox.  ""The American"" struck me as hyped up beyond my memory of that novel.  But, then, James himself conceded in his later career that he got that story entirely wrong.",1428192000,,302,4.769230769230769
3611447,5,B001GJ4U5A,"Incredibly well-done.  What amazes me is that the stories are presented in such a way that it is entirely clear what is going on at every moment, which cannot be said of the books themselves.  Warning:  None of Henry James' works ends as you think they should.  Like life.",1427587200,2,272,4.489795918367347

3611450,5,B001GJ4U5A,"I purchased this set for that one drama alone after watching Uma Thurman and Nick Nolte in the 2000 movie. My memories of Daniel Massey and Cyril Cusack from its first airing in this country were accurate, and I much prefer this production to the more recent one. The emotional tension is so much superior and fits my expectations of Henry James' work. The Thurman/Nolte/Beckinsdale/Northam 2000 version is too much in-your-face destroying that very tension which makes the earlier production so engrossing and bittersweet.",1401926400,3,523,5.238095238095238

3611452,5,B001GJ4U5A,It was great being able to see the great writing of Henry James brought to life by some of the greatest actors in the English language.,1379980800,,135,4.230769230769231
3611453,3,B001GJ4U5A,I was not impressed with this set...most of the stories were filmed a long time ago. Richard Chamberlain was very young..looks like most were filmed on sets.,1370390400,,157,4.851851851851852
3611454,5,B001GJ4U5A,"I haven't read much of James thru the years, but his psychological profiles makes this collection extremely interesting. His characters, yet simple, are complex.  I'm amazed that it's kept my interest.",1358553600,2,201,5.483870967741935
3611455,1,B001GJ4U5A,"in Portrait of a Lady the final two segments are missing from the set - nowhere to be found.  I contacted Amazon by phone and was given a refund.  The issue here, however, is that the producer of the set [BBC] sends an incomplete product, with no explanation. Who wants to see the beginning of Portrait of a Lady to be left suspended without an ending?  Disgraceful.",1357430400,8,366,4.432835820895522
3611456,5,B001GJ4U5A,"Forget the film versions of Henry James novels: this box set contains a series of great productions produced during an age when BBC Television had a regular Classic Serial slot, with productions stretching over multiple episodes, when scripts had more importance than the look.  They might seem somewhat slow for today's audiences, but they capture the nuances of Henry James' novels; that reflective mood that lets us ponder the characters' motives, and helps us to speculate on what they might to next.  THE GOLDEN BOWL is simply gorgeous, with Cyril Cusack's Bob Assingham acting as onscreen narrator, trying to determine our responses; likewise THE PORTRAIT OF A LADY with Richard Chamberlain.  There are also some less well-known adaptations here such as the dramatic SPOILS OF POYNTON.  If you're an aficionado of Henry James, this box set is just for you.",1354233600,2,862,5.135714285714286
3611457,4,B001GJ4U5A,"Everyone has a ""great author"" who they simply can't read. Mine is Henry James. Every attempt to read one of his novels has been a failure.  With the single exception of ""The Heiress"", I've found every movie and stage adaptation of his works dreadful.  Somehow, it seems that James was writing for the intimacy afforded by television, long before the medium existed.  The gem in this collection is ""The Golden Bowl"".  The movie version - with Uma Thurman and Nick Nolte - is a complete disaster, despite the sumptuous sets and star casting.  The teleplay in this collection is exquisite - perfectly cast, perfectly scripted (especially the role of Bob Assingham, played by Cyril Cussack).  Who cares if you can see the sets shake?  The only real disappointment in this collection in ""The American"".  It is particularly nice to find an adaptation of ""The Spoils of Poynton"", with a very young Gemma Jones.",1351814400,6,903,4.856209150326797
3611458,3,B001GJ4U5A,"This is atypical of many of these romantic dramas of this period, there was very little action, and to much dialologue, though there were many great actors involved, these type of dramas were much more like plays, whereas the Catherine Cookson Dramas, not only had great acting, but a lot of great action too.",1343606400,2,309,4.7407407407407405
3611459,5,B001GJ4U5A,"""...Henry James' fiction represents a more vivid conception of the moral life than even Jane Austen or George Eliot."" (Harold Bloom)

A moral dilemma delicately unfolded reaches a piercing pitch almost as it decays into a desolation which catches the dying echo of Merton Densher's  ""Kate, take me now as I am"". There in the gorgeous final scene love is pitted against scruple or, as justly, love against love, one now fully lit, the other being extinguished as the couple see where they are. This dramatization is based on the middle novel of the last three masterpieces Henry James wrote in the vein of the ""melodrama of consciousness"". There are necessary compressions in an 81 minute rendering, but they are quibbles compared to the monstrosity of the 1997 release of the same name.",1318982400,4,786,4.902255639097745
3611460,3,B001GJ4U5A,"Some stories are more memorable than others but the collection is worth seeing.  The films were much less grandiose when these were created so the viewer must expect to view them as one would a play.  The characters, in most cases, are complex and the stories are involved centering on in-depth dialogue between interesting characters, well-acted, in the complexities of human relationships.  The subtitles are a necessity for many of the older generation and should be mandatory on all films sold in today's marketplace.",1316217600,16,521,5.178571428571429
3611461,2,B001GJ4U5A,This collection is poorly put together with two discs pasted together instead of double sided ones for longer shows and carelessly packaged with scratches and other flaws.,1315958400,4,171,5.37037037037037
3611462,2,B001GJ4U5A,"I love the BBC movies and the time periods in which they represent. My only qualm with this series is the random sexual content, which I can do without. For a better and more accurate review of the movies please refer to other reviews and the product overview.",1307750400,18,260,4.4375
3611463,5,B001GJ4U5A,"These films are brilliantly acted, written and Henry James was one great writer and observer of the human mind and the inherent frailties and foibles of people whether they were the good, the bad or the ugly, the ugly being those who would rather tread on other people than retain a shred of human dignity and compassion. Hours of wonderful viewing and an excellent presentation in this set....",1300665600,5,394,4.8088235294117645
3611464,2,B001GJ4U5A,"I love the BBC series, but his wasn't near as good as others I've seen such as Hard Times or Berkeley Square, The Pallisers etc. Slow, just ok",1283904000,2,142,4.107142857142857
3611465,5,B001GJ4U5A,"This collection contains some of the best six hour BBC Classic Series made in the 1970's and later aired on PBS in the USA. They are all based on the novels and novellas of Henry James whose long novels adapt brilliantly for television. I appeared as Charlotte Stant in THE GOLDEN BOWL which is the final disc (they play on both sides and each novel is 6 hours long) I enjoyed watching each series, some of which I missed when they were originally aired. This collection gives the viewer over 30 hours of great television adapted from some of the most intriguing novels ever written. I was delighted to both watch them and to give them to a number of my friends. Gayle Hunnicutt",1265500800,37,678,4.475806451612903
3611466,5,B001GJ4U5A,"This is a must for any Henry James (the writer) literary fan. You'll soon become a film fan of his stories as well.  Also a must for the Victorian film lovers. This collection contains 5 of Henry James' important works put into films with lengths ranging from 81 minutes to 264 minutes, like full-length movie features.

Henry James wrote romances before Hollywood created ""THE"" acceptable ending. You'll never know till it's over how these stories will end.  Each story is performed using a wonderful cast made up of some of the best stars of Britain, some in early roles within their careers.

Details:
THE AMERICAN, 87 minutes, original airing 1998
Christopher, the American, a self-made millionaire takes on Parisian aristocracy due to his desire for a beauty named Claire.  It's new money vs old money and more important those time-honored ways of life.

THE PORTRAIT OF A LADY, 264 minutes, 6 episodes, 1968
This is about a girl (Isabel Archer) who takes charge of her destiny, but more in the contemporary style of a 21st century liberated lady. But is the Victorian period ready for Isabel?

THE SPOILS OF POYNTON, 169 min., 4 episodes, 1970
Gemma Jones (very well known now as ""The Duchess of Duke Street""--highly recommended Masterpiece Theatre DVD set) is Fleda Vetch.  Miss Vetch gets caught in the middle between passions of a mother, an engaged couple, and the artifacts of Poynton.  Scenes are as Victorianly beautiful outside as the inside sets in this story taking place in 1897. With so much at stake, who will be the winner?

THE WINGS OF A DOVE, 81 min., 1979
Rich London girl loves poor London boy.  Mama forbids it due to his income.  Enter rich American girl and a plot forms.  Will love win over wealth in these Victorian times? With Henry James writing--one never knows for sure.

THE GOLDEN BOWL, 257 MIN., 6 episodes, 1972
A father/daughter mutual admiration tale. Daughter marries a Prince. Father marries a friend of this daughter. Father's bride is found to be an ex-lover of the Prince.  Love is much easier when those involved are not aristocracy, noblemen, or heiresses. But then, Henry James didn't intend for this romance to be a simple love story.

Look up ""AFFAIRS OF THE HEART"" if this is not enough Henry James for you. And surely it can't be.  There are 2 sets of ""Affairs of the Heart"" available--13 more and different book-to-TV adaptations. Read my reviews on both. They come very recommended--again for Henry James readers/watchers, and Victorian romance lovers, those enjoying stories that have a surprise ending, and anyone just enjoying the beauty of an era of high design that has long since past.

The Henry James Collection comes in a very nice 5 DVD case with a small booklet. Yes, these DVDs do provide subtitles for the hearing impaired OR the British dialect challenged.",1251936000,53,2824,4.847916666666666
3611467,5,B001GJ4U5A,"- are brought beautifully to life in this collection.  Gayle Hunnicutt plays the quintessential Charlotte in ""The Golden Bowl"".  And, although the collection brochure ranks ""Portrait of a Lady"" as the weakest in the group, a young Richard Chamberlain gives a riveting performance as Ralph, redeeming this production to rank with the others.

3611468,4,B001GJ4U5A,"Contrary to another reviewer I LOVE the older BBC productions of great novels, they made them with respect for the original.  The only modern one included in this set, the American, is simply an abomination of a James story.  Be warned that it includes a graphic sex scene, I guess today's no talent filmmakers can't make a film great by sticking to the original and so have to throw some trash in to get an audience.
