5766968,4,B00D1D45R2,"My daughters (6, 4, and 1) all enjoyed this DVD!!!  They LOVED learning all about SHARKS!

I enjoyed the Creature reports at the end of the movie that was an excellent review and brought up great discussion points with the kids.

The music is catchy!

Their favorite shark was Lemon Shark!

I am a member of NCircle's NSider and was sent a free DVD to watch and review",1403136000,,368,4.352941176470588
5766969,5,B00D1D45R2,My son is really into Octonauts because he loves animals. He couldn't get enough of this shark DVD! He loves learning about all the underwater sea creatures! His favorite is to watch all the creature reports! Great educational DVD!,1402963200,,231,4.948717948717949
5766970,5,B00D1D45R2,"The Octonauts are one of our favorite DVD series' to watch - hands down! As a parent, I love that my kids are learning something and our kids find them very entertaining and fun and ask to watch the Octonauts often! It's a win-win situation! We are also a homeschooling family, so something like these educational and fun Octonaut DVD's that are full of scientific facts are something that we really enjoy adding to our days. In fact, I'm planning to use them as a fun little science curriciulum this summer and have the kids write me a little report after each episode about what they learned about that particular underwater animal! It should be a lot of fun.

Calling All Sharks was loved by all our kids (who are ages 2, 4, 6, 8). It's a DVD that captures the attention of the younger kids an the older kids and will definitely be watched over and over and over again in our household. We would HIGHLY recommend it!!",1402185600,,920,4.443786982248521
5766971,5,B00D1D45R2,"(*Disclosure: My family was sent this DVD to review as part of the NCircle Nsider program. The following is my honest opinion of the DVD.)

I can't say enough good things about the Octonauts! On the Octonauts newest DVD release titled Calling All Sharks! we learn about three different types of sharks as well as the comb jelly, pilot fish and the porcupine puffer. This show is so wonderful because it exposes kids to creatures they might otherwise be unaware of. For instance, I had never heard of a cookiecutter or dwarf latern shark prior to watching these episodes. This series is so good about using comedic situations to get kids laughing and learning. My boys (ages 2, 6 and 7) thought the Giant Jelly episode was hilarious! The show has a song at the conclusion of each episode called the creature report where a few interesting facts that were covered in the episode are put into musical form as a sort of review. The DVD has a running time of approximately 70 minutes. My kids and I have always been big fans of WordWorld, and I honestly didn't think there would ever be an educational children's show that could measure up to that caliber of clever. Then, along came the Octonauts. I'm not comparing the two because they teach the same subject matter- WordWorld teaches phonics/spelling while Octonauts focuses on science. However, they're very much alike in that they have a very entertaining and clever way of combining learning and fun! This series is definitely the new favorite in my house! We are already eagerly anticipating the next Octonauts DVD release!",1401840000,,1575,4.790441176470588

Another great DVD from the Octonauts and this one focuses on Sharks  just in time for that annual Summer event  Shark Week!  The Octonaut team is once again out to introduce you to a number of sea creature that are both interesting and entertaining. These Sharks can be scary -  until you get to know them. And before you know it Peso has his medical kit out and hes helping them out. Quazi is a favorite of my grandchildren because he is so wild and crazy.  And hes up to his old tricks here  declaring that hes not afraid of anything until these Sharks reveal that hes as scared as anyone on the team.

My 5 year old son is really into sharks right now, so he was super excited when he got to read the word ""shark"" right on the DVD cover. As we dove into 70 minutes of Octonauts fun, we got to explore, discover and learn all about new and different  sea creatures, including lots of sharks. The Octonauts know how to make each episode fun too, with great songs, fun facts and problem-solving skills. They teach in each episode without cramming a bunch of animal facts into one episode. I can definitely appreciate that, especially when my son can go into information overload! The Creature Report at the end of each episode shows real life video, pictures and facts about each animal too. It's great when my son can see for himself what this amazing sea animals are like! We have learned quite a few new animal facts from the Octonauts, emphasis on the ""we.""",1403740800,,959,4.53757225433526

Cookiecutter Sharks
Lost Lemon Shark
Dwarf Lantern Shark
Giant Jelly
Hungry Pilot Fish
Porcupine Puffer

At the end of each episode is a creature report. It is a song-and-dance number with a little information about the animal from the episode and a few real pictures. My son in particular enjoys seeing what the creates actually look like.

You can watch an individual episode or all of them at once, depending upon how long you want your children occupied.",1403654400,26,593,4.673076923076923
