2615414,5,B000GNOSHW,"What can I say? The long wait has ended. Fans of this 80's classic detective show are so happy to finally have this gem to add to their collection. Riptide was not a critic's darling or media attention-grabber, but this was escaptist fun at its best. Buy this. Discover Cody Allen, Nick Ryder and Murray Bozinsky...three guys - three true friends - a pink helicopter (yes, pink) and whole lot of humor and good times. The relationship between these characters only grows and deepens in Seasons 2 & 3. Let's hope they follow soon.",1159401600,6,529,4.638297872340425
2615415,4,B000GNOSHW,"This show isn't for newcomers--the scripts and mysteries aren't spectacular, there are no extras, and the transfers are so-so, particularly on the pilot.  There's graininess on that episode, and washed-out skies on the rest, although other colors are fine.

Ah, but the nostalgia factor!  My sophmore college roommate just sprang full-blown into my mind as soon as the show cued up.  That Mike Post theme music--a signature of 80s action shows--is there in all its glory.  Nick and Cody are hot and often shirtless, and Murray Bozinski as the computer geek is head and shoulders above T.C., Rick, and the rest of the 80s sidekick crowd.  The relationship between the trio is sweet, some of the unsophisticated humor had me laughing out loud, and the computer stuff is just amazinging simplistic after all these years.  This show is just wonderfully cheesy.  Boz is really more hero than sidekick, and his character is, in some ways, the best.

I always remembered the third episode in which Nick meets up with a smart girl he knew in high school who hates him now.  They have an exchange about the misunderstandings from way back when at the show's midpoint and bury the hatchet--and the scene is just as sweet, charming, and real as I remember.

I love Alias, Lost, and 24 as much as any other modern viewer--but if you ever want to step back to a time when t.v. was just mindless, silly, light fun at times, there's no better way than revisiting Riptide.",1159228800,9,1456,4.738095238095238
2615416,5,B000GNOSHW,"Diciding to go into the private-detective business, Nick & Cody worked from Cody's cabin cruiser, the ""Riptide"". Having at least two advantages over the compitition: Cody's Speeboat the ""Ebbtide"", and the ""Screaming Mimi"", Nick's old but serviceable pink painted helicopter.

Since they knew it was the high-tech era, they employed an army buddy called Boz, a computer nerd and genius with electronics.

The boys also occasionally get the help of Mama Jo and her charter boat all-girl crew moored next to their boat.

First telecasted on January 3rd, 1984 until its last telecast on April 22nd, 1986 for a total of three seasons and 58 episodes.

The show ranked 18th among the best 30 TV shows in its first season, getting 18.8% of viewers according to the Nielsen Rating. The rating jumped even higher in the second season ranking 14th, getting 19.2% of viewers(The Nielsen Rating is the percent of all TV-equipped homes tuned to the program on an average night, as measured by the Nielsen Media Research).

The cast were:
* Cody Allen ..... Perry King
* Nick Ryder ..... Joe Penny
* Murray ""Boz"" Bozinsky ..... Thom Bray
* Mama Jo (Occasional, 1984) ..... Anne Francis
* Lt. Ted Quinlan (1984-1985) ..... Jack Ging
* Kirk ""The Dool"" Dooley (1984-1985) ..... Ken Olandt

2615427,5,B000GNOSHW,"I remembered Riptide as a fun action adventure series from the 80's that had that early to mid Eighties cheek and attitude that was the best part of the era.  Joe Penny and Perry King brought that Southern California laid back way of doing things to solving their weekly crimes which always involved sexy girls and guys going about their business in the tightest clothes this side of a Circus.  Including a whole cruise ship crewed by girls that Hugh Hefner himself would have drooled over and Captained by a mama hen played with perfect 'been there done that' street smarts embodied quite handily by Anne Francis, at least in the first season, after that she and the producers parted ways because she wanted more character development and they didn't.  Countering Joe And Perry was Thom Bray playing what was undoubtedly the very first computer nerd on a TV show (now watch...ten other shows will come out of the woodwork with earlier portrayals of computer nerds) and he did a good job of being the innocent among lamb among the lions on the show.  The plots were forgettable, the guests were great fun,  Anne was top notch while she lasted, and the true star of the show the California Lifestyle of the 80s made the audience tune in and have fun.  I did and I think you will too.  Doesn't matter your orientation, remember what I said about everybody was showing off great bods every week...there's something for everyone.  Watching this show is a lark.

The early computer equipment and the first computer robot sidekick (besides Robbie in Forbidden Planet and The Robot on Lost in Space) is a hoot and still Thom Bray makes what he does seem logical to the layman.  The cars are great.  And yes ladies there's always the 'hair'!  It was usually non stop action with a little implied romance for our boys Joe and Perry that never went anywhere and a damsel in distress to rescue at the end.  And of course the eternal struggle to get the computer nerd hooked up with someone...anyone!!  Fun Fun Fun a la Beach Boy chic.

I recommend it a lot.",1441584000,3,2046,4.597796143250688

2615439,3,B000GNOSHW,"Even devoted fans cant deny that RIPTIDE was grade-A cheese--and we're talking Velveeta, not Gruyre That said, a little TV-style cheese never hurt anyone.

In the pilot episode, Cody (Perry King)from the movie CLASS OF 1984 notes that he and fellow ex-Army Military Police Nick (Joe Penny)who later co-starred on JAKE & THE FATMAN with William Conrad; have been friends for 10 years, detectives for 2 weeks.

Of course, an action-adventure series needs sidekicks and gimmicks. So, computer genius and fellow vet Murray ""Boz"" Bozinsky (Thom Bray) becomes the brains to their brawn, while toys include a houseboat (""The Riptide""), a pink helicopter (""The Screaming Mimi""), and a robot (""Roboz"").

As with MIAMI VICE, which premiered on NBC in the Fall of 1984, much of the action takes place by the water, while the playful banter between the Southern California-based duo is reminiscent of SIMON & SIMON, one of the era's other popular buddy shows Created by Stephen J. Cannell THE ROCKFORD FILES, THE A-TEAM, HUNTER, and 21 JUMPSTREET; RIPTIDE  also gave the gals something to ogle--in the two-part pilot (""Riptide, AKA Pier 56""), King and Penny play an entire scene wearing nothing but tighty-whiteys and in most episodes, shirts are sure to come off.

Courtesy of the scenic location, the series boasts a bevy of bikini-clad babes, as well.
Guests stars include Kelly Preston (""The Hard Case""), Dennis Franz (""Double Your Pleasure""), and Geena Davis and Lance Henriksen (""Raiders of the Lost Sub""). Marsha Warfield (Night Court) and Anne Francis (Honey West) also drop by on occasion. The former is Max, hostess at their favorite nightspot; the latter is Mama Jo, skipper of the all-female charter craft docked in the next slip. RIPTIDE began life on NBC as a midseason replacement in the Winter of 1984, paired with Cannells THE A-TEAM, and was renewed for 2 more seasons. Entertaining adventures aside, this three-disc set is devoid of extras.

Come aboard ""The Riptide,"" home to the hottest detective agency in L.A. Cody Allen (Perry King from The Day After Tomorrow) and Nick Ry (Joe Penny from ""Jake and the Fatman"") are longtime pals who have seen more than their share of danger - and action. Along with a buddy from their days in the military, the brilliant but socially inept scientist Murray ""Boz"" Bozinsky (Thom Bray), they solve a series of mysterious cases involving stakeouts, seduction, and the law. Detective work has never been this hot.

This abbreviated season of RIPTIDE takes me back to memory lane to when it was part of NBC's Tuesday night line up with THE A-TEAM at 8PM, RIPTIDE at 9PM, and topped off by REMINGTON STEELE at 10PM, back when NBC's motto was ""BE THERE"" which was NBC's slogan from the Fall of 1983 thru the Spring of 1984.",1389571200,,2763,4.929032258064516

The crime here is that only Season 1 is available at a decent price in the US. The other two seasons can be had from Amazon Canada, but at a high price. Hey Mill Creek, why don't you try to get the rights?",1324252800,,319,3.923076923076923
2615451,5,B000GNOSHW,"The 1980's saw several good private-detective TV series, all of which had in common lots of humor, good buddy relationships, intriguing cases, and out-of-the-ordinary locations.  This is the shortest-lived and perhaps the least serious of them all, but still well worth your time.  Long-time pals Cody Allen (Perry King), a rich-voiced preppy sailor who owns the classic 1930s cabin cruiser (the ""Riptide"") that serves as their home and HQ and a powerful fiberglass jetboat (the ""Ebbtide"") used when they need to get somewhere in a hurry, and tough, streetwise Nick Ryder (Joe Penny), helicopter pilot and owner of the repurposed Sikorsky cargo chopper ""Screamin' Mimi"" (otherwise known, at least to Cody, as ""that pink grenade,"" among other derogatory names), have recently turned their hands to private detection out of Slip 7, Pier 52, King Harbor, when a young woman who claims to be the only survivor of a lost charterboat begs them for help.  It seems that the King Harbor PD, in the person of the abrasive and unpleasant Lt. Ted Quinlan (Jack Ging), believes the ship to have been hijacked and she a part of the plot, while her story has it that the boat exploded and sank with all hands.  Recruiting another old friend, the classically geeky Murray Bozinsky (Thom Bray), who's a genius with computers, Cody and Nick set out to prove her case and find themselves up to their necks in drug running, gold smuggling, and double-crossing, along with the lusciously underclad all-girl crew of the charter sailer ""Barefoot Contessa"" from the slip next door.  Thereafter their cases range from a threat to Quinlan's life by the mobster husband of an old friend, a fugitive from a mental insitution who isn't sure whether or not she committed the crime that put her there, and a divorce case that teams them with a pair of female PI's (one played by Stepfanie Kramer of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hunter-The-Complete-Series/dp/B003QS0E54/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hunter: The Complete Series</a>), to a member of Murray's Hi-Q Club who, unbeknownst to herself, has attracted the attention of a professional hit man.  The set includes the double-length pilot and 12 standard episodes, all of which can be counted on to deliver high-octane action, fights, chases, bare chests and bikini-clad girls, boats and the Mimi, and--what gives the show its particular unique twist--Murray, a sweet-natured innocent eager to be ""one of the guys"" and earn respect for something other than his computer skills.  (In the closing segment he and Nick find themselves caught in a triangle with an attractive dolphin-trainer, and the partnership seems headed for the rocks.)  Though not as serious as its era-mates ""Simon & Simon"" or ""Magnum, PI"" (both of which are also available on DVD), it's a rollicking ride and should please all fans of this TV genre.",1323388800,,2886,5.245119305856833

I was impressed with the down home quality this program portrayed, and the main characters were very likeable. I always thought it would be cool if life was like that, but alas, it wasn't, and still isn't. Still, in my world, while I watched and got involved in the plot of the week, it didn't matter. I always came away with a smile on my face and a bounce in my step. And I still get the same feeling today as I grab a bowl of popcorn and a soda, sit in front of my TV set, and BAM ... I'm back on the Riptide! What a great feeling to escape this messed up world and relive a "" good ole time "" whenever I want to. Come on Cody, Boz and Nick; the Riptide awaits!

2615465,5,B000GNOSHW,"Really enjoyed this show when it was on in the 1980's. Glad it's on DVDs now. I agree with several other reviewers who urged buying this (VEI) set for Season One instead of the slighly cheaper SONY release, since VEI has released ALL 3 seasons, and SONY only released first season, and should show our support to VEI for releasing ALL 3 Seasons by buying from them! Quality was pretty good, even though there is a disclaimer at start of each disk regarding quality of ""Historical Footage"" There weren't any bonus features, except a pilot episode for a TV show I'd never heard of. VEI is based in CANADA, which may explain why Season One is slightly more expensive than SONY version, since it has to go through Customs, pay duty and whatnot, but I got their version anyway to show support! I enjoy the computer references thanks to character ""Boz"" the computer geek. The IBM pc (first generation) came out only a few years before this show aired, and they're portaying the computer as a miraculous machine they use to hack into various databases to lookup info on the bad guys! Very exciting episodes I enjoyed in the 1980's but after watching episode after episode(on DVD) I notice pattern emerging: stock plot seems to involve beautiful girl in distress; in process of resolving case, Nick, Cody & Boz always seem to be involved in high speed car chase, boat chase or helicopter chase, with bad guys shooting at them, often with automatic weapons! But is enjoyable and exciting to watch, and fun to see the stars looking young again back in the 1980's. I got all 3 seasons, it's worth it!",1225929600,,1589,4.638297872340425

I recommend this.",1207180800,,316,4.372881355932203
2615469,1,B000GNOSHW,"There are TWO releases of Riptide ""Season one"" on DVD. This release by Sony, and another by a company named VEI. Here is why I'm urging you NOT to buy this version, and instead support VEI;

Sony has a long history of neglecting fans and waiting for several YEARS to release further seasons. They also tend to discontinue many DVD TV releases, citing poor sales (no further seasons). For instance, TJ Hooker may never see another season released.

VEI on the other hand, seems to care about the fans of each series they release. Everyone thought that Hardcastle and McCormick would never make it to DVD, yet VEI released ALL THREE seasons, QUICKLY, and apparently unedited (no music changes)!

Sony has not released season TWO of Riptide, while VEI has already released BOTH Season One AND Season Two, with Season Three just around the corner (February 27, 2008)! I doubt you will even see a Season Two release of Riptide by Sony!

So, why would you want to buy this release and support Sony, when they will probably NEVER even release season two? Before clicking on the ""BUY"" button, I urge you to Search Amazon for the VEI release. As consumers we need to support the DVD releasing companies that SUPPORT ALL OF US!

Here's the info on the DVD release that you should buy:

Studio: Unidisc. Inc (This is VEI)
DVD Release Date: November 7, 2006
ASIN: B000HD0YGA

You'll find it here on Amazon.

Also, the VEI release is indeed an ""Official Release"" (Fully Licensed) and you will not be sacrificing quality!

VEI will soon be releasing Stingray, another great Stephen J. Cannell series!!!

I have NO AFFILIATION with VEI. I'm just a fan who appreciates it when a studio actually releases an entire TV series, quickly!

This series deserves FIVE STARS. The ONE STAR rating is for this SONY release.

Also, thank goodness for VEI, the company responsible for releasing Riptide, Hardcastle and McCormick and a few other titles. They've done a much better job of releasing The Stephen J. Cannell TV shows than Anchor Bay ever did. It appears that Hardcastle and McCormick was released without any music changes! And although it looks like there have been changes to Riptide (especially season two), they seem to have handled the editing a bit better than Anchor Bay did. Anchor Bay RUINED the Greatest American Hero, Hunter and 21 Jump Street.

I would also urge fans of TV on DVD to buy this DVD release of Riptide instead of the Sony release of the same season. VEI is a company that seems to care about the fans. They actually released all three seasons of Hardcastle and McCormick quickly, when nobody ever thought they would EVER be released! It looks like they will be doing the same for Riptide! Let's support them to say ""thanks""!

I think anyone who loves 80's TV will have a great time watching Riptide. I enjoyed it back in the 80's and I still enjoy it today!

Here's hoping that VEI releases Stingray soon! Another great Cannell creation!

UPDATE;

Scheduled release date for Season Three of Riptide:
February 27, 2008!
VEI has kept their promise to the fans!

2615471,5,B000GNOSHW,This show was cheesy but funny i just finished watching the First Season man i have not laughed this hard in a long time ever episode is just as funny as the last one lot of good shows came out in the 80s but this is my favorite one. Boz was the man he had all the women hanging all over him with his computer talk women loved it. Cody and Nick where funny to serious but they would always throw in a good line in the show make you laugh just great all around show. Cannot wait to get the Second Season that i just ordered.,1197763200,,523,3.897196261682243
2615482,5,B000GNOSHW,"While bootleg versions are available elsewere, I'm glad I waited for the real thing.  The image is great, the sound is fine, and makes for good TV.  Sure makes a great alternative to reality TV, in every respect.  I plan to buy the next season when it becomes available.",1189555200,,270,4.469387755102041
2615483,5,B000GNOSHW,"I remember loving this show from when my daughter was still young.  After seeing it again almost 20 years later it's still great.  The transfer is flawless in my non-professional opinion and it is like Murray says in the show, ""Boss""!  This was during the years of Stephen J. Cannell's prolific writing-spree - complete with his ""pulling the sheet out of the typewriter"" at the end of each show.  Bathing-beauties ""galore"" decorate almost every scene of the first several episodes so it may be a smidge too ""sexy"" for younger viewers.  If you don't have to worry about the kids, there's lots of ""boss"" action including the running contest of who's had the most broken noses between Cody (Perry King) and Nick (Joe Penny) as well as the great interactions between the three main characters.  Murray is a computer-geek who's naive as can be who invented the ""Roboz"" robot which he uses to ""save the day"" or Mr. Cannell just adds him as ""comedy-relief"".  Nick drives a '56 Corvette as well as ""The Screaming Mimi"" - a pink, Army-surplus chopper about the size of Rhode Island and almost as old (having to hit the switches with the heel of the hand to get it to start).  Cody has a boat called ""Riptide"" on which they live and drives a woody and various ""low-horsepowered"" oldies which invariably prove inadequate for any high-speed chase.

In the first episode you learn that Cody had the idea of quitting their normal jobs and trying their hands at the Private Investigators gig.  Computer-savvy Murray joins the team purely by accident after Cody and Nick save him from arrest by landing ontop of a high-rise office building - a building in which he is throwing a temper tantrum over the fact that the company that bought his computer game changed some of the aspects of the game he invented and sold to them - and flying him to safety.

My wife and I both love this show.  It's ""boss"".",1187308800,,1885,4.627627627627628
2615484,4,B000GNOSHW,"We searched for this TV show for years and weren't ever able to find it on video or DVD until we saw it on Amazon.  Of course, after 20 something years, it was corny and not exactly how we remembered it.  But the most amazing part was watching as Boz did things on computers and a robot (Roboz) that were not even realistic in the mid-80's.  Perhaps this show gave many computer geeks dreams and ideas for the rapid development of computer programs that are so easily accessable today.  Waiting anxiously for Season 2, which has the Christmas episode that was the most moving post-Vietnam War era story.",1178928000,,603,4.555555555555555

2615492,4,B000GNOSHW,"Its great to see this tv series finally released.  Some of the special effects may be a little dated or cheesy but the dialogue is crisp, fast & fun.  Perry King & Joe Penny were at their physical peak & very easy on the eyes.  They also had a real chemistry & easy banter that was believeable as long-time friends running a detective agency.  They also managed to squeeze in a racing car, speeding boat or swooping helicopter chase in each episode.  Worth the price & hope to see season 2 & 3 released soon.",1166486400,5,508,4.3052631578947365

2615495,5,B000GNOSHW,"Stephel J. Cannell really perfected his creative genius for this show. By taking an ordinary private detective show and placing it on a boat, and casting three likeable guys and a robot, he not only gave us something we'd never seen before, but he gave us a show where the interplay of the main characters was always far more interesting than the case they were working on.

I was a fan of the show when it was on TV, but in watching the DVDs, I have been constantly impressed with the dialog and the banter between Nick & Cody in particular. Geeky Boz will have a good line here and there, but overall, it was just a well written show.

While I was a great fan of Quinlan's characer, the Mama Jo character was just okay. However, she was vastly better than her replacement Marsha Warfield, who was sorely out of place. A female comedian running a bar and owning a tour boat full of hot chicks??? And performing stand-up outside the bar??? Hahahahahaha

But otherwise, I have been vastly entertained by watching this series again. Highly recommended!",1164067200,4,1050,4.574468085106383
2615496,5,B000GNOSHW,"Riptide is entertainment the whole family can watch together. The language spogen does not contain any improper words so this is a TV-series that you could let your children watch alone. Each episode contains action, excitement and fun. All actors deliver a very convincing performence.",1163808000,2,286,5.377777777777778
2615497,5,B000GNOSHW,This is a must have for any Perry King and/or Joe Penny fan.  The fact that there are no extras are the only negative.  Can't wait for the next season.,1163030400,2,151,4.0
2615498,4,B000GNOSHW,"It's funny how when you are a kid, you see things so differently.  I used to love this show (still do), but now I can see exactly how corny and cheesy it was.  I never used to notice what stands out today like a sore thumb - bad acting, bad editing, the two main characters Nick and Cody always touching each other and plain unrealism, however it's for some reason excellent.
There are two 'hunks' (I always did like Nick - Joe Penny) and a geek who is into computers (if they only knew back then what we know now about computers).  They run a detective agency and solve cases.  Each episode stands alone and by the 80's standards was pretty high tech.  One reason this is probably so good is because of what they could do without today's technology - no cell phones or internet etc.  This is crime the old fashioned way and it sure was fun.
If you can get beyond the outdated fashion, the corn factor and the bad humour, then you will love it.  Stephen J Cannell productions put this out and he was responsible for so many hits back in the day.  It's plain old fun and I highly recommend it.  It brings back a few memories that's for sure.  PS. - Look for appearances from a very young Geena Davis, Denis Franz and Kelly Preston.",1161302400,7,1230,4.262931034482759
2615499,5,B000GNOSHW,"The genius of Riptide is difficult to quantify; it is the one subtle aspect of a show that threatens to careen overboard in all other areas. You first briefly see its brilliance during the opening theme, so explosively edited that the appearance of the title itself feels like an afterthought. You see it in the characters: in Nick and Cody, who are constantly surrounded by beautiful, bikini-clad women but always look most comfortable sharing each other's personal space; in Murray, the impossibly earnest nerd who must have invented wireless internet; in Roboz, who brilliantly doubles as inimitable set design and convenient deus ex machina; and even in Quinlan, a police chief so one-dimensionally inept that he symbolizes an erratic force of nature more than a being capable of rational thought. You see it in the action sequences, bravely realistic in their haphazard composition, and in their running gags, the sheer length of which must have set network television records every week. It even shines through in the guest stars, most of them lesser-known actresses showcasing the most unique of performances. You see it too in the deceptively uncomplicated plots, the curious end credit freeze-frame choices, the ever-unspooling variations on the theme reprise, and the alarming frequency of shirt-removing.

It all adds up to a singular viewing experience, a fascinating product of its time that could not be replicated today. Two more seasons of Riptide gold were produced, including cameos by Steve Allen, James Cromwell and George Clooney; hopefully sales of this DVD will be high enough to warrant their future release.",1160697600,11,1632,5.252873563218391

Another of the late, great Stephen J. Cannell creations that were ahead of their time, this show features two young men as detectives for hire. The first episode brings in ""Boz"" - Murray as a tech geek that aids the duo in their escapades with his computer prowess.
