7479938,1,B016UOQAU8,"Instead of a full set of races with proper narration by Ewan MacGregor they got some dork who sounds absolutely disinterested, almost clinical in his description, and they only have what I suppose they think are highlights of each race instead of the whole race!!! THIS BLOWS!!!!  I have not been so disappointed in a long time. I buy these to enjoy the race season over & over, not to listen to a bored idiot attempt to tell me in his monotone how exciting it was as they delete nearly all laps from every race.  So pissed.  This is NOT what your fans want to see, Duke.  Go back to the way you did every single race season in review before this worthless waste of good racing.  MAN I'm mad.",1454716800,3,692,4.292307692307692

7479940,3,B016UOQAU8,"2015 was the most intense season in MotoGP history.  There were more passes in one race then there were in the entire 2014 season.  Unfortunately this year's Season Review doesn't capture all the drama and nuances of the races.  For instance, in the Argentina race, Marquez chose to run hard compound tires, while other riders chose the extra hard tires.  Marquez had a monumental lead during the race, and Rossi started out in eighth place.  But as the race wore on, Rossi picked his way through the pack, and Marquez started to have tire problems.  During the live race, there was a lot of excitement as Rossi got closer to Marquez.  But in the review, you don't get the sense of anticipation as Marc's lap times keep dropping, and Rossi keeps getting closer.  And in the Assen race, Rossi was leading at the end of the race, and had increased his gap on Marquez with 2 laps remaining.  Marquez was still trailing Rossi by just over half a second in the middle the last lap.  It looked impossible for Marc to close that gap before the end of the race.  But Marquez made a monumental effort to catch Rossi, and did.  But the review does not quite capture Marc's performance in those final turns.  The review just skips from lap 3, to turn-15 on the final lap, when Marquez was already close to Rossi.

The race commentary is read from a script.  The script itself is full of words and phrases that convey a sense of excitement.  But the narrator himself sounds like he is just struggling to keep pace with the teleprompter.  There are many places where he fumbles the words.  And at least one time, he spoke the abbreviation ""KM"" instead of saying ""kilometer"".  In fact, the commentary during the segues is much more animated.

This review also lacks non-race content.  There are only news segments on 2-3 of the races.  There are segues for ""News"", on most of the races, but then there is no news.  Post race interviews are also missing, but then those were dropped many years ago.",1452643200,5,1983,4.555240793201133
7479941,1,B016UOQAU8,"This DVD could have been pretty decent if not for the awful, monotone sounding commentator. I have nearly every Duke grand prix review DVD, and because of the awful commentary that is read from a script with no emotion, I would never recommend this DVD/BluRay. Please, please bring back Keith Huewen & Julian Ryder!",1451347200,5,315,4.851851851851852

8737304,3,B016UOQAU8,"While the race coverage was, as usual, filmed perfectly I have to agree with the majority of other viewers about the seriously flawed narration. Instead of the brilliant live commentary that I have become accustomed to the narrator sounded like he was reading from an unfamiliar script while watching the races in a studio.
It definitely lowered the level of pleasure I've experienced in the past when watching your other race films. Please bring back your former commentators.",1460160000,2,477,5.128205128205129
8737305,2,B016UOQAU8,"Ive been collecting motogp dvds since 2006 and i was so glad when they finally came out on blu ray. This blu ray tho was not as good as the other reviews because the commentator was just AWFUL!!!! He is extremely boring and totally takes away from the excitement of the races! No enthusiasm or nothing! I like the original guys! The two guys that usually always commentate the races. Theyre energy is phenomenal! They totally have me into the races! Bring them back! This new commentator is so awful, i almost sent it back because of him. Another thing i don't like is that the blu ray doesnt come in DTS or at least 5.1 HD sound. ITS BLU RAY!! One main thing we as riders love about motogp is the sound of those bikes. If it came in DTS, the sound of those bikes would be awesome coming thru my system. Give us what we want and pay for! But PLEASE don't EVER let whoever this is commentate another season review!",1457049600,3,913,4.283236994219653
