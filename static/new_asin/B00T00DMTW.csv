8700069,5,B00T00DMTW,This movie is hilarious. Filmed in South Africa with well known cast. Highly recommend!,1513468800,,87,5.285714285714286
8700070,2,B00T00DMTW,"Madcow is a spoof of the Frankenstein film. In this version a cow's head is attached to a super human body. This creature secures a chain saw and goes around killing people. The film makes fun of movie techniques used in action and horror films. It was at times amusing, but never a belly laugh. The girl reading her lines from a clipboard I thought was the best part.

Guide: F-word, nudity (Lola the body double)",1456617600,,414,4.447368421052632

If youve ever wondered what a horror movie about a half-man/half-cow lunatic wielding a chainsaw would look like, then MAD COW is the film for you.  Seriously, though, the fine (and demented) folks at Troma once again display their brilliance with this film.  Oh, it won't be for everyone, thats for surebut if you're a fan of Troma (and you know who you are), then youll love this movie.  I enjoyed it immensely, and I plan on watching it again soon.

I think Troma has topped themselves with this film.  Over-the-top doesnt even begin to describe the experience you get hereand thats a good thing!  Aside from the bizarre premise, the execution of this film is a slapstick lovers dream, and I found myself laughing quite a bit throughout the whole thing.

MAD COW is not shot very well, but it doesnt need to be.  The production value looks low, but again, thats ok.  Youre not watching this film to see high-budget special effects or top-notch acting.  And if you are, then you are obviously not familiar with how Troma operates.

The acting is atrociously good, and I love the performance given by Gregg Viljoen, who portrays Vince Chopper.  Viljoen delivers one-liners like a pro, and his straight-face expression through everything is a huge part of what makes his character so much fun.

The special effects in MAD COW are decent enough to pass off as entertaining.  The mad cow costume cracks me up every time I see it, and the gore is plentiful and fun as well.

MAD COW is a big win for me, and fans of Tromas work will love it.  This is the first Troma film to come from South Africa, so I guess you could say its beefing up Tromas international library (sorry for the pun).  Check this out if you like Tromaotherwise, you probably won't care for it.  The film is available now.",1450051200,,1862,4.5375375375375375
8700073,1,B00T00DMTW,"Don't know what the hype about this film is but TRUE cult movie fans will not appreciate the over the top SILLY HUMOR. I hated every minute of this film and could only get through 3/4 of it, then I shut it off. It's just a man in a one piece pajama with an UNREALISTIC costume rental cow head. Nothing redeeming in this film what so ever. It does not even make the list, ""SO BAD IT'S GOOD"". This title will not reside in my movie collection and was properly disposed of.",1448755200,,470,4.119565217391305
8700074,5,B00T00DMTW,"The greatest low-budget cow-slasher pun-imbibed 90 minutes I've ever spent. Best watched with a group of similarly minded friends, who don't mind when you dig your elbow into their side once again with another ""Ha! Did you see THAT?"" If you haven't seen this movie yet, check it out. This should be the next big college cult classic!!",1446681600,,334,4.775862068965517
8700075,5,B00T00DMTW,"This is a fun, silly movie that pays homage to Monty Python and any number of farces. It's a fun look at South Africa also and uses all local talent which is nice to see! I had a great time watching it and if you're into puns and well timed one liners I think you will too!!",1442534400,,274,3.824561403508772
8700076,4,B00T00DMTW,"This movie is honestly way better than I thought it would be. I went into it expecting to be disappointed, however, Madcow is a rare low-budget gem! The plot is a bloody combination of Frankenstein meets The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Just when I thought it couldn't get anymore ridiculous, I was on the floor laughing again. A genetically engineered half-cow half-man rampage revenge killer? Genuine gold. I think this is an ideal movie for a drunk Friday night with friends.",1441756800,,474,4.9375
