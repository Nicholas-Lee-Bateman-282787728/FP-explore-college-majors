I have combed the Internet in search of Old British Titles that thrilled me at the Cinema and on Early Television.
Amazon have managed to open doors to many great film titles and this collection on Vol 1 is great entertainment from begining to end.
B Grade is Buy Grade for this DVD
A Fantastic chance to add to a film collection and may many more of these treasures find their way into our hands.
As a projectionist I have seen and run films in Cinema,s and Drive-in,s and its a pleasure to buy six of the best.

3517392,5,B001CR4970,"I don't know why some people were complaining about the picture quality. I didn't find anything wrong with it. Really.... What can you expect from such old movies? I found each and every movie to be well worth the time spent viewing them. I would say, ""This set is worth every penny"". I hope someday there will be  a Volume 2.

3517393,3,B001CR4970,"These obscure British films have never been on DVD in US before and - to my knowledge at least most were not on VHS.  I chanced on to this one to see the 1958 film ""Tread Softly Stranger"" with Diana Dors - which received excellent reviews when released in the UK as a PAL DVD. I'm glad I spent the time on this film. Not only is Dors - a combo Jayne Mansfield (but with a slimmer figure) and Marilyn Monroe actress - both sexy and erotic, but the tale of a robbery gone wrong has some great twists and turns. The other films on this set aren't quite as good in my opinion.

The prints are not sharp but apparently the best that can be hoped for until someone takes the time - and money - to restore them. But at least they are out there for all the word to see. The other improvement that could be made with this set is a series of film notes about the actors, directors and the British film industry.

3517398,4,B001CR4970,"The half-dozen films in VCI's British 'B' collection #1 include two by the legendary Tod Slaughter, plus a story of cornered anarchists, a convalescent nurse implicated in murder for the second time, an honest man and son who foolishly break the law, and an industrial safe heist.

SYNOPSES--

CRIMES AT THE DARK HOUSE--  Tod Slaughter portrays a murderer who assumes the identity of his wealthy Australian victim and then travels to England to claim the man's inherited estate.

FRIGHTENED MAN--  A struggling antique shop owner fences some stolen goods to raise money for his son's university  education. The boy comes home looking for some fast cash; he gets involved in a gang-style robbery that goes terribly wrong.

GIRL IN THE NEWS--  A nurse acqutted in the death of an elderly patient changes her name and takes a job as assistant to a wheelchair-bound man whose wife and butler want to kill him and frame the girl for the crime. Directed by Carol Reed (""The Third Man"").

HOODED TERROR--  Master sleuth Sexton Blake pursues the ""Snake,"" and his gang of masked thugs, the ""Hooded Terror."" A fine opportunity to watch Tod Slaughter (as our bad guy) devour the scenery with his usual gusto.

SIEGE OF SIDNEY ST.--  Anarchists trying to raise money in aid of Latvia's freedom fight are involved in a deadly robbery. The building they take shelter in is surrounded by 100 policemen. Story of the failed robbery is told in flashback as the seige unfolds. Based on a true event from 1911.

TREAD SOFTLY STRANGER--  Calculating woman plays upon the affections of two brothers, convincing them to rob a safe at the steel mill where one of them works. During the heist, a night watchman is killed, and his son sets out to find those responsible.

8288964,4,B001CR4970,"I was pleasantly surprised by this film.  There were tons of Sexton Blake stories written by several authors in the ""Penny Dreadfuls"" in England from about the time of the first Sherlock Holmes stories.  Several Sexton Blake movies were made in England including the first in 1909.  There was also a television series starting in 1967 and running through 1971.  With that introduction; this particular film was from 1939 and featured better acting, better scripting, better sets, and better suspense than I had any reason to expect.  Certainly on a par with the best of the Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes films of the era.  Worth a look.",1475712000,,637,4.906542056074766

8288966,4,B001CR4970,"PLOT: a mysterious Tong gang with hoods~

1938~ this starts in what is China and a table surrounded with ""mysterious"" hooded figures~ the HEAD man has a coiled snake to ID as the Boss the rest just have a long snake on theirs. Now to London where a man has a message about the Hooded men. He is killed before he can pass on the message to Sexton Blake. Who looks like Sherlock Holmes and by some coincidence lives on ""Baker Street""...LOL Blake is on the trail of the gang who have a great hide out~ complete with a spy view of the street via a camera so they can see every one who approaches the hide out. the pass word is ""I have been sent by the snake"" to get into a gaming room which is the ""cover"" for the gang activity. When a woman agent is  kidnapped by the ""hooded snake""~ the ONLY clue left at the scene is a RARE stamp which leads us to a WEALTHY stamp collector. This is a good movie but not a great one. The costumes are cheesy and the woman detective heroine is very hammy~ Blake is good but the fun is his overly suspicious landlady and his bumbling side kick. This copy is ""not bad"" but not good. Very dark in places so you have to sometimes replay a scene just to see what is going on. I give it 4 STARS~ because the SNAKE hide out and CAMERA surveillance are great and add to the plot where everyone is sneaking around the Snake Gang are watching them on a TV screen. ~ 4 STARS~",1424131200,,1395,4.069090909090909
8288967,3,B001CR4970,"Hardly known(let's face it: forgotten), the British low-budget ""Hooded Terror"" is a snappy, fast, and dark crime-horror film, starring the great Victorian ham, Todd Slaughter. His best film, among many, was ""Crimes of the Dark House"". Tod Slaughter's grisly movies played on in England in the late 1930's, even when the country banned Bela Lugosi horror films. ""Sexton Blake and the Hooded Terror"" is Sexton Blake, the Baker Street detective, looking for information on the Black Quorum, a ruthless and powerful criminal network. Blake wants their leader, the Hooded Terror. Blake works with his ace, Tinker, and a pretty French spy, Mademoiselle Galley, his girl. The movie's exciting finish is a slap-dash riot; Sexton Blake invades the Snake/Hooded Terror's ""Death Chamber of Serpents"", to rescue his friends. Tinker and the girl are tied-up in the middle of a snake pit. Blake shoots the Snake, wounding him, as the police arrive. The Snake rushes out a back door. The police chief shouts: ""Sexton Blake, help us catch the Snake!"". Blake shrugs and says: ""No. I'm leaving now..."". ""The Hooded Terror"" is over, and the Snake is still at large! And all in 69 minutes. In a small part is future star David Farrar, playing a gent named Granite Grant.",1366934400,,1250,5.014423076923077
