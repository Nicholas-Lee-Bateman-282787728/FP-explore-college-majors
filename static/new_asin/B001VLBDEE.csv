8346599,3,B001VLBDEE,The physical movie itself is fine.  We are satisfied with the product.  The movie itself had way too many gaps in the logic.  Crammed too many messages into 1 movie and didn't do a good job at any of them.,1255651200,,205,4.075
8346600,5,B001VLBDEE,"I saw this movie in the theatre and I simply loved it. The movie is very much family oriented and discusses some very real happenings in the life of a teenager especially in America. The teenager, young boy gets mixed up with the wrong company and starts copying their behavior. The young man starts drinking, disprespecting his mother and abusing the internet. His girlfriend and mother help him get on the right track by cultivating his interest in robotics. The director does a great job of capturing these moments on screen. The movie may not be your big budget hollywood movie, but it captures most of the intricicacies, emotions and troubles that teenagers go through. This movie is a must watch, I have already ordered my copy on Amazon, waiting for it to be delivered.",1243728000,,776,4.7555555555555555
8346601,5,B001VLBDEE,"When my two teenage sons and I went to the movies one day, we knew nothing about this film. We got to see it by chance - nothing good was on that day in the movie theatre. And we were pleasantly surprised! Nowadays, when teenagers get bombarded by violence, openly sexual context scenes, blood, murders from all the possible screens (movies, TV, internet, musical clips and so on), this film was like a gulp of fresh water in the desert.
'Catch your mind' is a deep film that tries to analyze a lot of issues that American families can identified themselves with: single parent challenges, love-hate relationships between children and parents, complex interactions between schoolmates etc.
 It shows life of a suburban boy Bruce, who is entering the dangerous zone of early adolescence. He is a great kid, but his mother who is juggling her work, going through a divorce and raising two kids cannot fully protect him from the influences that every teenager is facing on the streets: drinking, smoking, swearing, unguarded emotions, sex.
Authors depict Bruce's first love exceptionally gently and tactfully. They show how vulnerable our kids can be at this period of their lives.  Even though Bruce's crush on Monica ( she is very hot looking young actress, as my sons mentioned!)  did not have a happy ending, it helped him to get involved with an interest of his life -  robotics.
Scenes of robotic competitions are so intense, catchy and exciting that my kids started researching this topic as soon as they got home! Unfortunately, not many schools have this type of activity as an extra curriculum, but this is a great thing to keep our teenagers from the streets.
  It's a very talented piece of directorial work and my family cannot wait to buy the DVD for our home collection.

8346602,5,B001VLBDEE,"very good movie, loved the plot and seeing the challenges different characters faced. Seeing it in theaters was great and now i've bought it to watch again and again in my own home.",1241913600,,181,4.515151515151516
8346603,4,B001VLBDEE,"As a person about a decade out of high school, it's easy to get nostalgic about that period of my life.  This movie managed to put me right back in to school.  I felt what it was like to have the crush on the girl, to begin to spend time with a new group of friends, or to have tension with my mother.  So unlike the normal, happy nostalgia I feel, this was more of a ""real"" look at that time period.

I think this is a great movie for families with middle school aged kids to watch together.  Parents will remember what it was like when they were that age, and children will be interested to see what life will be like (and the challenges they'll face) in a few short years when they reach high school.

Wholesome flick with a good message, and you don't see much of that these days.  Good stuff.",1241395200,2,797,4.103225806451613
8346604,4,B001VLBDEE,"This is a very good movie to watch as a parent. It is all about letting one's child go . Director and producer should be appreciated for their noble intention of a clean and responsible movie. I was looking for this DVD and this movie is a must have in libraray of every parent.

I am going to order it this week end.",1241136000,,317,4.031746031746032
