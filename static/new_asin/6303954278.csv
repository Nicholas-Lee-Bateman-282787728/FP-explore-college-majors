737318,3,6303954278,"Eh. I guess I can see the appeal. There is definitely a certain charm in the sincerity and enthusiasm of a B movie like this. Yeah the production is shoddy, the dialogue is clunky, and the story lurches forward awkwardly and often nonsensically, but it was clearly assembled by people who were having unconditional fun with the material. But aside from the few cool practical effects moments, the film just didn't do much for me. I could've gotten up and turned it off at any point without a second thought. The story was just too flimsy and it never made good on the satirical potential of the concept beyond the obvious, surface-level jabs at consumerist culture. Again I can see why some would be endeared to the childlike enthusiasm and wackiness of it all, but it ultimately left me feeling indifferent.

_The Stuff_ fluctuated very unevenly in genre (horror, thriller, comedy), tone (serious, scary, silly), and quality (writing, directing, acting).

Also, it felt like the film was a one-person operation. I now see the writer, producer, and director were the same individual, which might explain the shortcomings.

The sweet mystery treat is soon taking the country by storm. It's low in calories and it tastes great, so shut up and buy! A spy (Michael Moriarty) is hired by the competing ice cream company to try and crack The Stuff's secret formula. What he gets is a little more than he bargained for, as he battles giant waves of fanatical Fluff, inexplicably beds a beautiful woman (Andrea Marcovicci) and somehow attracts a tag-along child (Scott Bloom).

If the above synopsis makes your stomach churn, ""The Stuff"" may not be the right stuff for you. If, however, you read it and are intrigued, you probably won't be able to get enough of ""The Stuff."" It's a silly b-movie to be sure. Throwing logic out the window at just about every turn, director Larry Cohen's schlockfest delivers silly, easily digestible entertainment, delivering chuckles (some intended, some otherwise) by the bucket load. Michael Moriarty is game as the hapless lead. With his lazy, drunken demeanor, you forgive the fact that he basically stumbles over his own lines and find yourself cheering the guy on as he encounters racists and racist stereotypes alike and goes toe to toe with the titular goo.

The special effects are remarkably pretty effective for the era and the budget. In most shots, you'll believe that a dessert really could come to live and swallow you whole, like an albino blob.

737562,3,6303954278,"The Stuff (1985), by Larry Cohen, has long been on my radar. For some reason I never saw it on cable, nor has the film fallen into my lap. I know the film has made several lists for cult and horror, but it wasn't until Arrow Videos Blu-ray release that The Stuff found its way onto my TV. Lately, the films director, Larry Cohen, has had a resurgence with his films suddenly becoming available on Blu-ray. Cohens films dabble in everything from giant lizards attacking New York in Q (1982), to babies eating their way out of their mothers wombs in Its Alive (1974). His films are an acquired taste and not for your average movie goer, which made The Stuff all the more a curiosity.

The Stuff, at the beginning, pays a quick homage to classic sci-fi thriller The Blob (1958). An older gentlemen finds this strange goo on the ground. Instead of it consuming him, he consumes it and thinks it tastes pretty good. Thus, the product that will become known as The Stuff is born. Now before you start citing FDA regulations and question how they market such a product, Cohens script addresses all of that. It is protected by the same copyright that keeps Coca-Colas formula safe. This is where David Rutherford (Michael Moriarty), who goes by Mo and finds a way to work it into all of his various aliases, enters the picture. His job is to discover and bring back the secret ingredients for The Stuff by any and all means possible. A rival company is sick of losing sales to The Stuff and feels that the monopoly on the dessert should be over.

The story switches gears, for all but a moment, to reveal the essential sub plot that The Stuff is actually an addicting drug with a possible mind of its own. We meet Jason (Scott Bloom) and his typical American family. Jason discovers The Stuff moving on its own, one night, in the fridge and its enough for him not want to eat it, ever. The poor kid discovers he is on his own since his entire family is already addicted to The Stuff. To illustrate this point even further, they have replaced every meal with this dessert-like substance. Jason goes on a personal crusade to take out The Stuff in his own home town, but the odds and its addiction are beyond this young boys control.

There is a lot of good stuff (wink, wink) here for this film. In the special features, which are new for this Blu-ray release, Cohen talks about his inspiration for the film stemming all the way back to WW2. According to Cohen, cigarette companies supplied the troops with free cigarettes to get them addicted and thus secure their market for after the war. He also cites how marketing has gotten completely out of hand, circa 1985. So just after a few minutes of watching the film, you can see where The Stuff developed its cult status. Its a scary concept, even now. However, if Cohen made the film today, it might be an app, a mobile device, or a social media page that has everyone addicted.

The Stuff suffers from a lack of cohesion in the script. Moriartys Rutherford finds his first in with The Stuff company by flirting with its head adverting executive, Nicole (Andrea Marcovicci). He makes a great promise about buying her agency and talking about it over dinner, but before we ever see that scene take place, he is already questioning Vickers (Danny Aiello), a former founder of The Stuff corporation, and a checking out a whole town in Virginia that had marketed The Stuff first. When Nicole does reappear, she is on board with stopping The Stuff and letting the public know how horrible it is. We never saw her moment of realization about The Stuff, nor how Rutherford brought her over to his side.

Another odd thread in this story is Garrett Morris Chocolate Chip Charlie W. Hobbs. Hobbs was put out of business by The Stuff and he looks to settle the score. Rutherford and Hobbs meet in Virginia and their familiarity with one another is that of old college buddies, not two perfect strangers that have just met. It is completely jarring and really takes you off the film about an addicting and killing dessert.

We are given some great elements to the story that could have been. The Stuff is actually oozing from the Earth and makes everyone who eats it want it more. We see its affect and that alone is scary enough to hold up a mirror to ourselves with anything we over indulge in. Cohen, as well as many others in the special features, talks about budgetary constraints, which is only one of the problems with the film. Michael Moriarty may have been Cohens go to actor, much like Steven Spielberg and Richard Dreyfus, but his bad hair piece and even worse accent make him ridiculous and not a leading man you want to root for.

The Stuff is a film with a lot of great ideas, but is poorly executed. I have found this to be true with a lot of Larry Cohens work. I wish that someone or some studio would take his crazy stories and build a world out of them, like Marvel and DC Comics are doing with their properties. His films are ripe with rich and timeless ideas, they just lack that one element that makes them great: direction.",1466899200,,5076,4.4989154013015185

737630,5,6303954278,"Review was originally written for my site Mind of Tatlock. The product was provided for review.

The Stuff is a flick that rightly deserves the cult classic status. It's a film that wants to have a fun, goofy time and that's exactly what it delivers. It's hard to take a flick about a killer dessert serious and director Larry Cohen knows this and decides to just go balls to wall fun. Arrow Video already released this Blu-ray in the UK back in 2014, and this Region 1 release is the exact same as that release, so if you already own the UK Blu, there is no reason to get this one. However, if you don't own it yet, there is no better time than now to get your hands on this delicious dessert...

Movie Review:

The Stuff - a delicious dessert that was found bubbling up through the Earth's surface. What is it? No one knows, but it's highly addictive and the more you eat, the less human you become. The Stuff was found by accident, an accident that involved a person willing to stick his fingers in a bubbling white substance and shove it in his mouth. A faceless corporation hears of this deadly delicious stuff and starts to see dollar signs. They market it to the public and the public eats it up, literally. Competitors are looking to replicate the formula, so they hire corporate saboteur David 'Mo' Rutherford (Michael Moriarty in a super fun and quirky role) to investigate the stuff and figure out how it's made.

It doesn't take too long for 'Mo' to find out that The Stuff isn't exactly the best thing to eat, as he sees first hand what it can do to you. He decides to team up with Nicole, the marketing genius behind The Stuff and a boy who saw The Stuff move all by itself. Also, Chocolate Chip Charlie (Garrett Morris) and Colonel Malcolm Grommett Spears (Paul Sorvino) jump into the flick to help out for a bit. Yes, if that all sounds random, it is.

The Stuff is a combination of The Blob and Invasion of the Body Snatchers and it manages to succeed in combining the two. It's a throwback flick from 1985, with some stellar practical effects and hilariously awful visual effects. It has a quick pace, with some sketchy editing, resulting in a flick that feels like it's jumping all over the place, but it's this kinetic pace that makes The Stuff exciting to watch. It doesn't take itself seriously, even though there is a lot that can be said about the sad state of consumerism present in the flick. Larry Cohen didn't want to make a preachy film, he wanted to make a fun film and that's exactly what you get with The Stuff.

Blu-ray Opinion:

Like I already mentioned before, The Stuff is a Region 1 re-release of the UK edition from Arrow Video. It has the same audio, video and special features, which are all solid. You might be worried when you access the special features section and only see three features, a making of, trailer commentary and trailer, but don't fret! The Making of is a whopping 52-minute segment featuring interviews with Larry Cohen, Andrea Marcovicci, Steve Neill and others. It's an impressive special feature with a ton of information on this cult classic flick. That feature alone is worth the purchase. The other feature, the trailer commentary by director Darren Bousman is a fluff piece, but still fun.

Verdict:

They don't make movies like this anymore! The Stuff is fun; plain and simple. It's a quirky, confusingly edited blast. Region 1 folks can be happy to know they can now easily get their hands on this wonderful release from Arrow Video. Buy this Blu for sure! Although buying only one might not be enough, as you probably already know, enough is never enough! (Okay, one is probably enough, but hey, I needed to use that line somewhere, right?)",1464220800,,3709,4.548725637181409
737631,5,6303954278,"Larry Cohens 1985 horror comedy satire The Stuff may be 31 years old, but is as fun and poignant as ever. The rampant over-medication and obsessive consumer culture of the 80s is not something of the past; on the contrary, the 80s simply laid the foundation that weve continued to build upon and grow into a certain brand of capitalist somnambulism that has come to represent our culture.

Most genre fans know the story; but, just in case, heres a quick recap:

In the opening scene, a rail worker finds some white ooze seeping out of the ground and, like anyone in his or her right mind would, he eats it. Turns out that its the best thing hes ever tasted. This stuff is soon harvested and marketed as The Stuff.. The whole damn country embraces the low on calories, high on taste treat they just cant get enough of The Stuff!

The Stuff may taste great and be healthy on the surface, but it turns out to be a living ooze that turns those who eat it into brainless walking corpses before literally eating them from within. The sentient, parasitic substance is uncovered for what it truly is by a few people, starting with a young boy named Jason. Along with former FBI agent Mo Rutherford and the beautiful Nicole, Jason leads the battle against The Stuff and those peddling it.

In the end, evil plans are thwarted, hope is restored, and The Stuff is destroyed or is it?

This story has a special place in the hearts of many a fan of horror and science fiction films. In the tradition of the great B-movie fare, the film is schlocky and socially conscious all at once. It cuts deeply with its fierce and pointed satire, all the while retaining its fun and enjoyable nature. There is no doubt why the film is so beloved. Whats more is that the film has never looked better than in the brand new Arrow Films Special Edition Blu-ray. Even without the brilliant special features, the scan of the original negative is flawless and the film comes to life in a way never before available on home video. The sound is crisp and clear. If one has only previously seen one of the DVD releases or watched the film streaming on Netflix prior to watching this print, it will surely be a revelation to him or her.

In addition to the 1080p high definition restoration Blu-ray, the package also features a standard edition DVD, a booklet with art work, and an essay from Joel Harley. The cover art is reversible, with one side being the original cover art and the other a brand new piece, both sides with their own appeal. But the real stuff in The Stuff is on the Blu.

As noted above, the film looks and sounds great. The original trailer is included on the disc, along with an intro and commentary to the trailer Saw II, III, and IV director/The Stuff megafan Darren Lynn Bousman (whom the reviewer reveres due to his brilliant hyperstylized splatterpunk musical Repo! The Genetic Opera). However, the real gem on the Blu-ray is the accompanying documentary, Cant Get Enough of The Stuff: Making Larry Cohens Classic Creature Feature.

Fans of The Stuff, as well as Cohens other quirky genre films, will find a lot of Stuff to sink their teeth into, with stories and anecdotes from several of the people involved in the film. Cohen himself discusses the film from concept to finished product. The segment highlighting the makeup and effects is especially fun and entertaining.

From the classic lines like Mos No one is as dumb as I appear to be to the rivers of yogurt-like ooze to the rabid Stuff-crazed dog, its all here and in the best looking presentation to date. Whether its your first time watching or your 27th, with Arrows The Stuff Special Edition, enough is never enough!

I was 11 years-old when THE STUFF came out on VHS, and I got to enjoy the film a short while later.  At the time, I remember thinking the movie was a bit tame for my standards, however it was still excellent and very entertaining.  Here it is, 30 years later, and I can still state the same things.  THE STUFF is full of gooey, horrific goodness, and I highly recommend you check it out.  If youve seen it before, youll love revisiting this one in HD; and if you're new to the film, well, you're in for a treat.

I love the premise of THE STUFF:  a guy walking around a worksite sees a gooey substance coming out of the ground.  So what does he do?  Well, he dips his fingers in and tastes it, of course!  What else would you do?  This comedic start to the film shows the lightheartedness of the concept, and then it sets the tone for a darkly humorous commentary about consumerism and societys blind submission to marketing.

THE STUFF is shot well and looks very good onscreen, thanks to Arrow Video and MVDs HD transfer.  I found only a couple of grainy scenes, usually during lower-light shots, but the rest of the film looks great.  Likewise, the sound has been amped up as well.

The acting in THE STUFF is good but campy, which is exactly what the film strives for early on.  Michael Moriarty does a great job as the lead, and he is joined by an interesting ensemble of supporting actors that include Paul Sorvino, Danny Aiello, and Garrett Morris.

The special effects are surprisingly good, given the time period.  Most of them are practical effects, and they look great.  But there are also a few camera-tricks used that still look good, however its sometimes obvious.  For example, when Jason is trapped in the tanker truck and the stuff is oozing toward him, its pretty blatant that the goo is superimposed from another piece of film.  Still, this does not detract from the film at all.

THE STUFF is a huge win for me, and I think its another fine feather in the caps of Arrow Video and MVD Distribution.",1461801600,,2090,4.402088772845953
737637,4,6303954278,"I remember watching THE STUFF when I was just a little guy and it wasn't one of the films from that era I would have a life-long obsession with. That's not to say I didn't enjoy it, but it wasn't a classic to me at the time. Now that Arrow Video has put together a stellar presentation of the film on Blu-Ray, I figured now would be a good time to re-visit and give it a new evaluation. I've noticed how it has grown into a cult film and I needed to know for myself if it's worthy the moniker.

 If you're unfamiliar with the story, it goes like this: An old man discovers a white goo bubbling out of the Earth and decides to give it a taste. The stuff ends up being delicious and it's quickly marketed. It's an overnight success and soon everyone is eating it all the time. A young boy named Jason (Scott Bloom) discovers it moving in his fridge and realizes something is wrong. No one will believe him except for ex-FBI agent ""Mo"" Rutherford (Michael Moriarty) who was hired to investigate what's actually in THE STUFF. People grow horribly addicted to the snack food, so addicted they begin to kill for it. Jason sees his family change when addicted to THE STUFF so he, ""Mo"", and ad agent Nicole (Andrea Marcovicci) set out to find the origin and destroy every last bit of it.

As silly as the premise may be, it's an excellent social commentary on consumerism that's just as relevant in modern society as it was in the 80's (if not more so). The film also works as a horror/comedy. The cast boasts solid performances from not only Moriarty, Bloom, and Marcovicci, but also Danny Aiello, Paul Sorvino, and the amazing Garrett Morris as Chocolate Chip Charlie. Watching THE STUFF only helped to cement my love of practical effects. While some work better than others, the ones that do hit are quite brilliant.

Arrow's transfer is beautiful! The film was meant to be a big colorful extravaganza and it has never been more evident than on this disc. The colors are vibrant and crisp, making the crazy commercials in the film really blind you. While the special features may appear a bit thin, it contains a brand  spanking new hour long documentary featuring interviews with Larry Cohen, Andrea Marcovicci, and many others. The doc touches on every single aspect of the film, covering the effects, stories about Moriarty's improv, and blowing up equipment. Rounding out the features is Darren Lynn Bousman's commentary on the trailer which was from the Trailers from Hell series. THE STUFF has earned its cult film status and this disc will help cement the idea for many years to come.",1461024000,,2586,4.5766738660907125
737638,3,6303954278,"The Stuff is the new dessert sensation sweeping America. Its tasty, low in calories, and doesnt stain. The downside: it has a life of its own. Young Jason (Scott Bloom) seems to be the only person who doesnt love The Stuff. In fact, he won't go anywhere near it after seeing the pudding crawling around the refrigerator one night. Everyone who eats The Stuff starts acting weird. Teaming up with industrial saboteur David Mo Rutherford (Michael Moriarty), Jason is determined to put a stop to The Stuff and the devious organization behind it, or they face a gooey demise.

Combining elements of The Blob and Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Stuff attempts to satirically comment on Americans tendency to become infatuated with anything new and trendy. Once the plot is set in motion, however, the film never lives up to its potential. With some routine chase sequences and a bunch of wisecracks uttered as the real purpose of The Stuff is revealed, the movie teeters on the fence between comedy and horror, never settling on a consistent tone. Even as horror/comedy, The Stuff falls short.

Director Larry Cohen (Its Alive, Original Gangstas) uses the premise as a jumping off point for shots at commercials, marketing, industrial espionage, and nutrition. One of the humorous  though pessimistic  messages of the movie is that since we don't seem to care enough about food additives that could contribute to illness and even death, its faster simply to ingest a food that doesnt prolong the agony.

Though the premise is far-fetched and the script is uneven, the movies characters are well defined, three-dimensional folks who find themselves in situations that aren't so hard to believe. An above-average cast Andrea Marcovicci, Paul Sorvino, Danny Aiello, Patrick ONeal, Alexander Scourby, and Russell Nype  allow us to suspend disbelief and lose ourselves in the bizarre fantasy.

Bonus extras on the R-rated Blu-ray release include an introduction and trailer commentary by director Darren Bousman (Saw II, Saw III); making-of documentary featuring director Larry Cohen, producer Paul Kurta, actress Andrea Marcovicci, and mechanical make-up effects artist Steve Neill; reversible sleeve with original and newly commissioned art work; original trailer; and collectors booklet with a new essay on the film and original stills and promotional materials.",1460851200,,2359,5.257978723404255
737739,4,6303954278,"The concept of this film is so ridiculous it just has to work - at least in the able hands of Larry Cohen, who does not turn his basic plot into a by-the-numbers shocker but an all-out-attack against the FDA and the American food industry as such. And while the film does deliver its fair share of shocks and gore scenes, its main focus is satire - and as satire, with a weird and intentionally trashy twist to it, the film works like a charm, constantly sidetracking but never derailing its horror plot with witty allusions and deservingly mean hints ... which makes the whole movie as hilarious as it is horrific. And a quirky central performance by Michael Moriarty doesn't hurt to much either, now does it?

737740,4,6303954278,"Review-How do I define the 80s? The era of the video store. I loved going to the movie theater, do not get me wrong. I really loved going to the video store and seeing all these direct to video horror films that you knew would be extremely cheap, but would provide you some entertainment and fun. Case in point, studios like Vestron Video and New World were the kings of the video store experience. I would mention Orion in the mix, but those films mostly had theatrical runs first. Thorn-Emi was the same as well. New World Pictures though, you would read the box and they would have all the stars in the film on it, and also in parentheses the films they were in just in case they were not that big a star. The Stuff is a great example of the beauty of New World. You have a film that centers on this mysterious ice cream like substance that is sweeping the world. The ice cream like substance seems to be turning the people who consume it into zombies who are out to protect the substance. A film like The Stuff works on the level of taking a horror film premise and mixing it in with dark satire about topics like what we consume in our bodies and what we are led to believe by ads and sales pitches.

Larry Cohen takes his element of horror and adds a conspiracy element to the film where we see how consumerism is turning people into mindless followers. It also has a message that what we put into our bodies could be harming us, and if we used our brains and not let others dictate to us what to consume we would see the harm it causes. The Stuff is the weirdest kind of message film. It is like if you watched The Blob and they were giving you messages of global warming and anorexia. I remember seeing it in 1985 and loving it then, but seeing it today on blu ray my love has grown fonder. This is not only a cult classic, but it was also so ahead of its time. For fans of 50s horror with dark comedy mixed in, you should seek this film out immediately. If you have the dvd, throw it away and buy this blu ray. The picture quality is so superior to the original that I owned as well. The sound quality was good, but I am just happy this is finally on blu ray. This film was the anti 80s film, and should really be commended for standing the test of 31 years.",1460505600,,2267,4.140589569160998

737742,3,6303954278,"Larry Cohen's The Stuff (1985) covers a lot of ground; the most obvious target being '80s consumerism and our cultural fixation on excess cleverly embodied by the film's phony product tagline ""Enough is never enough!""  In this particular instance we're talking about a sentient goo that bubbles up out of the ground and is sold to the American public as a deliciously addictive dessert - The Stuff - and accompanied by a series of catchy jingles, TV commercials and colorfully appealing packaging.  It's an ingenious satire of one of our most obvious social weaknesses, but, as critic Kim Newman points out, Cohen's films always sound brilliant on paper; it's a much bumpier road translating his high concept ideas to the screen.

Corporate spy David ""Mo"" Rutherford (Michael Moriarty) is hired to discover the secret recipe behind The Stuff by a consortium of worried ice cream executives.  The first red flag is his discovery that all the FDA officials who gave the product their stamp of approval are now deceased or missing.  And the only man willing to talk (Danny Aiello in a brief cameo) is suspiciously afraid of the family dog that's hooked on The Stuff too.

With the help of an ad executive (Andrea Marcovicci), a chocolate-chip cookie magnate (Garrett Morris) and a 10-year-old kid who suspects the truth, the trio uncover what American's don't want to hear:  their favorite low-calorie dessert is actually eating them alive!

While the idea is a satirical dream come true, Cohen doesn't always follow the logical path.  A self described ""jazz artist of the cinema,"" the director goes off on narrative tangents, chooses bizarre riffs on the main theme, and allows lead actor Michael Moriarty (Law & Order) to improvise at will; creating a main character that feels like he's on an extended day pass from a psycho ward.  Of course, all of this is what makes The Stuff so wonderfully unpredictable.

As a Blob-like rip-off of genre clich&eacute;s, the script should almost write itself (and the film does feature several VHS-era effects of exploding heads and melting faces), but Cohen seems to purposefully mess with the monster movie format.  Not a straight comedy but far from a traditional creature feature, The Stuff often falls victims to its own narrative eccentricities; Paul Sorvino's appearance in the third act as a gung-ho conspiracy nut who nearly takes over the film being the most egregious.  As it all heads towards a series of miniature effects and exploding towers of slime, one wishes Cohen could have made the rest of the film as smart and savvy as the fake commercials he used to sell his imaginary man-eating yogurt.

Arrow's new 2K scan of the film should do wonders for its reputation either way.  As a movie most folks discovered on VHS, their new release is a like a digital head-cleaner, bringing out detail and color you probably never knew was there.  Extras include a 60-minute documentary that gives Cohen a chance to explain his intentions and work ethics (even he admits he's hell to work for) along with comments from the cast and crew.  There's also a quick Trailers from Hell segment, the original theatrical trailer plus liner notes and new reversible cover artwork.",1459641600,,3213,4.942379182156134

Whats (or Whos) Being Eaten

Amos Lassen

The Stuff is a movie about The Stuff, a new desert taking supermarket shelves by storm. It is said to delicious, low in calories and it does not stain the family carpet. Young Jason seems to be the only one who doesnt love The Stuff in fact he won't go anywhere near it but then he claims to have seen the pudding crawling around the fridge one night. Additionally, everyone who eats The Stuff has started acting really strange. Jason teams up with Mo, a wisecracking industrial saboteur to put a stop to The Stuff and the organization behind it.

the stuff1

Larry Cohen directed of this as horror film about a guy who tried the new desert, The Stuff and liked it so much suggested it to friends and then learns that it is not only addictive but sentient as well. It did not take long for it to spread and becomes one of the favorite snack food.

the stuff2

It seems that The Stuff is a allegory for consumerism told with a fun story. This mysterious substance oozes out of the ground in a quarry and it tastes good. Within days it was being sold in incredible mass quantities to the whole country and people are eating it for breakfast, lunch, dinner, desert and supper. They feed it to their pets and put it in their coffee.

the stuff5

Rival candy companies are not happy about this and so they an industrial spy, David `Mo Rutherford, to find out exactly what it is. What he finds is rather sinister indeed. And with the help of a commercial maker, a runaway kid and a militia leader he tries to put a stop to The Stuff. However, the viewer never really hears what this goo is. Perhaps it is just that the movie is a look at capitalist consumerism that was so popular in the 1980s in this company and is satirized here. There is a lot of fun made of commercials and scenes where the characters talk about the evils of products that are extensively advertised. There are those who love the desert so much that they begin hording it.

the stuff3

Once someone comes into contact with the substance and ingests it, he/she is replaced with a Stuff clone thats looks like the person but with something missing. When Jason refuses to eat The Stuff his parents angrily ground him, sending him to his room until he conforms. When Jason fakes eating it, his family is pleased.

the stuff6

For when it was made (1980s) the special effects are quite good. These include evil stop-motion marshmallow fluff and the gore and facial prosthetics. But there are also times when The Stuff oozes around like The Blob. The pacing is excellent and the satire works everywhere but during the scene transitions which are quite funny but I am not sure they were meant to be. Characters seem to come out of nowhere without ever having been established, then they may never be seen again regardless of the rapport they may have built. As I said, we never learn where the goo came from and we also do not learn what is purpose is. Was it trying to overtake the world or just achieve peaceful domination?

the stuff7

Nonetheless, this is a strangely satisfying film even though it seems to have no idea where it is headed. It seems to think that it makes sense and thats good enough for me.

We all know that there are some movies that have the most wooden and uncommitted actors, we've seen special effects that wouldn't convince a child of three, and we've heard lines that left us scratching our heads in wonder. Even so, some of these movies still entertain us!

This movie has all of these elements *in abundance* but is boring and stupid from start to finish. The plot has enough holes that it's as if it was written by the village idiot.

Technically, the movie is amateur, from the sound, the camera angles and direction, everything is done quick and cheap. The effects in one scene simultaneously rip off Alien, Nightmare on Elm St. and The thing... without any effect, it's just a joke. Who would be afraid of foam anyway?

The heroes of the movie are two obnoxious morons, one of whom does the whole ""judo chop"" routine but without any sense of irony. (as seen in Austin Powers for example.)

 The other guy is a fat colonel who is surrounded by goofy looking young boys dressed up as soldiers, he is apparently a stereotypical bigot who hates a guy because he's black and believes that ""liberal thoughts"" and ""communism"" are everywhere and need to be stopped. He also said that the Vietnam war was lost ""back home,"" which is really insulting to the actual people who fought that war and the people that know the history of that situation.

I know, you think I should lighten up, and hey... I love politically incorrect funnies... but this stuff was not funny at all, not by a longshot, and not even unintentionally so.

The so called satire in this movie is basically a ham fisted attempt at reminding us that the American public is being infiltrated by liberals with ""liberal thoughts"" being represented by ""the stuff."" This, of course is a communist plot designed to undermine America from within.

What an absolute load of rubbish, most people just want to be free and live their lives in this great country, without being pissed on by fascists like the guys who came up with this movie.

But like I said, even if you put all this aside... there's no horror, no zombies, nothing remotely funny about this s*** - pile of a movie.",1427500800,,2224,4.581863979848866

THE STUFF: It looks like marshmallow cream, tastes better than Ben & Jerrysand comes bubbling up from a quarry, ready to be pumped into trucks, clumped into cartons and dumped into stores as The Stuff. Its also addictive and aliveand if you eat enough of it, it takes over your mind then consumes you from the inside.

Industrial saboteur Moe Rutherford (Moriarty), hired by a rival fast food chain to steal the secret recipe, discovers all of the above and more, with the help of Nicole (Marcovicci), the brain behind The Stuffs PR campaign, and Jason (Bloom), a kid who saw it move and watches it turn his family into the Cleavers from Hell. Can this intrepid trio manage to infiltrate the plant and get its evil owners to Stuff it?

Discussion: Ever get a craving for junk food? Ive always held the theory that the billions served burger chain (which must remain nameless to avoid litigation) puts a little something extra in each burger: an undetectably small quantity of some addictive chemical that makes you crave a burger fix once a month or so... Obviously, Larry Cohen thinks likewise (and, if the packaging of The Stuff is any indication, he also hates Baskin-Robbins).

The Stuff is a throwback to old 50s Grade Z sci-fi flicks like The Blob and Invasion of the Body Snatchers, but done with an undercurrent of fun and a nod to modern advertising (the stuff if there ever was some). Morris is in great form, and Moriarty has a high old time as a good old boy, floating through the flick full of Southern charm and smarm. Its a captivating, tongue-in-cheek sci-fi adventure which is simultaneously a parable about addiction, consumerism and commercialismand the connections that bind them all together to hold us all captive. Best of all, though, are the commercial parodies, full of delightful cameos.",1423267200,,2068,4.704419889502763

738213,5,6303954278,"Something about this movie strikes a very resonating chord with me.

On the surface, the Stuff is a relatively forgettable ""schlocky"" horror movie because it's got 80's-era special effects, actors no one recognizes, and a quirky though predictable plot about parasitic, killer ice cream. Since it shows the ice cream as a sentient mass that moves on its own, it's easy to write it off as just a knock-off of ""the Blob"" with some satire of pop advertising thrown in.

The thing is, there's more going on here than just a knock at mindless consumerism, which it definitely does satirize, though limply. People get addicted to a dessert that is shamelessly mass-marketed, the same way people get addicted to alcohol and cigarettes. Not too hard to grasp. Derp.

That's not what gives this movie an eerie resonance, though. This movie is a bit too effectively scary, and takes itself a bit too seriously, for it to be just another shallow horror movie. I think the Stuff is a metaphor for the effects of creeping Marxism breaking down families and societal bonds, and turning people into *ssholes.

The ""Stuff"" is a dessert, a short-term indulgence that doesn't help you survive like food would. It's perfectly legal, gets you so addicted to it that you throw out all your food, and turns you into a zombie soldier who shares the same ideas as all the other zombies.

The cult of Atheism and Liberalism, which has its roots in Marxism, is also an indulgence that is perfectly legal, gets you so addicted to political correctness and social acceptance that you throw away all your discernment, and turns you into a zombie soldier who viciously attacks anyone who disagrees with your ideology. Religion? The new blasphemy. Nuclear families? once the backbone of civilization, now seen as ""archaic.""

I see it happening in real life, people getting addicted to and converting into these zombies who think they're such hot *beep* just because they've internalized the crap about the superiority of secular modernism that's been spoon-fed to them by the media: homosexuality is normal, women beating up men is normal, promiscuity is normal, religion is unconditionally backwards.

When I was a kid in the 80s, I was spoon-fed that America is the best country in the world. Now music and movies seem to conspire to teach kids Godless perversion and anti-Nationalism. And why shouldn't they? It's not illegal and it's just a dessert, an indulgence. And my God do youth ever eat it up. If one pays too much attention to how pop culture may be warping its audience, society's knee-jerk reaction will be to dismiss one as ""crazy.""

In the Stuff, their product brand is an easily recognizable three colors. Whenever I see those colors in the movie, I feel a flicker of fear in my gut because it's like the flag of a stealthy, marauding army that seeks to conquer not by force, but by suckering people into changing their values, all under the seemingly innocuous guise of a popular brand of dessert.

I do think something like ""the Stuff"" is happening in real life, only it's not mass addiction to a dessert but to a specific set of values that are anti-family and anti-religion. This is why I find this movie remarkable, and is why I bothered to come here and write this - I'd like to see this opinion out there.",1413072000,2,3298,4.78207381370826

The slow moving marshmallow creature is bland and when it comes out of people it is interesting but not great. The acting is fine and some bigger stars appear here and there. What is interesting is 30 years after this was made ,how close it is to predicting Americans sugar diet that has turned us into zombies. In the movie ""the stuff "" is compared to Coke in a scene ,found in a Pepsi cooler in another and linked to the candy ""woopers"" in a grocery store. It is refered to as a desert that is low fat (during the 80s snackwells replaced fat with sugar in cookies and called it healthy ),and when the main character visits a former FDA worker he says ""the stuff should be banned like alcohol prohibition ""alcohol is sugar. When the family who become stuff zombies chase a vehicle ,the driver notes they have alot of energy.
  In another odd bit of prophecy the Garret Morris character ""Chocolate Chip Charlie "" is a blatant parody of Famous Amos .In the movie Charlie has had his company stolen by his stockholders ,a few years later in real life Amos had to file bankruptcy and even lost the right to use his name.
  So next time you are out in public and you see people lining up at Starbucks or Auntie Ann's for some empty calories that have turned them into fat zombies ,remember The Stuff!",1403568000,6,1412,4.337121212121212

738287,4,6303954278,"A man stumbles across a delicious, pulsating gooey substance bubbling out of the ground at an industrial mining site, which he immediately touches, sniffs and tastes.  WHAT!?!  Now I'm no geologist, but when I encounter mysterious STD-like, sticky, gobbledy-gook discharges oozing from Mother Earth's orifices I tend to keep a safe distance.  I mean, why was it bubbling?  Was something alive under the surface?  Was it super hot?  Is it loaded with some dangerous bacteria or fungus or virus?  I doubt I'd touch itlet alone taste it!  Did this guy not see The Blob (1958, 1988)?  If he had seen The Blob I bet he'd of thought twice.

But low and behold it turns out to be a sweet, tasty treat which is readily--basically overnight--mass manufactured as a domestic dessert staple.  This film is cleverly complete with television commercials for ""The Stuff,"" marketing it as an adult snack with the tagline ""enough is never enough.""  This tongue-in-cheek propagandist approach reminds me of They Live (1988) as we observe so much social commentary on the American practices of consumerism, advertising, and corporate and FDA ethics.

Like in so many other stories, a young boy (Jason) discovers something just isn't right when he sees The Stuff crawling around in his refrigerator.  Jason won't eat The Stuff after seeing it meandering around the some Tupperwared leftovers, but his parents do and they've been acting weird.  Like buying a year's supply of The Stuff and throwing away all of their other food in the trash weird.

Luckily, an investigator (Mo) for a competing snack food company is also going around trying to figure out what The Stuff is made out of--and he's not getting answers.  It seems that all of the FDA folks who so suspiciously and swiftly approved the product have all left the country.  Hmmmmnothing strange going on here.  Just regular everyday FDA stuff, right?

A theme song plays ""one lick is never enough of The Stuff"" and Models lasciviously lick spoonfuls of this homicidal yogurt; Jason's mother testifies that she lost 5 pounds on a Stuff-only diet; and Jason's father attests that it ""kills all the bad stuff inside us"" just drink the Kool-Aid and the allegory cranks on.  The satire is so blatant that it's never obscured by the clumsy storytelling, which make the movie all the more entertaining.

The Stuff functions like The Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978).  You come into contact with it (via ingestion), and it gradually ""replaces"" you with a Stuff-replicant that's like you, but not quite right.  Once infected, the goal simply becomes to get everyone else infectedbut not by force.  When Jason refuses to eat The Stuff his parents angrily ground him, sending him to his room until he conforms.  When Jason ""fakes"" eating it, his family is pleased.

The effects include evil stop-motion marshmallow fluff and the gore and facial prosthetics are pretty good for the 80s and remain most entertaining today.  At times, The Stuff oozes around like The Blob.  But I was quite impressed with the pacing, however schizophrenically haphazard (LOL).  Much of the movie (most of the middle) was without interesting effects, yet the utterly brash satire and senselessly incohesive scene transitions of it all keep me laughing.  Characters seem to come out of nowhere without ever having been established, then they may never be seen again regardless of the rapport they may have built.  The randomness is major!  For example, a conspiracy-theory-toting general leading a resistance to The Stuff happens to own two radio stations to spread his message.  Oh, and his ""army"" takes taxi cabs when travelling in military convoys.  WTF!?!  Oh, and an infected guy just strolls past this army security by making a scene.  Oh, and a cookie industry mogul has some ancient kung fu fists of steel.  Oh, and this one Stuff-infected dog was his Stuff-infected owner's boss.  Huh?  Just bonkers!

Curiously, we never really find out where the stuff came from.  Did it well up from deep beneath the Earth's surface, did it crash land on a meteor like The Blob (1988), or did it come in a spaceship like The Thing (1982, 2011)?  We also never learn its purpose.  It's clearly smarter than the mindless consuming machine of The Blob.  But was it ""trying"" to take over the world like in The Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) or peaceful domination like in The Live (1988)?  No motive is ever revealed.

This movie (or, AHEM, it's writer/director) may have exhibited all of the smooth storytelling of an over-excited 5-year old trying to explain something he didn't really understand in the first place.  But like a child fumbling over his thoughts in a word-salad of excitement, The Stuff is not without its own special brand of charm.  This movie and its franticly forced social commentary are hilarious and it is well worth a watch.

MORE MOVIES LIKE The Stuff:  More amorphous enmities may be found in The Blob (1988), The Raft (segment from Creepshow 2; 1987) and Street Trash (1987).  The Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978), The Live (1988) and The Thing (1982, 2011) all provide stories in which trust and conspiracy are tested during surreptitious alien takeovers.

738288,3,6303954278,"A classic style Horror Movie that is very similar in form to the 1950's style of Horror movie, but with updated special effects.  The movie centers around a white substance that is discovered buried in the earth, one of the men tastes the substance and discovers that it is sweet.  The man then forms a company over time, bringing the product to market, and his new product called the Stuff is met with a frenzy from the public, the people just can't get enough of the Stuff.  So rival corporations are trying to get the secret to this product; so they hire ""Michael Moriarty"" a corporate saboteur, or corporate spy to discover the secret and bring the information back to them so that these other companies can compete with the Stuff.

738357,4,6303954278,"THE STUFF bills itself as a horror film. In the first ninety seconds of the movie, an old man stumbles across a strange, white goo bubbling up out of a snow bank. Using old man logic, he eats a dollop of it, and finding it tasty, suggests to a friend that they mine it and sell it as food. Naturally. It turns out that The Stuff is both sentient and addictive, and The Stuff spreads as one of America's favorite snack foods.

I'm tempted to say that the movie is a satire on the mindless consumerism of capitalist culture (especially as it was manifest in the mid-eighties when the movie was released). There's almost no doubt that this kind of morality was on the filmmaker's minds -- there's a lot of fun poked at commercials, and there are at least half a dozen scenes where characters discuss the evils of The Stuff with big, name brand ads (Marlboro, McDonald's, and Mobile gas stations) featured prominently in the fore- and background. Aha! People are too crazy about hoarding ""stuff"" the movie seems to be saying in a message that's about as subtle as clown shoes.

The problem is that the plotting and story are so haphazard and chaotic that the satire is lost in sheer stupidity. The movie is more senselessly frenetic than a Prodigy music video played at double the speed. I'm pretty sure that the editor must have been on an heroic amount of coke, because the pacing and cohesion of the scenes is tissue thin. Characters appear out of nowhere. Events occur rapid fire with a sporadic sense of timing. Establishing shots are nearly nonexistent.

The really weird thing is that there's very obviously the mood that this is all supposed to make sense. Our protagonist -- a business spy/saboteur named Moe (played by an actor who -- very literally -- uses the exact same facial expression to convey everything from lust, horror, anger, fear, and relief) -- makes wild, logical leaps in fractions of a second, and the audience is expected to understand intuitively his train of thought. Like a five year-old kid trying to explain the plot of a Harry Potter film, the film obviously knows in its own mind what it's going for, but its execution is not just spotty: it's blotchy. It's the narrative equivalent of a Pollock painting. There's no telling what events lead to what causes, nor the motivation behind anyone's actions. And that applies just as much to The Stuff itself. The whole film is truly baffling.

So why four stars? Because it's freaking hilarious. If I thought for a second that this level of humor was intentional, this film would get five stars from me. And even though I'm a connoisseur of the B-, C-, and D-grade of MST3K style viewing material, I still rarely find a film that's as cheesily satisfying as this one. From the very first frame, when the old man inexplicably starts lapping up the strange white bubbling goo, you know this movie has no idea what it's doing, and the very fact that thousands of dollars and man hours were spent in bringing it to your screen makes it even sweeter than the eponymous dessert treat. The fact that it sincerely THINKS it's making sense -- and in a dark and insistent way -- makes its lunacy all the more poignant, adorable, and hilarious.

If you're a hardcore horror enthusiast who brooks no substitutes, stay away. But if you have a sense of humor about the world today, and if you're looking for a goofy film to riff on with your friends, and ESPECIALLY if you're searching for a wild card film to play on a Halloween party eve with some soused compadres, you can't do much better than this misguided, eighties treatise on consumer culture and pasty-white after-dinner treats.",1382400000,30,3649,4.651162790697675

Poor Jason sees the Stuff moving by itself in the fridge one night, and concludes it is alive and therefore unsafe to eat. But his parents and older brother won't listen, and become increasingly more creepy toward him as they make gradually more threatening attempts to make Jason eat it.

In the meantime, other food company owners, being put out of business by Fletcher's wonder product, hire former FBI agent turned industrial spy David ""Mo"" Rutherford to deduce the secret ingredients of the Stuff. To this end he woos Fletcher's ad campaign lady, Nicole, and even secures a job at the company as head of security. By happenstance he also runs into, and more or less adopts, Jason after running across the boy who is being chased by his by-now borderline homicidal family.

Together, Mo, Jason and Nicole discover the horrible truth about the Stuff. It isn't made: it bubbles right out of the very Earth itself! Worse, as Jason already knew, it is alive and takes over the minds and bodies of everyone who eats it. Finding help in the form of the mentally unhinged Colonel Spears and his militia, who believe the Stuff is a Communist plot, our heroes have to stop the evil dessert from conquering the world!

The Stuff is a fun sendup of old B-movies like The Blob and Invasion of the Body Snatchers with a fun cast of characters. The special effects are a hoot, too, particularly with regard to the Stuff-possessed people. When injured or killed, they ""bleed"" Stuff, and sometimes, the sentient white glop decides it wants to leave a host, resulting in the hilariously gross sight of characters violently puking Stuff all over. A weak human villain and some really choppy editing keep it from being truly wonderful, but overall it's a cute little flick.

The DVD is well put together with an interesting and informative commentary track by director Larry Cohen.",1313280000,,2173,4.786666666666667

Unfortunately, the completely unprocessed ""Stuff"" has some sinister surprises. The Stuff is alive! It's addictive and takes over the bodies and minds of its eager eaters. The Stuff: ""Are you eating it... or is it eating YOU?"" This is the question asked by former FBI agent turned industrial saboteur David ""Mo"" Rutherford, who teams up with a young boy, a former Stuff employee, a militia-leading conspiracy theorist, and cookie mogul Chocolate Chip Charlie to take down the deadly dessert and the people selling it.

Starring Michael Moriarty as David ""Mo"" Rutherford, and featuring Andrea Marcovicci, Paul Sorvino, Garrett Morris, and Scott Bloom in supporting roles, ""The Stuff"" is a true delight of a social commentary from the sci-fi/horror/comedy genre. Great characters/performances and the goofy yet disturbing premise are the driving force, as it suffers from some awkward editing here and there. Some have called ""The Stuff"" a zombie film. I don't really see it as such. The characters become much more like those in ""Invasion of the Bodysnatchers"" than zombies. Meanwhile, the Stuff itself wreaks havoc as a blob-like entity as it travels from person to person and attempts to preserve its existence and spread.

The anamorphic widescreen DVD includes a fine commentary from writer/director Larry Cohen, the man behind the ""It's Alive"" series and the films ""Q the Winged Serprent"" and ""God Told Me To"". It also includes the theatrical trailer and a text bio on Cohen. Great purchase for those into such weird sci-fi/horror-type films that are heavy on consumerism satire.

It was definately one of my favorites.  I recently bought the dvd version.  The movie made me nostalgic for the classic B movies that were more common not that long ago.  The concept behind this movie is very good.  How it's played out is what makes it special.

The story is rather simple.  There is somthing bubbling out of the earth.  It's not oil it's some strange substance that resembles yogurt.  But this substance is odd and causes people to become addicted to it.  Although most people can't see any negative side effects.  Actually the effects are positive.  More energy and the ability to lose weight causes this products popularity to skyrocket.

I will save the story for those who haven't seen it.  There is a whole new crowd of teenagers and other B movie watchers who should love it's cheesy acting and subpar special effects.  Sometimes it doesn't take a multimilliion dollar budget to make a good film.  Sometimes all it takes is a good storyline.

738809,5,6303954278,"The Stuff (Larry Cohen, 1985)

Larry Cohen has written scripts for some of the biggest films, box-office-wise, in history. He's also written some of the biggest flops. (His first screenplay for the big screen was The Return of the Magnificent Seven; his last two were Phone Booth and Cellular. You be the judge.) However, Cohen has directed far fewer films than he's written. His directing career has also been inconsistent (witness the horror that was Wicked Stepmother), but it contains some of Hollywood's most criminally overlooked gems: The It's Alive! trilogy, Q, and The Stuff. Of those five films, The Stuff is by far the best, and has had a place on my 100 Best Films of All Time list since I started it.

The title role is played by an odd yogurt, discovered bubbling up out of the ground somewhere in Antarctica in the film's opening scene. By the time we get through the title credits, it's being marketed as The Stuff, and is truly the taste sensation sweeping the nation. A cadre of ice cream executives, terrified of their businesses going under, hires industrial espionage agent and ex-FBI man Mo Rutherford (Michael Moriarty) to find out what's in The Stuff so they can duplicate it. Rutherford runs into some problems with that (for obvious reasons), so he approaches the problem from the other side, interviewing such folks as one of the members of the FDA team who approved it (Danny Aiello in a wonderful cameo), the CEO of the publicity company that created the marketing (Andrea Marcovicci, one of the reasons Oliver Stone's film The Hand is such a fine movie), and the down-and-out previous owner of a chocolate chip cookie company bought out by the makers of The Stuff, Chocolate Chip Charlie (the wonderful Garrett Morris). Meanwhile, one kid, Jason (Scott Bloom, recently of John Q, in his first film role), knows that The Stuff is more than it seems...

The potential for a ham-handed attack on capitalism is obvious here, and it's to Cohen's great credit that the socioeconomic subtext of the movie (and think about it-- how many times have you had an opportunity to discuss socioeconomic subtext in a comedy from the eighties?) is far more complex than a knee-jerk ""capitalism is bad"" attitude. Cohen came up with some wonderfully complex characters, put them in the situation, and then let the material speak for itself, which it does in an extremely funny way. Morris is one of the most gifted comic actors of his generation, and Moriarty is quite capable of deadpanning some laughs, too (along with his future Law and Order costar Paul Sorvino, who has a small, but wonderful, part towards the end of the film). The only real letdown is the end of the film, but then, were you expecting realism in a horror film about yogurt?

Two decades after its original release, The Stuff more than stands the test of time, and is well on its way to becoming a bona fide classic. Seek it out. You won't regret it. After all, like the movie's everpresent jingle says, you can't get enough of The Stuff. **** ",1112227200,,3028,4.749049429657795

They must stop the Stuff or else the world is in danger from the tasty but deadly resistance of "" The Stuff"".

An interesting but rather exciting if goofy horror/sci-fi parody from Larry Cohen ( director of "" Q: The Winged Serpent"" and ""It's Alive!"") that has an interesting satire of commercialism consuming people and parodies 50's sci-fi/horror movies. The special effects especially on the Stuff are done by David Allen, some of the acting is kind of weak and there is cameos by Abe Vigoda and Tammy Grimes ( whom did Molly on the 1982 cult animated movie The Last Unicorn).

The DVD is a clear transfer with a few flaws on a couple of scenes, there is a couple of good extras like audio commentary by the director and a trailer of the film.

I highly recommend this movie if you like a healthy fun dose of satire and horror with Sci-fi thrown into it.

738813,3,6303954278,"""The Stuff"" is a movie I had seen many, many times as a child and when I saw it on Amazon, I had to buy it, simply for the nostalgia that would be involved.  Well, it was a smart move.  As a child, I liked this movie mainly for the visuals.  ""The Stuff"" literally comes alive and moves around, very similiar to how ""the Blob"" moves, but cooler.  Plus, the abundance of ""The Stuff"" in its packaging is really quite funny.

Watching this movie now, I realize that it actually has a decent plot and the satire on consumerism is quite cutting.  Not to mention, this movie actually has great acting.  Mike Moriaty is superb and Paul Sorvino will have you holding your belly with laughter.  Even the 10 year-old kid does a good job acting, for a B-movie.

I don't like the ending to this movie, it's just too quick, but I would definetly recommend this movie to anyone who:

A.) Loves Horror movies of ALL kinds

B.) Loves ""fun"" movies, which can't be taken seriously

or C.) Is just curious about what it is all about.

Are you buying it or is it buying you?????",1099526400,,1057,4.304568527918781
738814,3,6303954278,"As a rather unsubtle allegory of mindless consumerism The Stuff works quite well. It'd be easy to dismiss it as an 80's shlockfest but there is some brains behind it and Larry Cohen (the very man who wrote Maniac Cop, Phone Booth and Cellular) keeps the film fun until the last frame.

It's a cool story too. A weird goo oozes out of the ground in a quarry and it tastes good. So good in fact that within days it's being sold in mass, mass, incredibly mass quantities to the whole country. People are having it for breakfast, lunch, dinner, desert and supper. They feed it to their pets and put it in their coffee. Enough is not enough as the slogan goes.

Rival candy companies don't like the look of this and hire a very smooth industrial spy, David `Mo' Rutherford, to find out exactly what it is. What he finds is rather sinister indeed. And with the help of a commercial maker, a runaway kid and a gung-ho militia leader he tries to put a stop to The Stuff.

My main problem is that the origins off The Stuff and its `intentions' are never fully revealed or exploited. It ends without a satisfactory explanation which is quite a shame considering how much potential is wasted. There are stories that Larry Cohen cut 30 minutes of erm...stuff from the movie and perhaps there's more to the missing scenes. But for what it is, The Stuff, is a fun 90-minute movie that will not linger in your memory too long after seeing it.

Anchor Bay's DVD of The Stuff presents the film in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen. The picture is generally clean and dirt free but has some trouble in a few scenes. The Mono sound is adequate and tolerable but the ADR is too apparent in the early scenes and there are brief drop-outs towards the end. A commentary by Larry Cohen is also included.",1095465600,14,1774,4.449230769230769
738815,4,6303954278,"Larry Cohen did it again with THE STUFF (1985): he concocted another Horror/Social Comedy offering, this time using the theme of food as the point of entry!  A biting satire of advertising and consumerism (the best since George A. Romero's 1978 classic DAWN OF THE DEAD), THE STUFF is entertaining, gross and flat-out fun. Starring Michael Moriarty in another of his patented quirky Tab Hunter-Gone-To-Hell performances, this film is not great, but it is quite likable. After his breakout starring role in the great baseball drama BANG THE DRUM SLOWLY (1973), the Method-trained, blond-haired, blue-eyed, 6'4"" Moriarty has carved out a niche starring in ""B"" movies (usually for Larry Cohen), and he's always fun to watch!
Here he plays a Southern-drawlin' FBI agent named David 'Mo' Rutherford---""'cause no matter how much ah get, ah always want mo'"" (great line!)---who is hired by the dairy industry to find out mo' about The Stuff. You see, The Stuff was discovered by an oil-well worker who witnessed a strange meteor crash and found a pool bubbling with thick, white goo, decides to taste it, discovers that it tastes sensational, and is quickly able to market it to the general public as---what else?--The Stuff! An instant hit, outselling ice cream by five-to-one, The Stuff unfortunately has some gruesome side-effects that gradually become known to the few who do not partake of it. Let's just say that it has a similar result as those nasty space-plants in INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (1978). Mo and a ten-year-old boy named Jason (who is the only one in his family not to have eaten The Stuff) begin to get to the bottom of things, aided by a most unlikely pair: A black cookie entrepeneaur nicknamed Chocolate Chip Charlie (the hilarious ""SNL"" alum Garrett Morris) and a racist militia leader named Col. Malcolm Grommett Spears (an even-more hilarious Paul Sorvino). Add to the mix veteran actors Danny Aiello and Patrick O'Neal, and you have a recipe that calls for you to just sit back and have fun! THE STUFF may not be for everybody (certainly not for anyone under 13), and it's not to everyone's taste (or lack thereof), but if you like ""B"" films---especially those by schlock-meister Larry Cohen---then give THE STUFF a try. Don't say I didn't warn you!

738816,5,6303954278,"The stuff is an alien substance of sorts, found bubbling out of the ground in small towns across the United States. It looks like ice-cream, tastes great, but ... once it takes hold of you, it becomes addictive and deadly. But what is its secret ingredient?
Enter Michael Moriarty ('Troll', 'Courage Under Fire'), who is hired as an industrial saboteur by representatives of a food company to discover just what makes the stuff so addictive. As the stuff becomes more readily available, the people selling it are no longer content to merchandise through the smaller outlets. They begin to advertise it nationwide.
David 'Mo' Rutherford (Moriarty) tracks the stuff across the country with the help of Nicole (Andrea Marcovicci) and a young boy, Jason (Scott Bloom), witnessing its effects on the population. During their efforts, they are assisted by Col. Malcolm Grommett Spears (Paul Sorvino) and the wacky cookie entrepreneur, Chocolate Chip Charlie (Garrett Morris, 'Saturday Night Live'). As the film progresses, it becomes impossible to know just who to trust, and resisting the stuff becomes increasingly difficult.
Larry Cohen has become a hero to those whose interests are in cult horror/sci-fi films, having turned out classics like 'A Return to Salem's Lot', 'The Ambulance', and 'Q: The Winged Serpent'. This is his fourth collaboration with Moriarty and it is well worth the money. 'The Stuff' contains comedy, action, science fiction, and horror - a combination of 'The Blob' and 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers', with Cohen's crazy sense of humor thrown in for good measure.
Also stars Brian Bloom, Danny Aiello, and Patrick O'Neal.
Bonus features on this edition include an informative audio commentary with director, Larry Cohen, TV Spots, original theatrical trailer, and widescreen presentation.

738894,4,6303954278,"One thing can always be said about the movies from writer/director Larry Cohen: They are both quirky and entertaining.  And his 1985 flick THE STUFF is no exception.  As with most of Cohen's work, THE STUFF is not meant to be taken seriously.  Though it is a sci-fi/horror film, it's not all that scary.  The superficial science-fiction and horror elements really only serve as a skeleton on which Cohen can grow a body of irony; the true muscle and flesh of THE STUFF is satire.  Cohen's ""plot"" is intentionally campy and absurd, churning out blatantly wry comments on the obsessive consumerism and capitalistic opportunism prevalent in Western Culture.
The story: A new dessert has captured the attention, as well as the pocketbooks, of the American consumer--The Stuff.  The Stuff tastes great, is low in calories, and is apparently chock-full of all the nutrients the human body needs.  Indeed, some folks have started eating it exclusively, much to the chagrin of the manufacturers of other desserts and food products.  So the disgruntled competitors deploy their secret weapon: David ""Mo"" Rutherford (Michael Moriarty), an industrial spy and saboteur with a reputation for getting results.  With the aid of Advertising Exec Nicole (Andrea Marcovicci) and cookie mogul ""Chocolate Chip Charlie"" Hobbs (Garrett Morris), Rutherford sets out to steal the secret ingredients of The Stuff.  But when he and his cohorts learn that there is something at work more devious than just aggressive marketing tactics, Rutherford and crew take on a more noble pursuit as they work to destroy the addictive hold The Stuff has on the public and expose the product's evil, self-serving manufacturers and distributors.
The wonderful cast deserves a lot of credit for helping Cohen to realize the raw, biting satire of his script.  Michael Moriarty gives a hilarious performance as smarmy but good-hearted industrial saboteur ""Mo"" Rutherford.  His earnest but glib delivery of often absurd lines helps the audience to accept the character at face value.  And Andrea Marcovicci does an affecting job as the Ad Exec who wants to help right the wrongs to which she's contributed.  But best of all is the performance of SNL alum Garrett Morris.  He is delightfully over-the-top as cookie mogul Chocolate Chip Charlie (an obvious send-up of real-life 1980s cookie peddler Famous Amos), a dethroned dessert king bent on revenge.
True, THE STUFF is not likely to go down in the annals of great speculative science fiction or classic chilling horror.  It's too outrageously camp.  But as satire or social parody, it's top-notch cinema.  Cohen's tongue-in-cheek screenplay mercilessly hammers away at real-life problems like corporate expediency, cut-throat commercial competitiveness, less-than-honest product marketing and advertising, questionable health and nutritional information...and just about every other unethical practice associated with Western economics and consumerism.  Though Cohen's basic premise is a bit off the wall, and though some of the film's special FX are a bit cheesy, the film works because it is peopled with three-dimensional characters that react plausibly to the outrageous situations in which they are placed.  That, and it's just so damn funny.
The DVD, from those wonderful folks at Anchor Bay, offers a great-looking anamorphic widescreen digital transfer of the film, along with the requisite theatrical trailer.  In addition, there is also a very informative and entertaining feature commentary with writer/director Larry Cohen himself!  A disc that is well worth the reasonable price.",1075075200,3,3600,5.391071428571428
738895,5,6303954278,"This is one of those movies I saw a million times as a kid.  When I was 10 or so and I'd wake up at 2 or 3 a.m. for some reason, turn on the tv-HBO mind you-and I'd usually catch this.  Now I'm crusty and old(I turned 26 today), and I still love this movie.  I was in it for the gruesomeness as a kid, but now I get the humor and overall message of the film.  This was the first Larry Cohen movie I saw, and it made me a fan for life.  An underappreciated director if I ever saw one.  Most film snobs have and will always think of him as a hack exploitation director-which he is, but a very good one.  As you all know, the ""stuff"" is a alien parasite -type substance that becomes the newest taste sensation.  People get hooked on it and become slaves to it.  It leaves their body and returns at will.  It makes people crazy and homicidal.  It oozes from them when they're shot.  Moe Rutherford(who hates sweaty palms) gets down to the nitty gritty and exposes the whole corperate conspiracy.  Considering this is a low budget film from 1985, the stop motion effects look pretty darn cool.  Cohen did very well with his limited budget.  Did this play in the theaters?  I'm sure it did somewhere.  I'd suggest renting if you haven't seen it, coz it may not be your cup of tea.  If you have and like it, you can't go wrong for the price.  Anchor Bay did a good job(as usual) with this one.  It isn't loaded with extras, but the film looks good and you can listen to Larry Cohen on the commentary!  Good stuff.",1073520000,,1506,4.141868512110727
738896,3,6303954278,"I have never enjoyed watching Michael Moriarty in either television programs or films. There is something about the guy, like fingernails on a chalkboard or a dripping faucet, which annoys me whenever his mug appears on my television screen. Regrettably, and for some completely unexplainable reason, I have seen him way too often recently. You cannot avoid running across him on television due to the saturation of a certain courtroom drama program, so I don't necessarily place the blame there because I simply refuse to watch that show. Still, even that split second glimpse before my finger slams down on the remote control is enough to send me into a dither. No, I need to police my movie viewing habits a little more carefully in the future if I wish to avoid sustained Moriarty encounters. The problem comes when I want to watch a Larry Cohen film. It seems like this director/producer/writer cast this actor in nearly every schlock film he made from the 1970s on. ""The Stuff"" is primary evidence in my effort to prove a Cohen/Moriarty conspiracy. And wouldn't you know it? Moriarty is at his most grating in this occasionally interesting social critique of rampant 1980s consumerism.
""The Stuff"" is about, well, a new food sensation called ""The Stuff."" We learn at the beginning of the film that the stuff is actually something bubbling up from the ground and that it tastes deliciously sweet because some old duffer decides to sample the white paste after he touches it (note to self: never, NEVER decide to taste something bubbling out of the ground). Since it is the evil 1980s, a time when corporate greed finally came into its own, in no time at all some company decides to sell this gunk as a low fat, low calorie confection. You would think the FDA or some other government agency working tirelessly to protect consumers would throw up major roadblocks to such a shameless attempt to garner a buck. Not in Larry Cohen's universe, where corporations are distant relations to fallen angels and the rest of us are gullible sheep along for the ride. We find out that the FDA did perform a battery of rigorous tests on the stuff but something happened during the process that resulted in either strange disappearances or cowed testers who refuse to speak out about what they found in the laboratory. With those pesky government agencies out of the way, the people behind the stuff pull in money hand over fist. The competition, made up of companies making such boring products as ice cream and candy, decide enough is enough and hire an industrial spy so they can get the formula.
Enter Michael Moriarty as David 'Mo' Rutherford (the 'mo' means 'more money'), a greedy former government agent who now makes his living stealing corporate secrets for the highest bidder. Moriarty assumes a languorous southern drawl for his character, an accent so annoying I actually felt parts of my brain liquefy every time he opened his mouth. Rutherford begins his investigation immediately, quickly discovering that something isn't quite right about the stuff. People cannot seem to get enough of this new treat, leading our hero to surmise that the company producing this white sweet is putting an addictive substance in it. After teaming up with up a disgruntled marketing executive, a cookie maker known as Chocolate Chip Charlie (Garrett Morris), a precocious kid who escaped his addicted family, and a far right militia type named Colonel Malcolm Grommett Spears, Rutherford is ready to do battle with the forces of darkness (or whiteness). The team discovers that the stuff comes out of the ground and that it possesses properties decidedly harmful to the human race as a whole. The company selling the stuff as a food product could care less about the potential dangers to people as long as they make a profit. At least the concluding scenes of the film, where the stuff executives get their ""just desserts,"" so to speak, is moderately entertaining. Regrettably, ""The Stuff"" as a film collapses under a host of problems.
It has been at least a week since I have seen such a poorly edited film. The beginning and middle parts of the movie aren't all that bad, but by the time we get to the end the whole thing looks like Cohen slapped it together in an effort to get the film ready for a distribution deadline. Even a Herschell Gordon Lewis film has better editing than ""The Stuff,"" and that is saying a lot. I have already gone into the problems with Moriarty's performance here, a problem that could have been offset had the other characters in the movie proved even remotely interesting. The terrorized kid is annoying, Chocolate Chip Charlie is amusing but only appears briefly in the beginning and towards the end, and Colonel Spears (played over the top by Paul Sorvino) plays on every wacko stereotype imaginable. Moreover, the romance springing up between Rutherford and Nicole, the disillusioned advertising executive, is unrealistic.
Happily, ""The Stuff"" does succeed on several levels. The special effects showing the stuff on a rampage and what it does to those who eat it on a regular basis looks good. The social critique works well, especially the slick advertising spots and the cheesy yet catchy jingles used to sell the product. Viewers well versed in 1980's pop culture should get a chuckle or two out of the cameo by Clara Peller, the lady who did the ""Where's the beef?"" ads for a widely recognizable hamburger chain back in the days of Reagan. Finally, the DVD release contains a Cohen commentary, trailers, and a widescreen picture transfer. ""The Stuff"" has plenty of flaws, but still manages to occasionally entertain.",1072051200,,5645,4.887382690302398

'we do have to keep the world safe for ice cream, i guess,'
has to be good.
but what's really moving about this film is a typical feature of 80's horror: a commentary on consumerism and capitalism as the 'real killer' of the film.  'the stuff' is really a clear warning to audiences: don't blindly trust our government.  don't blindly trust capitalism.  don't blindly trust the media.
'the stuff' tells us that we shouldn't buy everything we see on tv because the picture pefect surface we see is often covering something darker and more deadly; as could be said of the society that produces and markets these superficial ads/items.
 thanks to the 80's we now have a wealth of silly/serious films teaching valuable lessons about the media.... don't get me wrong - the humor in 80's horror is worthy of our attention; we should stop talking trash about 80's horror and start listening to what they're trying to teach us....",1007424000,3,1024,4.661111111111111

The DVD has the added value of comments by the director Larry Cohen which include great stories about making the film.

I almost had a heart attack when I saw it was available on DVD.  The film is great - accept its many flaws and hammy dialogue - because it's worth checking out for its pure brashness and unflinching consumer pops.
For all of you out there who want to know how it translates to DVD - let me explain.  The print is of very good quality and sound.  Everything is fine in those departments.  There's only one criticism I have about the DVD transfer - it brings out the special effects and spoils them.  There are numerous moments throughout the film where it blatantly uses blue screen and those shots are very noticeable and apparent.  They're not so bad in the video version.  Apart from that, everything's great.  The menu screen is excellent and inspiring; a splat of the white goo slurps and bubbles over the menu screen to the music from the film.  But what I really fell in love with was the director's commentary from Cohen.  He rarely stops speaking and goes into minute attention to every detail as it happens.  What a great guy.

First of all, there's a real cheeseball story, which if they stuck to it most of the time this would be better.  The opening is funny, you see this dude in the artic just waltzin' around when all of a sudden he comes across this white stuff comin' out of the ground.  He promptly dips his finger in it and eats some of it.  (Yeah, the first thing you do when you see a random substance in the ground is you HAVE TO TASTE IT.)  So these dudes start marketing the white junk now named ""The Stuff"".  Then we see a boy looking for a midnight snack when he sees the stuff dancin' around.  The boy freaks and tries to tell everyone, and obviously they don't believe him at first.  Pretty soon, the stuff starts selling better than any other dessert so the candy companies hire some guy named Mo.  (""They call me that cause whenever you give me money, I always want Mo."")  On the trail of the secret behind the stuff Mo meets Choclate Chip Charlie, the best character in the movie who unfortunately we don't see enough of.  Choclate Chip charlie has fists of death and can mutilate people by slapping and punching them (a la Story of Ricky style, which is an awsome movie that you should go buy now).  Eventually the two heroes find that the stuff turns people into mindless zombies who only crave more of the stuff and are evil.  So the two kick some zombie ... and decide to split up and investigate (and we don't see Charlie until the end).  Then the movie gets kinda boring for a while.  So at the end they get rid of the stuff epidemic by warning people about what it does and poor charlie gets killed by the stuff at the end.  Some very funny scenes in the movie.
