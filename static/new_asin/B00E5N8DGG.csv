5891414,5,B00E5N8DGG,"I attended all 11 VIVA! Hysteria shows in Las Vegas, as well as the 2 premiere showings of the movie. The movie premiere included a recording of the acoustic set that the band performed for the Meet and Greet VIP guests exclusively, which is on the DVD. I can assure anyone who didn't get to see the Vegas shows or the movie premiere that, if you like, or love, Def Leppard, you will like, or love, the DVD. One reason I made the decision to attend all 11 of the Vegas shows is that Def Leppard is just super-fantastic live. They put on a great show, successfully delivering their studio recorded hits to the live concert without anything lost. From Joe expertly drawing the crowd into the experience, to Sav, Phil, Viv, and Rick delivering consummate instrumental/backing vocal performances, they do not disappoint. They really do sound as good or better live than recorded and stay true to the music. That said, the recording of the VIVA! Hysteria shows is very well done and presented, and I feel is superb enough to excite, even the modest to definitely, the die-hard fan! Included on the DVD is a Ded Flatbird set, where Def Leppard performed some of their other-than-Hysteria-hits, posing incognito as a Def Leppard cover band. I am having a very hard time, indeed, awaiting my copy to arrive from Amazon....",1382313600,4,1314,4.692640692640692
5891415,5,B00E5N8DGG,"I know the official release date hasn't arrived yet, but I pre-ordered this Blu-ray from another online company and it came in today, Friday, October 18th.  First of all, it starts with interviews of the band members with pictures of the group from the beginning until now leading up to the start of the Viva Hysteria show.  Then, WOW..... The sound is totally INCREDIBLE.  Amazing video board behind the band as they play and this band has never sounded better. The drums will actually rattle the windows in your home.  Joe's voice is the best I've heard him sound in years. So anyone that was afraid that the show wouldn't transfer from live to video with great intensity, you can lay your fears to rest!!!!! I didn't see the show live but this Blu-ray is the first live show I've seen that can compete with the Led Zeppelin Blu-ray Celebration Day!!!!! I haven't watched the ""Ded Flatbird"" shows yet, but I can't wait to see the guys perform live stuff from the first album, ""On Through The Night"". For any fan of great ROCK MUSIC, this is a MUST HAVE for your collection!!!! Thank you for your time.",1382054400,25,1103,4.555555555555555

THIS SHOW WAS AMAZING, WATCHING DEF LEPPARD PERFORM HYSTERIA IN IT'S ENTIRETY WAS A DREAM COME TRUE!!! THE ONLY SONG MISSING FROM THE ENCORES WAS FOOLIN', DISAPPOINTING...
WATCHING DED FLATTBIRD PLAY EARLY CLASSICS WAS GREAT, TOO BAD THEY BROKE UP!!!",1380931200,8,390,4.924242424242424
5891418,5,B00E5N8DGG,"I attended 5 of these  shows at Hard Rock & out of the hundreds of concerts I have seen, these were by far the best. Joe's voice was well rested and perfect! The setlist was different each night, which included songs from Def Leppards early career. For me, the Ded Flatbird set was the absolute best!  I'm so excited to relive this wonderful concert experience! If you missed Viva Hysteria in person, you will absolutely love this!",1380240000,11,431,4.584415584415584
5891419,5,B00E5N8DGG,"I was present for two of the live shows that became a part of this film.  The show is broken into two sets.  The first part contains the entire 12-track Hysteria album played in original track order.  The second part is a set of fan favorites and rarely played songs.  In person, the quality of the show was beyond compare.  If the blu-ray captures half the energy of the actual event it will be more than worth the money.  This was an amazing event.  Definitely collection worthy!",1379635200,11,481,4.459770114942529

This DVD brought back such great memories of that concert ohhh so many years ago!",1486512000,,256,4.204081632653061
5891425,4,B00E5N8DGG,"(Husband on Amazon account) I really enjoyed this blue ray. I collect music blue rays and this isn't the best of my collection but really good if you like the arena rock era and of course Def Leppard. Since it is recent, they do play a bunch of filler you need to skip over but there is a good 3-4 classics in a row x 2 that really sound great even though they're past their prime. Unfortunately, lead singer Joe Elliot runs out of steam and it's not the best rendition of closing song Photograph. The only major classic not here is Bringing on the Heartbreak. Phil Collen's lead guitar really sounds awesome on this. Can't go wrong if you're a fan and it's under $20. Not something I throw on with friends and family though.",1485993600,,725,4.338235294117647

5891427,3,B00E5N8DGG,"Oh boy is it a shock to see this after In the Round in Your Face when Def Leppard were late 20's top of the tree and all of them were gorgeous!.  Back in those days I was that age too and so was I!.  How the years have changed us all.  I am not famous however.  This is a very good DVD in terms of it being the whole of Hysteria performed live on stage in Las Vegas in 2012.  However I must also be frank and say that though the performance is good frankly I think its time they accepted they are now in their late 50's and stopped trying to be 20 again.  It doesn't work.  Joe Elliott sounds strained on some of the big hits from Hysteria and struggles now at times to hit the screaming notes of his 20's.  Not knocking the guy, it happens to everyone.  Phil Collen is a great guitarist and also in great physical shape but he's still in his late 50's and somehow just now looks rather silly stripped to the waist on stage. Almost pathetic and sad.  Keep it under wraps Phil.  Viv Campbell is the redeeming feature, he hasn't changed at all since he joined the band and he looks and sounds the business both then and now.  The two Ricks are both as I would expect to see them and their performance is solid and professional.  A great band and I've loved them for years but now I feel its time to gently start to wind down and thanks for the 30 plus years you've given us.  As a fan  if your wanting to relive the young happy days get in the Round in your Face and pretend that its the 80's again.  If however you're prepared to accept that time has moved on for us all and its no exception with Def Leppard its worth buying this if only to console yourself that your not the only one who has wrinkles now and in the case of both me and Joe Elliott, a few more pounds as well.",1483228800,,1776,4.002840909090909

5891432,5,B00E5N8DGG,"I predicted Def Leppard would be back after seeing how much they enjoyed themselves on the Taylor Swift Crossroads collaboration and I'm beyond thrilled I was right. I've seen all their other concert DVDs, which for me were all huge disappointments.  The band has never been better and the audio & video are superb.

Def Leppard never disappoints and this is no exception.  Highly recommend!!!  Do yourself a favor and add this to your collection.  Hard rockin, riffs by Campbell and Collen are spot on!!

5891451,5,B00E5N8DGG,Def Leppard is definitely High-Energy. I have Def Leppard 'The Definitive Collection' on CD. But unfortunately I was not able to see them live in concert: however this Blu-Ray is the next best thing.,1431820800,,199,4.882352941176471
5891452,5,B00E5N8DGG,"The title says it all! I've been a fan of Def Leppard since '83 and have seen them live in concert 5 times.  Although, none of them were when the late Steve Clark was with them. I also had most of their albums on cd, from ""On Through The Night"" through ""X"". I also have the DVD of ""Historia/In The Round, In Your Face"".  I love everything about this DVD, from the opening part, where they show things like interviews with the band as well as scenes from the ""Visualize/Retroactive"" DVD, to the main concert, itself, especially the song ""Gods Of War"" where Rick Savage, A.K.A. ""Sav"" does that killer bass solo. I also enjoy the bonus features, especially the 2 Ded Flatbird set-lists as well as the acoustic set. So, I recommend this concert DVD to anyone who's a fan of Def Leppard, heavy metal, in general, or would love to see a great concert DVD because, believe me, it is WONDERFUL!!!",1430179200,,888,4.441717791411043

5891466,4,B00E5N8DGG,"3 and a half stars for the Blu-ray. I enjoyed the concert and getting re-acquainted with a band I hadn't followed much since the 80's. My only complaint is with the audio. On my system, the main concert had poor sound, with the low end being particularly muffled and muddy. I actually found the ""bonus"" Ded Flatbird  sets (also in DTS HD MA 5.1) to be not only more interesting, but sounding better too; overall, they were less dynamic and made less use of surround, but at least they fixed the sloppy bass of the main feature.",1420934400,,527,4.43298969072165

This is the kind of concert that blows people away and makes a fan of anyone who sees it.  Every song is a great performance, they are truely gifted to play every song with consistency, quality, and accuracy.  I especially liked: Women, Poor Some Sugar On Me, Love and Affection, and Rock of Ages.  Great fun.  I first bought the dvd, and then upgraded to blu ray.  The blu ray is a huge leap in visual and audio - you won't be disappointed.",1399248000,,573,4.299065420560748

5891511,5,B00E5N8DGG,"Before Def Leppard became a pop metal sensation, they were a superb melodic heavy metal band, in the group of bands known at the time as the ""2nd wave of British metal."" In a novel demonstration of ""thinking outside of the box,"" Def Leppard opened the Las Vegas shows as an alter-ego version of themselves, playing their early career material, including most of the High N Dry album, as well as other high-energy tracks. They played different sets different nights, and two are included on the DVD in their entirety as bonus features (with no repeated songs!).

This footage is, in a word, FANTASTIC. And the audio quality is kick *ss stellar. I HIGHLY recommend this for pre-Pyromania fans. This is a performance I've always dreamed of seeing. It reminds me of exactly why as an early fan I was so excited about the band.

By including this early material, the band has really covered their entire fan base.  What a wonderful idea!

These are the songs included in the bonus material:

Good Morning Freedom
Wasted
Stagefright
Mirror Mirror (Look Into My Eyes)
Action (Sweet cover)
Rock Brigade
Undefeated
Promises
On Through The Night
Slang
Let It Go
Another Hit And Run

5891512,5,B00E5N8DGG,"Great bluray!! I saw this on azis tv & was blown away, I bought the Bluray to add to my concert collection.  The band sounds better than ever.. Joe's vocals are right on! Its amazing watching him sing & changing the tone/texture of his voice as he progresses thru the song! truly a great performance - highly reccomend!",1394064000,,319,4.5
5891513,4,B00E5N8DGG,"So I pre-ordered this Blu-Ray after seeing it become available online. I went to one of the last shows during the residency at The Joint. The main reason I purchased this product was because the group performed different songs every night and since I only went 1 night I wanted to see as much of the performance as possible while having a great seat in the comfort of my living room.

I know of a couple songs that were played via the band's Facebook set-list posts that never made it on the Blu-ray. I know for a fact that ""Rock Rock ('Til You Drop)"" was played, yet it is not present on the disc. Also, on a little better note, a nice touch was a small acoustic session that has been added as a special feature that plays a few favorites. I'm not going to list the songs as I feel that if you are thinking about purchasing this disc than you will love all the songs played.

The audio is a live feed into the mixing board, you will not hear much of the crowd in the background so the sound is straight from the equipment. I rate the audio at around 3.8, as it made me feel that the audio was a kind of overlay instead of getting that true live feel.

I really like this disc, but the audio held me from giving the disc a 5 out of 5. I watch on a regular basis and sometimes play the show in the background while cleaning around the house. Overall though, this is probably the best way to have seen the show next to actually being there. You get to see way more than was played during 1 show. I believe that any Def Leppard fan will want to add this to their collection.",1394064000,5,1571,4.1107491856677525
5891514,5,B00E5N8DGG,Live concert by Rock and Roll immortals Def Leppard from sin city--Las Vegas. The entire Hysteria album is played before adoring and screaming fans.

5891518,5,B00E5N8DGG,"In my opinion, the best thing the band has released.

They are their own opening act as "" Ded Flatbird"", playing great covers and very old Def Leppard songs,
the songs that made us fall in love w/ the band in the late 70's/ early '80's.

Then they put on an amazing set of all their classic hits.

The whole band sounds spot- on, the guitars sound gorgeous, and Joe Elloitt's voice is in terrific form
and he nails every note, especially in ""Stagefright"".

My fave member is bassist Rick Savage, and he's still as hot as ever.
I named my cat after him, too ! ( Savvy )

This is a fabulous concert DVD, buy it and rock your face off !",1391472000,2,633,4.1138211382113825
5891519,4,B00E5N8DGG,"Concert doesn't quite capture the energy of the band in their hey-day... of course, I can't head-bang like I used to either.  Still gets a thumbs up from me.",1391385600,,157,4.413793103448276
5891520,5,B00E5N8DGG,"Please let me frist address one complaint from a lot of reviews here - the claim of bad sound quality.

I have a decent 1200-or-so watt home theater and I can say the sound was just excellent.  Yes, it is more bottom heavy than you may be used to from In The Round, In Your Face, but that's what the kiddies like these days.  Even so, to my ""every day guy who just likes good sound, not some sound studio Ph. D"" ears, the bass and drums are not TOO pumped up.  As a matter of fact, the strong bassline sounds pretty good.

I will agree, however, that Vivian's guitar sounds a bit too quiet in a few places.  Most of the time, though, it's just fine, so can't this really just be a little variation you'd expect in a live performance?

You may point the finger at the person who mixed this post-show, but really a little variation for a concert video is absolutely trivial, folks.  A real concert is not perfect.

On to the material - it was interesting to do the Hysteria album start to finish, because I've never heard several of the album tracks live before.  Also, the two opening shows (done under the name Ded Flatbird) featuring other material, before and after Hysteria, are excellent and Joe made me laugh out loud with the statement that ""we are the best Def Leppard cover band in the world.""  The band is in great form, too.  The playing is perfect - you know talent that's been around a while when you see it.  Yes, Joe's voice has lost some range, but so has every other vocalist that's now in their 50's or, for example Stevie Nicks, even older.  Like her he does a great job adapting, and does get in a few good higher parts.

I'd say don't be swayed by the reviewers with $20,000 recording studio speakers and 100 years of experience testing audio nuances while squating in the middle of an 80 piece orchestra.  This is an outstanding concert video, and a nice comapanion, not replacement, for In the Round, In Your Face.  It shows these guys can still rock and still enjoy it.

Oh, one last thing, FANTASTIC camera work.  I'm so glad this is free of the spastic split-second edits that have become popular, while still giving a feeling of motion and changing perspective.  Great job.",1391040000,3,2199,4.409429280397022
5891521,5,B00E5N8DGG,"I chose this rating because it's the greatest rock concert ever. Def leppard  performed at the hard rock hotel in las vegas nevada at the hard rock hotel in 2013. I want to say the songs they played were women, rocket,animal, love bites, pour some sugar on me, Armageddon it, gods of war, don't shoot shotgun, run riot, hysteria, excitable, love and affection, and etc. I want to say I give it a 5 to 10 star review with a 100% rating. I want the amazon.com customers to buy this item because it's worth the hard earned money that people work hard for. I want the amazon.com customers to buy it directly off amazon.com the directly because it's wrapped up one hundred percent and its brand new from the company buyer. When you buy off amazon it will say 100% rating. When you buy from a third party seller the rating could be 99% rating, 98% rating, and etc. I forgot to tell the amazon.com customers when you buy used from amazon its okay because you get everything but when you buy from another seller please check the packaging to make sure the disc and booklet is in there. Sometimes it might not be in there. When you buy a collectible just follow the same steps. The amazon.com customers can buy from their own personal preference.

So if this is true..the video is great. No complaints. The audio was a little bass heavy and geared in on Joe. It could have been mixed better, true. For the 'average' listener it's fine. For audiophile it's not going to be too good. For me it's okay. As far as the bands vocals..it's like any other near 30 yr old band. Their voices are not going to sound like Sheffield back in the day. Joe is not a spring chicken anymore and his voice is not like it used to be ! The band plays well of course but no they are not in their prime anymore. As far a Vegas crowd goes..I was not at any of the concerts live and you can't go by the video editing etc. I think most there probably enjoyed it though. Based on what I saw here, I would have but just don't expect a young 80's band sound or look. Get their older DVDs for that. That is all.",1388275200,3,1007,3.8932038834951457

The show was very slick and polished and brought back memories of teenage years listening to Hysteria.  Also the preshow / opening act also Def Leppard was great.

I must say that Joe sings those older songs (and the new ones) pretty well, and Vivian is a great addition to the band, albeit due to the unfortunate death of Steve Steamin' Clark.  These guys can still rock.  This BR has excellent video and sound quality.  If you like the older Def Leppard on top of the newer (post Pyromania) stuff, definitely pick this up.

The band plays homage to late guitarist Steve Clark, and prove some things just keep getting better with age. Anyone who remotely likes this band will enjoy this. Five stars!!!",1385596800,5,547,4.48

5891558,3,B00E5N8DGG,"Well, I can understand that many people liked it, it's a love or hate concert imho. Personally I didn't enjoy it much, Joe can't hit those high notes any longer and the way he tries to do it now using silly falsetto - sounds and looks weird. DTS-HD for 5.1 isn't great also - guitars could have been louder, especially Vivian's.
All in all - it's like watching some silly hollywood comedy, for example ""Last Vegas"" - good old actors and not their best perfomances, it gets more boring every 5 minutes. Oh, yes - there is an audience in concert, but it will take 30 minutes to notice it.",1385164800,3,586,4.336363636363636
5891559,5,B00E5N8DGG,"Hysteria was a great album and seeing the entire album played live in its entirety is nice.  I also like the fact that they play

5891561,4,B00E5N8DGG,"Very high quality and good editing. It's good to listen to tracks the guys from Sheffield didn't play live since 30 or something years. Joe's voice changed a lot during these  years so songs like ""Stagefright"" or ""Run Riot"" sounded forced in its vocals.
The whole Side 1 of ""High 'n' Dry"", and ""Rock Brigade"" are the highlights of this Blu-Ray.
A must have for us Def Leppard fans competing directly with ""In The Round In Your Face"".",1385164800,,433,4.551282051282051

I love that they added all kinds of bonus features to the DVD that you didn't see on the movie screen.

Thanks so much.",1385078400,,264,3.5172413793103448
5891565,1,B00E5N8DGG,"Big disappointment. Long gone is the voice of Joe Elliot and there is way to much effects / chorus to hide it. Poor editing makes it look and sound like a Britney tv appearance with Ellen Degeneres due to what would appear as lip sinching. There is no ambience in this concert, none at all. This is what happens when you play in Vegas! mostly tourists that well could be just passer by's, not real fans. It is one of the most boring audiences I have ever seen in a concert. I honestly do not recommend it.",1384992000,5,505,4.216494845360825
5891566,5,B00E5N8DGG,"Probably the top 3 best Live concert sets I have ever seen!  This concert blew me away!  Especially when they act as an opening act for Def Leppard, they play jams that they normally don't EVER play!  WOW!  It also helps when you have 1000 watts of Blu-Ray surround sound and a Aquos TV...  They sound is freakin awesome!  And Joe's voice sounds pretty awesome..  A must buy!!!",1384992000,,377,4.455882352941177
5891567,5,B00E5N8DGG,Excellent audio production great video production represents the album extremely well. As a musician I appreciate this studio album and the impact that it had on popular music. Having never had the chance to see the band live this video was welcomed. I was very close to just popping in the car and driving from Indiana time Nevada to see this but it just wasn't in the cards for me. Was very happy to see that they put it to DVD. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did. All the hits are there of course. They perform the home front to back. But some of the highlights for me or some of the lesser-known twos like excitable. Life performance combined with the stage production is simply awesome.,1384992000,,691,4.364341085271318
5891568,5,B00E5N8DGG,GREAT band and an amazing show in Las Vegas!! A must see!!! Def Leppard are still the best around. Don't miss this one!,1384560000,4,119,4.217391304347826
5891569,5,B00E5N8DGG,"My wife and I were lucky enough to attend Def Lep's residency in Las Vegas and were even luckier to draw the date they were filming this DVD by chance. An awesome performance excellently captured in this DVD. We are both longtime fans and were thrilled by the concert. Lep shows why they have stood the test of time and why their music is still relevant today with this show, and best of all their live sound is expertly close to the album (a sign of true musicians). A big plus is that I spotted us not once, but TWICE in the crowd footage - doesn't get any cooler than that. If you are a fan, you will not be disappointed.",1384387200,11,624,4.1652892561983474

5891571,1,B00E5N8DGG,"I don't know what the rest of these 5 star reviews are listening to and watching. But my Blu-Ray BLOWS in most every respect. These guys look old and tired. The playing is off key, sloppy and just lacks any kind of enthusiasm. Elliot's voice is gone. And seriously. You're in you 60's now. Leave your shirts on. But what absolutely ruined this thing to no end is the audio quality. Absolutely over blown to the nth degree low end thump. Really. Could NOT tone down the low end on my system enough to make it even remotely bearable. If you have a good system and are expecting decent sound you won't find it here. This has to be amongst the worst audio production that I have heard in fairly large and growing concert Blu Ray collection. Didn't even make it through one listen. It's just not worth it.",1384214400,5,800,4.375838926174497
5891572,4,B00E5N8DGG,"Well 3.5 out of 5 I would give this blu-ray.  The show is great, the set list is awesome but finding the songs outside of Hysteria is a bit of a pain.  If you are looking for tracks 15+, you have to go into the extras and look for the Ded Flatbird night 1 and 2, it's a little odd how they did that.

So for the show this gets a 5/5 but the audio it gets a 2/5.  The Audio shows up as HD Master Audio sounds awful.  I had to turn my sub off so I could stand listening.  When you switch to the other sound option it's on standard stereo sound.  They could have done a much better job with the audio.  Like come on, it's a bluray disc!!!

Overall, this is a great show.  The crowd is a little lifeless at times and Joe's voice isn't always that good but this is freaking Def Leppard!  Gotta love it.",1383955200,3,797,3.8580246913580245

5891574,5,B00E5N8DGG,"An absolute blast to watch, the best Def Leppard on film you will find. Watched it on big screen with good sound and a group of friends and it was the closest you'll come to seeing a kick ass Def Leppard concert without being there. The live Hysteria song were amazingly close to the original but honestly better in some ways. I can't quite put my finger on it, but I think I like this version of the song better.",1383782400,3,413,4.175
5891575,1,B00E5N8DGG,"I was so looking forward to this Blu-Ray. The audio sync is terrible, the band looks tired, the songs and crowd are lifeless and it just boggles the mind how a band who has sold as many records as they have and has as many hits as they do can't seem to stimulate an audience or command stadiums. They play with 2 other bands when they tour and they get sucked into horrible concepts like the Vegas residency which did them no favors. Def Leppard should have hired a new manager 15 years ago. I have been a fan of Def Leppard since 1983...this thing is junk.",1383350400,4,557,4.214953271028038

5891577,5,B00E5N8DGG,"This is doing it right!!  release the film of a show , with loads of bonus content so that your blu ray is jammed with goodies to entertain for hours!!

I was at first upset to see the list of 14 songs until I opened the bonus features of the Ded Flatbird shows and acoustic set....

I think the group sounds great, looks great , and everything from the stage set to the camera work is completely first class. To elaborate, the venue and the staging is terrific to look at, the backgrounds for each song and lighting were obviously planned and well executed. The filming and even more importantly the editing isn't that hyper every beat switch so common on Iron Maiden and other DVDs but actually allows the viewers eyes to focus before switching camera angles and goodness when Viv or Phil are playing a solo they are usually shown!

 I know this group prides themselves on their legacy and giving their fans value for money (something I admire Metallica for as well) and I do believe they've done themselves and their fans proud.
With the economy tanking and our consumer dollar worth less every day I can recommend this to any Def Leppard fan and I dare say if you aren't but love good hard rock I think you'd be hard pressed to not be after viewing this.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1383177600,5,1279,4.467811158798283
5891578,4,B00E5N8DGG,"I've spent the last few weeks watching this Blu-ray and I'm enjoying it thoroughly.  The video quality is very good and the sound mix is somewhat clear, actually a bit bass heavy.  Honestly, the Ded Flatbird sets (listed under ""bonus 1"" and ""bonus 2"" in the menu) are far better than the Hysteria set.  I'm a big fan of ""High 'n' Dry"" and ""Pyromania"" albums so that is what I really dig about this Blu-ray.  The inclusion of ""Good Morning Freedom"" was the icing on the cake!  That song was previously only available as the B side to the ""Hello America"" single, from the ""On Through the Night"" era.  Great song.

I don't notice much difference between the stereo and 5.1 mixes (both encoded in DTS-HD MA at 48khz/24bit resolution).  I'll explain.  The stereo audio stream going through a Neo:6 decoder sounds identical to the discrete 5.1 surround mix.  So honestly, the surround mix isn't a real surround mix IMHO so I had to dock one star.  I'm listening to this on a fully calibrated JBL Studio series surround system.  Otherwise, this is still a must own for Def Leppard fans.

Enjoy!",1383177600,9,1087,4.598958333333333

I was a bit concerned about the sound after seeing the concert at the movie theater which didn't do justice to the sound performance of the live show, but I'm relieved to know it was the theater and not the sound track, because it sounds awesome on my home theater system.

5891583,5,B00E5N8DGG,"I cannot begin to express how long overdue this is. It is so killer to have an official live DVD and album that include the rare stuff that rarely if ever gets played live. 'Good Morning Freedom' is an old b-side but to many it is a new song. There are not many bands out today that could write a crafted rock song like GMF and to think these guys were in their late teens. The tracklist is fantastic. The band sounds great, just a great compilation. Hats off to Viv Campbell too. The guy was just diagnosed with cancer when rehearsal started for this residency. What a trooper and he sounds great!

Any band that intend to release a live album in the future should contact Joe Elliott. The sound is great; I have never been a big live album fan because usually you get a bunch of tracks that may have been performed live but basically became studio tracks with crowd noise added by the time it was produced. This is the real deal. I read on a message board where someone stated this and recommended watching/listening to the new Metallica release then listen to this new Leppard release. I did and they are right. Metallica polished and fixed alot of the tracks. I like the raw sound from Def Leppard and dare I say this has a punk rock vibe to it. It really does. Stand up job from a standup bunch of guys and one of the all-time great rock bands.

Def Leppard in the RnR Hall of Fame!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is a total joke that these guys are not in there; I doubt they care but they deserve it.",1382486400,18,1493,4.27208480565371
5891584,5,B00E5N8DGG,"Def Leppard have been my favorite band since 1987's 'Hysteria'. I was seventeen when I first heard 'Animal' on FM radio, and I was hooked - not just on this band - but on guitar-driven rock music in general. I imagine many people discovered Leppard with this landmark album, which has sold a staggering 20 million to date. Producer Robert John ""Mutt"" Lange built a sonic amusement park, with literally dozens of guitar layers, and choruses hundreds of voices strong, in each song.  What a daunting task, then, to recreate this monster's sound over 25 years later. Yes, the group has been playing most of 'Hysteria' live since then, because it spawned SEVEN hit singles. But five of these songs have been played rarely, if at all, in a live setting. How do they translate on stage? Well, I wouldn't buy this without having a quality home theater system, as that's the only way to appreciate just how meticulously the band performs these tracks, all in amazing DTS MASTER AUDIO. The Las Vegas residency allowed them to rest between shows, really bringing out the best performance I've seen from them in years. In a live setting, you can usually blow through a catalog of hits without regard to precision, as long as the ""meat"" of songs remains. On this occasion, the band put obvious effort into making live 'Hysteria' sound as much like the studio version as possible, and they mostly succeed. There's a glorious fat, bottom end, which is one of the most memorable aspects of the album, thanks to Rick Allen's electronic drum kit and Rick Savage's throbbing bass. The two guitar attack of Phil Collen and Vivian Campbell sounds like twelve, thanks to carefully chosen guitar parts, achieving the maximum wall of melodic sound. Joe Elliott's voice isn't quite what it was 25 years ago, but who would expect it to be? He's still able to mostly bring the vocal power, along with the rest of this band of singers. The choruses sound HUGE! This is a testament to just how good they are live, as I didn't detect much, if any, post-tinkering (overdubs) to the audio tracks. Ded Flatbird, ""the world's best Def Leppard cover band"" (because it IS Def Leppard, complete with alter-egos and hilarious made-up names), is featured on two blistering sets, performing stuff you haven't heard the guys perform in years, with tracks from 'On Through the Night', 'High 'n' Dry', 'Slang' and 'Euphoria'. The 1080p video looks great, without too many quick cuts seen in most modern concert films. If you're even just a casual fan, buy this, as it is truly the best live representation of Def Leppard to date.",1382486400,31,2587,4.7616926503340755
