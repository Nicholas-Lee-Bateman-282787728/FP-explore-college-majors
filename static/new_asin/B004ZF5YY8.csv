8449705,5,B004ZF5YY8,Great acting great story. Worth every penny. I just wish I could get a hold of a blu ray copy but I don't think it was ever released on blu ray. The dvd quality is pretty good though. I was surprised in the end with the outcome of the movie. Lots of drama. Highly recommend if you are into story telling.,1483747200,,304,4.0
