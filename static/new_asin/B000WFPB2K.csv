8223114,5,B000WFPB2K,THIS DVD IS REALLY GREAT. I'M VERY SAD BECAUSE I LOST THIS DVD DURING MY LAST TRIP FROM USA TO MEXICO. WHEN I STARTED TAKING MY DVDS OUT OF THE BOX WHERE I SENT THEM IT WASN'T  THERE ANYMORE. AND IT MAKES ME BE REALLY FRUSTATED BECAUSE I DON'T SEE IT ON SALE ANYMORE AND I WON'T BE ABLE TO BUY IT AGAIN. I WISH THEY WOULD HAVE IT BACK ON SALE FOR ANOTHER PERIOD OF TIME.,1380931200,,370,3.8051948051948052
8223115,5,B000WFPB2K,"Watching Alejandra Guzman - Trayectoria one can easily understand why within just a few short years of these performances she would be known throughout the latin world as La Reina del Rock (the queen of rock).  Spanning a period of between 1989-1991 the young Alejandra Guzman transforms from an adorable pop princess into a stunning rock goddess who will torment the eyes of any man who views this DVD; and that is just a delightful bonus.  Perhaps more importantly, the viewer will appreicate the raw talent that matured into the Grammy award winning singer whom today is beloved as El Guzman.",1255737600,,595,4.881188118811881
