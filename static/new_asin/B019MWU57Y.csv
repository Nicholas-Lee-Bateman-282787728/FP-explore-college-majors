7576445,4,B019MWU57Y,"This was an interesting movie that I would definitely recommend,the storyline was good and all actors involved did their part. I was caught off guard with Wayne Brady's performance,totally out of character!.",1457654400,4,207,5.5

7576447,5,B019MWU57Y,Very real portrayal of a family's struggle because of a parent's substance abuse. We rarely see men in the role of sober peace keeper though like we do here. Hill Harper and Sharon Leal were great as usual but the little girl who played their daughter was surprisingly talented,1457049600,10,277,4.673469387755102
7576448,1,B019MWU57Y,"Very disappointed in this film. Was expecting much more. The movie is based out of Philadelphia, with me being from North philly I was very interested in seeing this film. It was very slow and disjointed. Story line was all over the place. Even though it had some of the best actors I'm thinking it was alot more to this film that was left on the editing floor.",1456963200,4,361,4.323529411764706

7576450,5,B019MWU57Y,"I saw this movie 2 years ago during the Austin Film Festival to a round of applause when it was over.  It was also an audience award winner that year and I often wondered what the fate of this film would be because it was so moving and powerful and the first film for writer and director Tommy Oliver, basically telling his childhood story.  I had the wonderful opportunity to meet both he and Hill Harper that night.  Harper's acting in this film was by far his best work to date in my opinion, even the character Wayne Brady portrayed was a stretch for him.  I wish this film had been released in theaters to a broader audience to witness this compelling and powerful drama about the impact drug addiction has on a family and the love that keeps them together.  Bravo! Tommy Oliver, Sharon Leal and Hill Harper, you all deserved award nominations for this but few saw it then.",1497916800,,878,4.428571428571429

7576476,4,B019MWU57Y,"Overall its a decent story. You get drawn into the characters and you feel compassion for the lead character - Hill Harper.
Its not often these days you see a drama told from the perspective of a black male lead. This is definitely a refreshing departure.",1466985600,4,255,4.565217391304348

7576492,4,B019MWU57Y,"Tim Brown (Hill Harper) lives in the projects of Philadelphia and is getting ready to open his own laundromat with a combination of used washers and dryers. He has a daughter Maya (Troi Zee) who is light years in intellect beyond her parents. Shenae (Sharon Leal) is the wife who completes the family. When drug pusher Alonzo (Wayne Brady) gets out of jail, he pays a visit to Shenae, a former client and girlfriend. Shenae becomes hooked and disrupts everyone's life.

The film doesn't really have a great story with a twist and a marvelous happy ending...neither does Old Yeller die. It is inspired by a true story and is simply a story about life. The question is why this film and why now? Currently white suburbia has a problem with heroin addiction. There is an outcry to do something, something that didn't happen in 1982 when it was primarily in poor urban neighborhoods.

I would have liked to have see some statistics about heroin use then and now at the end of the feature to bring the film into prospective. There was none. It allows the viewers to come to their own conclusions concerning race and how issues are addressed.  The acting was fairly decent. The dialogue was boring as in real life.
