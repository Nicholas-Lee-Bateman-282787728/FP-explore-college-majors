8510350,2,B007549X0C,"I really like Leslie Howard and Kay Francis. So, in general, I will watch anything either one acting in. For me, however, this movie left me cold, and I barely made it through the movie. The chemistry between the two actors was lacking. I could follow the plot somewhat, but Leslie's lines were totally confusing and I could not figure out what he was trying to convey to the audience. Fancy gibberish I think would be a good description.",1487030400,2,438,4.556962025316456
8510351,3,B007549X0C,Would give 3.5 stars if I could.  Held my interest for a while but then kind of lost steam just when it should have been picking up.  Leads charming but romance plot line underdeveloped.  The representation of history seems bizarre even by 1930s standards.,1477180800,,256,4.7727272727272725
8510352,4,B007549X0C,"Interesting history, set during WW1, told from the English and Russian perspective.",1453507200,,83,6.0
8510353,3,B007549X0C,"An amusing little spy thriller and love story, it's certainly laughable as history. A total whitewash of what the Soviet was becoming. At the end after Lenin has been shot he survives and his first words are reported as ""stop the terror"" and shortly after we are told he has pardoned all political prisoners (!). Of course as we know the terror was just getting underway....A very nice print if you are watching streaming. Look for the real Moura, Bruce Lockhart's lover during those days, in a cameo role.",1452297600,4,506,4.696629213483146
8510354,5,B007549X0C,A 1934 film of spies in World War I behind enemy lines.  Actors like Leslie Howard and Kay Francis bring great presence to this tale of intrigue.  Michael Curtiz who made a ton of wonderful movies from 1912 to 1961 doesn't fail to bring action and suspense to a credible story.,1392940800,3,277,4.411764705882353
8510355,4,B007549X0C,"This movie is one that will appeal to those who are interested in history.  It takes place during the time of Lenin's rise to power in Russia, after the elimination of their monarchy, up to his assasination.  The story is quite good and it gives a very good analysis of how Lenin and socialism/Communism took over.  Leslie Howard is, as usual, terrific as the British agent and Kay Francis is lovely as the Leninist.  It's worth watching.",1356652800,4,438,4.64935064935065
8510356,5,B007549X0C,"Note: I saw this movie on television when Turner Classic Movies showed it.

This early film from director Michael Curtiz (who would later direct the swashbuckling adventure The Adventures Of Robin Hood and the classic drama Casablanca) stars Leslie Howard (who would become famous as The Scarlet Pimpernel a few years later and then play Ashley Wilkes in the classic Civil War romance-drama Gone With The Wind) and Kay Francis is very well acted and directed. I don't know if the film was shot in Russia, but the exteriors and interiors were very convicing...and the actors playing Russians spoke Russian very well; same thing goes for Mr. Howard. The drama is well-maintained and you never lose interest.

This film is Not Rated.",1345593600,11,730,4.975409836065574
