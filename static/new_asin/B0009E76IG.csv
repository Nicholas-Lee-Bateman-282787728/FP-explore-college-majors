2281608,5,B0009E76IG,"First of all the production.  Some may find this stripped down, unit set goes against the roccoco splendour and excess usually associated with productions of Massenet's most famous opera too bare bones, but McVicar is on to something.  In this sort of semi circle, bull ring type atmosphere  everything - and I mean everything - must and does come from the singers.

Some may also prefer the opulent tone of Fleming in the role, or the dark liquidy sexiness of Netrebko, but for my money, Dessay is my ideal as Manon.  Her performance here is nothing short of astonishing - maybe THE Manon of our day who is completely believable in all stages of Manon's development.  Her ""Adieu, petite table"" was so organic, so revealing, showing how conflicted this young woman was between true love and the lure of a luxurious lifestyle.  Whereas I don't often feel pity for Manon until the end, Dessay had me right here.  And she wouldn't let go.

Where many sopranos treat the Gavotte as the showpiece of the night, Dessay does something unique that just blew me away, singing the second strophe of the aria almost entirely inward looking - introducing a genuinely introspective quality to it.  It's as though the crowd has melted away and she's singing this entirely for herself, fully understanding the words, then with a sudden recognition of who and where she is, puts back on her game face, which may fool the crowd at the Cour de Reine, but not the viewing audience.  It is an absolute tour de force of vocal acting and the audience appropriately goes mad with the longest ovation of the night.  But something else happened, too, during this scene that grabbed me as few Manons have:  the melodramma between Manon and Count des Grieux, her questions, his answers, came alive in a way that made the scene crackle.  Ramey, given concerns about his ""wobble"" was authoritative, if not vocally splendid, and his speaking voice retains a grave, elegant quality that, (at least for me) made the role a success.

Villazon is every bit Dessay's equal on just about every level.  A few oddly shaped phrases of his French, and a harsh note or two crept in at the beginning, but his Des Grieux is so entirely believable, so loveably innocent that one cannot help but feel for him every step of the way.  I felt ""THIS"" is who Des Grieux sounds.  His ""Ah Fuyez"" was propulsive, musical and gut wrenching.  (At times, not always, his darkened, timbre reminds me of a certain Spanish tenor in his youth.)

When Manon arrives at St. Sulplice, it is with a feverish intensity.  Clearly burning with madness and desire, she casts off her duster looking almost as though she will explode.  When she desparately cries out her prayer, you know this woman is completely overwhelmed by her feelings - she is unraveling - though probably fixed to a plan, has no idea as to how she's going to proceed - that prayer is desperation itself.  Instead of acting out the usual seduction scene Dessay appears to her former lover as though a wounded bird, and Des Grieux fights - a little violently - to restrain himself from caving in, but he cannot keep from touching her and his fate is doomed right here.  Explosive is not too strong a word for the quality these two infuse this scene with and here they are lighting up one of Massenet's greatest, grandest moments.  (At the conclusion of this scene I had to hit ""pause"" and have a cigarette.)

The final scene had me in nonstop tears, Dessay presenting a ruined, truly pathetic rag of a girl, and her quiet death (no gasp on ""Lescaut"") and Villazon's reaction made me shudder as he kisses her, raises her almost refusing to believe what just happened.  Amazing.

Victor Pablo Perez leads the Liceu forces in a very French sounding performance, catching Massenet's nuances, breathing with his singers so naturally it was refreshing.

This Manon is truly a marvelous example of total music theatre - everything coming together about as perfectly as I could have wanted.  Anyone who loves Massenet, really owes it to themself to have this disc in their library.  As Pepe noted, for the price - it's one of the best operatic bargains you'll find.

I'm still all verklempt over this one, gang!

2281609,5,B0009E76IG,"Filmed at Barcelona's Liceu Theater last summer, this is a superb and unsentimental production of Massenet's ""Manon"" that builds to a shattering conclusion. Eschewing a recent trend for updating, David McVicar's production sets the story in the exact period of the Abb Prevost's famous novel: the early 18th century. But that does not mean that this is a quaint and prettified staging -- far from it!

Taking his cue from Hogarth's gritty period paintings, McVicar gives us a grim, venal world in which only the toughest survive. And that makes the love story of Manon and Des Grieux all the more poignant since we know that these two innocents don't stand a chance in such a setting. McVicar's masterstroke is to surround them constantly -- except in the St. Sulpice scene and during their final duet -- with a crowd of cynical onlookers, portrayed by the ballet and some chorus members; even the intimate Act 2 scene in their apartment in Paris has curious servants hovering about.

In Natalie Dessay and Rolando Villazn, McVicar has two performers who are as much actors as singers. A diminutive little gamine, Dessay has to overcome the fact that she is no beauty, while Manon is supposed to be so gorgeous that she attracts every man who sees her. But overcome it she does, and while she can't match Anna Netrebko's glamour in this part, she captures the complexity and extreme feminity of Manon's character in much greater detail than does Netrebko (whom I saw in the Los Angeles production, which, in its Berlin incarnation, is due out on Deutsche Grammophon later this year). Her voice may lack Netrebko's size and voluptuousness, but she excells in the role's colorature passages and acuti. And her more fragile sound makes her death scene incredibly poignant.

At the time of this production, Rolando Villazn was in the midst of a vocal crisis that was about to send him into the lengthy absence from the stage, from which he has only returned this month. Yet, despite a minor sense of stress in some of his loud climaxes, this is not really evident at all. His singing of ""La Rve' in Act 2 is gloriously subtle and tender: he owns this aria. And his acting is utterly persuasive. It's tremendously difficult to make ""good"" characters interesting, but Villazn knows how: his Des Grieux is by turns sweetly romantic, fiercely protective, and, at the end, utterly broken. The closing death scene between Dessay and Villazn is utterly heartbreaking, but again without any sentimentality.

Other cast members are strong, especially Manuel Lanza's robustly sung Lescaut. A minor problem is Samuel Ramey's Count Des Grieux. Now well into his sixties, he sings with a terrible wobble and really should retire so that we can remember him as the glorious singer he was. The little-known Victor Pablo Prez conducts the Liceu Orchestra with admirable Gallic spirit and refinement. The photography is excellent throughout.

I give this outstanding DVD my highest recommendation. If you love French opera, Dessay, Villazn, or simply an enthralling theatrical as well as musical experience, buy it!",1200873600,43,3094,4.97678916827853
2281610,5,B0009E76IG,"To date the reference recording -- by default, given the virtual absence of other DVD format productions -- has been the 2001 performance at the Bastille Opera with Renee Fleming and Marcelo Alvarez.  David McVicar's production, from Barcelona's Gran Teatre del Liceu, changes the landscape considerably, in several regards. It's a shame that the 2006 Los Angeles Opera production, directed by Vincent Patterson, was not recorded.  Ideally, a collection of opera on DVD would have both the Barcelona and the Los Angeles performances, because the real choice, I think, lies between these two conceptions.  The Bastille production is sumptuous in many ways, with superlative musical direction (Lopez-Cobos), visually alluring period sets and costumes cast in a spectrum of sherbet colors that defy description, and the estimable presence of Fleming and Alvarez.  I think those who love this performance may find it hard to enter the world McVicar and his star soprano, Natalie Dessay, create at the Liceu.  McVicar's production is an imaginative and powerful invocation of Hogarth's (not to mention Goya's) seedy eighteenth-century street scenes and claustrophobic interiors.  McVicar presents a world still tinted with signs of former luxury but pervasively marked by neglect and decay.  The color palette throughout the staging, for example, is dominated by shades of taupe, moss green, and grey, so much so that it is hard to detect the arrival of Manon in the famous Cours-la-Reine scene, and it is also positively shocking to see Manon appear in brilliant crimson in the gambling scene. In some ways, that's the trade-off: we don't get the easy visual pleasure of the cinematic spectacle, but we do get a pretty powerful dose of the scandal. This is to say that the purely visual dimension of McVicar's production is polemical: he is not aiming to satisfy our desire to see yet another version of the rags to riches story in charming 18th-century porcelain, and I would guess the point here is not simply that we know how the story ends but that MiVicar wants to remind us that the world in which Manon tries to survive is sumptuous only in a superficial and extremely precarious way, never far from its callous and mercenary underbelly.

So, fair warning: those seeking a visually seductive performance of Manon should buy (or stick with) the Bastille production.  On the other hand, McVicar's staging is harrowing and moving beyond belief -- it may not correspond to the sentimentality of Massenet's score but it surely conveys more of the spirit of Prevost's 18th-century novel.  Indeed, I think the astringent staging presented here goes miles toward helping us hear Massenet's music differently, and better.  Surely McVicar has ideal partners in Dessay and Villazon.  There is simply no comparison between Dessay and Fleming, or between Villazon and Alvarez.  All four, of course, are superlative singers, but Dessay's Manon is specific, vulnerable, complicated, and ultimately devastating in ways that Fleming's Manon only gestures at, in beautifully composed but oddly inert ways.  To be sure, Dessay's laser-like timbre does not convey Fleming's vocal opulence but neither does Fleming's Manon traverse the dramatic arc that Dessay presents in crushing detail.  (Compare the Saint-Sulpice scenes in each version and you'll see and hear what I mean.) Similarly, Alvarez's Des Grieux is beautifully sung but generalized; Villazon's is also beautifully sung but it is also believably raw and exposed.  The Liceu set does have a weak element, but it is not a major liability: unfortunately, Samuel Ramey was cast rather too late in his career to make an impact in the paternal role of the Comte Des Grieux.  That said, if the choice is now between the Liceu and Bastille productions, I'd go for the Liceu.  [The Los Angeles production boasted an even more passionately sung Des Grieux and the stunning Manon of Anna Netrebko, placed in a deliberately over-the-top staging filtered through the lens of '40s and '50s Hollywood film melodrama.  You either loved it or hated it -- but, unlike the Bastille production, the LA conception presents a real alternative to what Liceu so movingly creates.]",1200268800,96,4202,5.189349112426036
2281647,5,B0009E76IG,"Like the Donizetti Love Potion, this also teams up Villazon and Netrebko to completely believable effect. Both are in good voice although there are a few early signs of the vocal strain which has recently caused Villazon problems leading to unreliable engagements. These are not of any real significance here though and should not affect any purchasing choice. The problem may stem from his apparent reluctance to hold back his enthusiasm to deliver fully in performance rather than saving his voice whenever possible. This is good for his audiences but is a potentially heavy long term price for Villazon. He certainly gives 100% here.

The setting is updated to the 1950's, but both Villazon and Netrebko have an aura about them that suggests a modern coupling would be appropriate. They are especially vibrant together and are clearly of an appropriate age for each other dramatically. This is a great advantage in any opera but is especially beneficial in this setting. Netrebko brings a dramatic aura of both glamour and decadence to her part and is in particularly good voice. The part seems made for her.

All the supporting roles are well sung and convincingly portrayed by Christof Fischesser, Alfredo Daza, Remy Corazza, Arttu Kataja, Hanan Alattar, Gal James, Silvia de la Muela and Mattias Vieweg although inevitably the limelight is dominated by Anna Netrebko and to a lesser extent, by Rolando Villazon.

The orchestra is also on top form under the sparkling direction of Barenboim.

The recording offers excellent surround sound in DTS 5.1, PCM 5.1 as well as stereo. The camera work is sympathetic with a nice balance of close detail and more distant shots. As another reviewer has remarked, it is vital that good singing is backed up by good acting in opera especially when the storyline is so slight and we are certainly offered a combination of fine singing and acting in this case. Fortunately we live in an age when the old stand and deliver approach has been replaced by far better stage training and camera awareness and that is what we get here.

In general terms, although I personally like the modern setting, I feel that there will be those who would prefer a more traditional staging and it should be noted that this production may not therefore be to everyone's personal taste. The musical values remain excellent however whatever views one may have on production choices and this performance certainly went down well with the audience. Providing that purchasers are prepared to accept the period updating to the 1950's this disc should give considerable pleasure. With that proviso in mind, it seems reasonable to suggest that 5 stars is a fair rating for those in sympathy with this modernised concept and that those who would reject that should look elsewhere for their choice of Manon.",1343260800,,2818,4.974522292993631
2281648,3,B0009E76IG,"I have owned both this and the rival Villazon recording with Netrebko as his partner. As happened in his very successful performance of Donizetti's Love Potion with Netrebko, the two are able to spark off each other in an altogether more natural way. They are also able to sustain that level whereas in this performance the levels are rather more variable.

The McVicar production here is basically set in period but does not rise to the heights of his remarkable Rigoletto at the Royal Opera or his Le Nozze de Figaro at Glyndebourne.

This is possibly the best of the Massenet operas and does at least avoid the problems of Puccini's ending of the similar story with Manon's death in the Florida desert! The, perhaps controversially updated setting of the Villazon/Netrebko with Barenboim at the helm, is still for me the best bet as I feel the musical values are more reliable. In this I am not alone and I would suggest looking at the reviews of that set before buying this.

Otherwise the sound here is well recorded both visually and sonically and the camera work is sympathetic.

............................................

Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:

The Florida desert? That's a new one on me.).  (U.S. review)

That's my point exactly of course, which is why I put the exclamation mark after the sentence in the above review. Puccini clearly had no idea of American geography and this is a particularly blatant example of geographic and consequential dramatic nonsense! Ian Giles

2281649,5,B0009E76IG,"I recently read a quote attributed to Rolando Villazn:  ""When opera is really good, it doesn't just touch the ears.  It opens your chest and scrambles you up.""  I couldn't agree more.  This opera DVD certainly has that effect on me!

The evocative staging of this superb live performance of Massenet's Manon is confronting in its portrayal of the brazen decadence of an ugly and voyeuristic 18th century society, whose glitter falls away very quickly for the hapless Manon and Des Grieux.  The orchestral sound is rich and lush, and it is impossible not to be transported by Massenet's beautiful score.

To me, Natalie Dessay has perfectly captured the essence of Manon.  As the story progresses the moods of her voice change sharply - from precocious naivety in Act 1, to sad inevitability in ""Adieu Notre Petite Table"".  There is brittle and superficial gaiety in the Gavotte, and seductiveness barely concealing pathetic desperation at Saint Sulpice.  Finally we hear genuine warmth when in her last moments, Manon finally thinks of someone other than herself.

Des Grieux has all the superb Rolando Villazn trademarks - beautiful singing straight from the heart, and astonishing realism of character.  He pulled all my emotions with him on his rollercoaster ride from joy to despair.  ""En Fermant Les Yeux"" is an absolute highlight - the perfect mix of tenderness and ardour, flowing like golden honey.  By contrast, ""Ah Fuyez Douce Image"" is an outburst of inner conflict, culminating in an explosive climax.  I have no problem with his interpretation being perhaps less ""French"" than some others ... his distinctive, passionate sound is part of who he is and should be cherished for its individuality.

Samuel Ramey's voice may be less elastic these days, but his performance is still powerful.  The pivotal Saint Sulpice scene between father and son is superb in its tense restraint.  I felt physical pain to see this young man, so in need of comfort and guidance, receive only cold scorn and lofty criticism.

The bonus documentary is a fascinating insight into the production's preparation.  It is a tribute to Mr Villazn's superlative acting skills to see, in un-costumed rehearsal, on a bare stage surrounded by activity, with piano only and a hovering director - at the end of the death scene his face is bathed in real tears!

The Barcelona audience were vocal in their appreciation of this performance, and I add my applause to theirs.",1319673600,2,2449,4.997530864197531
2281650,2,B0009E76IG,"The production works against the score.  That said, I like the production, but I prefer the score.  Dessay is a very fine actress, but lacks the control and finesse in the voice-- less voice, more silver.  And Villazon is just a disaster! To roar out Ah, fuyez.... is to make a mockery of great French music and great French singing.  He belts as if he were a Mongolian shepherd. To have heard the style from Thill or even Villazon's Spanish compatriot, Aragall on the Myto recording.. would put Villazon to shame.  I am so disappointed.",1311724800,2,537,4.610526315789474
2281651,4,B0009E76IG,"First, I'll probably make you angry with me, by saying I don't especially like the opera, Manon.  The reason is simply a matter of preference.  I like operas with well-written librettos that add something to the moments of beautiful singing.

I've always felt the libretto for Manon is more than a little weak.  The characters vacillate too much, and often end up appearing too shallow or unthinking.  For example, Manon is a sweet innocent girl, but she abruptly goes along with a plot to have her lover (Villazon) kidnapped. She turns to life as a courtesan, but then remembers her love and wants to return to him.  She does, but then abruptly forgets the love in a lust for the riches that money can buy--and abruptly again, urges him to gamble so that she can again live the good life.

OK.  You probably hate this review, because I have dared to express my personal dislike for weak story lines.  Maybe I can win you back, at least a bit, by saying that if you can enjoy what I consider a weak story line, this is maybe the best Manon ever recorded.  The costumes are beautiful, and this is even surpassed by the voluptuous singing of Dessay and Villazon.  They are simply incomparable!  Their acting also contributes a great deal and provides a really appealing look at ""young love"" and its struggle with ""family issues"" and the vices of life.  Yes, Samuel Ramey's voice is not what it once was, but it is still firm enough for this role, and he looks good too!

I apologize if my remarks about weak story lines offended, but I can assure you that if you like Manon, this will be among the best Manons you've ever seen or heard!",1311465600,8,1634,4.494915254237288
2281652,5,B0009E76IG,"Dessay is simply delightful in voice, acting, diction, and voice,  voice, voice, voice.  Villazon is definitely just as good. Even his diction is not bad, far better than Domingo any day. Alas, Ramey is worse than a disappointment. Production is bizarre - in an arena???? Sets are scanty but effective.

Definitely recommend this Manon. Dessay and Villazon make this an excellent Manon.",1293580800,4,386,5.193548387096774

2281655,3,B0009E76IG,"Netrebko is scary!  Anyone who can act that well and sing too!  She is truly amazing. This is not to discount Villazon who is wonderful in his own right.  I give Netrebko and Villazon 5 stars, the opera 2.  Everytime I see Massenet's version I'm reminded of how I hate this.  The story makes no sense, certainly not in the 1950's.  The music is incredibly boring.  Only one memorable aria in the whole opera.  No wonder Puccini felt he could improve upon it 9 years later.  The opera still makes little sense in Puccini's version, i.e., the couple dying in the deserts of Louisiana, but at the least Puccini gives us some decent music along the way.  Worth buying, owning for the love scene in act II, pretty much a snoozer in acts III, IV and V.",1264464000,,746,4.37956204379562

2281668,5,B0009E76IG,"What happens when a beautiful soprano singing next to a great tenor? We have a great opera, this conclusion may seem obvious, but not always exceptional singers together make great operas. There has to be chemistry, they must be free to show its full potential. In this version of Manon Massanet have an explosion of elements, all positive, all exciting, all lead to a great show.

Anna Netrebko has been prominent in the opera scene by physical beauty, her stage presence is contagious grown men and women. The dramatic acting, great actress, you know to capture the feeling of the character and express it. The voice of beautiful timbre, lyrical, a little dark, powerful, well designed. A Russian singer has all the elements of a great modern soprano, voice, acting and physical beauty.

Are very comfortable in Manon, ask the French accent, but it goes unnoticed when we hear arias: Adieu, notre petite table or Obissons, quand leur voix appelle. From naive girl on the way to the convent for the consecration in Paris (Part one emerging unforgettable) and decay in prison. It demonstrated very convincingly by a superb performance. This is a modern singer, that's twenty-first century opera, a union of elements of art. It renews and attracts public.

The Mexican tenor Rolando Villazon follows the same standards of quality, his Le Chevaliers Des Grieux evolves young, naive and full of love for a grown man and bitter. His voice tries to follow the evolution of the character, the lyrical passages does very well in the dramatic pieces missing weight. It works well alongside the protagonist, embodies the character, is comfortable in the role, rather than the previous version with Natalie Dessay in Paris, 2007.

Comprimrios The highlights are: Christof Fischesser makes Le Comte des Grieux, paper down voluminous voice. He is too young, just remember the father of the protagonist and his voice is more baritone that down. The Lescaut Afredo Dasa baritone voice is clear with good musicianship and performance.

Daniel Baremboin is a fashionable pianist and conductor of world renown, is governed by orchestras all over the world. I always thought it better on the piano. In Berlin Staatskapelle baton of their time are too slow, perhaps to help the singers to interpret, but no breath! But that makes the reading of the work monotonous, sometimes tiring, arias that excite the public are little applause. Loses to music, get the theater.

The direction of Vincent Paterson captures the essence of the work of Massanet, does not sit, modernizes the reading. Carries the work to Paris for 50 years, with train arriving Manon, parties at the foot of the Eiffel Tower and the grace of Hotel Transilvania are dynamic elements. Explores the dramatic potential of the singers, move them without exaggeration. The perfect light, help and encourage, directors this time is understood, had the same design. Costumes consistent with the time chosen, flawless, perfect finish, in the city carry light from the 50's. This opera is introducing a new variable, makeup, never seen work so well executed. Choir or are impeccably costumed actors, with the advent of high definition make-up gave a leap.

Comparing the first Manon I attended with Edita Gruberova letter of 1983 in Vienna with the newly released Netrebko, there is an evolution, such as opera recordings have changed in those 25 years. The opera is theater that corner, the VHS are in high definition DVD, the productions are infinitely more whimsical, resemble a large theater or Broadway productions. We have interviews with actors and directors, choice of chapters and a booklet with the article and summary of the opera, all in English of course.

Vocally I prefer with Manon Gruberova or with Beverly Sills in 1977 in New York City Opera. The Manon of Netrebko and Villazon back a new language, modern, current, charismatic. In the era of Internet, digital music, speed, use disposable, opera seems an aberration. But she finds a way, renewing the public and will always be reborn as Phoenix.

Paris  uma Festa !

O que acontece quando um belo soprano canta ao lado de um grande tenor? Temos uma grande pera, essa concluso pode parecer bvia, mas nem sempre excepcionais cantores juntos fazem grandes peras. Tem que haver qumica, eles tem que estar  vontade para mostrar todo o potencial. Nessa verso da Manon de Massanet temos uma exploso de elementos, todos positivos, todos empolgantes, todos levam a um grande espetculo.

Anna Netrebko tem se destacado no cenrio lrico pela beleza fsica, sua presena no palco contagia marmanjos e senhoras. Pela atuao dramtica, grande atriz, sabe captar o sentimento do personagem e express-lo. Pela voz, de timbre belo, lrico, um pouco escuro, potente, bem projetado. A cantora russa tem todos os elementos de um grande soprano moderno, voz, atuao e beleza fsica.

Est muito a vontade em Manon, peca no sotaque francs, mas isso passa despercebido quando ouvimos suas rias: Adieu,notre petite table ou Obissons , quand leur voix appelle. De menina ingnua a caminho do convento para a consagrao em Paris (Faz uma emergente inesquecvel) e a decadncia na priso. Tudo demonstrado com muita convico atravs de uma atuao soberba. Isso  uma cantora moderna, isso  pera do sculo XXI, uma unio de elementos da arte. Isso renova e atrai publico.

O tenor mexicano Rolando Villazn segue o mesmo padro de qualidade, seu Le Chevaliers Des Grieux evolui de jovem, ingnuo e cheio de amor para um homem maduro e amargurado. Sua voz tenta acompanhar a evoluo do personagem, nas passagens lricas se sai muito bem, nas partes dramticas falta peso. Atua bem ao lado da protagonista, incorpora o personagem, est a vontade no papel, melhor que na verso anterior com Natalie Dessay em Paris , 2007.

Os comprimrios de destaque so: Christof Fischesser faz Le Comte des Grieux , papel para baixo de voz encorpada. Ele  jovem demais, pouco lembra o pai do protagonista e sua voz est mais para bartono que para baixo. O Lescaut de Afredo Dasa  bartono de voz clara com boa musicalidade e atuao.

Daniel Baremboin  um badalado pianista e maestro de renome mundial, rege orquestras pelos quatro cantos do mundo. Sempre achei ele melhor no piano. Na batuta da Staatskapelle Berlim seus tempos so excessivamente lentos, talvez seja para ajudar os cantores a interpretarem, seno haja flego! Mas isso torna a leitura da obra montona, as vezes cansativa, rias que empolgam o publico so pouco ovacionadas. Perde a msica, ganha o teatro.

A direo de Vincent Paterson capta a essncia da obra de Massanet, no se acomoda, moderniza a leitura. Transporta a obra para a Paris dos anos 50, trem chegando com Manon, festas aos ps da Torre Eifel e a graa do Hotel Transilvania so elementos dinmicos . Explora o potencial dramtico dos cantores, movimenta-os sem exageros. A luz perfeita, ajuda e estimula, diretores dessa vez se entenderam, tiveram a mesma concepo. Figurinos condizentes com a poca escolhida, impecveis, perfeitos no acabamento, nos transportam a cidade luz da dcada de 50. Essa pera inaugura um novo quesito, maquiagem, nunca vi trabalho to bem executado. Coristas ou protagonistas esto impecavelmente maquiados, com o advento da alta definio a maquiagem deu um salto qualitativo.

Comparando a primeira Manon que assisti com Edita Gruberova datada do ano de 1983 em Viena com a recm lanada da Netrebko, existe uma evoluo, como as gravaes de pera mudaram nesses 25 anos. A pera  mais teatro que canto, do VHS estamos no DVD de alta definio, as produes so infinitamente mais caprichadas, lembram grandes peas de teatro ou produes da Brodway. Temos entrevistas com os protagonistas e diretores, escolha de captulos e um encarte com artigo e resumo da pera, tudo em ingls  claro.

Vocalmente prefiro a Manon com a Gruberova ou com Beverly Sills em 1977 na New York City Opera. A Manon da Netrebko e do Villazon trs uma nova linguagem , moderna, atual, carismtica.

2281670,5,B0009E76IG,"I have had a laserdisc copy of this opera on the shelves for many years but never managed to get past the first act so this BD was my first exposure to the complete opera.
A movie with a relatively thin story line succeeds because of the artistic ability of the actors just as one with a strong story line can fail because of poor acting.  A successful operatic production requires just so much more with great acting, great singing, great music and great staging because most have rather thin story lines.  Well this production of Manon has it all and I did not find the modern setting used by Staatskapelle at all inappropriate.  The balance between voices and orchestra is fine as is the audio and video generally.
Now I must confess to a love affair with  Anna Netrebco as her beautiful & powerful voice combined with stunning good looks have me completely captivated so be aware of this prejudice.  But combine her talents with those of Rolando Villazon with the music of Massenet and you have a winner here.  Their singing and acting brought tears to my eyes.  What more can be said?  Unreservedly recommended.",1249948800,2,1116,4.629441624365482
2281671,3,B0009E76IG,"I will admit, as I write this review, I feel spoiled. Having viewed Villazon/Netrebko in the Salzburg Festival's 'La Traviata' release on DVD, I come to this production still reeling from the other.

First things first, the singing is incredible. Dessay and Villazon both have incredible range, they sing, they are controlled, they project confidence. The staging I felt was in keeping with the tone of the era and Prevost's book. This is France before the Revolution, the lasciviousness of the background characters, the motley crue of the elite with their predisposition for dissolution. This was illustrated well. So in fact, the overall tone (of the singing) and the tone (of the stage) were bang on.

Despite how beautiful everything comes off, especially with the addition of the dancing and the waving of fans to symbolize the steaminess of this decadent world, there is a lack of chemistry between Villazon and Dessay. Dessay started out strong, playing the wide-eyed girl about to enter the convent before being whisked away by de Grieux's character. But when she appears later as a the bourgeois woman of the world, I felt she lacked credibility and stage presence. My interest waned and I found the remaining acts punishing to watch.

Again, I am spoiled but I truly feel an opera's success nowadays can depend on the acting and chemistry of the leads. Joan Sutherland couldn't act, she could sing and she had a certain presence. If her facial expression always remained the same, there was still an emotion in her voice. Villazon sings and acts with heart. Dessay moving from the innocent to the femme fatale simply doesn't work. Her voice is beautiful but I couldn't feel her voice the way I could Villazon. Manon is a powerful character but Dessay simply doesn't offer what her role demands.  While Villazon comes through, his role in many ways doesn't benefit from Dessay's lack of credibility. We hear his pangs of love, we feel his heart beating in confusion for Manon but when we see Dessay's Manon, we wonder why he would feel a certain way. I felt sympathy for his character and not hers.

This production on the surface is faithful to Massenet's Manon (the singing, the staging) but when it comes to the heart of the matter, I found it lacked.",1240444800,9,2264,4.839793281653747
2281672,5,B0009E76IG,"I recently purchased the DVD of Jules Massenet's opera Manon as performed by Natalie Dessay and Rolando Villazon at the GranTheatre del Liceu in Barcelona.  In a word, this is a superb performance by the lead singers.

Dessay has a beautiful voice and uses it with intelligence and her portrayal of Manon is about as human as you can get.  She is a consumate actress, able to express the many-faceted traits of the heroine.  Dessay moves easily about the stage, singing naturally and thrillingly throughout. Her interpretation of Manon is very believable.  She is one with Manon, living and breathing as thouigh she is Manon herself.

Villazon sings a thrilling Des Grieux.  His voice has a bright ring to it and he interprets Des Grieux convincingly.  I am not at ease with Villazon's vocal technique and I wonder how he gets such good results since he seems to sing inwardly rather than pushing the voice out. But it is a time honored adage that says: ""You don't argue with success!"" and Villazon has earned his place among the top tenors of the operatic world legitimately and justly.

Dessay and Villazon do not sing/act Manon and Des grieux - they ARE Manon and Des Grieux. They are involved with each other, interacting at every level of an interrelationship between lovers. You laugh with them and you suffer along with them. They draw the audience into the very vortex of their turbulent experiences.  This performance will leave no one unaffected.

This a well sung performance by and large, though not all the singers are up to the demands of their respective roles - Manuel Lanza is unable to hit the high notes squarely on the head during the climaxes - he almost does but falls short.  Sadly, Samuel Ramey as Le Comte Des Grieux has seen better days. The voice is wobbly and unfocussed. His was a stellar career and he was worthy of the acclaim he received in his vocal prime. The supporting cast contributed to the overall high standards of the performance as does the orchestra under the baton of Victor Pablo Perez.

Certainly, this is a DVD well worth owning and I recommend it highly to all opera lovers. One would be hard pressed to find a better duo than Dessay and Villazon in this opera.",1239580800,5,2209,4.677002583979328
2281673,4,B0009E76IG,"If you've been agonizing over which version of Massenet's delectable Manon to get, the Bastille Opera's take with gorgeous staging and costumes in traditional style with the superlative soprano singing of Fleming or the delightful singing duo of Dessay and Villazon in the Liceu production, along sashays Netrebko with Villazon in a stunning Blu ray recording directed by Vincent Paterson which looks very much a winner. Personally I prefer the first to the second not just because of the singing but sorry, McVicar's staging just leaves me cold. The Netrebko/Villazon version is time transposed from 18th century France to 1950's Paris but is rather enchanting and works well. The staging is visually interesting and the costumes marvellous especially in the promenade scene where some of the ladies seem to walk out of the pages of Vogue magazine and the high definition video shows this in all its color and splendour. But it is the singing/acting that wins hands down and the chemistry between this famous pair. Netrebko arrives Amiens in Act 1, a breathless starry-eyed Lolita enthralled by the prospect of glamour and as each Act unfolds she changes --a teaser in baby-doll lingerie frollicking in bed with Le Chevalier(Villazon); a glamour queen trophy paramour strutting the Concourse with rich playboy Bretigny for whom she has deserted Le Chevalier,a tornado in red beseiging Le Chevalier's sanctum in the abbey to get him back, a fur clad platinum blonde bombshell ala Marlyn Monroe urging him to risk all at the gambling table and a pathetic, bedraggled prisoner dying in Le Chevalier's arms. Anna as Manon,is a throbbing tour de force. As for the well known arias, Villazon scores with his  wistful ""En fermant les yeux"", dreaming of an idyllic life with Manon whilst she is barely able to look him in the face because she's already thinking of leaving him for a richer life with Bretigny. This scene fairly drips with pathos. His ""Ah fuyez douce image"" is sung with as much passion as pain. The lighter weight numbers are very enjoyable too; the rueful ""Adieu, notre petite table"" by Netrebko and the frothy, joyful ""Je marche sur tous les chemins"" in which she celebrates her glamour queen status at the Concourse. I could go on. I love this disc. The only reason for not giving it a perfect score is a slight problem with balance in the audio at times( for ninety percent of the time  the DTSHD 5.1 sounds very good, I hasten to add)and I suppose recording a live performance is always a major challenge for sound engineers. Still it is a small flaw that will not affect your enjoyment of this disc at all. And enjoy it you will.",1238716800,5,2645,4.849557522123894
2281674,5,B0009E76IG,"Opera lovers easily put off by ""updated"" stagings of traditional 19th-century operas might well be missing something very special here, for this 1950's revisioning of Massenet's glorious 'Manon' is a true showcase for the incredible talents of Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazon. Netrebko in particular is simply dazzling, undergoing astonishing physical makeovers from act to act, and conveying the varying emotions of her character convincingly and with complete naturalness. You simply cannot take your eyes off of her. All this while singing with her usual luscious, creamy tone. Just gorgeous. Villazon is all intensity and passion, reaching his zenith in the Saint-Sulpice scene, where he and Netrebko all but tear the scenery apart. They have charisma to burn, and the chemistry between them is palpable. The rest of the cast is nowhere near their level, but they do a serviceable job in their supporting roles. Though this co-production between the LA Opera and the Staatsoper Unter den Linden in Berlin (where this performance was taped in the summer of 2007) sets the action a couple of centuries later than Massenet had intended, it nevertheless has some very clever and brilliant moments, but traditionalists will not be happy.  Any doubts about the production, however, fade into the background whenever Netrebko or Villazon is on stage.

The Blu-ray 1080i/60 PQ is stunning all around, and the AQ has great presence and dynamic range. (I listened to the 2-channel stereo PCM track.) Very highly recommended!",1238457600,2,1521,5.2809917355371905

2281688,4,B0009E76IG,"I have seen a number of Manons in my life; the most captivating one for a long time has been Bidu Sayao, but now there is a new champion - Natalie Dessay. She captures the vital essence of Manon in a performance full of nuanced charaterization and beautiful singing. The David McVickars production takes a little getting used to but that passes. Dessay and Villazon simply brush it off. The quintessential moment comes in the duet at the end of Act One: at the idea of living in Paris, the reaction of an estimable colleague-competitor of Dessay's is, ""Oh, that would be nice.""Dessay's reaction is that of teenager (as Manon really is),  more like, ""Oh-my-God, what I've always dreamed of, do you really mean it?"" - all summed up in the way she gasps, ""Paris!"" Rest my case. Her whole performance is like that. Aside from the eccentric set, there is one other blot, the worn vocalism of Samuel Rainey's Comte de Grieux. Otherwise, go for it; this is the Manon we've been waiting for!",1232323200,5,983,4.617142857142857
2281689,4,B0009E76IG,"What a difference blu-ray makes!  If there was ever a production of an opera to want in stunning high defintion, it may be this one, and DG does not disappoint.  The colors leap off the screen and the beautiful cast, costumes and scenery are just a feast to behold.  The DTS-HD track is very good for the most part, occasionally the singers feel too close and there are occasional balance issues, but it is excellent for the most part.

There has been a lot written about this production.  I saw it in LA a few years ago and was blown away then.  I'm very grateful to see it here on BD/DVD, but I feel there's something missing.  As amazing as Netrebko and Villazon are, there is something missing from their relationship here in this production.  I feel like the McVicar production (also with Rolando) with Dessay shows much more tenderness and intense subtlety in the first sparks of romance when Manon and Des Grieux first meet.  I'm not discounting the validity of the awkward teenager to passionate affair vision in the Patterson production here, but I think for me the McVicar approach is preferable and ends up being a bit more touching in the ending demise.  Of course, with Patterson's vision of Manon's life as a movie starlet, a touch more superficiality may be what he wanted!

In any case, this BD of this opera is a feast for the eyes and ears.  If you know Netrebko's singing, you know that the lightness and fluidity of tone required by Manon are not her strong suit.  If that is not an issue for you, then have no reservations and enjoy!

Dessay can demonstrate such a range of emotion from naivete to femme fatale.  Villazon has performed many times with Dessay and their comfort with each other is apparent.  I remember many operas where the soprano and the tenor sang directly to the audience; today great acting is also a part of the opera.  The stage directing is the only thing that could use some improvement.  The placement of the chorus often seems confusing and of no particular value to the story.",1212278400,8,633,4.566371681415929

Villazon sounds a bit strained in places (like his act III aria `Ah! fuyez, douce image' - this was the last production he participated before his half year break) but in general his singing is beautiful, like the outstanding rendering of his act II aria `En fermant les yeux'. They are both excellent actors. All the other singers are very good, with the exception of Sam Ramey whose vibrato is quite painful to my ears (but luckily his role is short).

Dessay is an athletic Manon, very engaged physically and vocally.  She is well matched by Villazon at his most serious.  The louche brother is vividly performed by Manuel Lanza.

Anyone open for innovation and theatricality will have a marvelous time with this Liceu prodcution.  Robert Carsen and Willy Decker have made me wary of overtly reimagined stagings, but this is a brilliant take on a familiar old friend, combining music, dance and story theater into the kind of inspired spectacle that Peter Hall has made famous over the years.  Dessay and Villazon are as good as one could hope (as is Manuel Lanza as Lescaut), but remarkably, they're only part of the picture here.  Usually I find a lot of stage business distracting to my enjoyment of the singing (which is, arguably, the raison d'etre for opera in the first place), but in this case the goings on are such an integral part of the world that director David McVicar has created, that I feel it actually enhances what the singers are doing.  (And thankfully, McVicar knows when to cool it, calm things down and let the singers shine.)  Bottom line, this is a vibrant and imaginative take on a repertory classic that is both respectful and innovative, and a very welcome addition to the DVD choices out there.",1201478400,22,1185,4.7560975609756095

By far every drama has its star actors, the performer that is most identified as the embodiment of that character. Placido Domingo as Otello, Pavarotti as La Boheme's Rodolfo, Jonas Kaufmann as Carmen's Don Jose. This is by far the perfect chemistry of Dessay's Manon and Villazon's des Grieux I have every viewed! Intimate and truthful. Dessay's Manon was captivating, in-depth, engaging and as believable as I had experienced in an opera before. Her ability to portray the complexity of Manon's character from the innocent girl to fallen woman was just breathtaking. Her portrayal in the beginning of the young girl who was so full of life and expectations was so refreshingly honest and believable. You found yourself feeling that same innocence of first love, all the hope and giddiness, all of the vulnerability of Manon when she falls in love with Grieux. You feel her absolute perplexity and confusion when he is kidnapped and returned home to his family because she was not good enough to marry a man of his station. Even when she joined the life of a mistress you still felt the sadness in her voice that even though she was now able to enjoy the good life, it really wasn't her at all, she wasn't really happy. You felt her steely resolve to reclaim her lover when she discovers he was going to take a vow into the priesthood and be lost from her forever. She would snatch him from the bosom of God! Equally mesmerizing and captivating was Rolando Villazon's portrayal of Grieux. Sometimes accused of ""overacting"" his characters with melodramatic, bigger than life gestures and explosive stage presence Villazon was none of those things and was without question, unmasked and completely the man he was portraying: in love and devastated by the life he felt trapped in. His portrayal was stripped of cliche and utterly exposed: intimate, optimistic, tender, compassionate, and loyal to Manon to the very end even when that life would destroy them both. The gambling scene was by far his finest performance when he wrestles with his feelings between doing what he hated the most, gambling, and his love for Manon and his inability to refuse her anything she wants from him. She eggs him on and on and he pleads with her not to ask of him this one thing, but she is relentless until he finally gives in. The final scene when he does everything to find her after her arrest was so heartbreaking as you realize how far they had both fallen; she from that wide eyed innocent young girl and he in his inability to make the tough choices when it meant they would be safe and together. In the end it would kill her, and for all intents and purposes, him. I couldn't get this performance out of my mind for quite a few days afterwards.",1411603200,,2808,4.674747474747475
