8161425,5,B000LC4DBO,"Ill admit the movies are a bit dated. But their old movies what do you expect. The quality is due to their age nothing more. They are all english dubed and don't have subtitles which is a lot easier than reading subtitles.
Bottom line: they're all great movies which would be a pain to try and track down individually. I recommend purchasing the bundle it will save you a lot of heartache and monney then to try and buy for example ""samurai reincarnation"" alone.
They have a nostalgic feel to them. And they are a great collection.",1341187200,,531,4.484536082474227
8161426,3,B000LC4DBO,"ST. CLAIR DVD multi-packs are reasonably priced, and offer decent quality video/audio transfers of unrestored public domain material. Discs are single-side recorded, plastic storage cases fairly sturdy, movie liner notes appear on box's back cover and most DVDs include bonus items.

Source material for the SAMURAI COLLECTION 9 Movie Pack is less than ideal. Washed-out colors, grainy transfers and dubs from well-used tape are too apparent.

HIGHLIGHTS:

THE CHINESE CONNECTION-- Two words: Bruce Lee. Young man seeks revenge on a Japanese gang for the death of his teacher.

DUEL OF THE IRON FIST-- Gang member goes into hiding after a restaurant brawl leaves his father dead. When he returns a year later his own gang has allied with the one that committed the murder and now both mobs are after him. Shadowy film with lots of one-on-one action.

FISTS OF BRUCE LEE-- Actually, this is a ""lowlight."" Bruce Lee wannabe Bruce Li (ahem) may have Lee's fists, but that's about all. He stars and directs (ineptly).

KUNG FU: THE PUNCH OF DEATH-- For one reason or another, two martial arts schools engage in deadly battle. General theme is vengeance avenged. Lots of action, naturally.

SAMURAI REINCARNATION-- The beheaded leader of a failed 17th Century Christian revolt resurrects as a demon and leads a group of reincarnated ninjas in a fight for vengeance.

Featuring Jackie Chan, Lee Van Cleef and Sho Kosugi, it contains ten completely different Kung Fu films.
