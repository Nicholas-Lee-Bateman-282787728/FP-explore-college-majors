8356250,5,B0028IMO1U,Excellent demonstration of building this rifle. Shows how to complete important details with clarity. The man building it was extremely proficient and knows all the ends and outs.,1385337600,2,179,5.428571428571429
8356251,4,B0028IMO1U,"Seems to have everything needed to complete a rifle. Toward the last 1/3 of the DVD details and steps were being left out. All and all a really great instructional DVD, a lot to be learned. I refer to it often.",1369267200,2,210,4.146341463414634
8356252,4,B0028IMO1U,"This is a nice introduction to the overall process and should make it clear to anyone that this is nothing to attempt half-heartedly.  Hershel shows you the major steps and, more importantly, that there is a great deal of hard work involved.  I have yet to build a rifle myself and I wanted a good introduction to the process. This film (two dvd set) was just the ticket. Long story short, I will need to do more homework before I tackle something this involved.  The subject matter was covered just well enough for a beginner like me, but I'm sure more experienced folk will find it interesting too.  The fact that this video is derived from what appears to be a PBS series or the like is obvious from the way that the video jumps from segment to segment.  This is also an older series so I'm certain that has a lot to do with the video quality and the way it was shot.  I'm happy with my purchase.  Good luck to all.",1359849600,,918,4.271676300578035
8356253,5,B0028IMO1U,"The House family is obviously an extremely talented clan. Hershel has a down home way of instructing one to build
a piece of American history. I would buy again, instructional videos by Hershel House.",1310947200,,200,4.911764705882353
