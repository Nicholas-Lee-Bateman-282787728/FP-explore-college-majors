Some wonderful acting, especially by the guy who tries to pull the scam; but the bank workers are all good, their respect but not exactly warmth for their boss (Cushing) coming through; but despite that, the way they back him at the end, his appreciation for it, is so touching, and so well done. And it's a Christmas film! In fact, they could have probably turned that up a notch.

I really don't think much of living in these times, everything's screwy. But stumbling upon a pic like this, while going through youtube in bed one night, is definitely one of the plusses.",1489968000,,602,4.574074074074074
8633316,4,B00HLT0YKO,"In this 1962 black and white thriller a man impersonates the company detective and informs the bank manager his family is in grave danger in order to rob the bank. This is 8o minutes of mostly dialogue, there is little action, but still the suspense is there.

If you have trouble understanding quick speaking, tight jawed English accents you might have problems understanding everything that is said. There are no subtitles.

At times this movie is part of the Icons of Suspense Collection, which contains: Stop Me Before I Kill! / Cash on Demand / The Snorkel / Maniac / Never Take Candy from a Stranger / These Are the Damned. Amazingly that price is usually less than this DVD by itself.
It is an interesting part of the Hammer films collection.",1404432000,,749,4.666666666666667
8633317,4,B00HLT0YKO,"If you enjoy this tightly knit U.K. heist flick (3 1/2 stars) featuring the great and underappreciated Peter Cushing, don't pay an exorbitant amount for Sony's single-release DVD-R-- it's cheaper to buy their 'Hammer Icons of Suspense Collection' (2010), which includes 'Cash on Demand' and five other worthwhile thrillers on 3 fully mastered discs.",1392249600,6,349,5.481481481481482
