2510302,5,B000E97HTE,"I first saw this performance on PBS, while looking for Christmas concerts.

Strange as this might sound, I had never heard Renee Fleming.  I had seen several photos of her and assumed (wrongly!) that she was just another opera singer they were promoting to sell her recordings in other markets.

It was an eye-opener.  Renee Fleming sings with precision and ease, and every song demonstrates that she has worked hard to acquire the education and training to make her singing seem effortless.  On top of this, she sings with warmth and feeling, seeming to be enjoying the concert as much as those assembled in Mainz Cathedral, and we who watch it on dvd.

The only negative thing I would say is that I hated her dress--it simply was not at all flattering to her.  But her good looks, her immense talents, her enthusiasm, and the beautiful Mainz Cathedral all contributed to make this a Christmas concert that is a gift to all who see and hear it.  After some of Renee's brilliant embellishments, the camera even catches the face of one of the musicians whose face seems to indicate that she has just heard some superlative singing--that she was there to bear witness to an exceptional performance.  Once you see it, I think you will agree--it's a magic moment--a magical Christmas concert.",1168128000,15,1288,4.7657657657657655
2510303,5,B000E97HTE,"And the result is a DVD filled with luxurious singing and devotion. Moreso than on her album named Sacred Songs as well Renee Fleming sings with elegance and poise, giving even the most rehashed evergreen a life of its own. What I love most about this DVD is its simplicity. An old school diva in a beautiful, classy dress rather than a girl strutting around trying to be sexy. Her voice has a velvety warmth I miss in nearly ever other full lyric soprano we have these days. Genuine emotion is pulsing through her singing, she's an artist willing to take risks, never just a voice but always an artist. This DVD is excellent for the holidays ahead and I'll be playing it more than once for I'd rather hear Renee Fleming perform these pieces than yet another pop singer.",1166832000,23,770,4.507142857142857

8107547,5,B000E97HTE,Interesingly Renee Fleming's Christmas program at Mainz Cathedral is quite different from the production that was on television several years ago.  I much prefer the DVD to the television program.  Having lived in Mainz for three years and having visited the cathedral before it's stunning reconstruction I am thrilled to have more footage of the inside of the Dom as well as a slide show of the city of Mainz.,1296259200,3,410,4.8428571428571425

8107549,5,B000E97HTE,"I bought this for myself for Christmas and love it! there's not much more I can say that hasn't been said, but wanted to make it an even 10 for Renee!

What is also great besides Renee is the gorgeous Mainz Cathedral itself. I recommend the ""bonus features"" almost as much! Amazing history of the 1000 (!) yr old Cathedral told to us (via subtitles). We also see the history of the boys choir and it was all so interesting.

Renee of course, is still the star and with the fabulous acoustics the sound is great. You'd not believe such a small orchestra could sound so big. The best in my opinion was Renee's version of ""Ave Maria"", done live and perfectly, then a 2nd time as a music video of sorts, in the ""bonus features"". There she is just as good and twice as gorgeous (green works well for her). I found myself hitting ""repeat"" a few times. Such a beautiful woman with a beautiful voice.....must be nice.

Another highlight is ""Oh Holy Night"", Renee hits the high note and then everything stops while it echos...goose bump time! What a crime it's only a ""Christmas song"". Anyway if only a minor fan or new to Opera, you'll fall in love with it - and Renee.",1199664000,6,1161,4.3657407407407405

8107551,5,B000E97HTE,"Rene Fleming has been one of my favorite sopranos for several years now.  As a voice teacher and an accompanist, I find her voice contains that rare combination of depth and brilliance, solidity and flexibility that is a rare and illusive. Her CDs and DVDs are never more than a short reach from my stereo or television.

  When you combine her singing with my favorite time of year, Christmas, and my favorite European destination, Germany, you have a treat which cannot be surpassed.  Her voice, soaring through the Cathedral of Mainz, is like a precious stone in an exquisite setting, and provides a muscial experience that transports me to that place and time at every hearing.",1180224000,11,681,4.836206896551724
8107552,5,B000E97HTE,"Wonderful and beautifully filmed concert in the incredible Mainz Cathedral starring Renee Fleming accompanied by two choirs. The singing is fabulous and Renee is obviously vocally giving everything she has to the performances. She also seems to really be enjoying the ability to hear her voice soar in the cathedral. ""Laudaumus Te"", and ""Ave Maria"" are the standouts.
Renee also looks fabulous with her classical beauty and designer gown.",1175299200,7,438,5.36231884057971
