458266,5,6302418828,"Anything and everything that could go militarily wrong, does...  This is a wholesome comedy the whole family will enjoy.
It leaves you in stitches.  It's a very touching movie.
Andy Griffith, Don Knotts, and Jamie Farr are definitely in their field here, true wholesome comedy at its best.  The other stars are great, as well.
Enjoy this one.  Buy it.  Watch it with the whole family.  Again and again.",970790400,,402,4.753623188405797
458267,5,6302418828,"What a great classic comedy.  Being from the south, I can honestly see some of my neighbors in this film.  I think I have most of the lines memorized.  Griffith is outstanding, as is Knotts.  If you have a comedy  collection started, this is a must addition.  If you want to start one,  this would be a great starting point.",945043200,3,324,4.3
458268,4,6302418828,"Griffith is exceptional as a country boy going through boot camp. He has an irrepressible good humor and optimism that is intolerable to his drill sergeant, Myron McCormick. McCormick even goes so far as to make Griffith  permanent latrine orderly (PLO), a title which Griffith accepts as if he  had been promoted. It is old fashion slapstick at its best. Especially for  those who have been in the service, it will be a delightful evening's  entertainment.",925257600,,457,4.973684210526316

458529,5,6302418828,"The story starts out with a laid-back scene from the back woods of Georgia. Rather reminds you of ""Sgt. York"". Will Stockdale (Andy Griffith) is being drafted in the U.S. Air Force. There he makes fiends with new inductee Benjamin B. 'Ben' Whitledge who informs Will that it is the infantry that does the real fighting and that the Air force is just their helpers. So the two of them set out to be transferred to the infantry. We see how simple it is to transfer.

No Time for Sergeants brings back all the sights and sound that you are familiar with the military, especially the induction process. They even included the military attitudes. What makes this so funny is the proximity to reality. You have met these people in all walks of life. From Irvin S. Blanchard (Murray Hamilton), who has a bad case of the ROTC. To Major General Eugene Bush (Howard Smith) that unwittingly gives an inspiring eulogy to (I am not saying).

One fun part of watching the movie is not really the movie but recognizing all the actors, some from the original play others look like a retrospect of the ""Andy Griffith Show.""

The situations hopefully are not as easily recognized. Be sure to watch the PLO (permanent latrine officer.)

458975,5,6302418828,"An old saying goes, ""You can take a boy out of the country, but you can't take the country out of the boy.""  A Georgia farm boy named Will Stockdale, portrayed by Andy Griffith, proves the truth of that saying when he gets drafted into the peacetime Air Force.  His sergeant is told that Will is a draft dodger (an untrue rumor) and puts him on latrine duty to keep him out of trouble.  Will does such a good job that his sergeant makes him P.L.O. (Permanent Latrine Orderly).  Will is delighted at first, but his trusting nature and country simplicity soon get his sergeant into trouble, and he must pass his classification tests within a week or his sergeant will be in even bigger trouble.

Of course, Will runs into all kinds of mishaps along the way, not the least of which is his interview with the psychiatrist.  By the time it is over, the psychiatrist is almost in need of psychiatric help!  This scene, in my opinion, is an all-time cinema classic.  Don Knotts also appears in a short but memorable scene as a corporal administering a manual dexterity test.  Stockdale passes the test, but in a very unconventional way!  Personally, I think Knotts should have been given the part of Ben Whitledge (Will Stockdale's sidekick), because he and Andy Griffith worked so well together.  Also, he was a much better actor than Nick Adams.  Be that as it may, Griffith's performance alone makes the movie worth watching.

Here's an interesting bit of trivia.  Andy Griffith and Don Knotts first met when they appeared in the Broadway version of ""No Time For Sergeants"".  They hit it off immediately and became the best of friends.  A few years later, Knotts heard that his friend was going to star in a new TV series in which he played a small-town sheriff.  He immediately called Griffith to talk to him about it, and he asked him, ""Don't you think Sheriff Taylor needs a deputy?""  Griffith liked the idea, and thus Deputy Barney Fife was born.",1452038400,,1946,4.607558139534884

many years ago, after the movie was released. This is the funniest movie in it's time, and I'm not won for many black and white movies. This has always been rated in TV guide as a 4 or 5 star movie and now that they have remastered it, it is a joy to relieve all the classic lines that Andy Griffith pulled of. The scene between him and Royal Demming (sp) the physiatrist is so amazingly done. How they did that whole scene without an edit is amazing............also Don Knotts role was a classic line..........what an amazing ensemble of actors that were in this movie!!
For all of you who know the lines, I'll leave it as this..........P.L.O. !!!!!  Hilarious!!!!!",1421884800,,812,4.449664429530201

Myron McCormick as the hapless Sergeant, Murray Hamilton and of course Nick Adams all add their flair for visual comedy that has remained a classic film. The pacing and timing are from another era. Note cameos of Don Knotts and Jamie Farr (everyone is so young). Following the wonderful film ""A Face in the Crowd"", Andy shows he is capable in different roles.",1420156800,,416,4.791666666666667

460114,5,6302418828,I'm so happy that this classic comedy is preserved on DVD.  I hadn't seen it since I was a child and it was showing at a drive - in movie.  I even forgot that it (like most movies at the time) was filmed in black and white.  It looks great in the DVD format and it is a perfect copy.  The movie is still funny and it showcases Andy Griffith's humor.  There's even a cameo of Don Knotts way before Mayberry.  The price was just a bit more than renting and free shipping.  What a deal.,1402963200,,483,3.96875

Yet, I found it interesting, because this type of thing went over well with military families. The service men of the time were big on jokes about the ""brass."" I think this is probably more of a ""guy's movie.""

I did like the guy that was a buddy to Andy, but Andy has never been the comic to me. He seems more of a straight man. Maybe I watched too much of Mayberry RFD, or The Andy Griffith show.",1402790400,,576,3.8813559322033897
460117,4,6302418828,"I first saw this gem more than fifty years ago as a young child.  It was funny then and it is still funny now.  In many ways, there is an endearingly charming innocence about the characters and the way the story unfolds into a 'modern' morality play.  If you have an older relative who has ever served, they may particularly enjoy some of the WWII/Korea era military service backdrops and jokes.  This movie is notable in many ways, but the one that grabs my attention fifty years down the road is that this is one of only two movies that have ever successfully used nuclear explosions as a punchline (the other being Dr. Strangelove - a far darker and more cynical film).  This is a black and white movie - do not attempt to adjust the picture. The transfer is not perfect, but works well enough to be viewable on modern televisions. Holds up well over repeated viewings and can be seen by any member of the family at any age.",1402617600,3,927,4.39766081871345

460200,5,6302418828,"Georgia hillbilly Will Stockdale is drafted into the U.S. Air Force and shipped off to boot camp. Here his Sergeant discovers that he is not only good-natured to a fault, he is also very good at cleaning washrooms, and doesn't resent the chore, so he is designated as PLO --- Permanent Latrine Orderly. When a superior officer learns of this plum assignment, he informs the Sergeant that Stockdale must be properly classified and prepared to ship out with his classmates. Otherwise the Sergeant will get a new assignment --- as PLO.

What follows is a continuous serious of hilarious incidents, including the psychiatrist (""do you hate your momma?""), and the eye test (""they was a bunch of strange words, like 'gnixl'""). Perhaps most memorable because of its eventual significance was the first pairing of Andy Griffith and Don Knotts, who is the Manual Dexterity trainer. Asked to solve a simple metal puzzle, Will un-bends then re-bends the pieces, at which the bewildered Knotts wails ""but he did it all wrong!"" This movie is loaded with laughs and sage advice (""the Air Force is like a lake. You're in a canoe, the Colonel is in a canoe, the Captain is in a canoe. You're in the smallest canoe on the whole lake. Don't make waves!"")

Broadway stage actor Myron McCormick is Sergeant Orville King, whose well-ordered life in the military is radically upset by the well-intentioned hick from the sticks. McCormick preferred stage acting, but was tempted by the good money into a few movie roles, including as Paul Newman's pool-shark accomplice in the stark drama The Hustler. In No Time for Sergeants his role is strictly for laughs, and he delivers like the true professional he was.

From the college comedy circuit, to Broadway with the stage version of No Time for Sergeants and then into the movies, Griffith rose steadily through the ranks of comedians until he achieved virtual immortality with the long-running Andy Griffith Show. His character in No Time for Sergeants is closer to Gomer and Goober Pyle than it is to the Sherriff Andy Taylor who became so familiar to television audiences. In this film you can see the origins of Griffith's lasting fame as a good-old-boy comedian.",1394150400,2,2194,4.89247311827957

The only other main character, the barracks sergeant, could have been played by many other actors of that time, and in my mind I always picture someone like the Great Gildersleeve in the role.  He had that ability to look and act exacerbated that was unparalleled.

Seeing Don Knotts in his role and remembering now how long Griffith and Knotts were together makes me long for the ""good old days"".  Our youngsters had never seen the movie and they laughed all the way through it.  They asked if we would buy them the DVD for their birthday and, of course, we will.

It is a ""good"" wholesome family show that we can watch without the worry of improper innuendos and suggestive comments that you get with so many other shows! So when we saw that there were other movies that Andy Griffith played in, we were very excited and ordered several of them. I guess we just had the perception that Andy Griffith would have the same values and similar characteristics in all of his movies as he did in his role as Andy Taylor. However, we were disappointed when we found out that he plays roles of people with quite different characteristics in other movies. The roles that he plays in other movies includes characteristics of self-centeredness, pride, arrogance, loud-mouthed, vagrant and a rebel. All of these are basically quite the opposite characteristics of the image that we had developed of Andy Griffith.
I guess this move wasn't too bad but the role of the person that Andy Griffith played was that of a backwoods, naive person that had very little ""learnin"". Not sure that he had been off the farm very much and his father did not want him to get drafted in the military so he had not ever showed the draft letter to his son. Then he got arrested him as a draft dodger. Once in the service he got into some trouble and was punished by having to clean the latrine but was told it was a privilege and honor. And of course since he was so naive, he believed it. Like I said, I guess this move was OK and there were some pretty funny parts in it. But not really sure that I could give it a very high recommendation. It was OK just not all that great.",1387756800,,1652,4.401960784313726

Based on the 1954 BEST-selling novel by Mac Hyman, this story was adapted into a 1955 stage play where it originally opened on Broadway and ran for 796 performances.  Andy Griffith was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor.  In 1958, it was then made into this delightful movie with the same trio of actors intact:  Andy Griffith, Myron McCormick, and Don Knotts.  They and their supporting actors were perfectly cast and had great comedic timing.  And for those of you critics who think that the comedy was over-the-top, well, it had to be or the comedy would not have worked.

The DVD quality is excellent.  The black and white film is sharp and crystal clear.  Audio is also crystal clear.  English subtitles are available on this DVD, although it is not obvious at first on the DVD itself.

460391,5,6302418828,"If you are enlisted in, or ever were enlisted in, the military I recommend this.  If you are enlisted in, or ever were enlisted in, the Air Force, then you MUST see this.  It is absolutely hilarious!  It will especially help if you are from the south, and most especially if you are from Georgia.  (I happen to be from Georgia, was enlisted in the Air Force, and still am in the military, so this movie can't get enough stars from me!).  Don Knotts makes a brief appearance and it's been rumored that this is what prompted Andy Griffith to get him on his show a few years later.  But make no mistake, this is an Andy Griffith vehicle and showcases his comedic talent!

If you ever heard his ""What it was, was football"" routine, think that except in a military type setting.  I don't think you can go more than 2 or 3 minutes without laughing out loud.

I have a very good friend that I was in the Air Force with and he and I get together about once a year for an ""Andy Griffith-on.""  We are both huge fans of season 1 - 5 of that show and when our wives and kids go out of town, but we're stuck at work, we get together one night, pop some popcorn and watch as many of the shows as we can... sounds boring to some, but like I said we are huge fans of the show (it's wholesome, funny, and entertaining).  For the last few years, we've watched this movie as a lead-in to the shows, but were stuck with an old copy I recorded on VHS once when it was on T.V.  Now we have the DVD and couldn't be happier.

If you want to watch something that is truly funny... not the crude funny that is so prevalent today, but something that doesn't include cursing, etc. yet will still have you in stitches, this is it.",1369785600,3,1701,4.118181818181818

I consider myself decently aware of the classic films, but I had never run across this one until Christmas of 2012.

This movie is a classic funny movie that still makes me laugh to this day.  Features the first pairing of Don Knotts and Andy Griffith, although Knotts plays a minor role in the movie, but still in a funny scene.  You will see a young Jamie Farr as well and others that you will recognize in later TV roles.

Currently most so called comedians rely on vulgarity and shock value to get smirks but few really have a sense of humor. The most common form today is ridicule and making ""straw man"" fake stories. There is none of that in the movie. Its completely safe for children.",1359072000,,474,4.851851851851852

460593,5,6302418828,"I don't give many 5 Star Reviews to movies but this is one that truly deserves it!  This film is simply hilarious from start to finish, chronicling the the life and times of Will Stockdale (Andy Griffith) as a backwoods inductee in the U.S. Air Force.  This film set the tone for later efforts in a similar vein such as ""Gomer Pyle USMC"" but this one comes across as more genuine and even funnier.  The ""upsetting of dignity"" concept is played to perfection in this film by Andy Griffith. Second Lead Myron McCormick as Sgt. King comes across as a truly pathetic soul with lots of human frailties rather than the typically overbearing Sergeants you seen in most movies or TV Shows.

Also look for Don Knotts in a small but memorable role opposite Griffith in what I beleive was their first on-screen pairing.  Knotts appears as a Corporal administering a classification test to Andy complete with hilarious results!  Even then, you can witness their on-screen chemistry that they would play to great and enduring effect a few years later together on the ""The Andy Griffith Show"".

Whenever I saw it I remembered the part about the toilet lids. What reminded me of that was as I was talking to my son about how I went into the bathroom and stepped up to the toilet to pop the lid up. I know there is no way to do that but I was thinking also of the trash can that is a pop up lid and I got mixed up. Must be age.

Andy plays a hillbilly from Tennessee named Will Stockdale who finds himself suddenly drafted into the army.  The humor - for the time - and the timing rivals His Girl Friday for fast paced.  And you had better pay attention or you will miss some of it.  After watching this you will also know where the idea for Gomer Pyle USMC came from.

Don Knotts is in there too and does a fine job and though his part is too brief, the chemistry between he and Andy is obvious.

460711,5,6302418828,"Will Stockdale (played by Andy Griffith) is an innocent, good-natured, not-too-smart backwoods Georgia hillbilly, who's been called up in the draft. However, his father tore up the notice letters before Will could read them, because he didn't want his son to go to ""them big towns"" and get laughed at. It backfires; Will is arrested for draft dodging and carted off against his father's will into the Air Force anyway. Being Patriotic, Will doesn't mind, and enjoys himself thoroughly, at the expense of driving just about everyone he encounters half-crazy. His penchant for naivly causing trouble, his overly-friendly attempts to be nice to everybody, and his total failure to grasp the simplest things drives one seargeant in particular, who wants to live a ""quiet, peaceful life"", to the edge of insanity by the time the film is done. By that time, an oblivious Will has managed to exasperate just about every official figure in the Air Force, unintentionally evade everyone's best efforts to get rid of him, and put the entire atomic bomb research program, and the reputation of his base's general, at stake. The Air Force finally, in a last-ditch effort, transfers him and the one real friend he makes to the Infantry (which is what he wanted all along). By then, I can almost guarantee you will be wiping tears of laughter from your eyes because this film is just plain HILARIOUS!

The film starts a bit slow in the first ten or so minutes, but from there it just takes off, containing one hilarious exchange of dialogue and outlandishly funny situation after another. You can't help but to fall in love with Private Stockdale, one of Griffith's most endearing characters. As he bumbles his way through the induction process (""that eye test feller seemed a mite angry. And that sign had some weird words like Glumpl, Ilp, Bxotnk...."")gets lost while airborne (""Is this the Gulf of Mexico?""), and goofily misinterprets what is punishment and what is promotion (""I've been in here all week; I'm Permanant Latrine Orderly!"") the ""carnage"" from his many mishaps piles up around him; however, Will continues through all of it oblivious, unscathed, and still goofily grinning away, much to the delight of us the viewers. The luckless Sergeant King (""why do all the nuts get sent to MY barracks?""), played by Myron McCormick, is a character we also sympathize with, as he is usually the one who has to clean up the ""carnage"" after Will has messed something up yet again. However, you can't help but to wish the bad luck on him, just to see his quietly agonized, pathetically humerous facial expresions and reactions again, especially as they get less subtle and more frantic as the film proceeds. The cast also includes the pint-size Infantry-Loving, short-tempered Ben Whitledge, who is Will's reluctant best friend; he is played by Nick Adams. Adams and Griffith play off each other so well in this film; Ben usually trying to set Will straight about the army life, and Will trying to get Ben to loosen up and enjoy himself every once in a while. Their misunderstandings of each other's intentions are even funnier than when they both get along on the same page (""We're deserters, Will! I'd Rather be a dead Hero than a Live Deserter!"" ""I ain't a-gonna drop you no matter WHAT you say!"") Finally, several other great character acters round out the ensemble, from high-strung Manual-Dexterity tester Don Knotts (""There's only supposed to be one way of doin' it, and he didn't do it!"") to would-be bully and troublemaker Murray Hamilton (""Women officers; that's one thing I don't Cotton to!""), to slowly-devolving-into-exasperation Psychaitrist James Millhollin, who probably suffers the greatest and most comical ""defeat"" at Will's hands (""We will not talk about transfers and we will not talk about my mother. We will talk about what I want to talk about!!!!"").

Considering that it is almost free of any and all profanity and other such problems(the psychatrist's totally ignored question ""Sex- what do you think about it?"" is the only thing remotely resembling inappropriate innuendo in the entire movie, and I think one general uses one D--n), and, quite frankly, because it's so darn funny, I would highly recommend this movie for all families. It is truly a classic, and one of the best works Griffith ever did.",1336953600,5,4317,4.953103448275862

460843,5,6302418828,A much overlooked comedy from the time when movies were funny by being funny not by being mean and cynical.  This early one from Andy Griffith was a 180 degree swing from his debut film (A Face In The Crowd) and afforded him a chance to begin honing his down home comedic stylings (already a hit in comedy albums - who can forget 'what it was...was football' or 'Romeo & Juliet)that he would later bring to perfection in The Andy Griffith Show.  It truly is a comic gem and a great family film.  His supporting cast (a surprising Nick Adams exhibiting light comedic timing that he would never again display and the incomparable Myron McCormick who manages to be as sullen faced as a Bassett Hound and hysterically funny at the same time) ably frame the country bumpkin with a heart of gold and common sense to boot.  Andy Griffith has kept a sly eye on his audience and show business itself ever since and is one of this country's unsung National Treasures.  He knew 'funny'...still does probably...thanks...Andy...for this one...and for giving us Don Knotts and Ron Howard...and of couse...yourself.,1285200000,5,1100,4.768421052631579

460976,4,6302418828,"Many years ago my family went to the drive-in and saw the real ""No Time For Sergeants"". In it, Andy Griffith created the character who has been basically the same guy in three different settings. He started out in ""Sergeants"" as Private Will Stockdale, a lovably doofy Air Force enlisted man. The Most Famous Hillbilly In the World changed his name in the 1960's for the small screen as Sheriff Andy Taylor in ""The Andy Griffith Show"", and he was still the same guy in a different uniform. As a footnote, that series also kicked off the career of Ron Howard, the most unpretentious brilliant movie director who ever lived. Anyway, Stockdale/ Taylor morphed into an unlikely Atlanta lawyer named Ben Matlock. But as Bob Seger might have said, he was still the same. How do you take the same personna and keep it going, with only name and wardrobe changes? Here's a secret--it's necessary for your name to be Andy Griffith. Ignore all the other posts here who confuse him with Jim Nabors and Gomer Pyle. This is the original model--""...thuh best danged private in the whole danged Air Force."" Unfortunately, my only copy is a VHS tape that I grabbed off the air from a cable superstation, commercials and all. But I dread the day my machine either croaks and can't be replaced, or worse yet, eats the tape. Is it too much to ask for them to do up a DVD version?",1267574400,,1359,4.551020408163265

Previously, I had ordered a DVD from another site.  The other site had billed their DVD as being Andy Griffith in NO TIME FOR SERGEANTS.  It was priced nearly three times higher than the Amazon DVD and was more like an old, very brief TV promo for the movie, with Andy Griffith giving highlights of the story.

460980,5,6302418828,"what exactly is the criteria these days for Warner Bros. putting films on DVD versus dumping them into the Warner Archive? In the last year this is one of the very rare pressed classic releases by Warner - or anyone else for that matter -while films that could have been part of a very sellable noir set such as Highway 301, Rancho Notorious, and Nora Prentiss get cheap burn jobs. I just don't get it. But I digress.

This is really worth watching for two reasons. It is obviously a blueprint for the popular spin-off TV show ""Gomer Pyle USMC"" starring Jim Nabors in the part played here by Andy Griffith, and it is interesting to make comparisons between the two. Secondly, it really is part of a tribute to the great yet unappreciated range Andy Griffith had as an actor. Here he plays the yokel as well-meaning good guy, anxious to serve his country but just too friendly and green to fully comprehend the discipline he is under in training camp. He  thinks it is an honor when the sergeant gives him latrine duty, and his version of the 21-gun salute when the latrine is inspected is truly hilarious. Watch this and then watch him play the yokel as bad guy in ""A Face in the Crowd"". Fortunately, ""Face in the Crowd"" got a proper release before this burn on demand craze got started. Of course, the long running TV show ""The Andy Griffith Show"" demonstrated that Griffith could play the wise man, being friendly when he could and tough when he had to be as he policed a largely friendly and peace-loving local population with individual residents that could get rowdy and mean as well as the occasional visitor with nefarious intentions.

However, I really appreciate a solid comedy probably more than anything else simply because there are so few great ones out of the many, many comedies made. Don't get me wrong, there are a bunch of good comedies out there, one's that have one or two great moments, but to be a true classic there has to be at least one laugh out loud moment and at least several other very clever quips.

To me classic comedies include this, Four Rooms, A Night at the Opera, Duck Soup, Slapshot, Way Out West, Get Shorty, Big Man on Campus, Dr. Strangelove...well, you get the idea if you're a comedy fan.

It absolutely astounds me more people haven't seen this movie.  In my opinion, this has the funniest scene in any movie ever.  There are several laugh out loud moments in this one scene...almost unheard of and there are a few other gems in the rest of the film as well.

If you enjoy comedies and have never seen this film, you my friend, are in for the treat of your life.  This is the best comedy movie ever made and Andy Griffith performs flawlessly.  Why this has not been released on DVD flabbergasts me...it's like putting a cover over the Mona Lisa...why hide a classic?

Quite honestly the story is somewhat plodding and, by today's standards worthy of some editing.

I have no love for the slam, bam, thank you ma'am approach to film making current, and generally seek out films of this era but - so disappointed here!

One redeeeming character was the excellent Myron McCormick as the sergeant. A joy for every moment he was on the screen.

The induction scenes in this movie are pretty much the same as they were when I enlisted in 1976.  I didn't think things were that funny at the time, but everytime I watch this movie these days, I just plain howl with laughter.

If you are one of the folks who love this movie, I'd like to suggest the Dean Martin/Jerry Lewis classic SAILOR BEWARE.  It's just as hilarious as NTFS.

I've seen a few VHS versions of NTFS on eBay, that also offer a backup copy in DVD format.  However, they are expensive, and I cannot vouch for the quality of the DVD.  It all depends on the quality of the equipment used to make the copy, and the quality of the VHS source tape.  I think I'll just save my money and wait for a first-rate publication of the movie on DVD.

The auditioners thought that his appearance and accent were acceptable but then, well, they just didn't know....  so they asked Andy to wait in the office while a few other applicants were evaluated.  In the office a secretary asked Andy what he did so in explaination he went into one of his night club monologues for her.  Passers by heard the goings on and stopped their activities to watch also.  Shortly the passageway was blocked with an impromptu audience.  This so impressed the auditioner that Andy got the part.

Don Knotts, even though his part is small, is outstanding

i don't know who it was, but the shrink in this movie with andy griffith is also outstanding, that whole scene will have you rolling in your chair.  However, this movie really needs a DVD release, with if we were lucky, deleted scenes included, that would be awesome.

everything else is out on DVD so whats the holdup?",1128556800,11,452,4.475609756097561

There is disagreement over the aspect ratio of this release. Some say it was released in 1.85. That may be true, but I still maintain that alteration occurred at some point (because of the noticeable cropping.

Nevertheless, having the movie is better than not having it. Anyone wanting to see a timeless classic, a film that you can watch with your kids, with a script and acting being so good that the humor shines through 50 years after release, OWN THIS NOW.

--------------
Update 3 July 2010:

Well this movie is DONE. Warner Home Video just released the DVD, and they changed the aspect ratio to appease the low-end consumers and thus destroyed the movie.

Nice job. I am therefore changing my review to one of HATED IT. Yeah, the movie is one of my favorites, however the last thing I want to do now is encourage anyone to waste their money buying a poor product from Warner.

OK, I guess if you have never ever seen the film, I might say to get it---the movie is a classic. Better yet, Just borrow a copy and save your money.

The handling of this has been a complete disaster. What a shame.

461114,5,6302418828,"I remember watching this when I was a little girl.  I have both a copy of the play on stage and the movie in my collection.  No matter how many times I watch this movie I still laugh out loud whenever I see it.  And no kidding, this IS my favorite movie!!!

Since I'm a southern girl from Georgia (born in 1956), I really appreciate the southern humor portrayed in this movie.  My brother, sisters and I could probably recite most of the lines from the movie as it was one of our family favorites too.  And if you think the movie is funny, you should read the book by Mac Hyman.  Of course the movie is a little different than the book, but the book is great and gives more background on Will and his family and his ""first few difficult days of military service"" including little rubber hammers and popsicle sticks.

I love the P.L.O. (""it was my aim to make it as clean as that room where they gonna cut out your heart""...""You really ought to get up off the sergeants back. Why I bet he's best danged Sergeant in the whole danged Air Force!"") and  ""Aair-ah MEN!"" scenes.

And these:

Maj. Demming: I think that I would rather live in the rottenest pigsty in Tennessee or Alabama than the fanciest mansion in all of Georgia. How about that?

Will Stockdale: Well, sir...I think where you wanna live is your business.

Stockdale: ""I don't hate my mother. She's dead.  Died when I was born. I do have this uncle I hate.  Well, I don't really hate him.  Ya see he wants to wrestle the mule ever time he comes to visit.  The mule gets wore out, he gets all wore out..""  Demming: "" Did I ask you about your uncle?""  Stockdale: ""I thought you wanted to talk about hatin' people."" ...""I don't like just any girl. You see there's this girl back home her hair ain't no longer than a hound dog's""....

[reading from inductee questionnaire]

Benjamin B. Whitledge: You ever had R.O.T.C.?

Will Stockdale: No...., but Irvin did! Close to a year of it. He's so 'ornary I think he still might have a touch of it.

Benjamin B. Whitledge: No, Will. R.O.T.C. ain't a disease, it's trainin'...Reserve, Officer's, Training...,uh,..Corporation!

Stockdale: ""I done took the eye test.  That doctor was a might flustered. Words like Bulipzig and MYGOLP...""

:::""that was an eye chart! You were suppose to read the letters one at a time.""

Stockdale: ""don't make not sense neither way""",1120608000,5,2362,4.496470588235294

461126,5,6302418828,"One of the very best comedies I have ever seen and surely in the top ten of all time!  The casting is superb, with Andy Griffith (Will Stockdale) as the lead, who plays a country bumpkin military recruit, all the way down to the psychologist (name escapes me here) who psycho-analyzes Stockdale during his boot camp sojourn. Don Knotts is also superb as the manual dexterity analyst. This is also their very first instance of acting together.

Every scene is such a crackup in this movie it would be hard to decide which one was the funniest.  One that I really liked is where the two MPs are running up the steps of the ""Purple Grotto."" A typical inter-service fight has broken out inside, which they are there to quell. Stockdale is blissfully walking out down the steps (after his sergeant and a comrade, who is out to do him harm (played by a very young Murray Hamilton, of ""Jaws"" fame - he was the mayor) have tried to get Stockdale drunk, but with no success. The two MP's ask Stockdale, ""Is this the Purple Grotto?"" To which he replies ""Yes.""  He then adds, as the MPs are dashing inside, ""Now there's two thirsty fellows for ya!""  Words can't describe it.

For an old B/W movie, with no nudity scenes and not even a curse word, this production will show everyone what real characterization and movie directing is all about. Six stars in my book.",1102032000,13,1353,4.502040816326531

461135,5,6302418828,"This is one I have had in my collection for years. Great fun from start to finish. Griffith is funny, but so are the co stars(Adams, McCormick, Knotts, etc.). Inspection scene is classic as is the pyschiatrist sketch. McCormick is hilarious as the tired old Air Force Staff Sgt. who assigns Griffith job as permanent latrine orderly(PLO!). Andy Griffith show fans will recognize that this was the first on-screen teaming of Knotts and Griffith. This one is full of memorable lines such as Pvt. Whitledge(Adams) telling Stockdale(Griffith)""Honest, Will, sometimes I wonder why they took ya in the draf at all!"".  Fans of MASH will recognize a young Jamie Farr in latter half of film. This film came out during a post Word War II and Post Korean War America and there is even a subplot thrown in involving the Yucca Flats testing site. I have never seen the tv version or the broadway play, but this film is just downright funny and all fans of Griffith or anyone that has been in the military should watch this one.",984182400,14,1014,4.696629213483146
