Eduardo Yez's appeal escapes me, but he clearly is the darling of stage and screen in Mexico. This big guy plays the older brother to three siblings, the youngest of which is a teenage girl who falls in love with (and is impregnated by) a married man with three daughters older than she. The vile husband of one daughter kills his father-in-law and then later, when they discover she is pregnant...his young girlfriend.

The grieving brothers swear revenge and decide to court the three young women, then break their hearts.  Yez plays Juan, Jorge Salinas plays Oscar and Pablo Montero plays Franco. These three fellows pair up with Adela Noriega as the much-abused Sofia, Elizabeth Alvarez as fun-loving Jimena and Nora Salinas as the poetry-loving Sarita.

 Their evil mother Gabriela is played with domineering strength by Diana Bracho, while Guillermo Garcia Cantu plays the unapologetic Fernando: married to Sofia, bedding Gabriela and the murderer of sweet young Libia, played by Sherlyn.

As we can expect in a telenovela, the tables are turned and the three young men fall head over heels for the three young women. Then the fun begins. This condensation omits a number of key scenes that are alluded to later, has choppy editing, poor acting, a confusing round of Who's your mama? and a lame, contrived script.

Other than Salinas, for whom I was watching, everything else was a let-down, so this one will never be a favorite. Lo siento....",1407542400,,1526,4.906614785992218
