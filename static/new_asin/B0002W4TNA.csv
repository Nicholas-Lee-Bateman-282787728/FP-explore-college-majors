2128586,5,B0002W4TNA,"This set is just about perfect, even more so when compared to the previously-released, ""Worst of Ed Wood"" box set, this set fixes everything that was wrong with that one.. firstly, the name of that other set, which always just rubbed me the wrong way.. sure, they're ""bad"" films, but they're also some of the most entertaining things you'll ever sit through, and whether they're entertaining in the way Ed intended or not, he is the one who made the films, and now this DVD company is making money off his work, so it just seems really wrong for them to have a slam like that in the actual title of the box.

From the packaging-- pink angora with octopus tentacles-- to the extras, this set is what that other set should have been, and at about half the price! The sixth disk includes a very informative documentary, but not just that, it has a huge amount of special features, including commentary on the documentary and Ed's long unavailable first short film, and commentary on that too.. and galleries of additional archive footage, etc.. This is truly a special-edition kind of treatment, and not at all what you'd expect for DVD's of this particular kind of film. Then there is a second 2-hour documentary on the Plan 9 disk.. this documentary was the only special feature on the previous box, and if you watched it by itself you would probably get the feeling that it's just scratching the surface.. but now in this new box set it provides a perfect companion to the other full documentary.. the two of them together truly make a worth-while viewing experience, because they each often tell opposite versions of the stories of Ed's life, and interview different people at different points in their lives.. Watching the two of them together, in combination with Tim Burton's Ed Wood film, you can really start to form your own opinions on Wood in an informed manner, rather than just spitting back one other person's views.. All together these features give you depth rarely seen even on big-budget special editions of major films.

And, maybe more importantly than all of that, this film includes the 5th of Ed's ""major films""-- The unofficial sequel to ""Bride of the Monster"".. the film never released in Ed's lifetime because he didn't have the money to get it developed: ""Night of the Ghouls"". Without that film, the other box set was just kinda incomplete. I'm totally happy with this package.. can't think of anything bad to say about it, except that I feel kinda sorry for the people who paid $90 to get that other box set. Oh well, live and learn.. don't feel bitter.. get this one too. And while you're at it, grab Tim Burton's Ed Wood.. which is really a great film in it's own way, and a very good DVD edition, and long over-due for release on the format.

And remember: future events such as these may affect YOU in the future.",1099180800,75,2844,4.638888888888889
2128587,5,B0002W4TNA,"Honestly this collection is one of a kind.  If you're a fan of wasting money on bad/campy movies then you will love this!  I love it because despite the un-seriousness this movies present, if you watch Burton and Depp's movie you will understand the emotion and care Ed Wood truly put into these movies.

Honor and respect one of Hollywood's tragic icons of a bygone era by buying this collection.  They're extremely stunning just because you can tell they tried so hard despite having no money and no idea what they were doing.  It makes one really admire Ed Wood.",1098403200,11,565,4.61
2128588,5,B0002W4TNA,"I got this in the mail the other day, and what a great set! For the price it costs to buy ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" and ""Bride of the Monster"" together, you get ALL the films of Ed Wood -- minus the pornographic ones he slunk down to making at the end of his career -- in one convenient box. (Note: These are NOT newly rereleased DVDs, just the same ones from Image Entertainment all bundled together at a low price.)

Ed Wood is labeled the ""Worst Director of All Time"", but that really isn't true. These movies not only feature Bela Lugosi in his final roles, but they are also great entertainment in a ""so bad it's good"" kind of way. For a movie to be the worst movie of all time, it can't have any entertainment value whatsoever. I'd rather watch an Ed Wood movie than a Freddie Prinze Jr. movie any day.

The picture on these DVDs is grainy, and that can be a good or a bad thing depending on who you are. For me, it's a good thing because it helps to hide some of the weaker special effects.

Amazon.com doesn't list the special features, so I will list them for you: theatrical trailers for ""Glen or Glenda"", ""Bride of the Monster"", and ""Plan 9""; FLYING SAUCERS OVER HOLLYWOOD -- the excellent two-hour retrospective documentary about the making of Plan 9. And you get a bonus DVD, ""The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood, Jr."", containing audio commentary by Bela Lugosi Jr., ""A&E Biography""'s interview with Brett Thompson and Mike Gabriel, the Sci Fi Channel's news coverage of the world premiere, a collection of outtakes and behind the scenes footage, films of the Ed Wood Reunion at the Palm Springs Film Festival and the biggest Wood parade at the Hollywood premiere, galleries, and Ed Wood's rarely seen 23-minute first film CROSSROADS OF LAREDO.

P.S. As of this review, Amazon.com says it will take two to four weeks for this item to ship. That's ridiculous. I ordered this set from another online retailer, and I got it three days later.",1098316800,126,1952,4.490140845070423

It is a good single source for most of the movies he had a hand in (often as writer AND producer AND director, and sometimes even as an actor!).  The quality of the prints from which the discs were made is the primary limiting factor, and because none of these is on the AFT's Top 100 Films of All Time, that could be better, but we have what we have.

2128594,5,B0002W4TNA,Ed Wood has made what are considered some of the worst movies in Hollywood.  And they're all here in this boxed set!,1362009600,,116,4.2727272727272725
2128595,4,B0002W4TNA,"I don't know how I became acquainted with Ed Wood's work. I imagine the Tim Burton film had something to do with it, but I can't remember not being fascinated by Wood and his films. Decades after these films were made, I'm still amazed that a group of people collectively thought any of these films were even marginally good. If delusion is a talent, Ed Wood and his stable of ""stars"" were talented beyond belief.

While Wood's work is consistently terrible, there is something that is oddly endearing about his films. You can tell he tried. He had a vision, just no talent to make that vision a reality that anyone wanted to see.

As for the films in this set, Plan 9 From Outer Space is the real winner here. Plan 9 is probably Wood's best known film and there's a reason - it is hilarious. There is not one competent thing done in this film. The story itself is nonsensical. Something about aliens invading Earth to reanimate dead humans to spook living humans. I don't know...something along those lines. The aliens are inexplicably prissy and irritated by human kinds' stupidity (You're STUPID! STUPID! STUPID) and our blood lust (you know, because we invented The Bomb). Why they came to a planet full of humans is beyond me, but they're here so get used to it. The acting is also terrible. No one in this film is good. No one. That is fairly amazing because there are some legit actors in this film who did real honest to goodness acting in mainstream films and television shows. I don't know if those decent actors just started sucking because they were in Wood's orbit and got pulled into his gravitational pull of terrible, but no one in the cast could pull off even the most simple line of dialog. A lot of the film's notoriety comes from the very obvious unrelated, silent footage of dearly departed Bela Lugosi that is strewn throughout the film. I don't know if people were just more trusting in the 50s or if they weren't aware that old footage of dead people could be put into films, but I don't know why Wood ever thought he was fooling anyone. It's painfully obvious Bela's footage has nothing to do with the actual story. Despite all this, or rather because of all this, the film is a hoot. It's one of the few Wood films I actually watch on a semi-regular basis because it's just that hilarious.

The other films in this set, Glen or Glenda, Jail Bait, Bride of the Monster and Night of the Ghouls are also good for a laugh but some are hard to sit through. Jail Bait is Wood's attempt to do some kind of gangster/noir film. To be honest, I've only watched it once because it is boring. Dolores Fuller, Wood's then-girfriend, is the lead actress in this and she's just painful to watch. Even in a Z-grade film, you wonder why someone didn't pull her aside and tell her to take one acting class. She went on to have a successful career as a songwriter so perhaps she was aware of her own lack of acting talent. The other films, Bride of the Monster and Night of the Ghoul, are in the same vein as Plan 9. The only difference is Lugosi was actually alive when Bride of the Monster was filmed but I can't say that his acting was any better than it was in the silent footage from Plan 9. Glen or Glenda is probably one of the better known Wood films besides Plan 9 because of Wood's well known affinity for dressing in women's clothing. That said, I have mixed feelings about Glen or Glenda. I think Wood was slightly ahead of his time tackling a subject like cross-dressing but his execution of his expos (or documentary?) is just bizarre. So bizarre it's almost not fun to laugh at. You could tell Wood felt passionately about the subject (oh boy, did he!), but his attempts to make the audience feel sympathy for people who cross-dress is stymied by the weird stock footage and shots of Lugosi muttering nursery rhymes and acting as some sort of puppet master who controls the world. In the film, Lugosi is credited as ""The Scientist"" despite the fact that he does not perform any scientist-like tasks in the film.

The final DVD in the set is a documentary entitled The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood Jr. This wasn't even made by Wood but it's still bizarre. The bizarreness is mainly due to the fact that Wood surrounded himself with some folks who were, shall we say, a little left of center. They're all probably good people, just weird as weird can be. Age has done nothing to dilute that weirdness either. The documentary itself is informative but it tries too hard to be artsy or avante garde or something like that. Interviewees share their positive and negative stories about Wood, but some tend to go off on tangents that should have been left on the cutting room floor. One of the more interesting interviewees is Bela Lugosi, Jr. In case you didn't know, Lugosi, Jr. is not a fan of Ed's. At all. He makes it crystal clear that he thinks Wood used his father (which is true-ish) and exploited him when he was at his lowest point in life. I don't know if I'd agree with that entirely since Wood did give Lugosi work when no studio would touch him, but Wood's film were crap and I doubt that's how Lugosi wanted to cap his career. As such, I can certainly understand Lugosi, Jr.'s point of view.

Overall, this is a decent box set and is certainly reasonably priced. I got it as a birthday present one year and I couldn't be happier with it. There are a few films that are just too bad to watch, but most scratch that bad movie itch if you tend to get them. Ed Wood certainly was a visionary. A visionary of what I'm still not sure of, but it's too bad he didn't live long enough to see that his films live on and people are still interested in him.",1355097600,2,5679,4.4202483285577845

2128599,1,B0002W4TNA,"Appropriately, I am writing this during a thunderstorm. Ed Wood loved thunder and lightening. He treated stock film of lightening as a special effect.

Well, folks, I do not think ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" deserved its Golden Turkey award for the worst film of all time. That award should have gone to ""Night of the Ghouls,"" Ed Wood's last film. But Wood clearly deserved his title of worst director of all time.

Here's what's in the box, if anyone has a strong enough stomach for it. If you do buy the box, don't watch them through one right after another: only your worst enemy should experience such torture.

The Haunted World of Edward D. Wood, Jr. This is a biography of Wood which was done a couple of years before Tim Burton's film starring Johnny Depp. It includes a lot of the people who worked with Wood, as well as the major movie fans and memorabilia collectors who have turned him into a cult figure, and ""Plan 9"" into the cult classic it has become. There are also appearances by Bela Lugosi's son (or is it his grandson?) who sounds pretty darn negative about Wood. Interesting to speculate where this guy was when Wood was keeping Bela alive in spite of his drug habit and fascination with death. Wood was a loser, but he was such a thorough optimist that his incompetence becomes a poignant ache in watching this movie. One wonders how many people are in this movie because they are exploiting the public's fascination with this mega-loser. But then, the movies Wood made could be considered exploitation themselves, so I suppose it is fitting in a way. Ironic to hear the prices paid for lobby cards and one-sheet movie posters at the time this film was made. EBay could tell you what they go for today, but I'm betting it's quite a bit more. The highlight of the film is a view of the museum-like home of Forrest J. Ackerman, the man who made movie and pulp fiction fandom into a career.

Glen or Glenda? This was Wood's first completed film (fragments exist of an old western he never completed), and actually might be considered his best. It would be classed as ""film noir"" if it were not considered a cult classic. The story is clearly autobiographical, about a heterosexual man who is a transvestite. The story is told with the frame of a policeman's visit to a psychiatrist to get background information, so the shrink also has the opportunity to tell the story of a transsexual as well, and to compare that patient to the transvestite. There is a nightmare scene that makes a useful point with mockery about ""sugar and spice and everything nice"" about girls and ""snips and snails and puppy-dog tails"" about boys. It is also explained that his mother wanted a girl and dressed him in girls clothes as a child. Fine. But Bela Lugosi's role as the ""puppet master"" is not only unnecessary, it is degrading. Stripped of the Ed Wood attempts to use Lugosi, this might have been a reasonably competent mental health film.

Jail Bait. Not about young girls, which is how we used that term when I was a kid, but the cover of the DVD says ""She's a good girl...to leave alone,"" although I could not figure which female character is indicated by that line. It's a story of crime, and there's a father and a sister (the ""good girl,"" perhaps) who lament the bad boy's decay, but the twist about the father being a plastic surgeon and what he does with a criminal who comes to him for a change of identity is just plain bizarre. The whole thing makes very little sense, but probably was not expected to. And no laughs to speak of, either.

Bride of the Monster. Originally Wood was going to call it Bride of the Atom, but decided that wasn't scary enough. Again, Bela Lugosi, doing something as close to ""Bride of Frankenstein"" as they dared, with Tor Johnson, a 400-pound former wrestling star, in the Igor role. What can I say? Flimsy sets, even flimsier plot, and no discernible point. This is the one that included the movie prop octopus that couldn't move unless it's ""victim"" moved its tentacles for it, which got such a laugh in Tim Burton's film. Why the octopus? Because Wood had some stock footage he wanted to use.

Plan 9 From Outer Space. Not really any worse from a technical standpoint than some of those Buck Rogers shows on TV at about the same time this was made (late 1950s). Ironically, the one that got the Golden Turkey award for worst movie of all time was actually one of Wood's two best, up there with ""Glen or Glenda."" The only difference is, this had no point, the way G or G did. It seems to give something of a nod to ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" with the aliens saying they must destroy us because we are violent, but the ranking alien loses his temper pretty quickly, too, and shouts ""Stupid! Stupid!"" at the humans who confront him.

Night of the Ghouls. This is my candidate for the Golden Turkey. Central to the story is a fake medium who is obviously only in it to bilk grieving widows and widowers of their money. It may amuse you to try to guess which phony-looking effects were created by the medium and which were supposed to be taken seriously (i.e., created by Wood). Again, I can't find any point, except of course to knock off ""Night of the Living Dead."" Unsuccessfully; it's not even scary, let alone gross and disgusting, the way ""Living Dead"" was.",1337558400,2,5309,4.528675703858186

2128612,5,B0002W4TNA,"As other reviews have pointed out, the real charm in Ed Woods output during the 50's is the fact that, unlike the other dozens of notable B-movie directors of the time, Wood tried SO HARD to get his movies done, and put a lot of himself in each one.  The results are films bizzare enough that we laugh at them, but I never personally could say he was a terrible director, so much as he was a man who actually got films DONE under unbelievably difficult circumstances.

Let's face it, most directors get things like a budget, sets, actors, studio time, editors, special effects artists, etc.  Ed Wood had NONE of those things, but still COMPLETED most of his movies.  Its got to take some kind of talent to at least get that far.  The results might be something we laugh at, but if I had to write a film in 3 days, then film it inside the next 7, I can't say it'd be any better.  Asking for a excellent film in 10 days is like asking Michaelangelo to sculpt David using one can of Play-Doh.  Its just not gonna happen.

But even while his films are uninentionally comedic, they do display tons of heart, personality, and a genuine love of movies, and because of that the movies are charming and fun, typically free of the boring spots found in most low budget 50's flicks.

This box set has the 5 movies Wood wrote and directed in the 50's, and every one of them is worth seeing more than once, as you just miss too much goofy stuff the first time around.  Here's the breakdown:

GLEN OR GLENDA?:  Woods first film, and its quite an experience.  The plot, as it stands, is basically about Glen (played by Ed Wood himself) and his trepidation about confessing his love for dressing in womens clothing to his girlfriend.  Of course, its framed inside the lecture of a psychiatrist explaining Glen's case to an extremely interested police officer investigating the suicide of another transvestite.  That itself is framed inside Bela Lugosi's odd ramblings as ""the Scientist,"" a God-like character who offers random, hilarious narration (""PULL THE STRINKS!"").  The movie as a whole is unlike anything I've ever seen, its basically a plea for societal tolerance among those who are transvestites, but it sounds and feels like an educational film they'd show school children in the 40's.  Plenty to enjoy, including a 15min dream sequence my wife was able to artistically interpret better than I was.  My personal favorite moment is when the psychiatrist narrator refers to going to bed by saying its someone's ""nightly visit to Morpheus, the god of sleep.""

JAIL BAIT:  Lest anyone think this is a naughty movie, I'll tell you right now the Jail Bait of the title is an illegally possessed gun.  Basically, a rich doctors kid gets messed up with a robbery, shoots a retired cop working as a security gaurd, and the trouble just rolls on from there.  As this movie is a bit more down to earth than Woods other features, its the most competent film on this set.  You don't need a lot of special effects or fancy sets to pull off a basic crime drama, so it works well enough.  There are plenty of Ed Wood trademarks though, including the same bizarre, circular dialogue (during this movie my wife said, ""Ed Wood doesn't ever use different words for things, does he?""), some truly bad acting, and a god-awful (but, sadly enough, accurate to the times) black-face minstrel show used to both pad out the film and establish that the building the two men are about to rob is indeed a theater.  My favorite moment is during the robbery, where one man tells the security guard to give them the combination to the safe and the guard responds (while visibly standing right next to the safe) ""What combination? What safe?!""  Not as good/bad as his other films, but still plenty to enjoy.  The DVD itself is oddly quiet, though, we had to max out our TV's volume to hear it and even then, we had to be very quiet to catch everything.

BRIDE OF THE MONSTER:  This one is a total classic, so much to love.  Bela Lugosi is a mad-scientist living in a house by a swamp.  He spends his time strapping people to a dentists chair, putting a colander on their head, and ""irradiating them"" (turning on the dentists examination light) in an attempt to create a ""race of atomic super-men.""  The bride of the title is a kidnapped female reporter, the monster of the title is either a rubber octopus that doesn't move (super funny when the actors get ""killed"" by the monster by screaming and pulling the tenticles over themselves) or more likely Tor Johnson playing Lobo, the giant, mute (though he can scream) assistant of Bela who eventually turns on his master.  I'm not sure who the monster really is, since Bela explains away Tor as someone he found in the Himilayas, but if the Octopus is the monster, then who's the bride supposed to marry?  I digress...  This is one of Wood's best movies, and a great introduction to his body of work.  It clearly had more money behind it than the others, Bela and Tor are a scream, and the first half is plenty quirky, but actually holds together well enough.  I love the way it just slowly unravels more and more til it just falls apart completely in the last 15 minutes.  You can watch this one again and again, its so funny.

PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE:  Ed Woods most famous film, its also my personal favorite and one that any movie fan should see at least once.  The plot involves aliens from outer space (humans in skating skirts) coming to earth and raising an army of zombies (three, to be exact, though had Ed pulled off an actual army of undead, he woulda beat Romero by almost a decade) to scare us humans from developing a bomb that explodes particles of sunlight.  Lofty aspirations for any movie, much less a movie funded by a Baptist church (no, really!), Ed Wood fails to deliver on every bit of it, and somehow it all comes together with unbelievable comedic timing.  Seriously, had someone made this movie intending it to be a comedy they would be hailed as a genius.  But, no, Ed Wood really was trying to make a sci-fi movie with a social message about our uncontrollable lust for firepower.  I'm not going into specifics about all the flubs and goofy stuff, mostly because every 30 seconds or less something hilarious happens, but if I had to pick a favorite moment, it would probably be towards the end when the aliens and humans finally come to blows inside the aliens spaceship, the alien fights back by ripping controls off HIS OWN SPACESHIP and hurling them at the humans.  Again, its a must see for any movie lover, and a film that practically begs for repeat viewings to catch all the errors.  Its so incredibly awesome.

NIGHT OF THE GHOULS:  This one wasn't actually seen by anyone til 1984 when someone finally paid the processing fees that Ed could never scrape up himself.  As a result, its a very crisp film print.  The story is a sort-of-sequel to BRIDE and PLAN 9, as not only is Lobo back, but Kelton the Cop appears in this film (and makes direct mention of both the events of BRIDE and PLAN 9), and the detective that kept scratching his head with his own revolver in PLAN 9 returns as a special investigator the LAPD apparently has for the paranormal.  He's sent to investigate a ghost sighting at the house from BRIDE that has since been rebuilt (""exactly the same"" according to Criswell, the films narrator, though its obviously not even close).  What he finds is a phony spiritualist named Dr. Acula (yup, this is where that one episode of Scrubs got that from) who's tricking people into giving him money while he tries to raise their dead loved ones.  This movie is not as good as BRIDE or PLAN 9, but there's still plenty for Wood fans to enjoy.  Personally, I like Dr. Acula's girlfriends ghost ""costume"" that consisted of a white dress and a blonde wig.  Except the woman was already blonde, and the wig did nothing to change her appearance.  Also, for MST3K fans, Tony Cardoza, star of ""Skydivers"" and ""Red Zone Cuba"" has a bit part as one of Dr. Acula's accomplices.  And his character's name is Tony.  Oh, Ed...

Aside from the 5 movies, you also get two documentaries about Ed Wood, one retrospective on the Plan 9 disc that deals mostly with that movie and its cast.  Also a seperate documentary with other interviews from people who knew Ed Wood.  Both are interesting, and the people interviewed offer sometimes very contrasting pictures of who Ed Wood was.  In any event, they're worth watching for fans of his films.

Hopefully this box will go back in print soon enough.  You can still get the individual movies on DVD, but the box is such a value and if you like Ed Wood its a smart purchase.  A great buy for fans of movies bad enough to be strikingly entertaining.",1330128000,3,8733,4.545745361484325
2128613,5,B0002W4TNA,"I consider a movie as being truly bad if the only feeling it elicits from me is boredom. Say what you will about Ed Wood's films, one thing you can never say is that they're dull. There are many films with top-notch production values, so-called better acting, etc., and they're not worth a second look.

Wood was definitely in a class of his own. He didn't remake films or try to copy other directors. He came up with his own concepts and even dared to venture into what was then untread territory with something like GLEN OR GLENDA? Actually, everything that ""legit"" sources say is bad about Wood's films is exactly what makes them enjoyable. I particularly like the way his films capture their era in a non-glossified, raw kind of way. It's a pleasing change of pace from the more polished, A-studio product that always gets the attention. It's kind of like the old 45rpm records - sometimes you got tired of the top ten hits and wanted to hear the flipside. You found you got to like that track too.

Ironically, this much maligned filmmaker who longed for respectability in his day finally got his due years after his death. He has acquired ultimate, cult level status - something many directors today only dream of achieving.

This set of five films - three featuring the great Bela Lugosi - plus an absorbing documentary is an entertaining excursion into Wood's world of B-movie fun. Believe me, you could do worse. Much worse.",1317945600,,1433,4.6561264822134385
2128614,5,B0002W4TNA,"I don't believe that Ed Wood deserves to be called the worst directer is history. He certainly made so bad their good films. But,I believe he just didn't have the money to make grade A films. He took what he could get his hands on and made movies. Simple as that. Some are bad and some or the weirdest things you will ever watch. I put Glen or Glenda in this category.

This is a great place to start with your Ed Wood collection. This collection includes his most famous bad movie, ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". Bela Lugosi is in 3 of the films in this set. Some say Ed Wood used Lugosi but i think they had a real friendship. I think they worst movie on this set is ""Night of the Ghouls"".

The picture quality of these films are top notch. All the films are in Dolby Digital Mono. Although, The Haunted World of Ed Wood is presented in 2.0 Stereo.

Anyway, if you ever wondering where to start with Ed Wood then buy this. You will not be disappointing.

The films may or may not hold up, but if you're an Ed Wood fan then this box set is an absolute MUST to own.  None of the discs have any extras (save for their respecive original trailers), however, ""P9"" has a terrific 2-hour documentary titled ""Flying Saucers Over Hollywood: The Plan 9 Companion"" which features interviews with surrviving cast members, other filmmakers, critics, etc.  In my opinion, the best part features a modern-day discovery of the original run-down Hollywood movie studio/set where ""P9"" was actually shot.  Co-star Conrad Brooks walks inside and surveys the shambled remains and fondly recalls his personal memories.  Very nostalgic and incredibly moving.  The last disc, ""The Haunted World Of Edward D. Wood, Jr."" is the best part of the set, and worth the price just for this 112 minute documentary film (it can be purchased as a stand-alone, but if you're interested enough in Wood's films, you'll obviously want the box set anyway).  It's also packed with amazing extras, more interviews, behind the scenes, making-of's, ultra-rare(!) lost footage, etc.  There are also some very clever (and a bit startling) Easter Eggs to be found, but I'll let the viewer find them on their own.

You of course realize it's predominantly men who design your clothes, your jewelry, your makeup, your hair styling, your perfume!"" - Ed Wood narration from Glen or Glenda.

Ed Wood is certainly the auteur saint of naive surrealism. Everything he touched had his indelible stamp of personality all over it. More accurately, everything he touched oozed with Woodianisms.

However, his zany enthusiasm was short-lived. Night of the Ghouls is a depressing example of a very fatigued Ed Wood. Even before that, both Jail Bait and Bride of the Monster seem sub-standard Ed Wood, even if they do bear his mark and are manna for his enthusiasts.

Still from Glen or Glenda (1953)If  Ed was sadly showing early hints of what was to inevitably come in those two films, then he was at his inspired, bouncing off the wall zenith in both Glen or Glenda and Plan 9 from Outer Space.

It was mix-master forever up his ass, quite dead film critic Michael Medved who unintentionally rose Ed and his magnum opus, Plan 9 From  Outer Space from the shallow grave of obscurity into cult nirvana when he awarded Ed and his film as the worst film and director of all time.

Despite Medved's smarmy condescension, he should be forever thanked for posthumously catapulting Ed into the spotlight.  Medved's sole purpose for living was to play John the Baptist announcing Ed's coming. All the crimes and misdemeanors of criticism that came after are (reluctantly) excused in light of this important moment in history (alas, Leonard Maltin has had no such redeeming moment for his crimes).

Still, Medved was slightly off. It's Glen or Glenda, Ed's directorial debut,that deserves the accolades, a mountain of raining ticker tape to propel this little trannie misfit into well deserved fame and fortune. There is much appreciated surreal irony in Medved's accidental canonization of Saint Ed. It seems equally apt that Tim Burton's very good, intentional homage, Ed Wood, lost every invested dime. If Burton's film had been a box office hit, the cult of Ed Wood would have gone the way of all orthodox religions. Thank Ed, this was not to be.

For hardcore surrealists, it's those unintentionally surreal gold nuggets that are the most valued, and Ed's  almost indescribable Glen or Glenda is the ark of the covenant for naive surrealism.  There are  several other choice gems: Ed's own Plan 9 From Outer Space, Phil Tucker's Robot Monster, the Elvis Presley movies Live a Little, Love a Little ( with the groan-inducing Edge of Reality surreal dream sequence) and Easy Come, Easy Go (frogman Elvis doing yoga-is-as-yoga-does with Elsa Lanchester) , Santa Clause Conquers the Martians, and a legion of not so deserving camp classics, including Manos: Hands of Fate, which is indeed awful, but incredibly dull and does not deserve to be placed in the same category.

There is little point in attempting to describe Ed's autobiographical opus, Bela Lugosi's hammy, inexplicable presence, or the pretentious narrative pleas for acceptance.

Glen or Glenda is the  perfect, surreal toast to the Halloween season.

2128621,5,B0002W4TNA,"Edward D. Wood Jr. was a amateur filmmaker in the 1950s - 1970s. I purchased this movie at Newbury Comics long before I joined Amazon.com. One thing I love about these movies is DRACULA star; Bela Lugosi. After losing fame due to the Martin/Lewis ripoff; BELA LUGOSI MEETS A BROOKLYN GORILLA, Ed Wood met up with Lugosi and convinced him to star in his movies which were GLEN OR GLENDA?, BRIDE OF THE MONSTER and PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE. Now onto the movies in this brilliant box set of cult classics:

GLEN OR GLENDA? (1953): Starring Bela Lugosi, Lyle Talbot, Ed Wood, Dolores Fuller and Conrad Brooks. PLOT: A transvesite attempts to get engaged to his fiance but can't tell her his secret.
This movie is good but only Lugosi saves the weirdness.

JAIL BAIT (1954): Starring Steve Reeves, Dolores Fuller and Lyle Talbot. PLOT: A fugitive gets plastic surgery in order to get away with murdering a cop.
Ed's most perfectly pieced movie.

BRIDE OF THE MONSTER (1955): Starring Bela Lugosi, Tor Johnson, Loretta King, Tony McCoy, Paul Marco, Harvey Dunn and Dolores Fuller. PLOT: A mad scientist and his atomic brute try to find a perfect specimen for a race of atomic superman to conquer Earth.
Fun movie with funny bloopers.

PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE (1959): Starring Bela Lugosi, Vampira, Tor Johnson, Paul Marco, Gregory Walcott, Tom Keene, Duke Moore, Conrad Brooks, Mona McKinnon, Dudley Manlove, Lyle Talbot, Dr. Tom Mason, Reverend Lynn Lemon, Carl Anthony, John Breckinridge, Joanna Lee and Criswell. PLOT: An alien race attempts to take over Earth (for the 9th time) by resurrecting 3 zombies that invade the California Valley.
Great movie of comedy and attempted horror.

NIGHT OF THE GHOULS (1958): Starring Duke Moore, Tor Johnson, Paul Marco, Criswell, Kenne Duncan, Valda Hansen, Dr. Tom R. Mason, Marcelle Hemphill, Jeannie Stevens, John Carpenter, Harvey B. Dunn and Margaret Mason. PLOT: A detective investigates a fraud swami channeling with the dead.
Could have been better. Trivia: This movie was not publicly seen until the 1980s because Ed Wood could not pay the Post Production office to process his movie.

THE HAUNTED WORLD OF EDWARD D. WOOD JR.(1996): This documentary includes special interviews with family members, actors and filmmakers that were associated or inspired by Ed Wood.

2128628,4,B0002W4TNA,"Edward D. Wood Jr. was born in 1924 in Poughkeepsie, New York; spent his youth torn between comic books, pulp fiction, and movie matinees; and after a World War II stint in the Marines landed in Hollywood with an itch to wear women's clothing, drink to excess, and make movies.  The result was a series of remarkably atrocious low-budget movies of the ""so bad its good"" variety, and this inexpensive box set offers not only the best know titles but unexpected bonuses as well.

Filmed in 1953, GLEN OR GLENDA is Ed Wood's ode to the joys and tragedies of cross dressing, featuring Wood himself as the conflicted hero and Delores Fuller as the girlfriend who keeps wondering why her angora sweaters are stretched out of shape.  The 1954 JAIL BAIT is a riff on teenagers gone bad and is often described as the best made of Wood's films--but the term ""best made"" is extremely comparative, to say the least.  The 1955 BRIDE OF THE MONSTER is the only Wood film that actually made back its cost; featuring a desperate Bela Lugosi, Tor Johnson, a rubber octopus, and a laboratory helmet that looks suspiciously like a collander, it is easily a Wood fan favorite.  The 1959 NIGHT OF THE GHOULS is a kinda-sorta sequel, featuring Tor Johnson once again in a remarkably silly story of fraudulent spiritualists who bite off more ghosts than they can chew.

The most celebrated title, of course, is the 1959 PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, infamous as the film built around about five minutes of film Wood took of Bela Lugosi shortly before Lugosi's death.  Fans have attempted to catalogue every error in the film, but it is inexhaustible: no matter how many goofs, mistakes, and disasters you notice, you always see one or two more with every viewing.  Day turns to night and then to day--all in the same scene.  Cars unexpectedly change year and model from cut to cut.  Flying saucers cast shadows in outer space.  The list is endless.

NIGHT OF THE GHOULS was never actually released during Wood's life time: he couldn't afford to pay the lab fees for a print of the film, and since the film was never issued the transfer is unexpectedly good.  This is not the case with the other titles, all of which were pretty battered by the time video and DVD technology arrived on the scene--but this actually part of their charm.  And the set includes an unexpected dollop of bonus material.

The big bonus here is THE HAUNTED WORLD OF ED WOOD JR, a 1996 documentary that intercuts various bits of Wood movies with archeival footage of Wood and his circle and interviews with those who knew him, including his leading ladies Delores Fuller, Mona McKinnon, Loretta King, and Vampira (aka Maila Syrjaniemi.)  Perhaps the most interesting subject is Bela Lugosi Jr., who is extremely forthright in his opinion of Ed Wood as a cheapjack opportunist who hitched his wagon to a fading and desperate, not out of genuine affection for Bela Lugosi Sr. but to further his own ends.  Coming in a close second in bonus material is SAUCERS OVER HOLLYWOOD: THE PLAN 9 COMPANION, which draws from many of the same sources as HAUNTED but which focuses on this specific film.

While it is true that the set does not include every scrap of Ed Wood material available--for a tenth rate director-writer-actor he was remarkably prolific, racking up fifty credits on such films as THE BRIDE AND THE BEAST and ORGY OF THE DEAD--it will hit the spot for all but the most diehard fan.  Ed Wood will never appeal to a wide audience, but if you have the warped sense of humor required to appreciate his films, you'll find this set indispensible.

Late in his life, he again received star billing in movies when filmmaker Edward D. Wood, Jr., a fan of Lugosi, found him living in obscurity and near-poverty and offered him roles in his films, such as ""GLEN OR GLENDA?"" (1953) (in which his role made no more sense than the rest of the movie) and as a Dr. Frankenstein-like mad scientist in ""BRIDE OF THE MONSTER"" (1955), during post-production of the latter, Lugosi entered treatment for his addiction, and the premier of the film was ostensibly intended to help pay for his treatment expenses. The extras on an early DVD release of ""PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE"" (1959) include an impromptu interview with Lugosi upon his exit from the treatment center, which provide some rare personal insights into the man --- this was one of Lugosi's most infamous roles was released after he was dead. Ed Wood (Director) features footage of Lugosi interspersed with a double --- Wood had taken a few minutes of silent footage of Lugosi, in his Dracula cape, for a planned vampire picture but was unable to find financing for the project --- Wood later conceived of Plan 9, Wood wrote the script to incorporate the Lugosi footage and hired his wife's chiropractor to double for Lugosi in additional shots --- notice however the ""double"" is thinner than Lugosi, and covers the lower half of his face with his cape in every shot --- Leonard Maltin (Famous Film Critic) was quoted - ""Lugosi died during production, and it shows.""

Lugosi died of a heart attack on August 16, 1956 while lying in bed in his Los Angeles home. He was 73 --- Bela Lugosi was buried wearing one of the many capes from the Dracula stageplay, as per the request of his son and fifth wife, in the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California --- Contrary to popular belief, Lugosi never requested to be buried in his famous cloak; Bela Lugosi, Jr. has confirmed on numerous occasions that he and his mother, Lillian, arrived at their decision independently.

I strongly agree with another reviewer who indicated that a film would need to lack any entertainment value at all to be labeled the worst film of all time. As far as this notion goes, Ed Wood didn't make bad films because every one of the five he made in the 1950's are loads of fun and laughs. 'Glen or Glenda' and 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' are likely my favorites. His first feature, about transvestism, is so inept and so incredibly strange, that one simply watches mesmerized at the audacity and enigmatic spirit Wood demonstrated as a filmmaker in the early 1950's. What can be said about 'Plan 9 from Outer Space,' except that every serious film buff and film maker should make this film priority viewing. The other three films directed by Ed Wood and featured in this box set are all worthy of attention because they're  nearly as campy, inept, and hilarious as the other two I mentioned above. On the back of the case to 'Jail Bait,' the film description indicates that Ed Wood, here, made his first legitimate film. If the film is legitimate simply because it is less inept and hilarious than his other films, I do think this statement is quite misleading. Ed Wood never made a film that would receive any serious consideration for legitimacy from the mainstream and the critical masses. Ed Wood, now more than ever before, remains in a class all his own. Ed Wood's films are stamped with his trademark zeal, good humor, and distorted logic, and remain the work of a filmmaker who may have lacked talent, but was never lacking in purpose. The Ed Wood box set is a perfect way to enjoy Ed Wood's films for the first or twentieth time.

I expected to laugh a lot, which I did, but I didn't expect to be moved when I watched it.  He really poured his soul out and exposed what it was like to be a transvestite.  Ed Wood didn't hold anything back.  Maybe that doesn't make for the most polished product in the end, but it makes for something that was truly unique.

After watching the movies, I had mixed feelings. ""Plan 9"" isn't the least entertaining movie ever made, certainly..but technically, plot-wise, acting-wise, etc., it is pretty rotten. But that makes it great, and even more hilarious when thinking it was meant to be taken seriously. The other movies, all bad in their own ways, were surprisingly good. They all kept my interest, and specifically ""Glen or Glenda"" is an oddball one to have been made in the 50s. My only complaint is that the sound on ""Jailbait"" is really, really low, requiring me to keep it at full volume...I'm sure it's just a bad single DVD..the others were fine..

I think directors today could all learn something from Ed Wood. Most importantly, length. His movies, all barely over an hour, still say everything needed - this length should be used more today. And no matter how lame or unbelievable his storylines were, Edward D Wood, Jr. told his stories exactly how he saw them. And that makes them great flicks!",1132272000,5,1227,4.702325581395349

I think you will have to look to Phil Tucker or even Roger Corman for that. And Plan 9 is NOWHERE near being the worst movie ever made.

Actually, the best movie of the set is Bride of the Monster, where a well advanced in years and heavily addicted to morphine Bela Lugosi proved that he could still act even under the most unfavorable of circumstances. Ed Wood deserves a Nobel Prize for allowing Bela to go out on his feet doing the thing he loved the best. And don't forget that former Mr. America Steve Reeves later of Hercules fame got his acting start in Jail Bait, although I found the speed guitar score annoying to the point of wanting to turn the sound off.

And Plan 9 is, well, Plan 9. One of the all time sci-fi classics. Sure, it was shot on the cheap in a studio the size of a phone booth with cardboard headstones and misfit actors but it had a cohesive plot and there was never a dull moment. I can't say the same about much of the garbage being vomited out by Hollywood THESE days. Do yourself a favor and buy this box set, it's more fun than a barrel of monkeys.

These films are bad, but let me state, for the record, that they are not the worst films ever.  As something of a bad movie connoisseur, I've seen dozens of movies that make ""Glen or Glenda"" seem like ""Citizen Kane"".  The thing about Ed Wood is that while his films aren't very good, they're just bad enough to still find amusing.  I think Ed could've been a competent, maybe even good, director/writer if he'd ever gotten a real shot.  Alas, he never got that chance, instead struggling in low budget hell.

The extras are what really won me over in this set.  There's an entire documentary on Ed's life that I found both hillarious and quite tragic.  If you've seen Burton's ""Ed Wood"" film, you don't really know the true Ed Wood.  There's also another doc on ""Plan 9"" that was just fascinating.  They even find the ""Studio"" where the movie was shot.  Just amazing.

If you like bad movies (but not too bad), you'll enjoy this set.  Ed never got his break, but at least he still lives on.  Maybe he was a genius after all.",1118880000,15,1177,4.339449541284404
2128637,1,B0002W4TNA,"These films are made by the most stupid and hilariously inept director Ed Wood. These films are so bad, they make films like Justin to Kelly or RoboCop 3 look like they are better than Casablanca. These films are so hilariously inept, that they are war crimes against the entire universe. They are so abysmal, that even Freddy Got Fingered is 1000 times better than this  putrid garbage (and that was really terrible, i rated that film 1/10). Plan 9 From Outer Space made me cry in sadness because I watched that film, Glen or Glenda I turned off after 3 minutes of watching, and the rest I didn't even bother and couldn't stand to watch. But I did watch Jail Bait, that was terrible (but it's Ed Wood's best film, and not as inept as his other painful films) Ed Wood never had any idea what he was doing, because his films are confused, pointless, and there is no story, and he and his films are not only insults to Hollywood and humanity, but they are insults to God himself, heaven and the universe. I WANT THAT TIME WASTED ON THAT GRADE Z TRASH OF MY LIFE BACK. PLEASE!!!!!!!!!

Plan 9 From Outer Space: 0/10

Glen Or Glenda: 0/10

Jail Bait: 2/10

Revenge of the Dead: 0/10

Bride of the Monster: 0/10

Overall: 0/10

Please do not buy this. There is no way you will ever not agree with me.",1117238400,12,1295,4.344398340248962
2128638,5,B0002W4TNA,"This is a collection any Ed Wood fan should have. It contains most of the corpus of his work and is in that respect a very complete collection. The question is whether owning these low budget icons is worth your money. Bought individually the answer would almost certainly be no. Bought in this collection, the story changes since the collection costs less than any two of the individual titles.

These are not exemplars of great cinema. In fact they are quite the opposite. They demonstrate how not to make a movie. The poor qulity of their productions, however, makes them somewhat enjoyable just to see the ineptitude.

A must buy for Ed Wood Fans, everyone else takes their chances.",1116979200,7,686,4.756302521008403
2128639,5,B0002W4TNA,"I found this one day at a Suncoast video and HAD to pick it up.

Here are Ed Wood's greatest (by his standards) Masterpieces in one easy collection.

I've only gotten through three of the movies so far, as I'm re-watching them all over and over and over again. Plenty of hidden features, documentaries, and other fun things. The haunted world of Ed Wood even include the original Laredo print, his first official directing debut.

This is a wonderful gift for movie fans, people into cheesy or classic theater, or those who have newly discovered the man who was Ed Wood Jr.

Now all we need is a nice big box collecting of his book released. And yes, Ed Wood did write books as well.",1109462400,4,683,4.44

Some have said this is a ""complete"" box set.  Not so.  Ed Wood made more movies like ""The Violent Years, ""The Bride and the Beast"", ""The Sinister Urge"", ""Orgy of the Dead"", plus some soft-core movies.  This box set contains the best of Ed Wood and is a perfect companion to Tim Burton/Johnny Depp's superb Oscar-winning movie ""Ed Wood"".  I highly recommend this DVD box set.",1104278400,7,578,4.572815533980583

Personally, I don't think it's worth the money considering almost all the movies are available for free on YouTube. I give it 4 stars in honor of Ed Wood and since it works well as a present for an old-fashioned friend.

I do wish the actual box holding the movies was better quality--its just really thin cardboard that can't be expected to last long. Then again I guess it works well as a metaphor for his movies.",1493856000,,464,4.383720930232558

8033721,5,B0002W4TNA,"I got interested in Ed Wood after seeing the Johnny Depp movie, which offers an entertaining but somewhat dubious storyline of Ed Wood's life.  I was aware of Eddie and company's shortcomings prior to the purchase, but had to satisfy my ""morbid curiosity"".  Initally, this box set could not hold my interest, in fact, I fell asleep about 3/4's the way through each title!  The fun thing about these flicks is in determining which is worse, the directing, the acting, the soundtrack, or lack of continuity.  Ed was a master exploiter, down to his utilization of Hollywood stock footage.  I think the same lightning/thunder loop was used in many of the titles in this set.  In particular, Eddie's group of regulars are pretty bad actors- but I knew that going in.  This collection was everything I expected and more.  I've watched each of the films several times now, and every time I discover more weirdness.  You have to admire Ed's tenacity and talent for making films on a shoestring budget.  Whatever Ed didn't have in directing and production, he made up in his ability to exploit and promote.  If you are curious about Ed Wood's life this set is absolutely fundamental.  Now I need to purchase a book or two on the man!",1410912000,,1224,4.694835680751174
