A: Hi De Ho (1947) - A below average transfer in both audio and video that runs for 63 minutes instead of 72.  Would give 2 stars for this one. Seek a better transfer.
B: The Duke is Tops (1938) - Although an older movie the transfer is quite good with a run time of 75 minutes compared to the 73 minutes on IMDB. Would give 4 stars for this one.
OK, you will never get HD quality from Alpha but the price is good so worth it for just the second movie. As usual, no subtitles. On average I give the release 3 stars.",1507420800,,610,3.9193548387096775
