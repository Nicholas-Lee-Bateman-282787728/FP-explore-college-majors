5494903,2,B00ARRQ9NI,"This film is grossly formulaic with bad acting. It has the lame soundtrack and writing of a Lifetime film. Jake (Mike 'The Miz' Mizanin) is home on 2 weeks leave in the small town of Bridgetown, Washington. He stays with his two sisters, doesn't approve of their boyfriends and has a hard time controlling himself to the dismay of family and friends. For a Marine, he needs a haircut.

Meanwhile, Jonah Pope (Neal McDonough) is a bad guy who has a grudge against the system. Being raked over by the stock market, banks, and health insurance companies, Jonah devises a plan of revenge in the city of Seattle. During an arms deal, Jake's sister Lily (Ashley Bell) and her ""not a loser"" boyfriend (Jeffrey Ballard) get taken as hostages as they witness a crime.

The FBI is apparently helpless to save the hostages and the city of Seattle, only a Marine can do that.

The script was written very badly. I can't fault the actors for trying. The political speech made by Jonah was unbelievably phoney. This is for fans of the combination of Steven Seagal, Marines, anarchists, and after school specials.

5494904,4,B00ARRQ9NI,"The Marine 3 Homefront is far better, and more interesting, than your average straight-to-DVD flick.

Jake Carter (Mike ""The Miz"" Mizanin isn't your typical one-dimensional invincible hero: he's emotionally troubled and facing problems from PTSD. Jonas Pope, played by Justified's Neal McDonough isn't a pantomime villain either. You never agree with his actions, which include kidnapping Jake's sister, but he does at least seem to be coming from somewhere sympathetic (he hates corporate America and thinks the country should have more economic fairness)

The movie was done on a relatively low budget, but it never looks too cheap. The acting is great too, with Miz making a decent acting debut. Ashley Bell as Jake's sister also works well in her supporting role. Any other actress and the character could have come off as a typical movie brat, but she manages to make Lilly human and relatable.

The action scenes are fun and well choreographed, and clearly a lot of thought went into then. Scott Wiper has improved somewhat as a director, even if he does revert back to the annoying shaky cam a lot.

 It's not going to win any awards or anything, but as pure popcorn entertainment The Marine 3: Homefront is pretty great.",1363219200,3,1228,4.970731707317073
5494905,4,B00ARRQ9NI,IMPRESSED WITH MIZ PERFORMANCE IN THIS MOVIE.  SHOULD HAVE KEPT THE SAME THEME BEING A MARRIED MARINE. HE'S GORGEOUS HOT,1363219200,,120,5.0
5494906,5,B00ARRQ9NI,"Quite frankly, the way the part of The Marine is cast, I don't care. Lead actors in this series take second place to my absolute adoration of action movie high-octane scenes. Running, jumping, shooting, things exploding everywhere! Mindless, senseless, wanton destruction! Now that's what makes an action movie!

Come now, don't tell me that you actually enjoy Arnold's acting! The man has four facial expressions: Stone Face, Gleeful I'll Kick Your Ass Face, Crazy Face and Fake Fear Face. His voice has never changed tone or inflection, it's just loud and louder. He has the range of of a broken-necked guitar. We love the BOOM!

One thing about Mike Mizanin, he's got some talent. He IS in the WWE, and every Superstar/Diva is an actor/actress. Ted DiBiase and John Cena are reasonably talented as well; they don't bore me like Arnold does. I love the WWE enough to watch the Monday and Friday shows regularly, I even like the OTHER wrestling company enough to watch it sometimes.

The love of action movies is mostly about the love of the adrenaline rush. A big, manly man running around, dodging bad guys, making stuff blow up, shooting big guns. The Marine series is rolling on, and it's GREAT! Mizanin is admirable participant in the lastest installment. Haters Love the Miz!

I will not get into the plot and all that is wrong with this urban yarn. I will say all the actors that I like were the bad guys and the shrill little obnoxious twit that was held hostage in the movie was easy to hate. I ended up cheering the bad guys to win and hoping they would kill that air-headed hostage. good luck.,1362787200,2,465,4.065217391304348

5494910,4,B00ARRQ9NI,"Love him or hate him, The Miz has taken this series by storm. While Cena may have started it off and had a few good moments, and Ted Dibiase had a few of his own, Miz really takes it up another notch. Great action movie.

5494911,2,B00ARRQ9NI,"""I'm sorry we can't treat this just strictly as a kidnapping, there's a lot more at play here."" After a long time away the Marine (The Miz) has finally come back home and is ready to start a new life with his sisters. He is having a hard time adjusting until a group kidnaps one of his sisters. When it turns out to be a domestic terrorist type group it is up to him to stop them and get his sister back. This is another type of movie that people will either watch or not watch no matter what reviews say. There is a definite audience for wrestling star movies, and I'm not really sure why. I will say that the first Marine wasn't bad, but when you go from John Cena to Ted Dibase Jr. to The Miz that shows how far the series has fallen. On the other hand if there wasn't an interest they wouldn't keep making them. I guess if you liked the others then you will like this one too. I thought the first one was good but the others are less then OK. Overall, if you have seen the other two then you might as well watch this one too.

Bring on Jake and his bad attitude and cue the action.

The Marine 3 is little more than a platform by which another ""professional athlete"" gets to ply his meager wares. The action is predictable and by this point, if you haven't figured it out from The Marine and The Marine 2, action is about all you'll get.

5494948,4,B00ARRQ9NI,"THE MARINE 3
HOME FORNT

I thought the first The Marine film was really good and much better than people give it credit for. The second film while not as enjoyable was still fun in my opinion, especially the story; it was Die Hard on an island. This one like the previous two is about a Marine on leave but it is much more like another WWE film, Walking Tall that starred The Rock. That of course was a remake and a very good one at that.

Jake Carter [The Miz] is a Sergeant in the Marines and is on leave coming home to see his sisters.  Of course like any brother he isn't happy with their boyfriends. But none of that matters when his younger sister [the wonderful Ashley Bell] and her boyfriend witness a murder during a weapons deal gone wrong. They are kidnapped by these terrorists so now the Marine must take action to save his sister and stop these guys.

Now like I said this reminded me of the Walking Tall film with the way the story kinda goes but also because the lead villain is the same actor in both. Neal McDonough is excellent always in any role but I love him as a villain. His skill plus those piercing eyes make him perfect for the role. Also I mentioned the wonderful Ashley Bell [who really impressed me with The Last Exorcism. Like Neal this is her second WWE film, the first being The Day which was also very good. She like always is great and this is a cool role for her, very different than what I have seen previous. Of course we also have Mike Mizanin also known as The Miz who in my opinion is excellent here. He actually may be the best actor from the WWE guys from the past few years. I will have to go back and re-watch some stuff but he really impressed me here as he did in his next film for them, Christmas Bounty. All of the actors were good here I must say.

Of course the writers have also worked on multiple WWE films, well at least one. Writer/director Scott Wiper made this his second WWE film to write and direct, the other was the excellent Steve Austin starring The Condemned. Then his writing partner here Declan OBrian makes this his first WWE film but not his first sequel to work on. He has written and directed three Wrong Turn films as well as the new Joy Ride 3 film.

The Blu-Ray comes with some great behind the scenes stuff but I really wish we would have gotten a commentary with the writers and Miz. But still it is a fun film that is not to be taken seriously at all. There are fights, explosions, gunfire and even some genuine acting. I recommend this flick to any wrestling or action movie fan.",1428278400,,2556,4.238193018480493

5494963,5,B00ARRQ9NI,"Knowing the reputation of this series, and the fact that it's a WWE-financed vehicle for wrestling superstar John ""The Miz"" Mizanin, I can't help but love this movie. While the first one was unremarkable (save for Robert Patrick, as the villain), with the second being totally forgettable, ""Homefront"" throws away the two previous films and introduces a totally new story.

""The Marine 3"" feels more like a reboot of the first two, despite the fact that 2 was unrelated to 1, and is actually serves as a good stand-alone film that can be watched with no prior knowledge of the previous ones. A lot of the movie hangs on whether or not you happen to be a fan of The Miz (which I am), as he caries a number of scenes. Unlike John Cena, Mizanin can actually put on civilian clothes without looking like a wrestler in disguise. I was also surprised by the fact that he get's pretty beat up over the coarse of the film, a la John McClane from ""Die Hard"". Speaking of which, the film is clearly influences in par by the Die Hard films, but this wasn't a problem for me, as it never felt like it was veering into being a rip-off.

Aside from Mizanin, the other central character of the film is the story's villain- played by Neal McDonough (who has shaken off the taint of his role in the awful Chun-Li film). McDonough is one of those actors who alwaya seems to skirt on the edges of the mainstream, yet never achieve full acceptance, but his surprisingly understated performance gives me hope that he has a future. The story is more ambitious than might be expected, with a bit a nice of social commentary that doesn't beet you over the head, and a fairly decent budget for a direct-to-DVD film.

The best of the three films, strongly recommended!",1407196800,,1742,4.506329113924051

5494978,3,B00ARRQ9NI,"In ""The Marine 3: Homefront,"" Mike 'The Miz' Mizanin plays Sgt. Jake Carter, an active-duty marine on leave returning to his home in a rural town, to meet his two sisters Amanda (Camille Sullivan) and Lilly (Ashley Bell). Lily and her boyfriend Darren (Jeff Ballard) are both abducted after witnessing a criminal act of a group led by a college professor-turned-extremist Jonah Pope (Neal McDonough), so Jake embarks on his mission on his own, to save his missing sister.

This is a typical straight-to-DVD action movie - shoot-outs, explosions and a few familiar situations - and as such it is not bad at all. The Miz is pretty impressive during the fight scenes that are sometimes violent (which itself is not a bad thing here). The problem is, it takes about fifty minutes or so for the film to give him a chance to show what he can do. The wordy mid-section of the film, where it attempts to show its intelligent side with reference to the post-Lehman Brothers environment, only slows down the film that should have more action, not speech.

Directed by Scott Wiper (""A Better Way to Die"" ""The Condemned""), ""The Marine 3: Homefront"" is an OK action movie that could have been better with a tighter pace and more heightened tension.",1381363200,,1235,4.73953488372093

5494991,3,B00ARRQ9NI,"There are times when it's nice to just put a movie into the DVD player and know from looking at the box art just what to expect. Simple action films are the best of these. There is little doubt in your mind that you're about to witness Shakespeare. No, you're going to watch a plot line delivered and set up and then about 80 minutes of butt kicking action. This film is that and nothing more but then it doesn't need to be.

This latest in the line of feature films from WWE of course stars one of its wrestlers, this time Mike ""The Miz"" Mizanin as Sergeant Jake Carter. As he explains in voice over he and his sisters were left behind when their parents died and he took off to join the Marines. Part of a special ops unit, he's been trained to be a killing machine from the start. His sisters, on the other hand, stayed in the home they grew up in and have become part of their home town.

Mike returns for a visit and has to adjust to a few changes. For one, his best friend is now a Deputy Sheriff in town. Another is that the older of his two sisters Amanda is dating him. And lastly his little sister Lilly is dating a young guy who was always someone in trouble that Mike isn't happy about. But he's trying to deal with it even though it leads to a small confrontation.

Later in the film Lilly and her boyfriend are working on his car near the river (why they chose here I have no idea) when they witness a group of home grown terrorists murder a man before their eyes as a weapons buy goes bad. They are captured quickly and taken hostage. Before being captured Lilly was able to let Amanda know what was going on. Now Mike sets out to rescue his sister.

But things become complicated when it turns out the FBI has been watching this group all along. It turns out the leader is a college professor turned extremist (Neal McDonough) who has made plans to blow something up. Just what they haven't discovered yet, but the bombing is supposed to go down today. Now they want Mike to stand back and let them handle things. Come on, this is an action movie; we know up front that they'll screw it up some way.

Of course they do and that's when Mike has to take things into his own hands. Trained in counter terrorism techniques, he sets out to take out the bad guy and rescue Lilly in the process. Along the way he ends up getting help from her boyfriend who turns out to be a good kid after all.  The end result is pretty much telegraphed ahead of time since this is a by the book flick but it's satisfying as well.

There is no outstanding achievement in acting here but the movie wasn't made as a showcase for that. What we have is some solid acting by a cast that knows exactly what kind of movie they're making. But that doesn't stop them from doing their best and coming off quite nicely. Most importantly is the acting ability of Mizanin. He does a fine job here and shows the potential to be not just an action star but a decent actor as well. Let's hope he gets the chance to prove that.

Like I said from the start, the movie is predictable and offers nothing new to the genre. Then again it never intended to. It was just intended to be another WWE vehicle to make one of their stars a movie star and to offer solid action entertainment for fans of the genre. The fact is they deliver on all counts.",1372118400,,3317,4.196232339089482

5495004,3,B00ARRQ9NI,"Mike ""The Miz"" Mizanin stars as Sgt. Jake Carter who returns home to Bridgetown, WA for two weeks to his family of his big sister Amanda (Camille Sullivan) & baby sister Lilly (Ashley Bell) along with his friend & who he later finds out is Amanda's boyfriend in Officer Harkin (Jared Keeso) but is critical & overprotective of certain issues going on such as Lilly's boyfriend Darren (Jeffrey Ballard). Lilly & Darren later witness a shooting during an arms deal with Jonah Pope (Neal McDonough) before being taken hostage by his group of extremists which Jake finds out about & goes after her but encounters difficulties along the way such as F.B.I. agents Wells (Steve Bacic) & Thompson (Nicola Anderson) who attempt to stop him from interfering in their own mission to stop Pope from committing a deadly terrorist strike.

The basic plot for this movie was no different than the previous editions where it's an off-duty marine going after the group of villains who kidnapped someone close to him so that hasn't changed but the way it was portrayed takes after the previous sequel where it's a more realistic & serious tone instead of over the top acting & action like the first installment. The action was your basic fist fighting & gun play while this had the best acting out of ""The Marine"" trilogy as Miz did a good job while I've enjoyed Neal McDonough's work in various movies as well.

The Miz's character in the film is actually pretty unlikable and he's supposed to be the good guy. If anyone reading this has seen some of the SyFy channel's awful original movies, just think of the SyFy channel producing an action movie about a marine with no Science Fiction involvement. That's how I can best describe this movie. Bad script, bad acting, and bad character development. I don't blame the Miz entirely for any of the movie's downfalls, which are many. The Miz is most likely a victim of bad screen/script writing, but it's still safe to say that The Miz needs a lot of acting work before moving any further in Hollywood.

5495016,3,B00ARRQ9NI,"The movie being in Seattle and starring the Miz was the reason I bought it. He did an adequate job of playing the 'strong, silent type' even though he does not come across that way in stature - he has more a volatile look to me and if he was portrayed with less tolerance, it would have been more believable.

As with most movies nowadays, the 'F' word is used waaaay too much to be effective. It loses the stress meaning and makes the person 'look' like a low class individual whose parents didn't love themselves enough to teach them respect 8o).",1364256000,,548,4.372549019607843

5495018,3,B00ARRQ9NI,"The Marine 3, obviously, is now the 3rd in its series. By this point, you should know what to expect. The first two flicks were religiously devout to adhering to action movie formulas, and the third is certainly no exception. It's still about a tough guy coming home from a tour of duty, not being able to cope with the life he's left behind, and stumbling head-on into a hyper-violent situation with cardboard villains (and yes, cardboard heroes) and tons of ADHD action.

From that, it's easy to know if this will be up your alley. So really, the only points to discuss are the flow of this action, since story and characters are completely sidelined, and how it fits into the series.

Each new entry is a new wrestler playing a new character. I will say that Miz was a lot more convincing as an actor than Cena or Dibiase. No one's going to be honoring him with any awards for his work, but I didn't have to cringe at any of his delivery.

The action turns out pretty well in this one. It's clearly inspired by a lot of other action movies (Under Siege and Heat stand out in my mind), but that's par for the course in direct-to-video fare. Fortunately, the direction keeps these scenes from feeling too much like a poor man's version of its blockbuster inspirations.

Action-wise, everything works, but nothing stands out as truly memorable.

As far as fitting into the series, if you're expecting something slightly different as new crews tackle the concept, you'll be satisfied with this take. The first was certainly very goofy, and this one is more serious like Marine 2, but Marine 3 handles it much better, and looks a whole lot slicker than the previous entry. Miz's character is made to be single, rescuing a sister rather than his girl, which excises a lot of the awkward development of a romantic couple that wasn't written or acted well in the first two entries.

Overall, it fits well into the series, so fans of the first two should enjoy it. Direct-to-video action fans will probably enjoy it more than Marine 2 as well. Fans outside of those niches, however, may want to pass and look for something with more meat.",1363737600,,2132,4.582677165354331
