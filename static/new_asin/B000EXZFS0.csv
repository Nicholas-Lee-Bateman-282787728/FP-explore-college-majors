2546011,5,B000EXZFS0,"I love Family Affair. I like seeing real family values and the way the

children showed respect for adults back then. Its nice to watch the

innocence of this show and not think about 9/11, the War in Iraq, and

seeing so much tragedy America seems to be faced with today. Iam so greatful this show is finally on DVD, I been waiting a long time.",1148342400,6,345,4.196969696969697
2546012,5,B000EXZFS0,"In contrast to the often low grade vulgarity represented in todays sitcoms, Family Affair displayed ""family values"" in their truest sense. I hope for the release of the entire series!",1145750400,12,183,5.133333333333334
2546013,5,B000EXZFS0,"I would watch this show in the day (probably in reruns but it was waaaay back in the preschool to 1-3 grade days of the late 60's early 70's). I really remember this show  and coming from not an ideal family myself I guess this was good therapy to watch because these kids are not in a ""normal"" family either. Mr. French was my big favorite and I had this wierd stuffed cloth doll (like a teddy bear but a man) and I named him Mr. French, I used to sleep with him and I'm sure it was a big comfort. Thanks Family Affair for all the entertainment and comfort you brought me in my not so ideal childhood. Another memory, the true fear I felt when the kids ran away, remember that one? This show really had me careing for the characters, great show!",1145491200,9,746,4.144827586206897
2546014,5,B000EXZFS0,"""Family Affair"" has been one of those TV shows that I have long been waiting for to be released onto dvd.  I grew up watching this warm, family show of Uncle Bill, Sissy, Jody, and Buffy, and of course, Mr. French, who seemed to always have some kind of a solution to whatever problem had occurred.  Most memorable episodes involved the disappearance of Buffy's Mrs. Beasley doll, a camping trip with Sissy complaining she couldn't use her hair dryer, and Jody trimming Mr. French's beard.  I only hope that the Season 1, listed on the box cover, instead of ""The Complete First Season,"" doesn't mean that something has been omitted and this is only a scattering of select episodes from the first season.  If anyone has any insights on this issue, please inform us in your review.  Once again, I'm very pleased to see that the beloved ""Family Affair"" will be joining ""The Brady Bunch,"" ""Bewitched,"" and ""The Andy Griffith Show,"" on dvd. I see ""That Girl!"" is also being released to dvd, another favorite TV show!  I hope that a release date is set soon for another great `60's TV show, ""Get Smart.""  I believe that I enjoy these now ""classic"" TV shows for the cast members in all of these shows do a great job in making their audience believe in whatever role they're playing and whatever the situation their involved in, is actually happening, and this is rare TV magic that's hard to find on TV these days.",1144022400,16,1407,4.581673306772909

It is a sharpe contrast to the real life Buffy Annisa Jones had to endure. Her vh1 True Hollywood Story made me feel very sad to watch. Such a happy looking child could have such an awful life but yet be such a great young actress that when your watching family affair she seems like shes on top of the world...This is a great series and I hope they release Batman with Adam West and Burt Ward they looked terrific on TV Land Awards 2006 and I hope the show comes out this year also.

The quality is excellent and, for all those who are hearing impaired, as I am, Season One does include subtitles even though Amazon's description does not indicate that.  I learned this fact only after a family member bought a copy and let me know.  I had seen the DVD on Amazon's website and had passed it up because of the lack of subtitling.  Please, Amazon, let us know whether a DVD is subtitled.

2546058,5,B000EXZFS0,i recommend all 5 seasons of this series.  it is not like 50s comedies that are all fluff and cliche.  this one was about a very loving uncle who took his nieces and nephews in after their parents died.  he was quite the loving uncle to do that but brian keith was not overstated in his acting. if you like this dramatic comedy with its understated way of teaching lessons in the end you may also like Room 222.,1370476800,,411,4.177215189873418

2546062,5,B000EXZFS0,"I was born when this show was on Television originally, that is not to say that I saw it a few weeks ago on ME TV Showcase, and seeing it on that channel, this is the kind of television shows that I like to see, it is good clean and fit for anyone to see it and enjoy it. After seeing it on ME TV Showcase, I decided to see if I could find it on Amazon.com to order all of the seasons of the show. Brian Keith does a very good job in proytraing his character Uncle Ben, even thought that he haves to figure out how to be a parent to two six year old twins and a teenage girl. Very few uncles would do what Uncle Ben does on the show of taking three orphan children in to raise them as his own. Kathy Garver does an excellent job in playing Cissy as the mature sister to the twins. The twins are up to the usual children's pranks that all six year olds does, and at the same time tries to understand what is happening to them. This is truly a classic show that Hollywood produced for televsion and now with it on DVD who knows that it might will bring an whole entire new generation of fans to the show.",1362787200,,1102,3.924107142857143
2546063,5,B000EXZFS0,"I was first introduced to ""Family Affair"" seven years after it ended its original run on CBS. I was in second grade, and discovered it in daily reruns after school. Needless to say, I was shocked to see little Buffy with MY Mrs. Beasley doll! After an explanation from my Mom, I found out she had the doll first. :) I also fell head over heels with love with Uncle Bill.

""Family Affair"" was and still is a show which tugs at the heart. Three young kids, suddenly orphaned, going to live with an uncle they barely knew. He did not always quite know how to be a dad to the children, especially in the beginning. Then there was his beyond proper,cultured manservant Mr. French. With his stuffy demeanor, he was in no way prepared to deal with kids in the house. However, they all learned and grew together, and quickly fell in love with one another.

Some of the episodes make me tear up now. The kids being afraid they will be separated, and have to leave their new home. Uncle Bill's deep affection for the kids, and the struggle to effectively and properly show it. Mr. French getting caught up in the midst of it all. It's one those shows which more than likely would not work today, due to the overall cynacism of the times.

I bought the first season a few years ago, and am delighted it is a part of my ever-growing collection. The entire series is available now, which is great news. Although I see the show, characters, and storylines much differently as an adult, I still enjoy watching it very much. Some things do not need to change.",1360540800,3,1543,4.4070175438596495

2546066,5,B000EXZFS0,"I was 8 years old in 1966 when Family Affair first aired and my older sister religiously watched every week. I remember sitting through a few of them each year as the ""Twins"" got older but resented the fact that my sister got to watch this show all the time. I probably wanted to watch something else on another channel, but never got the chance.

I'm now 53 years old and ordered the first 3 seasons because my wife loved the show when she was young. We are nearing the end of the first season and let me tell you, I now love this show. It seems kind of eerie though, watching and knowing the fate of Buffy and Uncle Bill. Still, I can't get enough. So endearing and even a bit teary-eyed at times. Plus, I must tell the truth here, I like John Williams as French's brother, more than the Sebastian Cabot French.

I've since apologized to my sister for no doubt pitching a fit and bothering her as she watched these episodes back then. I'm hoping that the remainder of this and the next four seasons are as enjoyable.",1342569600,2,1018,4.296875

I used to watched on TV Land back in 1999 & right now, I watch in ME Television in San Antonio Texas. Season 1 was the beginning of Uncle Bill was a single man with a butler Mr French. Uncle Bill enjoyed a single life with a female companion,until he was interrupted by his nephew & nieces. His brother & his wife were killed in & there was nobody who took the kids in. Uncle Bill was the only one the kids loved & that's really The Family Affair. Mr. French always had his hands full. Funny! I always love Buffy,because she is so cute. She made her first debut on biting Mr French in the leg. Ha! Ha! Ha! She was something else. She stole the show after all those years. I wish someone who teach her how to sing better on Season 3 Unsound of Music. That is so funny. she is so cute when she wanted to be in those events. But things failed on poor Buffy,someone said she was too little to progress things like Jody & Cissy. But Uncle Bill comforted her alot like every fathers should. Uncle Bill was a strong father figure to all the kids. I know he was there for Jody & Cissy. But most times, he was there for Buffy all the time. Giving her every advices to make her feel good. That was very touching on the show. I wish Brian Keith would give Anissa Jones a fatherly advices before she died from drug overdoses. I wish Anissa Jones would be like Buffy,so cute,little & always the best. I wish there would be another Buffy, that wouldn't go through like Anissa Jones did. She would have good things in life, going to school & stay until graduations, having a good life with family & friends,stay away from drugs & bad company of friends that wanted her to hook up on bad stuffs. This is a message to teen-agers. Stay in school,get a job,respect your family & teachers, don't hang with bad company of friends who in gangs,hook up in drugs,no stealing,no dropping out & no failings. Anissa Jones would change things around when she growing,but it was too late. I wish my cousin would stop being out of control & she is living. How can we make her act right? It was no use. She is hooked on drugs & it is no way to stop her. Just like it was no way to stop Anissa from going out of control. She was known as Big Bad Buffy. I thought she was cute. But she wasn't cute. My heart will go out to her family that would be a real Family Affair in her life. I wasn't like the other teenagers who acted crazy,failing in school & so on. Their lives were shorten because of that. I graduated from high scool & went to college, I had jobs during the summers,happy with my own family & church family,I read the bible & other books, not smoking & drinking. I'm just a clean bill of health always & forever.",1342051200,,2925,4.428571428571429

2546071,5,B000EXZFS0,"Yes, Mr. French (Sebastian Cabot) was none too happy to suddenly find three youngsters to care for.  But this was a winning cast.  Even the part played by John Williams as the other Mr. French while Sebastian Cabot was out sick is a true winner.  The colors are very vibrant and truly a show for the whole family.  Brian Keith was great as Uncle Bill, a man that took on the responsibility of taking of his brothers 3 orphaned children.  And of course not by choice, they were for lack of better wording abandoned at this front door.  This series is truly heart warming & funny at just the right moments.  Season one offers a behind the scenes interview with Cathy Garver (Cissy).  She sheds some light on how the cast was chosen.

Even if you were not a fan of the show it is worth owning.  Although cast a sitcom I like to think of it as a dramcom.  Some drama with comedy.

This show offers if nothing else how children can change your lives forever.",1276473600,,953,4.322033898305085
2546072,4,B000EXZFS0,"OK....The last I saw of these were those TV Land airings, and from that time around, in contrast from sitting through reruns during the early '70s, I can now see how much of ""Family Affair"" was irregular, compared to the other Don Fedderson production of note, ""My Three Sons"" (especially when it got a breath of fresh air via the establishment of Ernie as a new son and Robbie became the ""oldest"" one with Mike gone). The inconsistencies, however, seem minor, compared to the show that became the modern day ""FA"": ""Full House""; the WEAKEST ""FA"" episode had more chuckles than the STRONGEST ""FH"" (depending on how one defines ""strong""), hands down!

It helps that ""FA"" was family friendly without being gooey and sickly sweet; there's a hint of non-""political correctness"" that runs like a thread through the whole show, and that's conveyed through Brian Keith's low-key, ""gruff"" performance as Uncle Bill. He keeps things grounded in reality, so the children are never really spoiled. The THREE ""FH"" male leads could never equal ONE Brian Keith!

MPI's first DVD issue of the series began with this first season set. If you want them uncut and in color that looks brighter than the TV Land airings, then this is your first sampling of a JACKPOT, DVD speaking! One could have expected more with the ""extras"", but Kathy Garver (Cissy), plus a sampling of stills is better than nothing. (Remember, all of this may yet get remastered anew, someday, including the adding on of MORE ""extras"". Blu-ray? Never say never!)

The pilot, ""Buffy"", still hits me right in the heart and gut; it's unique that the show (presumably) sold, in part, on Anissa Jones' performance ALONE, as Jody (Johnny Whitaker) and Cissy only came around at the very end of the pilot! More of a surprise was finding out Brian Keith was filmed at different times so he could still have a movie career, having an arrangement like Fred MacMurray did for ""MTS""!

If any CHARACTER can be labeled as inconsistent, it would be Cissy; primarily, she comes off as very bright, but often, it doesn't take much more than BOYS to have her make many a misjudgment, one would swear! Garver manages to do her part well, despite script irregularities; she's showcased in many good first season episodes, including the sentimental ""The Thursday Man"". (If I recall right, they actually tried to remake THAT episode for the notorious ""FA"" update with Gary Cole and Tim Curry!) That said, what was it with with the lighting of those shows where there was ALWAYS a shadow below Cissy's upper lip everytime she talked or smiled? Beyond that, I still think she was CUTE, particularly when she had knee socks on!

Not bad, but not perfect, either. It's special, most of all, because these shows are UNCUT, and not every TV series available on Amazon (or elsewhere) can be claimed as such! Get this while you can at a sale price for your money's worth. Sturdy, compact DVD case makes for better storage and greater value! Time to look for Mrs. Beasley's glasses. AGAIN!

2546090,5,B000EXZFS0,"Before the Brady Bunch and the Partridge Family entranced America with a family of precocious youngsters with disarmingly attractive parents and the odd character thrown into the mix, there was Family Affair.

Despite the unrealistic premise (which has ""Uncle Bill"" (Brian Keith) the bachelor brother living in a swank penthouse high above NYC's Central Park, inheriting Buffy and Jody, the two most adorable little children in the world, along with their lovely teenage sister, Kathy, on the death of their parents), contrived plots and morality laden dialogue in each episode, this show remains a favorite among many cynical folks like myself.  Why?  Because in essence it taught that love makes a family, and not all families are the same.  What a concept for the 1960's (and today).

Why a modern-day middle class American bachelor would require a ""butler/cook/manservant"" (played to perfection by Sebastian Cabot), defies reality.  Although , having this odd character about allows the children to have their most precious dialogue with the often perplexed Mr. French, who finds himself Nanny/Governess to Buffy and Jody.  Mr. French is likely to be admitted to the Television Hall of Fame (if it exists) as one of the most beloved characters on television.

And who could ever forget Buffy's doll, a bespectacled granny in a polka dot dress, who she referred to as ""Mrs. Beezley"".  This little doll became a retail bonanza when other little girls all over the country had to have a ""Mrs. Beezley"" just like Buffy.

Last but not least, was there ever a cuter child actor than Johnny Whittaker (""Jody"")?  Not in my opinion.  This little boy could act from the time he was a toddler and remained a favorite of television producers throughout his teens.  He was featured in many hits like:  ""The Russians are Coming, The Russians are Coming"", ""The Littlest Angel"" and had the title role in ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"".  The best quality about Johnny is that he never appeared precocious, but embodied everything wonderful about childhood:  innocence, curiosity, and with a hint of naughtiness.",1177545600,2,2098,5.090643274853801
2546091,5,B000EXZFS0,"I remember watching ""Family Affair"" on television each week during the late 1960's early 1970's. Family Affair features Brian Keith as Bill,an engineer who happens to be a confirmed bachelor. He lives in New York penthouse with his butler, Mr. French portrayed by Sebastian Cabot. Bill's routine life is thrown for a spin when his brother and sister in law die in a plane crash. One by one the children, Buffy, Jody and Cissy are brought by relatives to live with Uncle Bill, since it is the wish of the deceased parents he raise their children. Once a confirmed bachelor Bill becomes, Uncle Bill while Mr. French becomes a nanny overnight. Their lives are forever changed in this hilarious and heart warming comedy.",1177459200,2,716,4.829268292682927
2546092,5,B000EXZFS0,"This is one of the few sitcoms that can appeal to both kids and adults. There is a lot of childlike humor that will appeal to kids as well as very thought-provoking family-type issues that warm the adult heart. The basic premise of the show chronicles the lives of three orphans as they strive to find a home and a place where they are loved. Brain Keith does a superb job playing Bill Davis, a rich bachelor, who steps forward to do the moral and decent thing by taking in his two nieces and nephew. Uncle Bill struggles to learn the ins and outs of being a father figure to three emotionally fragile kids. Sebastian Cabot provides a stellar performance as Mr. Davis's ""Gentleman's Gentleman."" The chemistry between the actors is perfect. I really didn't think much of the show when I saw it 35 years ago but I am now extremely impressed by the writing of the episodes and the high-quality production values. The only down side to Season 1 is that Sebastian Cabot takes a temporary leave of absence midway through the season and is replaced by someone playing his brother. The replacement for Mr. Cabot is not as good but the shows are still pretty good. I'm a little upset with the company that put the DVD set together. There is not an episode index or brief description of each show. Overall, there is nothing on TV today that comes remotely close to the entertainment value this show has to offer.",1172016000,2,1402,4.5236220472440944

2546099,5,B000EXZFS0,"Ok this sitcom family had as much in common with real life family issues as pliad dinasours with long purple tongues wearing ruby red lipstick do.  That said Family Affair was not meant to be super serious reality television.  Family Affair was an escape from the painful reality of life into a more perfect what if world.

Granted Family Affair was syrupy and maudelin but it also helped some people.  Family Affair was among the first TV shows that dared suggest a family can be forged out of componants that did not include a traditional Mommy and Daddy.  I was raised by loving caring awesome grandparents after my parents died at age five.  Like Buffy, Jody and Cissy we learned that the true enduring quality of family life is founded on the love we invest in each other.

As a black male child who grew up with two sisters all orphaned and in the loving care of his grandparents Family Affair helped us find peace and acceptance in our situation.  I always felt a lot better about myself after having watched Family Affair because, I felt less odd or alone.  Family Affair showed that the true meaning of family focused not just on blood but intensity of love shared among its members.  The lessons of Family Affair were priceless in my 1960'syouth and are of greater value in today's world of blended non-traditional families.  Blended families are not a new thing, as Family Affair shows all who watch.  Blended Non-Traditional Families can work if all who live in them invest themselves honestly which was the true message of Family Affair.

I refuse to buy into the shallow minded logic that judges Family Affair by the personal life outcomes of the stars that breathed life into its characters as they are two completely seperate things.  Family Affair is a work of fiction designed to educate, uplift and entertain feats it accomplishes quite well.  Family Affair reveals the very basic equation of love that ties families together and is worth its price on those merits alone.  Add to that Family Affair is a nice walk down memory lane to boot!  Family Affairs core message is more relevent and needed today in 2006 than it was in 1960's when I was young!",1162166400,9,2169,4.680738786279683
2546100,3,B000EXZFS0,"Back in the mid-to-late Sixties, this was one of the nation's top-rated sitcoms. Watching this saccharine trifle today, it's difficult to fathom why. Even by the standards of the day, it's so sickeningly sweet, calculatedly heart-warming and grossly unreal it makes The Brady Bunch look like The Osbournes.

For an alleged comedy, it's rarely funny but almost always maudlin--in the first season every other episode hinges on one or more of the robotic orphaned kids on the verge of tears because they mistakingly believe they're unwanted by the avuncular ""Unca Bill"" (which the diction-challenged Jody adorably mangles into something sounding like ""Uncwa Bwill"").

In one episode, Jody actually comes to the conclusion that he's unloved because, unlike a friend who's constantly being punished, Uncle Bill never beats him. . .so he embarks on a campaign to have Uncle Bill beat him! Mr. French (who not only arranges Uncle Bill's dates but also helps him bathe and dress as well) seems jealous of kids. Cissy appears to have the hots for her own uncle, while younger kids are always worried they're about to be shipped off to next foster home, ugh!!! Pass the Kleenex. . . and call CPS.

The jarringly realistic post-show fates of several cast members--Anissa ""Buffy"" Jones died of a massive drug OD less than ten years after the show premiered (apparently due in large part to her difficulty in adjusting to post-stardom teendom); Brian ""Uncle Bill"" Keith shot himself in the head--only add to the creep factor.

Still, oddly watchable in some unexplainable way--it's the sitcom equivalent of those cheesy old Big Eye art paintings of street urchins and starving dogs gazing forlornly from dirty alleyways. Or, thanks to the preponderance of bleached hair (even Unca Bill is a bottle blonde!) and monotone line readings, Children of The Damned with a laugh track. Yep, this is a minority viewpoint to be sure--but for anyone willing to look past the nostalgia, this is one profoundly weird series.",1162080000,7,1999,5.066869300911854

I missed that show for ages. I spent a lovely weekend with the Davis family. And Sebastion Cabot as Bill Davis' Gentleman's Gentleman Giles French is just adorable. The nice point of the show is, that family life is shown from the kid's side as well as from parents' side. Cissy adds the problems of a teenager.

2546106,5,B000EXZFS0,"The first 30 episodes of one of the great, lost 1960's sitcoms. Although seen in reruns throughout the early-to-mid '70's, ""Family Affair"" seemed to disappear in the '80's and was seen as passe (the death of Anissa Jones in August 1976 seemed to confirm this was all a flimsy Hollywood fantasy anyway). Still, it's too bad an entire generation missed out on the show, as it is sweet, good-hearted and exceptionally moving. Occasionally, the precociousness of twins Buffy and Jody seems a little put-on, and while the two tykes are terrific little actors, they sometimes were too-aware of the camera (which would disappear by season two). But there are many highlights, such as the Emmy-nominated pilot (a well-written and constructed episode, introducing the characters without going overboard or straining for laughter), Cissy falling for one of her teachers at Lexie High (Robert Reed!), Buffy and Jody getting lost in the Big Apple, and any episode prominently featuring wonderfully cuddly Mr. French (a delightful Sebastian Cabot, whose double-takes over a jar of marmalade are priceless). Wonderful show--one that was just as strong in the upcoming seasons as in the first.

The interviews with Kathy Garver (Cissy) were insightful as well and provided a bit of info as to the cast of the show. Though not a show to push any envelope whatsoever, it doesn't fail to entertain. A tad bit on the pricier side for some individuals (I spent $30.00), most folks I know loved this show and keep it in high regard. If ""The Courtship Of Eddie's Father"" with the late Bill Bixby ever gets released, it would make a nice companion piece with this series.",1155081600,,632,4.364406779661017

The DVD is pretty much a no-frills, direct to DVD copy.  I'm not sure if there was any extra processing to clean up the shots.  They're very crisp, but there are scenes where you'll still see a few screen blemishes.  Overall, it seems to keep the nostalgia of watching on an old color television.

Mr French (S. Cabot) was FANTASTIC in the part of a gentleman's gentleman. There were moments when he provided some great comic relief. The one thing I remember the most about this show is that in each episode it ALWAYS TAUGHT A VALUBLE LESSON!

2546116,5,B000EXZFS0,"I have been having so much fun watching Season One of Family Affair.  It is such a sweet, innocent show, and so full of love.  It's absolutely delightful to watch!

I remember loving this show as a child, and I have been waiting for it to come out on DVD.  I can't wait for the rest of the seasons to be released.

The only thing that makes me a bit sad is knowing about the tragic deaths of Anissa Jones and Brian Keith.  Anissa Jones is so adorable as Buffy, and no one else could ever have played Uncle Bill quite as perfectly as Brian Keith.  It's too bad that, in real life, their lives weren't as perfect as they look on Family Affair.",1153180800,5,641,4.120967741935484
2546117,5,B000EXZFS0,"To be able to enjoy this show on dvd is quite a thrill, considering it's been years since this show has been seen in syndication. I'd almost forgotten how truly adorable Buffy and Jody were during that first season! Anissa Jones was such an amazing talent. In the episode "" Mrs. Beasley, Where are you?"", instead of the character Buffy acting histerical over the loss of her beloved Mrs. Beasley doll, she had this amazing range of emotion of sadness that brought me to tears.

Johnnie Whitaker as Jody was perfectly cast as well. He was just darling when he kept doing bad things to get ""socked"" or severely punished to know how much his Uncle Bill loved him.

Well, I'm going through these episodes pretty quickly, so I hope the powers at be won't take too long to release the remaining 4 seasons of this wonderful family classic!!!",1152576000,6,834,4.590604026845638

2546120,5,B000EXZFS0,"I received my Season One DVD's in the mail from Amazon.com the other day and have been spending time watching Family Affair.

I love the show...always have, and the transfers are clear and clean.  Some of the other shows that have been put out on DVD in series format have not faired as well as this one has.

The episodes are in their entirety, which is awesome.  You get the opening, the opening theme music and titles, the show and also the closing titles.  Any Family Affair fan would be thrilled with this Season One offering...however, it's not without it's issues.

The extras are a photo gallery (not that many photos that they needed to put this on the DVD, but it's something) and a 15 minute interview with Kathy Garver.  Personally, I would have liked to see both Johnny Whitaker and Kathy Garver do this interview as he was one of the stars of this show as well (not to mention when you think of Family Affair, the characters that come to mind immediately are Buffy, Jody and Mrs. Beasley), and there are only two of this cast still alive to continue the legacy of this beloved show.  To exclude him from this is a travesty, and I hope that the company who's releasing this DVD  set (MPI) sees this and adds his commentary to the next 4 seasons.

All in all, it's a good product for a good price.  I like the packaging as well.  Everything in one place, and not the thin individual cases put into a larger slip case like box.

I'm looking forward to the upcoming seasons and finally having the entire series in my home so I can watch it at will.

2546121,3,B000EXZFS0,"It may be classic to some but in the overall scheme it's no Lucy or Honeymooners or Brady's. I Netflixed it and I have to say it's a good show but the kids are a bit young. Reading lines somewhat distractedly, you get the feeling the show is propped up by lisps and cuteness. I must say THEY ARE the cutest kids ever but it really isn't enough. Uncle Bill is fine. French is fine. The set up is interesting. But there just isn't any thing here to elevate it to the next level.

As far as nostaglia, it is errie to see the opening to this and to remember it as a child because I doubt I have seen it since I was 5 or 6. The credits are a bit of a mystery and it's hard to understand what they were going for. I think I would have preffered a tradional opening, showing the cast as opposed to flickering diamonds or whatever that was all about. The film print remastering could have used more work, many artifacts, and the sound is ""ok"", but this is all just typical MPI laziness. Better than the Hillbillies film remastering ""debacle"", but then the show is newer so that's to be expected. MPI is starting to feel like a bootlegger to me.

I will pass on this as a purchase but it was a fun watch.",1151539200,2,1195,4.102564102564102
2546122,4,B000EXZFS0,"Being the persistant pessimist that I am, I'll start with the cons.

The Cons:

1. You can't skip through the chapters. This means you must sit through the opening and closing credits every time. You 'can' fast-forward through them, but I've found that some episodes you can't (either my machine or the discs or sloppy production, not sure which).

2. I remember laughing at my sister for wanting a MRS BEASLEY doll. Now they routinely go for over $100.00 on eBay.

The Pros: IT'S FAMILY AFFAIR, ...ON DVD!!!",1151452800,4,508,4.738636363636363
2546123,5,B000EXZFS0,"I remember loving this TV show when I was very young and so I approached re-viewing it 40 years later with much trepidation because I was not sure how it would hold up. I didn't remember this sitcom being heavy with jokes and punchlines, so I worried that it might have aged badly. I'm very relieved to say that the 30 episodes in this set are wonderful and the entire cast is restrained, believable and talented. This is one of those heart-warmer comedies that aren't made any more. Its humor comes from the situations rather than a goofy setup or (worse yet) impossibly adult wisecracks coming out of the mouths of young children. When bachelor Bill Davis (Brian Keith) inherits the three children of his late brother and sister-in-law (Anissa Jones, Johnnie Whittaker and Kathy Garver), he and his butler (er ""gentleman's gentleman, Mr. French, played by Sebastian Cabot)find themselves suddenly having to raise three kids. Be forewarned, the first few episodes are real tear-jerkers as the kids continually believe they will be sent away to another relative. The DVD's picture is vibrant--it was one of the first color TV shows besides BONANZA-- and the stories are captivating.

The only confusing part of the DVD experience is that each episode begins with a pre-opening credits sequence--sometimes the scene that plays is a scene you'll see later in the episode and sometimes its the actual beginning of the episode, so don't be too quick to speed past the opening sequence. The DVD doesn't have chapter breaks within each episode. Sadly, there's no commentaries (only Garver and Whittaker are still alive from the core cast) but on the final disk, Garver hosts a special feature that takes you behind the scenes of the show and she's just as effusive and attractive as she was when she was first cast in the show--she was 18 when she was cast as 15-year-old Sissy. She also explains how Brian Keith agreed to do the TV show as long as he could film all his scenes one right after another (much the way Fred MacMurray did on MY THREE SONS), so he would only have to commit to a few months filming a TV show rather than a much lengthier filming period. This meant that many of the cast filmed their reaction shots to sequences weeks later. Even with this knowldge, its almost impossible to spot any odd continuity; it plays seemlessly--which is certainly high praise for William D. Russell, who directed all by the first episode.

Guests stars during this first season (1966)includes Myrna Loy, with reoccurring appearnaces by Heather Angel as another nanny, Miss Faversham. John Williams appears in episodes 18--26 as Mr French's brother, who looks after the family when his brother is called away (Cabot was ill at the time--can anyone explain why Cabot is wearing a bandage on his hand for almost half of the first season's episodes?).

Best episodes for season one include: the first show, ""Buffy""; ""Take Two Aspirin"" (ep #11, when Uncle Bill is in Mexico and Fench gets the flu); ""The Thursday Man"" (ep #13, which deepens the characters of Sissy and Mr French); ""All Around the Town"" (ep #17, where the twins get lost in the city); and ""Once In Love With Buffy"" (ep #21 when Aunt Fran returns and wants Buffy and Sissy to come live with her).

This is a DVD set well worth owning.

NOTE: One of the other reviews posted on Amazon complained that there was no list of the episodes on each disk. My set contained a glossy insert that listed all teh shows and noted which disk they were on. Maybe it was left out of his set. (Although, thanks for the helpful list of season one's episodes.)",1151193600,54,3598,4.722929936305732

I still have the old 45 of that song!!

Now I'm keeping my fingers crossed that they release the old TV series ""Please Don't Eat the Daisies"". The four Nash boys and that big old sheep dog, Lad, were favorites too! Hurry up guys, keep 'em comin'!!",1150588800,4,555,4.186915887850467

2546126,5,B000EXZFS0,"I could NOT WAIT for June 27; I hit the store early to buy this set!  I have not seen these shows uncut since the 70's.  In the late 80's, I taped a lot of them off of a local VHF channel, but they had much cut out of them, being in syndication.  This was my favorite show in the world growing up, and I am really excited about getting to share it with my own children.  I hope all the seasons will come out that quickly! The Walton DVDs are only released once a year, so at that rate I'll be waiting six more years to get them all!
Added on June 27:
  I am really pleased with this DVD set! The color is vibrant with a sharp picture, and the sound is clear.  The best thing is that the episodes are UNCUT!!  There are scenes in these episodes that I haven't seen since they were on broadcast T.V. My two young sons watched with me, and they thoroughly enjoyed it. I have to say it; this is great T.V. that you can watch with your family, and they don't make 'em like this today! Yea to MPI Video for putting out a wonderful show in a quality DVD set! I hope this review will lead someone else to purchase this set for their family.(By the way, Season 2 will supposedly be out in November.)",1149120000,7,1190,4.012711864406779
