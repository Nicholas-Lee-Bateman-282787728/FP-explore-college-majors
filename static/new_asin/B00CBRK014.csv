8580015,4,B00CBRK014,"I haven't actually seen this DVD yet but I have got the CD, and since I liked the CD so much I simply have to have the DVD as I think it will add more dimension to the songs by Teresa and the sounds by the HKPO.
The disc will be en route to NZ at this very moment.
I was first introduced to Teresa Carpio's voice circa 1970 when I used to travel in the East and brought back her tapes.
Finding her on DVD and still singing was like striking oil.
Today's songs and most singers I feel lack the vital element of song and that is emotion.
I can feel emotion with a capital E in Teresa's voice and all the great old favourites that she has brought back to life for me.
Most people do not know Tracey Haung, Ryoko Moriyama and Teresa Carpio but if you were living in the Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Andy Williams, Peggy Lee era you will know what I mean because songs were understandable then and 'Moon River' still evokes images of Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard sailing down the river in a small boat, and romance was king.
Sure I have tried Britney, Taylor, Beyonce etc and they are beautiful people but I don't know what they are singing about and there is far less emotion than the singers as Teresa, and you don't get much better than a great singer with a great orchestral backing viz Joni James at Carnegie Hall.
So being locked in the older generation and hearing voices from the past and near present has value and pleasure for me and I am so happy to know that both Ryoko and Teresa are still singing with the same great voices of 4 decades ago.

1 April, 2014.
Just received the disc and it went straight onto the sound/visual system and am delighted.
Altho the photography is a bit dated Teresa's crystal clear notes make up for this. This disc cost me about $50 to land but is worth every dollar and it will be a lucky guy to buy the remaining issue.
Just absorbing the single song ""Yesterday When I was Young"" has left my heart both sad and happy, pulsating and reflecting on the yesteryears and worth $50 for this song alone.
The HKPO is now playing Phantom of the Opera and I have not yet gone thru the second part of the concert nor played the accompanying Karaoke disc but I do know that I have bought real and historical value.
Thank you Amazon and Law Joseph from Hong Kong for your efficient despatch making my day so bright.
