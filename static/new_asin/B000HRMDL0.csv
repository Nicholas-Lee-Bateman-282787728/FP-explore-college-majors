2640210,5,B000HRMDL0,"Barbara Eden stars in Opposites Attract a made for TV Movie romantic comedy story about a woman who works for the mayor and when the mayor leaves office she runs for Mayor opposite a Ronald Reagan Clint Eastwood kind of actor played by John Forsythe. Originally during filming of the movie for TV  the film was going to be called Running Mates though the name of the film was changed before it premiered on TV.When it was shown on NBCTV October 17,1990 it was called Opposites Attract and it is a good comedy with Barbara Eden starring. It was kind of a Reunion for Barbara Eden since her Harper Valley co star Rod McCary co stars in Opposites Attract in a small role. Charles Levin who played Elliot in Alice and was in the pilot episode of The Golden Girls has a role in Opposites Attract. If you are a Barbara Eden Fan you would enjoy this DVD.",1208822400,,847,4.360759493670886
2640211,4,B000HRMDL0,"I have been a fan of Barbara Eden's for many years.  I do not remember seeing this film when it originally aired on TV, but I thought since I love Ms. Eden that I would take a chance and buy it.

It is very cute and entertaining.  Barbara Eden truly shines, as does John Forsythe (his performance reminds me a lot of Ronald Reagan).  The two have pretty good chemistry.  Conchata Ferrell also stars in the film as Barbara Eden's secretary/best friend.

The movie is about a public servant (Eden) who decides to run for mayor after an aging movie star (Forsythe) throws his hat into the ring.  The two soon find themsevles not just competing for votes, but also falling in love.

It is a very cute film, and I definitely recommend it.  What a bargain at that price too!",1196208000,12,768,4.390070921985815

8140894,4,B000HRMDL0,"Can a western movie star and a by-the-book town councilwoman find love?  They can if they're the dapper John Forsythe and the lovely Barbara Eden.  But first, they'll have to get past the fact that they are running against each other for mayor.

""Opposites Attract"" is a TV movie that first aired on October 17, 1990.  Forsythe (Dynasty, Bachelor Father) plays Rex Roper, a cowboy movie star who is a crowd-pleaser on the silver screen and even in the political arena, once he throws his cowboy hat into it.  Eden (I Dream of Jeannie) plays Charlie McKeon the serious-minded town supervisor of Crescent Bay, a picturesque town in northern California.

The two first meet when Rex shows up at a council meeting to request permission to install a jacuzzi for his new house in Crescent Bay.  Everyone on the town council votes yes, because, well...he is Rex Roper.  That is everyone except Charlie, who isn't swayed by his dashing good looks and charm.  She is swayed by the fact that there's a water shortage, and they have responsibilities to the community.  This prompts Rex, egged on by his bimbette girlfriend, played by Rebeca Arthur (Perfect Strangers), to run for mayor...against Charlie no less.

This is a cute movie that has a lot going for it.  It's so nice to see a romance between two mature adults.  Forsythe and Eden are both good in their roles and both are still so attractive.  Their acting isn't over-the-top; they feel like real people.
It's funny to watch the reality of how the masses will vote for anyone they like, rather than the actual issues or qualifications.  Rex Roper's on-screen persona is reminiscent of Clint Eastwood; one of his lines to an Indian in a western movie is:""Go ahead.  Bake my clay.""  Charlie's family and friends rallying around and supporting her when no one else is makes for good fun, especially the political commercials her son-in-law makes.  Charlie's family and friends include:  Ilene Gaff (Mr. Belvedere) as her sister and Conchata Ferrell.

The DVD quality is good.  The clarity & color show up well, which is a good thing when you are watching a movie with two pretty people in a pretty town.

If you are a fan of Forsythe or Eden or miss the light TV movies of yesteryear, you will enjoy this.  It's not laugh-out-loud funny.  It's a light story about two people falling in love.  If that gets your vote, then you'll  find ""Opposites Attract"" to be just the ticket.",1407628800,2,2424,4.725536992840095
