8373057,4,B002LG8DI2,"I originally had the Documentary of ""Vegas: The City The Mob Made"".  I was at one of my favorite haunts to buy movies today & found this 4 DVD combo of both Hollywood vs The Mob: fact vs Fiction & Vegas: the City the Mob Made for $3.99.  I figured what the heck, let me get it!!!!
  I have been enjoying this for the evening & I do like it quite a bit.  The worst I can say about this set: it gets a little dry (most documentaries are a bit dry anyways).  The Best: It really is a great set.  The price is very nice.  And it is very informative.
  Overall I give it four stars",1418947200,3,576,3.8461538461538463

On this set you'll find two documentaries: HOLLYWOOD VS THE MOB FACT VS FICTION ( 2008 ) and VEGAS: THE CITY THE MOB MADE ( 2010 ). This set contains 19 episodes, for more than 19 hours of fascinating documentary about the Mafia, Organized Crime, Hollywood, Las Vegas, the 30's and 40's, the Movie Industry, and so much more. If, like me, you buy plenty of books or DVDs about the history of The Mafia/Organized crime then this DVD set will be a nice addition to your collection. The first documentary, HOLLYWOOD VS THE MOB, might not be for everybody and will probably won't appeal to people who want to watch a documentary strictly about the Mafia. You see, this documentary is more about Gangsters movies than about the actual gangsters. You'll find profiles of Capone, Luciano and others, plus an history of how the Mafia came to America, but it's mostly about the movies and the influence that these men/events had on the movie Industry. At first I wasn't sure if I liked it or not, but it's something different and this 9-parts documentary is interesting and very well researched. The narrator, the music and the informations given to us are all great. Then VEGAS: THE CITY THE MOB MADE is without a doubt the best documentary ever made about Las Vegas and one of the best documentaries ever released by Mill Creek Entertainment. This great Documentary is a mix of so many things I find interesting: History, The Mob, The 30's-40's...I am a sucker for everything about History and everything about The Mafia, so I really enjoyed watching this 10-parts documentary. Same thing for this documentary, both the narrator and music are great, and the episodes are full of fascinating information.

So overall this is a very good collection, one that I highly recommend. If you enjoy watching documentaries about the Mafia, Organized Crime, the 30's-40's, History or if you enjoy watching old Gangsters movies then this DVD will be a great addition to your collection. If you want a documentary about the Mafia and nothing else then I highly recommend CRIME INC, the amazing documentary released in 1984, available here on Amazon for a very good price. :)
