2701201,5,B000LAZDQA,"Americans are so hung up about sex: Show an american a sex-scene and they totally loose their marbles, and the film rating system reflects this. This film is about people trying to find completion in their life, whether it's having an orgasm, having a sense of self-worth, realizing ones dreams.

The film attempted to tackle the dispair felt by a group of people outside the normal moires of society. The shortbus club provided an accepting community, a place where the main characters could be themselves, in the same manner that the sexual therapist attempted to provide a safe place for her clients to talk through their problems.

An excellent movie, sure to provoke some reaction in the viewing audience.",1168560000,32,710,4.957983193277311
2701202,5,B000LAZDQA,"yes there is explicit sex and nudity but don't let that either put you off or be your reason for watching this film.

The fact that the sex is explicit and unashamed normalises it and allows sexual conductn to be viewed in its context on the same basis as other conduct.

I can't wait to see it on DVD.",1168473600,13,302,4.101694915254237
2701203,5,B000LAZDQA,"I don't know if any of you heard the hoopla that was going around about this film, or even if you heard of it at all, but here it is in a nutshell:  John Cameron Mitchell (Hedwig and the Angry Inch) wanted to make a movie that doesn't turn sex into a dirty thing but at the same time doesn't hide sex either.  The big controversy over Shortbus is the fact that it definitely does NOT hide the sex.  It's all there in it's full glory with full penetration and everything...even an orgy or two.

Now that that's out of the way...Shortbus is not a porn movie.  It's not even one of those high class Michael Lucas porn movies that have stories in between all the sex.

What it is is a story about a handful of people who meet each other and who are all broken in some way.  The sex therapist who has never had an orgasm.  The former hustler who thinks he's only worth what people paid for him.  The dominatrix who longs to be an artist and live in a house.

They all meet and revolve around each other in a search for themselves.  And it's a fun movie and frank and open and it celebrates life and sex and living...

I'm torn about the actual sex in the movie, however.  I think the movie would've been just as effective--and much more palatable to the wide audience that it deserves--without the full on sex but at the same time the sex was part of the story and woven into it so well that you really don't think about it.  You're certainly not going to be getting off to it even with the full on penetration and fellatio and rimming--including one hilarious scene where three characters are having sex and they all start singing the Star Spangled Banner...one of them singing the song into the posterior of one of the others!--and S&M, etc.

Regardless of that I honestly think this was an incredible film.  When it was over I felt good and I can't say that about many movies.

If you're open minded and not put off by people having actual sex in a non pornographic film definitely check Shortbus out.  It was an amazing film and definitely worth watching.",1167868800,39,2054,4.318537859007833
2701204,5,B000LAZDQA,"Any supposedly straight (as opposed to a soft or hard pornographic film) that begins with a montage of sex scenes featuring both men and women in full disclosure is alright with me.

That I was witnessing this montage in a suburban multiplex (ok albeit an ""art house"") eating popcorn popped in Canola Oil and sipping a diet Sprite, sitting next to two blue hairs (who promptly exited, only after it might be noted, the completion scenes) only added to the surrealism of the situation.

Jamie (played by PJ DeBoy with a hang dog expression and tear welled eyes of which you soon grow weary) begins the film totally nude, filming himself auto fellating but blows the scene by doing just that too early.

Jamie is gay and a former street hustler and lives with James (Paul Dawson) in a decidedly one-way relationship: James loves Jamie and Jamie loves himself and says that he ""feels nothing, nothing at all.""

Jamie and James consult a sex therapist, Sofia (Sook Yin Lee) for help and guidance and during their first session, Sofia blurts out that she has never had an orgasm.

The solution? All three hoof it out to Shortbus: a sort of Plato's Retreat in which all manner of sex is performed in every position by every conceivable combination of men and women. Not all participate, no one is pressured, many just watch pretty much as we in the audience are doing: mouths agape, wondering how did Mitchell get the money to make this movie and more to the point: how did he get it released?

Justin Bond (played by himself), manager/chorus master/drum majorette of Shortbus describes and dissects the Club's ethos as ""like the 60's but with less hope.""

Director John Cameron Mitchell (the brilliant ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"") wants to titillate of course but he also wants to illuminate. And most of his characters do come out the backdoor better, smarter more self aware than when they entered. Not everything works. Some scenes are awkward and silly but Mitchell infuses the film with energy and social and emotional weight that cannot be denied.

Redemption through the cleansing and illuminating properties of Sex? Revolutionary.",1167782400,158,2133,4.84065934065934

2701206,5,B000LAZDQA,"This is an outstanding movie about working through dysfunctional relationships. It left me with a warm happy feeling. I was surprised that reviewers dwelled on the nudity and sexual activities. Maybe readers who did not know or recognize John Cameron Mitchell's name from Hedwig, were put off by the suggestion that this might be a pornographic movie. That's just not so. Sex is part of life, and definitely an important part of human relationships. Its presence was simply honest and real.

For me, the takeaway message was that we're all riding the Shortbus in one way or another, so be kind to ourselves and each other.",1166918400,23,622,4.867924528301887
2701207,5,B000LAZDQA,"I will admit, One of the main reasons I wanted to see this movie was because of the buzz about it being one of the most sexually explicit movies ever made in the non-porn industry. I didn't really expect to find the movie interesting, I just wanted to see what everyone was talking about.

The first minute or so was nothing but explicit sex and I almost turned the movie off thinking it was going to be pointless, that this was all there was to the movie, but I had nothing better to do so I kept watching.

This movie is not porn, nor is it erotica. This movie IS an uncensored look at the truth about love and sex, and is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is brutally honest, thought provoking, intense at times, and funny at others. These are characters that we can relate to, because they are real.

I can not say enough positive things about this movie, it is art, it is truth, it is exceptional.

It will definitely be a part of my DVD collection.",1166140800,321,973,4.21505376344086

2701211,5,B000LAZDQA,"Ok, look - its about sex. Yes, there's unsimulated sex. But this isn't porn. You're better off surfing the web if you're looking to get your rocks off. What this IS, is one of the few films I've ever seen that has a positive view of sex that doesn't turn a positive view into a melodramatic negative morality trip in the end. The exploration of sexuality is excellent in that many viewpoints are presented through the characters, which highlights how complex, amazing, and occasionally frustrating sexual experience can be. Plainly, this ain't for homophobes, prudes or conservatives. It is for anyone who would like some food for thought when it comes to relationships and sex.

I was left with both a sadness and a satisfaction in that people were grappling with the issues in their lives and how they were working through them.

2701228,5,B000LAZDQA,"I just wrote a review for Citizen Kane, considered to be one of the great films of all time.  I thought it was boring and uninteresting.

Shortbus, in contrast, from start to finish, was imaginative and creative with numerous characters to delve inside.  The opening sequence to the marching band at the end and with all the sex in between, this film is a tour de force of creativity.  The complexity of characters and how they connect to one another is fascinating.  The underlying messages throughout--9/11, suicide, female orgasm and the profound artistic nature of people fuels this film.

Step aside Citizen Kane.  Shortbus is a far, far better film",1464566400,2,654,4.890909090909091

The base story line involves a sex therapist who has never quite achieved an orgasm -- a humorous premise to be sure -- and the friends who try to help her get to that magic moment. But the film isn't so much about sex as it is about relationships and emotional connections. The characters are well written and acted, and the script contains a nicely balanced mix of humor, irony, pathos, drama, and -- yes, a lot of sex. But the sex fully supports the story line and not the other way around. In short, this is a movie about emotional intimacy, connection and friendship.

2701260,5,B000LAZDQA,"SHORTBUS contains a forthright, unalloyed and unapologetic depiction of the diversity of human sexual behavior in all its exuberance, terrors and complexity as it relates to its characters as whole persons.  This film is not about sex, but sexuality, as others have noted.  Profound, moving, and very human, I think it's a masterpiece that rewards repeated viewings--and I don't mean for obvious reasons. .>

I watched this film for the first time as a film buff.  Sure, I wanted to see the sex, but I was also curious about how the fact of actors having real sex on screen would be used dramatically.  As Pauline Kael, the great film critic for The New Yorker once pointed out, no matter how graphic the sex, merely seeing grappling bodies doesn't tell us what it MEANT to the characters.  You still need the kittenish smile on Scarlett's face the morning after her night with Rhett.

Then there's also the matter of the suspension of disbelief.  The usual reaction to seeing genitals is to be thrown right out of the movie.  We stop seeing a character and wonder at the body and the experience of the actor instead.  In SHAME (2011), powerful as it was, I stopped seeing the pain of the sex-addicted main character Brandon and instead saw a famous actor, Michael Fassbinder, frontally nude on a movie set.  I started speculating on Fassbender's sex life instead of Brandon's.

Thus I was fascinated to see how SHORTBUS director John Cameron Mitchell would overcome these dramatic obstacles to make the sex seamless and expressive, rather than jarring, and how it might actually advance the story.

What Mitchell--with his excellent and totally believable cast--achieved is a unique view of sexuality on screen that is neither pornographic nor prurient.  Nor is it detached and clinical--the other extreme.  With high, Hollywood-quality production values, there's nothing sleazy in the way this movie looks.  The animations of New York City that become an essential part of the plot are visually delightful.

As someone who has participated in the type of group love-making shown in the Shortbus club, I'd have to say it was never that glamorous or choreographed.  Nor were the bodies and the lighting ever that lush.  But, there was a fever in the air that the film catches of joyous transgression, uninhibited self-expression, underlying angst, and genuine striving to make deeper human connection.  I found the explicit depiction of sex essential to capturing that atmosphere, and thus it never felt gratuitous or sensationalized.  The ""sextras"" weren't whoring.  They reflected true affection and the best of what these gatherings can be about.

On second viewing, I got past the novelty of the sex scenes and discovered a deeply wise and compassionate meditation on the universal striving for love, acceptance and belonging.  The film confronts the characters and the audience with the basic questions:  Do you want to be loving?  Are you willing to let someone love you?  If so, how do you forgive yourself and others in that often confounding endeavor?  Because there will be times when it really hurts and you really screw up, and when someone might really screw you up.

Mitchell summed it up in his commentary on the film:  ""All [the characters] are kind of numb from 9/11, and Bush, and growing up gay, and growing up in a cultural environment where your body is bad, and what's natural is immoral...Where you're bombarded by media and sex all the time but there is no connection to humanity.""  The improvised scenes growing out of the actors creating the story in workshop could have resulted in an incoherent mess.  But Mitchell kept the vision on track that guided the cast, which resulted in a beautifully realized focus for the film.  The expert editing also aids immeasurably in developing the theme Mitchell points to in the commentary.

Thank you, John Cameron Mitchell and the SHORTBUS cast for showing us that struggle in such an innovative, thoughtful and (pun intended) penetrating way.",1419206400,,4010,4.989457831325301

2701281,5,B000LAZDQA,"I recently acquired a copy of the film ""Shortbus"" because I am writing an essay on independent films around the world. I found out the movie has been long out-of-print so the price was extremely expensive. Was I sorry I bought the DVD? IN no way. ""Shortbus"" is everything a film should be: entertaining, funny, sad and most of all well-written and acted.

 The film's story deals with a group of New Yorkers, gay, straight and bi who all have problems in their relationships or their singleness. They meet at an apartment called the ""Shortbus"" where everything goes, sort of what happened back in the sixties with ""love-ins"" where people are allowed to search for themselves and ""play"" with others in a safe and discreet environment.

 The characters are well defined and the script is simply superb and what amazed me was that none of the actors are mainstream stars. The sex scenes may upset some viewers, but they were needed in the film to give it reality and dramatic elements.

A complex tale with interweaving stories involving love and the search for sexual satisfaction.  This film is funny, moving, happy, bleak, sexy, gross and more, depending on the point you're at in the plot.
Most of the performers are quite attractive and enjoyable to watch, and most are also good actors.  The film can be quite mysterious and unique at times, and will give you much to think about.

2701288,4,B000LAZDQA,"The notion of legitimate actors engaging in explicit on-screen sex as part of story and character isn't quite as new as it seems.  Frank Ripploh, for example, shocked the hell out of audiences in 1980 when he did exactly that in the German art-house favorite TAXI ZUM KLO.  Even so, thirty years later it isn't exactly the norm, so I came to SHORTBUS with considerably curiosity ... and discovered the movie wasn't what I expected it to be at all.

In some respects, SHORTBUS is what you might expect if Robert Altman directed such a film--it has a very mosaic-like quality and an open-ended conclusion.  Even so, there is a central plot.  Sofia (Sook-Yin Lee) is a sex-therapist who has been faking orgasms with her husband all these years.  Indeed, she's never had one at all.  Her frustrations explode when she is visited by two gay men, James and Jamie (Paul Dawson and PJ DeBoy), who are debating whether or not to have an open relationship; in frustration with Jamie's superficial attitudes she slaps him and then must explain herself.  When she does so, they invite her join her at Shortbus, a sort of salon where members do everything from drugs to performance art to sex.

At this point the story takes off in two different directions, one focused on Sofia as she goes in search of an orgasm and one focused on the secretly suicidal James as he works to find a replacement for himself to live with Jamie after he is dead.  Sofia meets and becomes involved with a dominatrix named Severin (Lindsay Beamish); James and Jamie become involved first with Ceth (Jay Brennan) and then later with Caleb (Peter Stickles.)  Along the way the various characters admit to a series of personal issues ranging from past abuse to depression to inadequacy.  One way or another, all of them struggle to feel they belong, and that struggle generally involves sex.  And make no mistake, SHORTBUS is crammed with explicit sex, including penetration, oral sex, and ejaculation.

If this sounds dark, it isn't.  If anything, SHORTBUS is a fairytale painted in attractive, glossy colors, and although it has any number of touching moments, it is actually very, very funny.  But my criticism of the film is that it is too attractive, too glossy, too touching, too funny.  There's not much in the way of genuine grit or even any degree of reality, and the story and characters give up all their secrets in a single viewing.  Enjoyable for what it is, but in truth it is very slight.

2701297,4,B000LAZDQA,"Shortbus is a film about sexual relationships that takes both a humorous and very direct almost documentary approach with none of the falseness of commercial porn. There are several sets characters who attempt to negotiate relationships and struggle to find satisfaction.' The different plot strands come together at a club called Shortbus.  There is sex therapist who is unable to experience orgasm.  And frustration, disappointment and awkwardness is very much part of the film's subject.  Nothing is prettied up with overly emphatic lighting design and the character's desire and longing is portrayed in a straightforward and subtle style.  The film neither pathologizes unconventional sex, as mainstream productions frequently do nor does it present some ""no consequences"" sexual utopia.  There are times when the pace seems to drag and when the diffuse plot lines meander and lose tension and drive but on the whole and an impressive suggestion at what a mature and frank future cinema could look like.  it represents, at least in part, an example of what I'd like to do in my own future productions.

I was totally and utterly disgusted by the sex in this film. Sex is supposed to be an intimate thing between a married man and a woman who love each other and want to show it, not public! Do not watch if you're offended by public and animalistic sex. There was even oral and anal sex in it, which to me is not human!",1311811200,,584,4.407407407407407
2701305,5,B000LAZDQA,"Right off, I feel like I need to tell anyone who is planning on seeing this film, that it has adult content and situations that most people are not used to seeing in the mainstream cinema.

I mean, this film has displays of human interaction that most directors have NEVER filmed in mainstream cinema EVER. So filmgoers PLEASE be warned before you watch!!!

Moving on, I'd say this movie is basically about want. There's one character, the character who is a couples counselor, who wants to have an (Oh...I think a LOT of you know what I want to say.) But the thing is, is that this particular character seems to have an 'abundant' relationship with her husband (if you know what I mean), so why she has NEVER had an (Oh...you know what I'm getting at) is BEYOND me?

I mean, a better character development for her would've been if she had quite the opposite with her husband. Because to see the two of them go at it--like at the very beginning of the movie, it's kinda shocking (to say the least) that the two of them have NEVER hit pay dirt. I think that for this part of the movie, the screenplay sorta over thunk the wheel.

Though nevertheless, this dilemma is the reason we are pretty much introduced to the 'Shortbus' a type of social club where individuals go to meet and experience other people for these particular 'encounters' of...(well, insert adult content here.)

I guess this couples counselor feels like this is the ONE place that will help her get to what she's trying to find--even though, given her status as a sex therapist/counselor, you'd think she'd approach this place with a certain amount of suspicion. Though wouldn't she be the eager beaver!

Though backing up a little, she finds out about this 'Shortbus' place because of the couple she is currently treating--the two Jamie's--though one of them is now going by the name James.

Going back to the theme of want, Jamie just wants to sustain his relationship with James--hence their session with the counselor.

The want of James...well, that's a little more complicated because he has these issues that's making him quite depressed--he even takes pills to try to combat this depression. Only he's thinking ahead a bit and not wanting his lover Jamie to be...well, alone, initiates the two of them going to the 'Shortbus' to meet a third person.

On the surface, this premise seems quite intriguing--aren't all threesomes supposed to be this way? Only James has a sort of ulterior motive working, because deep down he knows just how depressed he really is and well, because of this depression, he knows how things are probably going to turn out...so, like I said, he doesn't want his lover Jamie to be alone.

Now just moving to this part of the film, I can honestly say that I was 'IN'. Forget that James and Jamie and their newly found third lover Ceth (pronounced Seth) move things along rather quickly to the point where they're all pretty much engaged in certain 'activities'. By this point, I was 'IN'!!! REALLY, I was!!! But then...I don't (can't) really elaborate on what happens. Though I CAN say that the national anthem is sung by Jamie and all I could think at that point was 'I'M OUT'!!! Because to have to have Jamie sing the anthem (as it were) was sooo unnecessary. It's like the director was afraid to do the scene straight (seriously, no pun intended!) And so he had to insert these 'funny' moments. Though to me, they came off as 'funny odd'?

It's like I wish I could've told the director to trust his audience to be able to take the scene as it was. Or as it could've been.

Because all of the silliness of the singing of the national anthem, sorta reduced the scene and really threw it away. Like the scene could've really did something amazing. It could've shed some light and truth and honesty. And been really powerful. Only with the singing, the whole thing came off as a big 'WHAT'?

And the thing that kills me, is that the actors involved in the scene were TOTALLY on board with the whole thing. (And that's what can make an audience be on board too!) I mean, I didn't notice any of the actors holding back, so why did it seem as though the director was holding back? (By resorting to comedy.)

I felt like this movie did this a lot. It was all trying to be out there with this level of (well, insert adult content here) but then it would sorta turn the corner with all this zany stuff--like this big confrontational scene at the 'Shortbus' between the couple's counselor and this guy who's been hanging kinda close to James and Jamie. Well, because of this egg the counselor is 'holding' onto, here comes more of the zaniness.

Oh well, this movie did a lot. (Was this movie supposed to be a comedy?) I guess I just wish it could've been more dramatic.

2701310,3,B000LAZDQA,"I have mixed reviews about shortbus.  I heard about it here on amazon because of all the rave reviews and the appeal of the sexuality. In retrospect, I am confused on all the perfect reviews of this movie.  Beware! There are spoilers!

From the beginning scene to the end, I was definitely enthralled and did not look away.  I am not used to seeing sex on film so raw, so real, so gay (sorry but I've never seen a gay porn) yet not be a porn movie.  For the most part, I thought the actors and actresses did a remarkable job.  How brave they all must be to bare all in a non-porn setting!  And I certainly admire the vision, or at least my interpretation of the vision, which is to show sex and relationships in a way Hollywood will never grant us--lifelike.  I like that it tries to demolish the uptight American view of sexuality and catch us up with the rest of the world (Europe, anyway.)  And I like that this movie was seemingly made for women and gay men; although I'm straight I liked the openness and relaxed nature that Hollywood would never portray to this audience.  The actors and actresses were very beautiful but in a realistic way; the female form never looked so good and was paired with men and women alike, without the unbelievable airbrushing and body doubles in movies today.  And it was kind of nice that the penis was not the forbidden genital like in all our movies outside of porn.  But there many things I did not particularly like- at times the story and the acting were lacking.

The story I liked at times but overall it felt shallow and poorly thought out.  And some things did not make a lick of sense.  A sex therapist that is pre-orgasmic and blows up at her clients, physically assaulting them?  And after, following them to a sex club without her love being aware?  What sense did it make that Jennifer (sorry severin) formed a bond with our troubled sex therapist by taking a polaroid of an unbelievable dialogue between Sofia and a group of strangers?  I guess the therapist had no awareness that her view on sex and her sex life was sad, pathetic, and misguided.

Rob seemed to be pretty damn carefree regarding Sofia's actions throughout the whole movie.  I don't know if this was poor writing or acting.  I also like how Sofia never consulted her true love one time before kissing or touching strangers.  Nor did most of the characters for that matter, save James and Jamie, and their ease of bringing a stranger into the relationship was totally unbelievable.

And the vibrator scene?  Completely ridiculous.  In this scene both Sofia and Rob failed miserably in selling this to the audience.

And the worst part of this movie by far was the stalker.  Wow.  Anything to do with that poorly written and performed character was completely unbelievable and laughable.  He works from home and has been watching and following everyone for years without anyone noticing.  Right.  I don't care if you're gay or straight or what- you would call the cops in a second and be furious if you found that you had a stalker.  Why did Jamie have sex with him at the end of the movie? And why did his frantically worried partner smile at him across the alleyway?  Don't you think James would have been a little upset?  Thanks for the call to let me know you're alive Jamie, and I'm glad your sleeping with a creep 20 feet from our place.

I'm glad Sofia finally discovered an orgasm; you'd think being a sex therapist and all she'd have the resources or at least be able to seek professional assistance to resolve this before now.

The ending... How disappointed I was to see everything wrapped up in a neat little happy package at the end of the movie just like all our Hollywood mainstream movies.

I know this review is harsh especially in comparison to the others, and I know that alot of hard work was put into this, but overall it was just ok and it certainly doesn't deserve all the perfect ratings.",1292976000,2,3930,4.507779349363508

The language means those who are looking for something for their church friends to share at the ice cream social can't even turn off the picture and listen. It is life in the socially raw climes.

Having said that, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. But, as a formerly practicing bisexual and currently gay man, I would, wouldn't I? You might not.

It is a few days in the life of a sex therapist and several other characters in various colorations of repression from emotionally locked up to out there around Jupiter in matters of sexual expression.

2701313,4,B000LAZDQA,"Bottom-Line: Shortbus is at times physically stimulating, but not as much as it is emotionally and mentally) arousing; and aren't those the two erogenous zones that matter most in sex?

It's a sad testimony to American cinema that the vast majority of (Hollywood produced) movies come and go without much in the memory to mark their passing.  In their effort to appeal to a mass world-wide audience the denizens of the America's entertainment empire have taken to producing (mostly) movies without much heart, soul, or message.  Thankfully independent film producers and distributors (in this case Think Films) have stepped in and are beginning to release films that bring edge, promise, and meaning back to American cinema.  Such a movie is the (NC-17, sexually explicit ) Shortbus (2006), a biting, edgy, sex laden amusing romp set in contemporary New York City, written and directed by John Cameron Mitchell (Hedwig and the Angry Inch).

Variety Magazine called Shortbus ""The most sexually graphic American narrative feature ever made outside the realm of the porn industry."" And make no mistake Shortbus is sexually graphic with depictions of real oral/vaginal sex, and masturbation.  Both heterosexual and homosexual are given equal time here folks so keep the kiddies far away from this movie.

But despite the graphic nature of the sex in Shortbus, the film turns out to be a rather funny yet engaging film about sex, relationships, and people enjoying or trying to enjoy sex.  The sex is just a by-product of the relationships the individuals form over the course of the film; dare I say it flows naturally, it does not pretend to be, it just is.
You know what you are in for from the opening frames of the film when James (Paul Dawson) is videotaping himself in the bathtub and playing with his penis (yes it is shown, there is full frontal nudity here folks) and then engages in a limber display of self-stimulation complete with (filmed) climax.  His home video at first seems narcissistic and even pornographic, but as the film progresses we get to know James for the deeply sad person he is and the reason for the film.  James is dad even as his (monogamous) partner of five years Jamie (P.J. DeBoy), is decidedly chipper and upbeat; i.e. his emotional polar opposite.  Jamie is almost frenzied, extroverted and just wants to love everybody, and want everybody to love him.

Sensing something is wrong with James and their relationship, Jamie suggests that they experiment sexually with other people and this leads to a rather comical group sex (orgy) scene at a local apartment; the gathering is referred to as a Shortbus. Their search for answers also leads them to a sex therapist (who prefers to be called a couples therapist) named Sofia (Sook-Yin Lee).  During the opening sequence of the movie she is seen having wild engaging in (un-simulated) wild sex with her husband Rob (Raphael Barker) in every room in their apartment and trying positions straight from the Kama Sutra how-to manual.  But we soon learn that Sophia is pre-orgasmic (her term) meaning she has never had an orgasm--even through self stimulation and has been faking them for years in order to spare her husband ego.  So that the fact that she's a sex therapist proves to be one of the most deliciously ironic sub-plots of the movie, as she tries again and again to achieve one.

And then there is Severin (Lindsay Beamish) a dominatrix who is so closed off that she forbids anyone to touch her, though she surrounds herself with Polaroid's she takes of random people.  But she is lonely and longs for a normal life with a house, white picket fence, little ones, and vaginal orgasms.  And there is Ceth (Jay Brannan) who becomes the (brief) third in James and Jamie's relationship. Finally, there is a very flamboyant Justin Bond who runs Shortbus and a Caleb (Peter Stickles) a voyeuristic young man who has been watching James and Jamie from his apartment across the street.

The cast of Shortbus is composed of mostly unknowns and newcomers; it's hard to image any Hollywood ""A"" listed actor/actress going as far as the characters did in the movie for the sake of their art-form (though Chloe Sevigny did her part in 2003's Brown Bunny).  But the lack of star presence lent a nice layer of realism to the film it might otherwise have lacked.

The most poignant and challenging performances in Shortbus belong to Paul Dawson and Sook-Yin Lee, though the movie must have been challenging for all involved give the nature of the film.  And yet after I finished watching Shortbus it was not so much the explicit sex that stayed with me--though it left its mark--it was the deeper meaning of the film; trying to puzzle out the reasons for the various characters sexual hang-up's and other emotional trauma's.  Why did Sofia's orgasm continue to elude her; why is James so profoundly sad, so much so that he plans to take his own life; why is Severin so closed off?

In the end what makes Shortbus such an eye-opening American film is not the explicit sex contained therein, but that the movie is not afraid to explore it in such a grown up manner; it does not titillate, nor does it insult, is shows us sex as it would be if the camera were not there.  To be sure Shortbus is at times physically stimulating, but not as much as it is emotionally and mentally) arousing; and aren't those the two erogenous zones that matter most in sex?

2701315,5,B000LAZDQA,"If it wasn't for his work in ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" I would never have known the name John Cameron Mitchell. So, I was surprised when I heard that he had written and directed, ""The most sexually explicit American movie ever made outside the porn industry."" I didn't really want to see it... and avoided it for the past three years. You must understand that, ""Hedwig"" had touched me on such a deep and profound level, that I didn't want to see, what I supposed would be, a misstep by one of the creators.

I've read enough reviews to see I am not spoiling anything by writing that most of the sex takes place in the first 10 minutes... that's not to say there is not enough sexual content in the remainder of the movie to warrant an ""X"" rating, but, once you are 10 minutes in, there is no slippery slope any longer!

The movie is definitely not a porn flick. Once the characters are established the sex is no longer the novelty you might expect it will be. You are living these peoples lives with them-only uncensored.

I believe this was the next, most logical direction for Mitchell to go in, as an artist. I consider it of the best movies I have ever seen. It was very real.

I can't give enough praise about this movie.  Like, ""Hedwig"" It touched me deeply and profoundly. I wish it was around when I first came out of the closet.",1289520000,,1339,4.318725099601593

I laughed, I cried, I wanted to scream....it was everything I could ever want in a movie. Deeply moving and entertaining. Be prepared, there is a lot of sex in this movie but it's artistic rather than pornographic. It's very beautiful. Where is Shortbus?? I want to go!",1285200000,,570,4.287037037037037

In some words, this movie shows what a state of sexual confusion can mean to some People.  Pleasantly ok with the movie. But is about average.  Reminds me a lot of a ""B"" movie.

2701324,4,B000LAZDQA,"Shortbus (2006) written/directed by John Cameron Mitchell (Hedwig and the Angry Inch) is truly not for the easily offended. It is the film like nothing I've seen before and I've seen many films. It should be named Real Sex and the City or Every Thing You Always Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask had not the latter title been taken already by Woody Allen. Actually you don't have to ask anything - you will get more information and graphic answers that you ever would hope for. This is the film where the graphical sex scenes are in abundance, they are extremely explicit. John Cameron Mitchell means business, and he gets down to it. By his own words,

""In the old days, when you couldn't show sex on film, directors like Hitchcock had metaphors for sex (trains going into tunnels, etc). When you can show more realistic sex, the sex itself can be a metaphor for other parts of the character's lives. The way people express themselves sexually can tell you a lot about who they are. Some people ask me, ""couldn't you have told the same story without the explicitness?"" They don't ask whether I could've done Hedwig without the songs. Why not be allowed to use every paint in the paint box?"" John Cameron Mitchell

But after the initial shock, you realize that there are ideas, feelings, the attempt to understand the important things - what do we want? What is sex for us? How to understand ourselves first of all, how to communicate your desires, how to fulfill them? Shortbus is totally honest; it does care about its characters, and tells their stories of struggling with all sorts of existential difficulties, sexual or not, without condescending, with the equal dozes of sweetness, wit, and understanding. The film was made by a talented filmmaker. The beginning scenes would certainly grab your attention while introducing a viewer to few New Yorkers whose lives will be intertwined later. The music score and the songs are nice and set a melancholic mood, they provide a welcomed rest for the passengers on the Shortbus. The cast that consists mainly of non-professional first time performers, did a convincing job. It is not porn, it is an independent dramedy that uses sex scenes to answer many questions about life.

The DVD includes the documentary Gifted and Challenged: The Making of 'Shortbus'. I found the Making... quite interesting and a lot of fun.

The film did not run properly after about 1 hour and 20 minutes, it started nreaking down digitally. The seller does not provide replacements, only money back. Logically, if one of the batch was improperly copied by the manufacturer, so likely are the others.

2701328,1,B000LAZDQA,"Back in 2007, I was having a passionate dinner conversation with
some artsy friends of mine who are film students.
They swore by all that they held holy that I WOULD JUST LOVE this
indie film called ""Shortbus"", which they said was so clever, well-written,
well-acted, etc., and I bought their recommendation (quite literally!)
hook, line & sinker! (-: (I guess P.T. Barnum was right about suckers!)

The next day, I ordered this film from Amazon and couldn't wait to get it
to see just what all their raving was about!
They had guided me to some really good indie films in the past,
so I had no reason to doubt their taste...
THAT IS, UNTIL I POPPED THIS SEX-FUELED DIRECTIONLESS FAUX ARTISTIC HODGE-PODGE
into my DVD player and immediately thought after 15 minutes...
What the hell is this??--NO, REALLY!!
Now I'm not a prude, I have no problem with nudity, various sexual
preferences, etc., but c'mon!!--That's all this film is really about
is shock value based on a myriad of different people of different races,
varied sexual persuasions, from all over NYC having sex 1-on-1, in 3-somes,
groups, dominatrix, and all other manner of swings & things!
There is a sparse plot that is liquid & murky as quicksand and sinks twice as fast!
No real substance, no real story, just writhing, moaning, undulating bodies---
drab dialogue--rinse & repeat. It gets lost in all the sensationalism.
Which I have found to be a sure fire indicator when any substance or
true artistic merit is lacking! They try to have a moment of revelation
and light towards the end, but by then, it's all just so misguided that you don't even care anymore!
I watched the whole thing all the way through, then called up my
artsy friends and expressed my severe disappointment in ways that I could
never repeat in this review and expect to get it published!
They insisted that I completely ""missed it"", and gave back as good as they got!
We didn't speak for 2 weeks afterwards! (LOL!!)
Myself and most of my friends are high strung, passionate,
stubborn artistic types, so these passionate discussions and
mini blow-outs are standard fare within our circle!  Just like family! (-:

In my summation though, NOPE, I don't recommend this movie to ANYBODY
who values cinema or stories with plots which are well-written, well-told,
directed or acted with an semblence of credibility!
In fact, my friends wound up buying the copy of this DVD
that I bought from Amazon from me for a slightly discounted fee! (-:

2701330,1,B000LAZDQA,"Sofia (Sook-Yin Lee) is a relationship's expert. Her husband Rob (Raphael Barker) open this film with a very graphic sexual encounter. Whilst Sofia finds the sex satisfying, ironically, given her profession, she is yet to have an orgasm. This quest becomes one of the themes of the film.

She meets clients James (Paul Dawson - who looks a lot like Mark Whalberg) and Jamie (PJ DeBoy), a gay couple having their own relationship problems. They recommend to her to attend a club called ""Shortbus"" which is an anything goes sex club.

Sofia protests to all that she is in a very happy relationship with her husband, whom she loves. Her relationship with him seems to be happy. She stumbles upon a group of lesbians including Severin (aka Jennifer) (Lindsay Beamish) who we see earlier in the film as a dominatrix. Severin can't form a relationship with anyone. Sofia breaches professional guidelines by both acting as counsellor for Severin, and having sex with her.

That's the problem with this film. Whilst it is trying to promote a 'guilt-free' sex enviornment ultimately several of the lead characters continue to have relationship problems. All they end up doing is realigning their sex partners. This then becomes the social engineering message of the film. That: relationships don't matter, sex does. I found this annoying given that the film argues against itself in that several of the characters still desire to have relationships. Sure James and Jamie become a foursome (with the addition of Caleb, their stalker (Peter Stickles) and Ceth (Jay Brannan)), but the others do not progress to their own desired outcome.

2701336,5,B000LAZDQA,"John Cameron Mitchell's SHORTBUS is among on of the best feature films of a different breed.  It is intensely and graphically sexual; but, it's so much more.  It is masterfully performed by a highly original cast.  The collaborative process and the ""making of"" features add another perspective.  Real sex, real characters that are flesh-and-blood people that we can relate to on multiple levels.  Highly emotional at points; but, funny, provocative, and philosophically challenging to a variety of individual interpretations of the feature.

If someone thinks this is ""just porno"", they've missed the point.  If a person views THE ENTIRE MOVIE with an open, they will be pleasantly surprised at the emotional and intellectual depth of characters fleshed out; and, how everything really does ""work out in the end"".

The music is also very inviting.  Photography, music, and acting performance combine to make a movie worth seeing more than once....",1250985600,2,947,5.302013422818792

It had its funny moments, but the sex scenes seemed planted in parts, just to be controversial. I didn't mind seeing them, but I am not sure all scenes even served a purpose, aside from shock value. I actually liked the ""behind the scenes process"" discussion much better,and I found it exciting that the actors were not quite aware EXACTLY how the film would develop until after they were completely involved in the work shops. My favorite seen is when the LI character smashes her vibrating egg and when the depressed boyfriend is finally able to accept himself for who he is. Some of the dialog was very poignant and shed light on some universal sexual anxieties and insecurities and unapolegtically explored them. Overall, I am glad I viewed it, but it was not ground shattering for me.",1250208000,,939,4.662650602409639
2701338,3,B000LAZDQA,"For those of you (and there may be some) concerned that, in a post-HIV world the Underground has diminished into historical insignificance, SHORTBUS serves notice the Counterculture is still here, and is eccentric as ever.  Shortbus is the name of a New York underground sex club, where uninhibited, hedonistic patrons flock for group sex, indie music, and ostentatious camaraderie.  No, it's not an establishment to host a church social, but it is a place where those who wish to think outside the box gather to learn more about themselves.

The varied regulars of Shortbus include a gay couple, a sex therapist, and a dominatrix; these characters spin the interdependent story threads of the film.  Although there's some quirky humor to be found in several scenes and in all of the characters, there is also a dark undertow--an almost pessimistic searching of self, of discovering shortcomings and ultimate disappointments.  Which is why SHORTBUS is almost too clever for its own good, and why the film is decidedly uneven.  Case in point:  the gay plot thread was overly corny and melodramatic, not fully vetted or resolved, with one of the characters repeatedly bursting into tears light years beyond the patience of this reviewer.

That said, there are some distinct positives about SHORTBUS.  All of the acting was very good, particularly Sook-Yin Lee (who I learned from the special features is a CBC broadcaster), playing a sex therapist who, irony of ironies, is in search of that elusive first orgasm.  The majority of character interaction was improvised, and improvised convincingly.  I like diverse characters, so here's a film that satisfies that requirement in spades.

Oh yeah.  There's also this matter of sex.  I won't sugarcoat it:  This is a graphic film using human sexuality as its driving metaphor.  There is gay sex, there is straight sex, there is group sex, there are deviations thereof; so if any (or all) of the above offend thee, do not watch SHORTBUS.  As director John Cameron Mitchell explains via the special features (which I heartily recommend), the graphic sex to begin the movie serves the purpose to ""burst the audience's hymen""--a prurient hook, so to speak.  The intensity of the sex is subsequently diminished as the film moves along.

The commentary featuring Mitchell and several of the actors is very informative and revealing--especially when it comes to the particulars surrounding the final camera shot of the film.  So there were things I liked and enjoyed about SHORTBUS, and things I didn't enjoy nor care for about SHORTBUS.  One thing for sure (well, maybe two):  Watching it is a definite unique experience; and the Underground is still out there.

I mixed the label to say that there was alot (the entire background in one scene) of sex happening, but it wasn't too much for the premise of the movie. It opens with one of the lead characters sucking HIMSELF  off. Then the sexual content get more intense from that point on. I recommend the movie, if you feel like, as the director says, 'a story that happens to have real sex in it'. But the plot of the psychiatrist trying to find HER orgasm seem a little but crazy (in a good way), as soft porn usually does.

2701342,4,B000LAZDQA,"Similar in structure to 1992's ""Chain of Desire"", a little-seen film about a circle of New York lovers connected by sexuality, a club scene, and a music score, ( and to a much older film called ""La Ronde""), ""Shortbus"" is upbeat, optimistic, and post-AIDS hysteria (while still being conscious of safe sex) whereas ""Chain of Desire"" hinged on that dark thread connecting its ill-fated characters.  Mitchell's second film is quite mature, and remarkably sweet. It's nice to see a film where people strive towards being conscious and kind; it's also nice to view something where straight, gay and every variation in between mingle with respect and regard to each other without the usual American 'tee-hee-hee' around sex, and money-machine ogres of Falwell and Warren hanging around to cash in and give guilt.

Central to the film, and quietly integral, is music from Yo la Tengo, and several songs including ""Upside Down"" and ""Far from the Sea"" and ""Language"" are quite catchy and memorable. These pieces color the film emotionally and supply a pad for the crises depicted amongst its protoganists, played so well by Sook-Yin Lee, Paul Dawson, PJ DeBoy, Julian Bond, and others.  Mitchell has coaxed remarkable performances from actors who also contributed to the script. I found myself quite endeared to them all and wishing I knew them personally.

If the low-budget endeavor has any flaws at all, it is Mitchell's sometimes obvious hand at making things fit into the structure, but this is a minor gripe since the film is almost a musical-of-sorts, and one expects some suspension of so-called 'reality'. Moreover, Mitchell is to be commended for his resoluteness is staying with this project for so many years, enlisting so many who believed in it and took career and emotional risks to make it the sweet, non-pornographic experiment that it is.

The film does make one pine, in a fashion, for these years between 25-35 if he or she has already passed through them, when clubs are crucial to one's life, when one is so desperately trying to anchor oneself in a meaningful style of living and loving.  I will be anxious to see what kind of Film Mitchell makes about his Forties.

Highly recommended. As for the sexuality, well, it's hardly pornographic, except to a sick mind, and handled quite beautifully. And even though the droll, den-mother Julian Bond quips at one point in the film as he watches the rosy-lit orgy with the enchanting Sook-Yin, ""It's like the 60s, darling, but with less hope,"" one senses there is, indeed, hope amongst this generation that plows ahead towards authenticity in the wake of prior generation(s) - some members who survived and many who didn't - who rose above the excreble muck of Anita Bryant, Falwell and the rest who sought to control the bodies -- and minds -- of Americans with fear and shame.",1231804800,2,2836,4.908141962421712

I could be wrong, but my opinion is that reviews and descriptions of this film should emphasize that much, if not most, of the film deals with gay issues and sex.

2701345,2,B000LAZDQA,"John Cameron Mitchell's 'Shortbus' is an interesting treatise on sex and-I guess-love, but that's all it seems to be-interesting. Though the film's intentions are quite admirable and worth a glance, the film fails to be anything but a graphically oversexed diddy with a little heart and a playful wink.

Mitchell's choice to gather as many unknown actors to star in his film was probably a smart move as there would have been no one in Hollywood with the balls-pun intended-to take such risks as these actors have done. However, the reason for these actors to go all the way  just isn't good enough. There's a trapeze act going on in 'Shortbus' that teeters between pornographic and melodramatic. The way the film presents its sexually graphic scenes are done quite naturally and even a bit humorous, but to what advantage? What kind of impression is the audience going to get with all these graphic images being displayed? In the end, it just boils down to two people actually screwing on film (sometimes only one . . . or three!). Now,I for one am not about censoring-especially when it comes to nudity and sexuality, but I have to be honest that even I was shocked and somewhat appalled as to what I saw. I think I probably wouldn't have felt that way if 'Shortbus' just got over its artsy self and call itself porn with a story (which, I'm sorry, isn't anything novel). Do I really need to see a man pleasure himself with his own mouth? If that question there bothered the hell out of you, then you haven't seen anything yet!

Those of you who loved 'Hedwig and the Angry Inch', as I did, beware. This is new territory for Mitchell to experiment with and your tolerance to sex and nudity will be tested. I applaud the actors for being so fearless and Mitchell for coming up with a good concept, but perhaps like Todd Haynes's equally interesting experiment, 'I'm Not There', 'Shortbus' only amounts to an interesting concept. I feel that it's defintely worth your time watching at least once. It's no piece of garbage, I assure you. It's just sex afterall.",1229385600,2,2060,4.669421487603306
2701346,5,B000LAZDQA,"Being a fan of Hedwig and the Angry Inch, I had some idea of what to expect from the genius mind of John Cameron Mitchell, but this film blew me away - so thought provoking, touching and at times laugh-out-loud funny. The cast is great, and it was good to see Miriam Shor (Hedwig and teh Angry Inch) making a cameo. All the perfomances were wonderful, but the thing that made this movie for me was the absolutely beautiful soundtrack which opened up a whole new world of music for me - as well as bringing in a few golden oldies like Anita O'Day in to round it out. Don't be put off by the sex - it's not gratuitous in its nature and really invites the viewer to examine and challenge their own views and ideas - and it is handled so truthfully that even the most uptight prude could not help but see something of themself in each of the characters and laugh. You'll definitely want to buy the soundtrack!",1226707200,2,905,4.267441860465116

OK, so the credits were the first indication that this was not going to be your garden variety flick. The Q TV moniker for those of us ""in-the-know"" told me right off the bat that the demographic was aimed at a gay audience. And then wham! An opening scene that made me drop my Yoplait all over the carpet...the dude's auto-fellatio complete with orgasm. My first reaction was WTF?! So I brushed it off, watched the flick, more sex...singing the national anthem during a three-way...blah, blah. These characters are all messed up in the head. I think the reasons why I didn't have nearly as much angst as it concluded was merely due to the diversion of its gratuitous sex. Great production values, but these people have some serious issues. Stupid ending with that lovefest parade and warm and fuzzy song by some washed up tranny!",1225411200,,987,4.613636363636363
2701348,5,B000LAZDQA,"When the young gentleman at the video store told me it had the most graphic sex he'd seen second only to XXX, I almost didn't rent Shortbus.  XXX gets really boring.  From experience, I can tell you it is more interesting to sleep with the people who make XXX than to watch their work. As I kept running across references to Shortbus in my reading, I took a chance.  It is rare in how direct it is about what it has to say, and so brutally honest in what it is portrayed.  Movies of this genre are often just so over the top to be tedious. The average viewer-if there is such a thing-will indeed see that finding different approaches to sex is that important in some people's lives. It makes it painfully clear that the prices to be paid for such knowledge aren't for the faint of heart.",1224115200,,787,4.261744966442953
2701349,5,B000LAZDQA,"This term is so cliched, but to this film, it really applies: I've never seen anything quite like this movie.
""Shortbus"" is a unique film that is about sex, yet more about everything else in our lives which connects to it. Writer-director John Cameron Mitchell did a beautiful job of guiding this tapestry of sexual pathos. Like porn, you see people engaging in sex; yet, it is more ""humanly"" tangible because we feel the genuine emotions coming from each sex act, not just ""acting"" or rather, mechanical sex.
How this film was assmbled is almost as interesting as the film itself: Actors helped craft the script as well as their own characters with Mitchell.
""Shortbus"" is a sex club in New York; sort of a bohemian-like atmosphere in which, as one character describes, ""people come here to use 'the motherboard of life' in order to find the right connections"". Here, people from all walks of life gather to find something---whether through sex or deep conversation.
As the film progresses, we watch these characters intersect with one another, and help, solve, or simply listen to each other's life dysfunctions. Whether the characters are straight, gay, bi-sexual or transgendered, the labels do not matter---they are just people trying to relate to one another through the wonders of sex and love.
If you feel you'll be overwhelmed by the frank content, then don't watch. But I think you'll be compelled to by the sadness, honesty & compassion of the interweaving plots.",1221609600,6,1474,4.94758064516129
2701350,4,B000LAZDQA,"If Robert Altman had ever taken on the subject of sex in America in one of his big, sprawling, multi-character epics, the result would probably have looked a lot like John Cameron Mitchell's outrageous yet moving ""Shortbus"".  You get all the things Altman gave us in films like ""Nashville"" and ""Short Cuts"": lots of characters, lots of situations, a lot of sadness, but a lot of hope, too.  Of course, here you also get lots of sex, in a very graphic manner and in all its various permutations.  If you can take that, and if you don't mind a film that doesn't offer easy answers to its many characters' many predicaments, I think you'll enjoy this movie, or at least find it fascinating.

By the way, if some of the sex scenes overwhelm you, be sure to watch the special features.  You'll be reassured to see that the challenge of those scenes overwhelmed, at least temporarily, many of the actors called on to perform them.  For some reason, it was good to see that hip young people up for being in an edgy, sexy movie could nevertheless feel a little shy when it came to actually doing certain things in front of the camera.  Maybe because seeing such trepidation on the part of the actors made the sexual problems of their characters, many of which involved shyness and discomfort, feel all the more believeable.",1221523200,,1315,4.594017094017094
2701351,2,B000LAZDQA,"John Cameron Mitchell's first movie, Hedwig and the Angry Inch, is one of the most original, interesting, and entertaining movies I've ever seen, so I expected to like Shortbus, his second movie. It pains me to say that I don't. I wanted to, I tried hard to, but I don't. Maybe because of Hedwig my expectations were too high.

I just don't understand Shortbus at all. I never understood Hedwig either, although I saw it six or seven times live in New York and dozens of times on film and DVD, but not understanding Hedwig didn't keep me from loving it. Maybe if I'd ever really understood Hedwig I might understand and appreciate Shortbus too. I didn't, so I don't know. Paraphrasing Hedwig, I don't have much to work with.

Somewhere in the Shortbus DVD extras, Mitchell said he wanted to do with sex in Shortbus what he did with music in Hedwig. That implies that the two movies might be fundamentally similar but using different media: music in Hedwig, sex in Shortbus. Okay.

So, since I don't understand either movie, the difference for me comes down to the difference in media. The problem is that Stephen Trask's music for Hedwig was brilliant, moving, and exhilarating, but the sex in Shortbus is just boring. Mechanical, uninspired and uninspiring, tedious. Like watching robots have sex. Maybe that's how Mitchell meant it to be, maybe he's trying to make some point that I just don't get, but the bottom line for me is it just doesn't make a good movie.

I have to say, though, there is one very, very good five-minute scene in Shortbus. It's when the characters played by Paul Dawson and Lindsay Beamish are locked together in a closet during a game of Truth or Dare. That scene is sweet, moving, perfectly constructed and paced and infinitely accessible. I can watch it over and over and over and never get tired of it at all. If the whole movie had been half as good as that scene is, I'd be raving about it and wanting more than five stars to give it, but it's not.

Also on the positive side, Jay Brannan is luminous in his few scenes (and in the DVD outtake called ""Are you sure you don't want to **** me?""). Unfortunately, his best scenes in the movie are shared with the unwatchably creepy, lizard-like mayor played by Alan Mandell (and it's not because he's old).

And talk about creepy, I don't understand what anybody sees in Justin Bond. He may be a delightful person when he's at home, but listening to his whiny, grating voice drawl out that awful, interminable musical number ""In the End,"" which bloats out the last four hours (it seems like) of the movie, that's like water torture!

So, even though I'm seriously disappointed in Shortbus, I'm giving it two stars: one for Dawson, Beamish, and Brannan; and the other for Hedwig, who may be lurking somewhere in Shortbus and I just haven't found her yet. I intend to keep looking.",1217203200,,2857,4.601178781925344
2701352,3,B000LAZDQA,I have to say this film was erotically stimulating but I am unclear as to the various story lines what the characters were trying to achieve.

2701353,5,B000LAZDQA,"Some have branded John Cameron Mitchell's ""Shortbus"" as pornographic.  I'm not sure what they (or any of us, for that matter) mean by ""pornography,"" but I suspect that people who apply the word to ""Shortbus"" intend it as a synonym for ""sex.""  There's lots of sex in ""Shortbus,"" but it's sex that's celebratory, fun, funny, poignant, self-revealing, and loving.

Humans are sexual creatures, and our sexuality is irreducibly connected to our personal identities, our ability to love (as well as our ability to hate), and our need for companionship as social animals.  In ""Shortbus,"" the complexity of sexuality is explored through several interrelated story lines:  Sophia's (masterfully played by Sook-Yin Lee) search for satisfaction, Jamie's (P.J. DeBoy) and James' (Paul Dawson) almost tragic but ultimately fruitful love for one another, Severin's (Lindsay Beamish) fear of intimacy, and drag performance artist Justin Bond's wonderfully exuberant celebration of human love in all its manifestations.  One particularly touching scene is an encounter between an ""ex-mayor of NYC,"" a gay, thinly disguised Koch, who reflects on loneliness, aging, and AIDS.

The film's dialogue is witty at times, poignant at others.  The actors are all, without exception, quite good.  The cinematography is superb.  The presentation is uninhibited, honest, funny, and thought-provoking.  If this is pornography, hurrah for porn.",1214784000,2,1415,5.596244131455399
2701354,4,B000LAZDQA,"This movie is simply phenomenal. The movie is about human relations with oneself, each other and about sex. The movie attempts to de-mystify and de-eroticize sex in such a splendid and matter of fact way that it succeeds, and while doing so manages to make a great film.

""Shortbus"" is about several characters. Sofia is a sex therapist who has never had an orgasm, James is a gay man in a great relationship but suffering from depression and Severin is a dominatrix who is unable to have a meaningful relationship with anyone. Along with other minor and major characters, these people interact with each other, changing for the better or the worse each other's lives and sex lives.

This movie is so amazingly touching and moving that I found myself completely absorbed by the characters and their stories. I was completely immersed in their compelling and interesting stories, being the joy and sadness along them. The movie, which has mostly first time or little known actors is frankly, simply brilliant.

Although the movie is about sex, depicts real un-simulated sex and sex is the main topic, it actually is about something else, something deeper: it is about human relationships. As another reviewer mentioned, this movie will not be enjoyed by those at issue with sex on movies or gay scenes; but, everyone else, this is a great great and, let me say it again, great movie.",1212537600,3,1382,4.8474576271186445

2701374,5,B000LAZDQA,"Shortbus is the dream child of writer/director John Cameron Mitchell, who brought us the delightful film, Hedwig and the Angry Inch.  Mr. Mitchell wanted his next film to be about sex and sexuality and he had seen foreign films where the actors actually had sex on screen as part of the film, but he had not known of any English-language ones.  He wanted to make the first, and what he has come up with is a delightful essay of a small group of people's sexual problems and their attempts to remedy those problems.

This is a not-rated movie and the viewer immediately finds out why.  The opening shot is of the head of Lady Liberty in New York City with the soundtrack belting out the words, ""Is you is or is you not my baby?  The way you have been acting leaves me doubt.""  As the song goes on the camera sails through the windows of several people's bedrooms while they are engaged in the most intimate of moments.  In the first zoom through a window the audience sees a naked semi-erect man sitting in a bath tub taking film footage of his penis.  Next we zoom through the window of an S&M hooker spraying off her assortment of dildos while being questioned by her john.  Then we zoom back to the first man who is now filming himself trying to perform fellatio on himself.  Next we zoom through the window in an apartment where a man is performing cunnilingus on an oriental woman who is sitting naked on a grand piano and then the couple goes through a wide assortment of gymnastic contortions of sexual intimacy.  Zoom into apartment #4 and you see a good looking man watching the guy in the first apartment filming his oral feat.  Finally all of the scenes end with orgasmic conclusions including our john with the S&M Dominatrix Hooker shooting his load onto a Sydney Pollack-style painting where it strangely seems to fit in.

At first the viewer is shocked, but isn't this really closer to real life than what is typically portrayed?  It seemed refreshingly frank.

It turns out that the man who was trying the acrobatic fellatio, James (Paul Dawson), has a gay lover, Jamie (P J DeBoy).  His lover is very attached to him, but James is pushing away in the relationship, wanting more.  James wants them to try an open relationship.  The oriental lady, Sofia (Sook-Yin Lee) with the acrobatic lover on the piano, is a sex therapist who has been faking her orgasms with her lover and actually in fact had never had one in her life.  James and Jamie come to her for sexual relationship advice and through that relationship they find Shortbus, a large home whose owner, Justin Bond, describes the place as, ""You know school busses.  This is the shortbus.  This is a salon for the gifted and challenged!""  It features a wide variety of environments, all equally bizarre, including a sex party room.  There is a cabaret room, a lesbian bar, and a very diverse group of people including the former mayor of New York.  In this environment all of the principle characters introduced in the opening scenes work on their sexual problems.  Sofia hooks up with the S&M Hooker, Seve (Lindsay Beamish).  As the hooker said, ""I will help you discover how to have an orgasm and you can teach me how to have a real human interaction with someone.""  James and Jamie find Seth a handsome man for a three-way romance, and the voyeur even finds a relationship fulfilled.  The film ends in a carnival atmosphere where the Cabaret vocalist is singing, ""We all get it in the end,"" to the accompaniment of a marching polka band.  Did I say the environment of Shortbus is a little bizarre?

However, Shortbus is a dramatic story of sexual conflicts and people trying to solve them.  I heartily recommend it.  Actually I was in the hospital the first time I saw the film and it got my heart going again!  Perhaps it will perform miracles for you as well.

This movie for me was and still is so very amazing in my eyes. I can't seem to stop watching it. I suggest a person that ISN'T too open not to watch this movie. Then again, it might be just the thing for you!

Shortbus packs HIGHLY INTENSE emotion in it. Combined with HIGHLY INTENSE love scenes and sex scenes. What was so amazing about this DVD was the making of feature. John Cameron Mitchell, in 2003, had a website called ""The Sex Project"". It asked for people to send in audition tapes and so forth. From there, they (Film Crew) narrowed it down bit by bit until they reached 9 (I believe it was) People/auditions. They informed those people and brought them in and worked on developing the story and cast members (Personalities of the Actors and Actress's)and Script for three years, than they began filming. John Cameron Mitchell informed the cast that they will be having sex with these people and on camera.

This Film won Two Film Festivals and A Nomination for Best Cast Ensemble.

It forever established that sex was dirty and should be relegated to the realm of porn in order to preserve community values. While today's mainstream filmmakers routinely deal with explicit sexuality, it is usually done with a heavy hand.  This films use of real sexual encounters in a FUN context is to be applauded. It shows that sex can be at least as enjoyable as a good comedy and doesn't have to be loaded down with adolescent angst. We do all get to grow up one day don't we?

2701382,5,B000LAZDQA,"I borrowed this film from a friend and had no idea what to expect.  By the end of the first few minutes, I had placed the popcorn back on the end table and cleaned my hands so as to not butter up the rewind button on the remote.  I was totally taken off guard, but in a pleasant way.  I liked this movie for several different reasons.

First, Shortbus pushed the edge in terms of sexual content.  The movie contains both straight and gay sex scenes, so there is something of interest for just about everyone.  And many of the scenes occur in group setting, with all types of people of varying orientations taking part.  I appreciated the inclusive nature of the film, which is one reason why I liked the movie so much.  The scenes in the movie are not gratuitous, but are done in artistic tone.

The movie also touches on other issues besides sex, such as depression, suicide, the intricate nature and philosophy of romantic love, promiscuity, the machinations of the female anatomy/orgasm, the importance of being oneself despite whatever societal pressures might abound, friendship, compassion, and most of all, solidarity in a world of unknowns.

Shortbus is a very special place.  It is a place where most people can go and feel welcomed.  Whether you are straight or gay, thin or large, beautiful or not-so-beautiful, introvert or extrovert, young or old, liberal or conservative, and whatever other designations one could think of, it does not matter.  Shortbus is a place to commune with others and share whatever it is you would like to share.

For me, Shortbus is a metaphor for what the world could be if we all would be a little less judgemental and a little more accepting, compassionate, and empathetic.  It is a place we all could identify with if we would only let go of those things that bind us to our misconceptions and anachronisms.....",1195776000,8,1855,4.69969040247678

2 - The actor had to be good to do some of things in the movie which I think anyone will find interesting regardless of gender
3 - I looked at this as neither straight nor gay in turn of a movie.  It concentrated on everyone's issues.  I happen to be turning the channel one day and saw this on logo.  I almost didn't watch this the first time I saw it because I thought it was a gay movie.  Much to my surprise.

That may sound a bit over the top but it is written from the heart, which is where this film comes from.  I knew nothing about this film before I saw it, in fact I had heard about it and shunned it as a perceived ""stupid movie"" based solely on the title.  Yes, big lesson there somewhere.
I will admit that the sex was what caught my attention right off the bat.  I had never seen images like this outside of porn and it took some getting used to (my friend literally had to close my gaping mouth at one point (a very patriotic moment)).  But once I got past the graphic sexual images, I was enveloped by the utterly raw, real, and often painfull emotions, characters, and situations.  All I can say beyond this (without boring you and wasting both of our times) is......SEE THIS MOVIE.  You will not be sorry that you did. (even if you just like looking at pretty people having sex)",1194912000,4,975,4.204301075268817
2701385,5,B000LAZDQA,I love this movie. It lays it all out and is frank and real. We still live in this sexual revolution and this movie brings out the emotion in all of us. You will see yourself in anyone of the characters in the movie. I was blown away!,1193961600,2,234,3.8958333333333335
2701386,5,B000LAZDQA,"Remember Caligula, with it's R-rated and X-rated version; the debate then was over the relative merits of both, and the same debate now hovers around this film.

Forget about that part.  The film is sexually graphic, but not gratuitous at key moments (like in the beginning, when the film is establishing what you're going to be likely to see, or in the moments when personal or a couple's pleasure is a material part of their existence). The rest of the time, as in the club Shortbus itself, the sex is brilliantly gratuitous, in precisely the best way it can be.

But again, we went for the sex, but what we got is a film.  John Cameron Mitchell (writer and director, of ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" as well) has now, I'd say, established himself as a filmmaker of preeminent relevance. Both of his films have a very definite, if hard to name, something--a world-weariness that's not exactly jaded, certainly a quirky eye for details that is not merely surreal. To make an irresponsible comparison, brilliant as Charlie Kaufman's movies are, the strange worlds they evoke are always somewhat contrived, perhaps wonderfully so. The strange world that John Cameron Mitchell lets us see are wholly realized, but still a kind of alternate reality. Yes, it's New York. Yes, it's the scene. But at the same time, it's super-real in a way that extremely few other filmmakers can manage.

I'm trying not to do spoilers here, but there are three perfect examples of what I mean.  When Sofia and Rob confront the problems in their relationship by using psychological techniques from Sofia's couples counseling practice, this perfectly embeds both the sense and the meaning of their interaction. Similarly, it may not be immediately clear at first why Severin and Sofia should meet in a sensory deprivation tank--maybe it seems like simply a quirky detail--but both the safety of the setting and that sensory deprivation implies a lack of feeling turns out to be exactly the right context to frame that conversation. Even without this insight, the choice of a sensory deprivation tank is wonderful. Still later in the movie, a truth or dare dare has James and Severin in a closet, having a very heart-to-heart conversation. Again, the setting is perfect to the theme, and yet subtle enough without browbeating the viewer, to say nothing of paralleling Severin and Sofia in the deprivation tank as well.

I am certain that the entire film is put together with this much care and attention throughout.  Why, for instance, are there two characters (Jamie and Severin) who have alternate names? (That Jamie changes his name to James rather obviously expresses his increasing distance from his boyfriend, Jamie.) One could note also that there is a ton of sex and rock n roll in this movie (look at the long soundtrack list at the end), but not drugs. Or that the overwhelming number of scenes are shot inside; even Sofia's jaunt in the park is not an actual exterior shot.

This is just another way to realize that John Cameron Mitchell is showing us a realized (artistic) vision of the world, and not New York itself; a fact emphasized, perhaps, by the animated cartoon version of New York that is the backdrop for the film, and that the ex-Mayor of New York in the film is Tobias, a fictional mayor, but one who is strongly reminiscent of Ed Koch in a number of ways. For those familiar with the controversies surrounding Koch during the AIDS crisis, the admission in the film that the ex-Mayor is gay portends to be not only a sly counterfactual, but even a kind of painful moment of healing for gay New Yorkers who have long felt betrayed by the Mayor. Yes, this is fiction, but it's an alternate reality, where he-who-was-closeted finally tells the truth, as it were.  Mitchell is clever enough to write the scene in such a way that you don't need to know all of this background to feel its pathos; mentioning it here is mostly just to underscore the deliberate wicked craft of the writing. Or, if this may be suggested even more briefly in one other way, as Severin is running a patter for the sake of Sofia's fantasy, there is a line, something to the effect of:  ""Phil Mudd approached the table and asked, `Is someone sitting here?'"" The reply is, ""No one's ever sat there.""  That's a brilliant, very outside-of-the-box moment of writing; one that comes from a point of view of long-standing loneliness, where no one ever sits. It's a beautifully perfect thing for Severin to say, all the more poignantly in something she is imagining as a fantasy.  The whole movie is informed by this outsiderness, which was equally palpable in ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch.""

Ultimately, it is this kind of care and attention and coherence that makes the sex not gratuitous, because even Shortbus itself (the sex club) is, again, precisely the context that the film's themes calls for.

It is not often that a movie lingers with me after I watch it, and the ones that have, have since entered the pantheon of great movie experiences for me.  In and of itself, this may mean nothing to you, but if you can see past the mere titillation of the film, there's something haunting and effective here. And funny and honest too.

Ultimately, the difference between the R-rated and X-rated Caligula was merely sex. By contrast, Shortbus integrates sex deeply into the characters in a way that thoroughly motivates it. Not everything's perfect in this film, and not everyone will be able to get past the sex, but that's okay too. Highly recommended.",1193702400,2,5517,4.772298006295908
2701387,2,B000LAZDQA,"Being a former school bus driver, I thought the movie title was very deceptive. I didn't know what to expect from this movie.  The movie has nothing to do with a bus! It refers to a shortbus, which I felt means, misfits, and outcasts of society, etc. The movie starts of very slowly but picks up momentum later on.  This movie is full of sexual encounters, which show full nudity and sex acts.  Even though they try to depict ""The Lifestyle"", I feel they fell short. I am not naiive, but I know lots of that promiscuous sex goes on between heterosexuals and homosexuals.  The movie touches on all of these lifestyles. This is not a movie you would want to invite a bunch of friends over to see. At least that is my opinion.",1193702400,5,723,4.333333333333333

2701390,5,B000LAZDQA,"I initially saw ShortBus in the theaters, wanting to scope what all the buzz was about.  What started out as subversive curiosity turned into a truly transformative experience.  Two friends of mine and I entered the theater cackling, but we all left feeling better about this experiment we call living.

John Cameron Mitchell and his cast have created the most intimately profound exploration of the human experience I have ever seen.  ShortBus became all the more brilliant when I watched the documentary (on the DVD) about how the film was made.  I have watched ShortBus several times since purchasing the DVD, and every time it leaves me feeling better just because I'm still breathing...not to mention it's got Justin Bond in it.  He has some of the best one-liners ever uttered in a movie.

There is plenty of explicit sex, to be sure...  But by the end of the film, the sex is just the canvas on which the story is painted.  Here the sex is the stage (as it is in real life) for comedy, tradgedy, jealousy, love, irony, honesty...name it.  I am so relieved to see an American filmmaker celebrating human sexuality.  Too often in American culture sex is shameful, hidden, or only hinted.  Sex is part of who we are and how we relate to ourselves and others.  Finally, a movie with penetration that isn't pornographic...  It is possible to separate sex and erotica from pornography (not that I disappreove of porn, either).

ShortBus is an honest look at people being people.  I know each character in the movie.  I can find some of each of them in almost everyone I know.  And the title is all too appropriate, because I've always felt like I've ridden the shortbus through life.  ShortBus is imperfectly perfect.

If you really pay attention to the stories between the characters, it just might change the way you look at life.",1192233600,5,1833,4.70440251572327

2701394,5,B000LAZDQA,"Oh. My. Goodness!  What an interesting movie that can be visually over-stimulating.  The movie opens with a montage of sex scenes.  You might think that you must've missed the beginning of the movie.  However, you didn't.  Instead, you dived into it.  Maybe Mitchell did it for shock value but the opening scenes were...well...right in your face.  You want to look away but you can't.  You can do nothing but maybe laugh and for some of you...be embarrassed.

After the montage, the story begins.  Now, there's so many things going on in this movie.  So, I will just pick 2 groups of people.  One is a gay couple, Jamie and James.  Jamie loves James.  But, James, a former hustler, while he does love Jamie, he feels that he needs more out of life.  Therefore, he suggests that they open up their closed relationship.  Jamie, fearful of losing James, decides couples counseling.

Sofia is a couples counselor.  Her speciality is sexual issues.  However, there's one problem.  Sofia has never had an orgasm.  In the initial counseling session with Jamie and James, she breaks down and reveals her sexual shortcoming.

So, all three of them go to the Shortbus.  Shortbus is...well, for a lack of a better word, a sort of a bathhouse but with ""class"".  In every rooms in Shortbus, there is a sexual activity going on, whether with a couple or a group.  Not everyone participates nor is everyone pressured to do so.  Some just come to watch.  At Shortbus, Jamie & James and Sofia each encounter people they hope will improve their sexual lives.

Love?  Lust?  Which one will win?  Are we all meant to achieve that greatest sexual satisfaction?  You'd be amazed how much sex impacts our daily life.

All I can say is ""wow!"" and that you must see it ASAP if you have not seen it yet.  I believe that we, as Americans, are such prudes when it comes to sex and nudity.  In fact, I saw this movie with my partner and 2 friends.  It was interesting to see the mixed reaction we each had towards Shortbus.  I was like...""it's about time"", even though I laughed at some scenes.  A friend was like ""sex and nudity are such private things and should not be shown"".  This film is a great topic to discuss afterwards.

Bravo to Mitchell for having the balls to bring such taboos in our faces!",1191369600,4,2276,4.564676616915423
2701395,3,B000LAZDQA,"Well, a perfectly executed self-performed fellatio sort of begins when you see the movie.(ha).

She tells them that she has never had an orgasm, so they introduce her to a club called ""Shortbus"" and dominatrix, ""Severin."" One thing about this movie, it actually does have some depth to it.  There is always a penis, a breast or someone or some people have explicit sex some place on the screen and one, two or more exploring each other's sexuality and minds.

2701396,2,B000LAZDQA,"A friend bought this film out of curiosity, watched it and was going to toss it but first asked me if I wanted to see it. So I ""borrowed"" it. (I eventually tossed it.) My first reaction was that it was laughable. Next reaction, it begs for a new flm rating -- PWP ... or ... PORN WITH PLOT. One reviewer here asked where they could get more films like this ... try an adult bookstore. Another reviewer compared it to Caligua. No comparison. Production values alone in Caligula far outweigh those in Shortbus which are weak and mostly non-existent -- even the Georgina Spelvin ""The Devil In Miss Jones"" (1973) had more than Shortbus. There have always been artists (and I use that word loosely here) that try to push the envelope when they create their art. But Mr. Mitchell doesn't.  Robert Mapplethorp, for example, was a brilliant artist. Mr. Mitchell isn't. As far as originallity, I would suspect that the context for singing the National Anthem might be original but then again, it could be borrowed from some legitimate porn film. There's nothing really new about this film that has been done before ... except ... the clutter of hardcore sex in among the plot.

I'll sum up by including a quote from Aisha Tyler:

""From the title, I was expecting a film about mentally challenged kids going to school. Instead, it was a film by a mentally challenged filmmaker who should have gone to film school""",1191283200,,1403,4.626506024096385

It follows a gay couple that are thinking about threesomes and a sex therapist that has never had an orgasm. All three end up at ""the shortbus"" which is an underground sex club where even voyerism is participation.

It's an artsy fartsy movie and since that isn't my style i really wasn't ""moved"" like some reviewers have said but i did find it to be a good and entertaining watch.

2701410,3,B000LAZDQA,"Although I admire John Cameron Mitchell immensely for taking a revolutionary approach to the discussion and depiction of sex in SHORTBUS, I must also say that I ultimately found the film tedious and ineffective.  The storyline was unbearably thin and the characters were hopelessly shallow (certainly too shallow to hold my attention).  I think Mr. Mitchell subjugated what could have been an interesting story (with a little more script development) to graphic sex.  I kept thinking as the largely unengaging movie unfolded that if I just wanted graphic sex I could have rented a porn film.  I longed for interesting characters and insightful dialogue.  Instead, I got empty verbal exchanges coupled with lots and lots of sex.  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE sex.  But is this what we should aspire to?  Is cruising the dark catacombs of a sex club the key to a great orgasm?  Is making out with a stranger far more of a sexual ideal than partnering with one person (especially if you're involved with someone you profess to ""love"")?  Maybe the answer to all those questions is ""yes"" - if so, it sends an ice-cold chill down my spine.",1189987200,5,1131,4.783505154639175
2701411,3,B000LAZDQA,"I wish Amazon's rating system allowed half stars. I'd be tempted to give Shortbus 3 1/2 because I do appreciate Mitchell's attempt to treat sex matter-of-factly in an actual (and mostly engaging) movie. I also really liked his previous work, ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" and wanted to be able to throw my support behind an innovative independent artist. As it stands though, my disappointment in what came across as the larger message of *this* movie can't help but override my feelings of goodwill.

The thing that bugged me in this film (bugged me in a big way) was the divorcing of sexual fulfillment from connection with loved ones. Without giving away plot particulars, I found it actually kind of distressing that key characters wind up only being able to find real sexual gratification with strangers. In a movie that's supposed to be about finding acceptance, that seems like a curious message.

Is this really Mitchell's view of ""utopia""? Of friendship? That it's, what, *preferable* to share your vulnerability with strangers while shutting out and not communicating with...the people who love you and care about you and actually deal with your crap on a day-to-day basis?

It's extra bothersome, because I thought this was an engaging film in other respects -- some uneven acting and writing aside. There was a lot of promise here, and I want there to be a place for films that treat sex as a legitimately important topic.

2701417,5,B000LAZDQA,"John Cameron Mitchell, who gave audiences the striking gender-bending musical ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch,"" pushes boundaries again in ""Shortbus."" The hype is true--there's hardcore sex, and lots of it, in this loose, improvisatory chronicle of several New Yorkers and their uncertain journeys through life. The bulk of what narrative there is centers around Sofia (Sook-Yin Lee), a sex therapist who's never had an orgasm despite an ostensibly happy marriage, and Jamie and James (P J Deboy and Paul Dawson), a gay couple considering opening their relationship, who are secretly being stalked by their neighbor (Peter Stickles). They and several of their friends end up at Shortbus, which seems to be part nightclub, part sex club and part political discussion group. At first it's hard not to be caught up in the prurient thrill of seeing these people actually perform THOSE acts on film, but unlike hardcore pornography, where sex quickly palls due to its pointlessness, the sex in ""Shortbus"" enthralls because there is always an emotional purpose to it--these characters are doing it for a reason. Hence they earn the viewer's empathy and sympathy. As subversive in their way are scenes where a group of women talk about their best orgasms, or where a young gay man (the unbelievably beautiful Jay Brannan) has a conversation with the aged, wrinkled former Mayor of New York, totally as equals. The film does falter somewhat toward the end and the conflicts are resolved a mite hurriedly, but the overall impression remains. In an age where mainstream community standards do their best to suppress the sight of adults having consensual, joyful, and even funny sex, while condoning the ever more explicit depiction of all kinds of violence against the human body, ""Shortbus"" is a vivid protest against such topsy-turvy hypocrisy. The DVD includes a fascinating half-hour documentary narrated by Mitchell about the unusual creation process of ""Shortbus,"" a must-see.

2701425,5,B000LAZDQA,"I'd been curious about this film for a while, and after seeing it I can honestly say that it exceeded all my expectations. This film explores the rich, complex emotional lives of a variety of characters. While superficially the characters are all very different (straight, gay, partnered, single, rich, poor, etc), what they all have in common is that they're all at a crossroads in terms of their sexual behavior, and how it either helps them to connect with other people and their own true selves, or not. To quote one of the actors in the film from the (excellent) documentary in the special features section of the DVD, the sex is really just a metaphor for something else. ""Shortbus"" is a deep, joyous, cathartic and beautiful film.",1180656000,10,737,4.765625

The first sexual action made me sit up and think, ""okay, here we go .."" but after that it all seemed as natural as everything else in the film.  The sex was funny and clunky and sexy - but natural in the context of the film.  All of the actors should be applauded for their courageousness in completing exposing themselves physically and psychologically.  I laughed quite a bit at their drama and was moved by the gentle humor.  A lot goes on here, but all of it is worthwhile.  The soundtrack also is excellent and highly recommended.",1180310400,7,654,4.445378151260504
2701428,5,B000LAZDQA,"Sanrtbus breaks the mold!  Other movies of this genre either are rather boring (...) or have plots that are non-existent or downright silly.  Shortbus tells the story of several young New Yorkers in a search for love and meaning in their lives.  They endure a number of ups and downs during their quest but the movie ends with a satisfying and uplifting conclusion.  The movie is not shy about full frontal nudity and includes scenes of actual sex acts, but they fit into the story.  By the end you care about the characters and root for them which is a testament to the skill of the mostly unknown and largely amateur cast.  I would suggest you try Shortbus--it may not be your bag but it is worth a look.  I'd like to see more movies like it.",1180224000,5,744,4.386861313868613

2701431,2,B000LAZDQA,"I love the idea of a film that depicts sexuality as it exists, rather than in the exploitative manner of pornagraphy which reflects only (mostly unrealizable) fantasy.  But this film takes that seemingly simple idea nowhere.  In the end, it is just a big bore.  The plot (if there is one) mostly centers around a woman's quest to have an orgasm, but one gets the feeling that it just so happened that that was the best footage that the director shot, so he used it the most in the final edit.  The film has a workshop production feel -- like the director just gave the actors some ideas of themes and then yelled ""action"", figuring he'd use whatever worked, rather than producing a coherently written film containing a beginning, middle and end.  Unfortunately, I think the director only gets one shot at this concept, so we'll not see if he could get it right the next time.",1179532800,8,875,4.547770700636943
2701432,5,B000LAZDQA,"Years from now, Shortbus will go down as the film that had the guts to do what no ever film ever did before.  At first glance, one might equate this movie with [...].  The sex scenes are the real thing, not simulated.  While graphic and unapologetic, they serve not to arouse but to reveal the high emotionality depicted within the characters this film.  What makes Shortbus one of the best films of 2006 is the way it depicts the intensity of emotions associated with sexual crisis.

Director John Cameron Mitchell worked with the actors to create the multi-dimensional and complex characters portrayed.  Among them are Sophia, a sex therapist who has never experienced an orgasm; [...] couple James and Jamie whose introduction of additional partners into their sex life is masking a deep internal conflict, and dominatrix Severin who struggles to have a meaningful connection with somebody.  It is hard to not feel the pain of these characters as we see it on screen.  Each struggles to resolve their crisis with the help of an underground salon called ""Shortbus"" where polysexual expression fills the rooms.

The film makes excellent symbolic use of electrical blackouts.  As somebody who lived in New York City during the famous 2003 all-city blackout, it was interesting to learn that that event was a source of inspiration for Mitchell and the other creative individuals involved in this movie.

2701436,4,B000LAZDQA,"When JCM released ""Hedwig"" it was original on many levels:  the main character is a drag queen with a botched sex change, it was a rock musical, despite the coarse treatment the message was still one of compassion and our search for love.  With ""Shortbus"", he now seeks to redefine, yet again, the purpose of film.  Film and movies have paradigms that are expected to be followed (if you want to make money you need star power etc) and one of the biggest is connected with our nathion's Puritanic roots:  you don't show the sex act if there is an implied sex scene.  And, if you are going to show the sex act, you make it obtuse and ""artsy"".  Shortbus makes sex and sexuality a very real thing for it's characters-- if two (or more) people start to make out, and you can tell it's about to lead to sex, JCM takes it to the next level and shows you exactly where that make out session really leads to.  Is it gratuitous, just trying to get some shock value?  I don't think so.  The film already has a voyeuristic quality, and this ""realism"" just adds to the audience's feeling of being an observer of some deeply personal moments in people's lives.  Is Shortbus destined to sweep the Oscars this year?  Doubtful, but I applaud Mitchell's desire to tell a story honestly, and not the way everyone else tells it, or expects it to be told.",1179014400,,1335,4.408163265306122

I watched it several times, not for the prurient interest but to actually discern what the real message, if any, is in this video.

The idea of true intimacy and how to acheive it seems pervasive to the straight and gay couples in the video.  I actually found the best part of the disc to be the interviews with the director and the stars and their take on the sexuality, and their purposes for making the video.

It is definitely a graphic celebration of the complications of acheiving human intimacy.  The comic relief is very nice, to take the edge of the sexuality. The Ashton Kutcher look alike was quite cute.  The subtle humorous scenarios were always a surprise. (A voyeuristic straight Secret Service agent monitoring the president's daughters during the day and peeping Tom at night on the gay guys across the courtyard for psychological analysis?  That was a stretch, among many!)

There has never been an opening sequence shot with such frankness in main-stream film.  Once you adjust to the explicit nature of this movie and realize that the film's unapologetic presentation of real people having real sex is actually a wonderful vehicle to instantly, intimately connect with these characters on all levels that are open and human, you start to settle into a beautiful movie about people just trying to integrate - to connect with something outside of their self, their work, their ideas - to find that elusive moment of equanimity.  The ride has great ups and downs - plenty of moments for laughs, tears and titillation.  The end of the film is also shot in incredibly beautiful simplicity (this scene thematically reminded me of the end of Hedwig - James Cameron Mitchell is so good at taking the viewer right to the precipice of change/acceptance along side the main character - impossible to see his films without taking away some personal insight).  This movie reminds us all that it takes darkness to see stars and silence to hear music.

The bonus materials on the DVD are great too - the ""making of scenes"" are a must view. I just wish they had included a segment on the animation in the film like they did on the Hedwig DVD.",1178496000,7,1395,4.582329317269076

But, at its best, which is pretty frequent, the proceedings have a unique point of view and a fresh, funny voice.  The cast is enormously likable and fearless.  No matter their orientation, there's bound to be something here that will strike sparks of recognition and amused chuckles from most viewers.  Mitchell's to be applauded for both intentions and achievement here.  Recommended.",1176336000,5,702,5.2792792792792795
2701455,5,B000LAZDQA,"Having seen Hedwig and the Angry Inch, I was apprehensive about this movie.  After all, Hedwig is a classic and John Cameron Mitchell had a lot to live up to.  In all honesty, He really didn't live up to the brilliance of Hedwig and the Angry Inch, in fact, you can't even compare the two films as each is an independent, unique foray.

Shortbus attempts (and succeeds) at focusing in on the importance of sexual identity and happiness in one's life.  In a world where people are, more often than not, taught that self-sacrifice is the key to a happy life we are confronted with several characters who, somehow, manage to mirror our own lives in a way that exposes that hippocracy.

For certain the film is graphic.  It depicts sexual acts (both homo and hetero) in unabashed reality as a device to help lure the audience into believing that what they are seeing is real.  By ""docu""-filming in this manner, J.M.C., is able to connect with people on a level that a well-planned and thereby censored film could never achieve.

While this movie certainly reflected my life and feelings regarding relationships, honesty, sex, and ""morality"", I suspect that anyone who has struggled with these issues who watches this movie with an open mind will benefit from it.

It didn't make back its initial budget in its U.S. run.  But this Little Movie that Could did something much more amazing, it reached right out there and touched folks.  Some it touched in the gut.  Some ran from the theatre, demanding their money back.  Some laughed at the silly parts.  Some laughed at the sad parts.

But for those of us who it was designed for, it did something really amazing, it helped remind us that 9/11 didn't destroy us. It helped us recall the '60's (but as one character so wisely points out, without as much hope).

Though there is hope, and joy, and laughter, and more actual sex (gay and straight) than any other movie you've seen without a second of porn in it.  All this, and a triumph of the human spirit.

My best friend went with me to see this film primarily because he'd really loved HaTAI.  He is a straight guy, he saw way more mano-a-mano love-makin' than he'd ever seen in his life, yet he was the one saying at the end how we needed to see it again, and soon.  So we went again.

Sure, the whole thing revolves around a woman who is unable to find her Big 'O'.  But it is essentially about how all the folks in this film are unable to connect.  It is like their lives are happening around them, but they can't really feel them, can't really let anyone know what they really need.

And in the end, they all get it.

This film covers all bases. There is straight sex, gay sex between two men and two women, and men and women pleasuring themselves. There is even a scene with group sex. And it's all real. It shows about as much as any porn would show. The stories are not fantastic, some characters are not developed enough outside the bedroom, and some senarios are silly or unrealistic. The acting was about as good as the acting in a real porn, and the script they were working with was packed solid with cliches.

2701461,5,B000LAZDQA,"Well, with the opening scene of Shortbus, you know you're in store for a very different kind of film.  The explicit sex seen in the first few minutes is perhaps the most graphic, most real sex scenes I've ever seen in a ""mainstream"" movie.  Director John Cameron Mitchell most certainly knows how to grab your attention from the start.

If you're not too shocked and stick around for the rest, you'll find this movie has much more to offer than cheap thrills.  This movie treats sex more honestly than any other I've ever seen.  The gritty, graphic nature of the sex throughout the film shows a side of relationships rarely captured on the big screen.

There are multiples stories going on here - one deals with a sex therapist on mission to finally achieve her first orgasm.  Another centers around a gay couple trying to make their longterm relationship work, even though one of them has his own demons of severe depression to work through.  All the characters and stories come together in a free-loving type club known as ""Shortbus.""",1175817600,7,1036,4.716666666666667
2701462,3,B000LAZDQA,"I started hearing about ""Shortbus"" quite a few years ago (maybe 5) and didn't think much of it. It's, essentially, a movie that will be seen less than the average porno that has a bunch of non-actors having real sex. Before this movie debuted, another movie called ""9 Songs"" came out. This was about a couple, non-actors, who went to concerts and had real sex. That's it. It was bashed deservedly and I expected the same for Shortbus. Oddly enough, this film got fairly good reviews and continues to get praise right here on Amazon. The movie is written and directed (although the cast is responsible for the storylines) by John Cameron Mitchell, who is probably most famous for writing, directing, and starring in ""Hedwig & the Angry Inch,"" which is one of my least favorite films of all time. ""Shortbus"" contains some of the same visuals that makes a lot of people like that film, but has even more homosexual content. I don't want to sound like a perv, but I rented this movie because I heard it had graphic sex and I was curious to see what all the fuss was about. The first 5 minutes of the film is nothing but graphic sex and some of it is a bit disturbing. What the character James does is highly unlikely. The film just weaves through various relationships (the title comes from the name of a sex club they all attend). For a quick synopsis: There's James and Jamie, a gay couple going through a rough patch in their relationship. There's Sofia and Rob, a married couple also hitting a rough patch. Sofia, a sex therapist, is unable to experience an orgasm. Then there's the dominatrix Severin, trying to find meaningful communication with someone. Ceth, a gay frequenter of Shortbus, who is one of the most annoying people I have ever had to watch act. There's also a stalker, who watches James from across the street in his high-rise apartment. The film is, without a doubt, realistic for the most part. It's massively better than the aforementioned ""9 Songs,"" but it's not a very good movie as a whole. It's kind of disturbing, but don't get me wrong...It's not porn, nor erotica. The way the film deals with relationships is realistic and some of the sex seems realistic (it is real, just more movie-like than one would expect)...As for the end of the film and many other scenes, it's a bit pretentious. The ending especially, which is both annoying and completely unrealistic...But look, I'm one of the only reviewers on here mentioning this stuff about the movie. I don't know what kind of audience to recommend this too, so I'm just stating my opinion and leaving the decision to you. I just, personally, didn't think it was a great film and I will not be watching it again.

To be fair, I had to see it twice before I was convince - the first time was preceded by too much hype around this film ""revolutionizing sex"" in cinema.  Once I realized that is not what the movie is doing or trying to do, I realized it was a story of several friends I had never met.  A little crazy, a bit confused, searching, oversexed.  These stories are pulled from the actors' and director's personal experiences and, despite the blur of human emotions, they speak all the more clearly because of it.

And though a bit glammed up for the camera, ""Short Bus"" will be seen as a slice of very real life in this era - not a mock-up dream of bygone days.",1175472000,6,967,4.338888888888889
2701466,2,B000LAZDQA,"Look, first let me say that I LOVED Hedwig and the Angry inch.  So of course I was excited to hear that John Cameron Mitchel was going to do a movie that was going to skewer the preoccupation of the ratings boards with promoting violence over sex by producing a mainstream movie with sex scenes as an integral part..  I felt that it was long overdue thought it would be an entertaining and important movie.

Fast forward to the reality... Mr. Mitchell has obviously been living for too long in the post Hedwig Bubble leaving him completely out of touch with real life.  It isn't groundbreaking nor does it challenge conventional wisdom when you make a movie containing explicit sex scenes in which the plot revolves in a large part around sex. (Please spare me the ""It's about relationships"" line.  These relationships were so artificial they make Cool Whip look Natural.

Basically the movie is a pseudo-intellectual higher budget version of a 3rd year film students performance art project.  It relies on dialog that would be unrealistic anywhere but a womyns studies retreat or in an abnormal psychology class.  The problem with being a success in the film arts world is obviously a lack of ability in figuring out what is realistic behavior and what isn't.

If you really honestly want to turn convention on it's ear and show the film ratings for the hypocrisy that they are with regards to sex on screen it would pack a much larger punch, to show a conventional plotline with the sex scenes not edited out.  i.e. Pretty Women, have the hooker and the businessman have full sex.  A James Bond style film, show the consummation with him and the foreign spy, a Horror film, have the couples have sex on screen before being killed etc...

But to show a movie in which everybody is wondering around in a Zoloft induced haze stumbling into a sex club that is a pale imitation of stories about Berlin in the 1930's even to the addition to the cast of the host walking around imitating Joel Grey from Cabaret is just pure boring self indulgent pap.  The end part, when one of the cast finally has anal sex with his stalker, then stands at the window catching the eye of his boyfriend in the apartment across the alley where they then begin to smile at each other may have sounded good after Mr. Mitchell's 3rd Pot brownie but frankly was just a lame attempt at a meaningful ending that was the last gasp of a movie drowning in it's own misguided self importance.

To say I was disappointed after the promise of Hedwig would be putting it mildly.  Hopefully John Cameron Mitchel can pump whatever well it was that gave him the inspiration for his first movie and stay away from the bad judgment and Juvenile outlook that produced this mess.",1175472000,26,2736,4.612371134020618

2701469,3,B000LAZDQA,"The reviews for this film are almost as entertaining to read and ingest as the movie itself. That may or not be a good thing. For example, here on Amazon, Shortbus is averaging 4 stars as of this writing. On pro.imdb, it has a respectable 7.2/10 score from viewers. On Metacritic.com, the average critic rating is 64 (65 on RottenTomatoes.com), while the average user rating is 8.7/10. A conspicuous variance.

I rented the movie for two reasons: 1) I find that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hedwig-and-the-Angry-Inch/dp/B00005QW5X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hedwig and the Angry Inch</a>&nbsp;is not only a brilliant film, but it is also one of my top-10 favorites ""of all time"" and have been waiting for John Cameron Mitchell to come out with something new for a while, and 2) to be embarrassingly honest, to satisfy a carnal curiosity.

Shortbus is a film focused on relationships and inner demons, and sex seems to have come along for the ride. In the opening scenes, we are witness to the most vivid sex I've ever seen on film that hasn't been classified as pornography, and these scenes were far ""harder"" than any soft core porn I've ever seen and in some cases better than the hard stuff, undoubtedly because this had the distinct stamp of feeling real. There's a young man auto-fellating (James, played by Paul Dawson), a ""trust fund Muppet"" and a Mistress (Justin Bond playing himself and Lindsay Beamish as Severin), and a heterosexual couple (Sook-Yin Lee as Sofia and Raphael Barker as Rob). Sofia and Rob have the most straightforward sex - pun intended? - as the first two scenes are more exploratory in theme and content. All end in shattering climaxes; indeed, James cries when he is finished; Justin hits the wall, so to speak, while Severin looks on, stunned; and Sofia finds her way to a rather convulsive end.

Frankly, it was all rather steamy, and I wish I'd seen it in the theater, if only to look around and watch people squirm in their seats.

And then we get to the meat of the matter. James's and his boyfriend Jamie see a sex therapist - Sofia - who prefers to be called a couples counselor. Their intention is to open up the relationship. As they talk, it's obvious to the viewer, and to Sofia, that Jamie has no life outside of James, and that the two appear to have very different agendas. She sends Jamie out of the room to talk to James alone, and after that, talks to Jamie alone. When you compare the Jamie that spoke to Sofia in her office to the Jamie throughout the rest of the film, you see a very different character. The Jamie in Sofia's office is, frankly, an idiot and immensely unlikable. Even Sofia slaps him. The Jamie throughout the rest of the book may be hyper-dependent on James, but he's warm, compassionate, and likeable.

We learn that Sofia's slap was not only a reaction to Jamie's personality, but also because she is ""pre-orgasmic"", meaning that she's never had an orgasm. They suggest that she go to a place called Shortbus to help find relief to this.

Shortbus (the place, not the film) is a world within a world, with the requisite transvestite caretaker and rooms upon rooms of deviance and compulsion. There is, of course, the large room where everyone is naked and having sex, and other rooms where people hang out with no clear purpose (this is a weakness in its structure). When Sofia enters, she bumps into James and Jamie, who are there to ""work at"" opening up the relationship.

Severin is there too, and Sofia meets her as she flees the other rooms - too many men. They develop a friendship, and decide to help each other: Sofia will help Severin try to open herself up to having a more meaningful relationship than what she has with her johns, and Severin will try to help Sofia reach orgasm. It's not at all clear what qualifies Severin to help with this, and it's not even particularly clear why Sofia contacted Severin outside of Shortbus to be friends.

James and Jamie find their third: Ceth (pronounced Seth), and we're treated to yet more sex. In an hysterical but somewhat uncomfortable moment, Jamie sings the Star Spangled Banner while, um, using Ceth's behind as a megaphone. Stranger yet, Ceth says that it wasn't the first time that's happened. The three do look very comfortable together.

With all the pieces in place, the story begins to dramatize, and moves from the light hearted sexy romp into a darker place of inner demons. It's far less successful when the lights go out - and I mean this both figuratively and literally, as the story is set against a backdrop of increasing brownouts that eventually lead to a blackout.

Every character is beset with demons, but none more so than James is. And somehow, in the end, they all achieve resolution. What I'm uncomfortable with is *how* they reached resolution, because what was presented didn't make an ounce of sense to me. It appears that sex opened doors for everyone to delve deeper inside, but here's a huge problem: with the singular exception of James, we have no idea what anyone's inner demons are. If we don't know what they are, how can we accept any form of resolution for them? And while we do learn of James's demons, his epiphany (or what he did to reach that epiphany) made no sense at all and was utterly unbelievable.

The movie was loosely scripted, and it grew in the telling with the actors ad-libbed input. I might have guessed that fact if the film didn't tell us, because (as I illustrated with Jamie above) characters sometimes went against what I felt their core-values were, at least as they were established in the beginning segments of the film. It's a great concept, but without continuity, believability suffers.

I'm on the fence with this. I'm tempted to give it two stars for a story that meandered and fell apart at the end, but they have to get credit for filming so much sex while none of it was gratuitous. At no time did the sexual situations ever seem overdone or out of place. That's one heck of an accomplishment, given how much flesh was shown. And there was a LOT of flesh. Men were erect and they climaxed - and we saw the result of their climax. We saw Sofia madly at work trying to give herself the big O, and were given, more than once, a very clear picture of her ""sex"". (I don't know how else to say it and escape Amazon's censors.

3 stars for their accomplishment...",1175212800,31,6403,4.701159678858162
2701470,5,B000LAZDQA,"I really enjoyed John Cameron Mitchell's ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" (2001) and was eager to see what he would follow that up with. ""Shortbus"" (2006) differs from ""Hedwig"" greatly in a number of ways.  Unlike ""Hedwig,"" ""Shortbus"" shows the perspective of numerous people instead of one major character, it is less campy and it isn't a musical. However, in some ways ""Hedwig"" and ""Shortbus"" are cut from the same cloth in that both are films about self-discovery, unrequited love and sexuality.

The film tells the story of several unfulfilled people--Sofia (a couple's therapist) who can't reach orgasm with her husband Rob, James and Jamie, (a gay couple who's relationship has stagnated) their new lover Ceth, Celab, a voyeur of James and Jamie,  Sofia's new dominatrix friend Severin and the drag queen host of the club Shortbus, where the characters congregate.

Throughout the course of the film we see the lives of these characters unfold and cross paths, as they look into their lives and ask why they are unhappy and what they can do to find fulfillment. Although there is a lot of graphic sex depicted in this film, it's not really pornography, as its purpose is not to sexually arouse the audience. I think film critic Roger Ebert best articulated the point of the film by noting that it is ""not about sex, but about sexuality, not about scoring, but about living.""

I really, really enjoyed this film. All of the characters were sympathetic and intriguing. And just when you thought that you had someone figured out, they would do or say something that you didn't quite expect, taking the viewer for a ride and throwing some curve-balls.  ""Shortbus"" may shock you a little, but more importantly it will make you think, as well as laugh and smile a little along the way.",1174953600,5,1780,4.819672131147541
2701471,2,B000LAZDQA,"Although the director is a major talent and a truly nice person, SHORTBUS is almost impossible to contemplate without a remote control. . .  WITH YOUR FINGER ON THE FAST FORWARD BUTTON. The often attractive actors become remarkably banal once they open their mouths. This is like an early Greg Araki film but with sex scenes replacing the rebellious wit. All the funny lines, in fact, can be found in the trailer. As for the sexual carryings-on, unless you have never watched a pornographic film before, you'll wonder what the big deal is about. Then there's the actor portraying former New York City Mayor Ed Koch, you'll wish he remained in the closet along with Ed. SHORTBUS, in the end, is truly all over the place, and when you watch the deleted scenes, you'll realize the reason why: no one was really in control. What in the world is that dialogue with the nosy neighbor talking to the President on his cell phone? Improvisation in film is truly hard to carry off. Christopher Guest frequently gets it right. Cameron, however, apparently requires a strong screenplay to carry forth his highly applaudable notions of total sexual liberation with any depth.  In the end, Shortbus is a flaccid ride to nowhere.",1174608000,14,1214,4.803827751196172
2701472,4,B000LAZDQA,"And not all of them are angry!  All of them are explored, however, in very graphic detail.  Yes, in ""Shortbus,"" fiercely talented writer/director John Cameron Mitchell attempts to follow up his superb debut (""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"") with a film that looks deeper into the human condition, both emotionally and corporeally.

The film opens with a whimsical camera shot, swingin' swooshin' and swoopin' through and around a beautiful pastel skyline model of New York, over the swaggerin' sounds of a walking bass line.  That we are looking at a (literally) colorful representation of New York here is important, as some of the events that follow - especially those at the Shortbus salon itself - are meant to, I think, evoke a colorful representation of an idyllic (but not necessarily 100 percent realistic) place where one can go to work through one's sexual and emotional issues without fear of scorn or reprisal.

Some of the characters working on these issues include Sook-Yin Lee as Sofia, the sex therapist (oops, I mean ""couples counselor"") who can't negotiate the long and winding road that leads from her G spot to the big O (and no, I'm not talking about Gail and Oprah here).  Paul Dawson and PJ DeBoy are James and Jamie, who take in Jay Brannan's Ceth as the new meat in their five year old monogamy sandwich.

And along the way, there are enough strongly presented, well-performed and emotionally charged moments in this film to make it much more than ""that mainstream film with all the graphic sex.""  Plus it has a terrific soundtrack (Jay Brannan's song ""Soda Shop,"" which repeats on the DVD main menu, is especially catchy).  That being said, I think ""Shortbus"" ultimately pulls up a little, um, short when compared to the brilliance of ""Hedwig"".  In a way, John Cameron Mitchell made a nearly impossible task for himself by making such an outstanding first film - how do you follow something as instantly iconic as Hedwig?

In ""Shortbus,"" we get an envelope-pushing, genre-busting and daring film that truly is, I feel, the first film featuring graphic sex to have its other story elements resonate through and beyond the mere carnal titillation.  That in itself is no small achievement.  But, to me, ""Shortbus"" is no ""Hedwig"" in terms of overall cinematic inspiration.  And maybe it's not meant to be.  And maybe it's not fair to compare.  Smaller in scale and ambition, ""Shortbus"" still succeeds for the most part on its own merits.  I just wish the shadow of Hedwig hadn't loomed so large.

I would ultimately give this film 3.5 stars, but because of the excellent DVD features as well as my respect for the sheer bravado required to pull off a project such as this, I'm rounding up to 4 stars for this particular product.",1174521600,3,2746,4.818763326226013
2701473,3,B000LAZDQA,"Films that deal primarily with sex are quite plentiful but there's usually a weakened knowledge of the film in the general media. Aside from the controversy it'll raise over the explicitness of the scenes, most movies barely get attention other than people wanting to check out a hot actor or actress do something naughty. One of the few to get attention outside of the sex was Shortbus, directed by John Cameron Mitchell who did Hedwig and the Angry Inch. So how's the film as a whole? Well it's not as great as everyone says it is. I like the approach and idea behind it; I just wish there was a better movie attached to it.

The film's central character is Sofia, a sex-therapist or self-proclaimed ""couples counsellor"" who has never had an orgasm despite having a rather energetic sex life. A couple she sees, and other central characters are Jamie and James, a gay couple who want to expand their relationship and make it more open. They refer her to ""Shortbus"", a club for people looking to advance their sexual experiences. She also meets Severin, a dominatrix who finds it hard to connect with others. All of the characters have to connect to each other and figure out just what they need.

Of course, I must first address the sex. Unlike some unrated/NC-17 films that are just clearly oversensitive ratings board members, this film truly earns its rating. There is so much graphic sex, I was wondering if hardcore filmmakers decided to get all ""arty"" on us. Some of it works while others (such as the strangest Star Spangled Banner performance ever) is funny but then some is just unbelievably unnecessary (such as a character who basically self-fellates). It's of course a movie about sex but after awhile it just feels like they put it in since they got away with other scenes, what else can they do? To the filmmakers credit though, as was mentioned later in the commentary, the sex gets less graphic the further into the film we get and development characters get. On that level, it's a good balance and not just using sex as a shock value.

Main thing is of course the acting. Well, they're pretty good with one looking like a throwback to Ziggy Stardust era David Bowie, a really tattooed (but quite beautiful woman) to a character who almost seems to just basically cry a lot. I'm not really knocking the performances but they just don't really stand out amongst everyone else. The only one who does is Sook-Yin Lee but that's because, being Canadian, I grew up watching her be a MuchMusic VJ. As far as the story is concerned, well, at times it just seemed kind of slow. It's a short movie (90 minutes) but some scenes almost seem to just keep going and going and it would've been nice if some were at least cut down a tad.

Some will love it because it takes a realistic viewpoint into sex and shows it as a human experience rather than this thing we have to downplay while others hate it for what the film is or just what it didn't do. I'm in the latter partly because the topic was fine, but the execution missed the mark.",1174435200,2,3042,4.555758683729433
2701474,5,B000LAZDQA,"Strange as it seems, I watched ""This Film is Not Yet Rated"" and ""Shortbus"" in the same day. And some part of me wondered ... did John Cameron Mitchell even bother to submit this to the MPAA? Not, of course, because he expected to receive a ""passing-grade"" from the prudish parents (and the two members of the clergy) that run the ratings and appeals board ... but simply to force the cloistered collection of puritans to watch couples attempting to negotiate their sexuality.

The fantastic ensemble cast is phenomenal at arousing laughter, compassion, and perhaps a few tears. Moreover, in a weird way, watching Sofia navigate the Shortbus haven is kind of like a return to high-school parties: everyone is making out, someone is crying in the closet, a couple of people are watching television, a group of desperate goofs are playing ""spin the bottle,"" and your boyfriend (or girlfriend) is bored. Ohh, and you never leave very satisfied:)

What surprised me was how this film could have been painfully predictable, but was not. For instance, in the film's introduction, Sophia expresses that she has never climaxed with her husband. When she explores Shortbus, she meets Severin (a tortured dominatrix). When the two women bond and become intimate, the viewer is convinced that satisfaction will come from another woman. Not so (thank goodness!). In fact, she is betrayed by Severin's greedy lust. This is an unexpected, painful, and realistic turn for the film. I applaud the fact the Mitchell complicates sex ... there are no easy answers for Mitchell (Thank you!!)

Unlike some of the reviewers here, I do not think ""less is more."" We have lived with ""less is more"" for way too long. We Americans think sex is shameful ... and if any films include it, they better be hidden in back rooms ... behind ugly beaded curtains. These films invariably degrade both sexes and they degrade sex itself. This film shows Americans loving-couples (in many cases real-life couples) engaging in consensual sex. It illustrates the complications and beauty of these relationships. Never does it condescend. Instead, it graceful allows its viewers to become welcomed voyeurs ... we learn as we watch. We experience the joy and frustration of these characters. It is ... quite marvelous.

If you are tired of films that ignore the pleasures of sex for women (ignore, or as we learn from ""This Film is Not Yet Rated,"" simply are not permitted to show WOMEN enjoying sex), if you are searching for a film which treats the sex-life of gay men with playfulness and respect, if you are desperate for a film which makes sex ""sexy,"" messy, and complicated, then give Shortbus your attention.

But if films with gay men pleasuring each other and women finding pleasure at all, turn you off ... well, you may as well return to the area behind the beaded curtain. The rest of us will hope that Mitchell continues to build upon his ground-breaking works!

Thank you, Mr. Mitchell!",1174348800,164,2955,4.888223552894211
2701475,3,B000LAZDQA,"I have yet to see a sexually explicit film in which the sex acts explicitly depicted within were integral to the plot or furthered the story along (Romance, Baise-Moi, Raspberry Riech, 9 Songs).  Such is the case with Shortbus. Granted, if you take away the sex scenes you still have an interesting story (hence my three star rating).  But if the story can stand alone with out the explicit sex then why bother putting it in? This film could have been just as effective with simulated sex scenes or even implied sex scenes.  For me, the explicit sex took away from the story and seemed to be a contrived shock factor ticket selling ploy from Mitchell who probably couldn't top the sheer brilliance of Hedwig. I was also disturbed that no one in this film practiced safe sex. It's irresponsible and shocking on the actors and director's part.  I am all for films that explore sex and sexuality. It can be (and has been) done successfully without show the  sex acts or the ""money shots"". I'm no prude but I think explicit sex should remain in porn films, not a mainstream movie trying to pawn off it's sexual explicitness as ""art"" or ""true cinema"".",1174348800,6,1146,4.598039215686274

2701477,3,B000LAZDQA,"I purchased this DVD sight unseen because so many people told me I had to see it.  Nay, so many people insisted that I simply HAD to own it.  It was, they implied, the most revolutionary film ever released, and the next logical step in the Progression of Cinema - the Cinema of the Future.  I'm sorry, but in the end, I was completely disappointed.

Not that it didn't seem to have several things going for it, at least initially.  To begin with, the film opens with the most candid and realistic depiction of sex I have ever seen in a non-pornographic film, and for a few minutes I thought I was viewing something genuinely revolutionary.  And, also initially, it seemed to have a few candid and profound things to say about troubled relationships, until I figured out half-way through it that the characters in those relationships weren't really very interesting, or (with one exception) very likable, either.

This cinematic sex-fest was immediately different from pornography in that, not only did it appear that the characters were really having sex, they seemed to be doing so in a perfectly natural manner.  That is, the opening sequence seemed inhabited by real people, none of them extremely attractive (well, not to me), engaging in sex acts that appeared quite convincing.  As anyone knows, the point of pornography is sexual titillation.  Despite claims of ""redeeming social value"", all pornographic films exist so that the viewer may achieve prurient satisfaction from watching fantasy sex scenes with beautiful people.  The sex in Shortbus is anything but arousing; the participants not only appear to be really having sex with each other (and I believe they actually were), the sex seemed downright mundane.  So I was immediately struck by the believability of the opening scene, including the act involving a dominatrix prostitute, and one character's self-filmed auto-fellatio.  Believe it or not, that's where reality ended, and surrealism began to seep in.

The basic plot concerns a sex therapist named Sofia, played by the amazingly talented Sook-Yin Lee.  Ms. Lee was easily the most engaging thing about Shortbus, and her performance alone was the most enjoyable aspect of the film; she also presented the most likable character.  In the film, Sofia remarks several times that she does not want to be referred to as a sex therapist, but she prefers to be called a relationship counselor.  I kept thinking that neither her character nor the film's creators seemed to be aware that a sex therapist and a relationship counselor are not the same thing.  Anyway, Sofia is having her first session with a gay couple, James and Jamie, one of whom is a former child star and the other a former prostitute, when she inadvertently blurts out to them that she has never achieved an orgasm, despite her ""perfect"" relationship with her husband, Rob (who may or may not be gay himself).  In a sort of bizarre role reversal, James and Jamie suggest to Sofia that she try Shortbus.  What is Shortbus, exactly?  I spent the rest of the film trying to figure that out.

Shortbus appears to be some sort of combination sexual workshop / voyeur's retreat / cabaret, where those who are sexually confused, no longer attracted to their partners, or otherwise sexually hung up / inhibited / you-pretty-much-name-it can go to work out their sexual problems through uninhibited sexual play with a variety of partners and fellow sufferers.  The biggest problem I had was that virtually all of the patrons of Shortbus seemed totally immersed in their own shallow worlds, endlessly crying about their sexual problems until working them out through hours of joyous, uninhibited sex.  At one early point, one character remarks how hot the gay couple is.  Aside from their youth, I didn't get what was supposed to be so hot about them, as I am generally neither into twinks nor vapid, shallow people.  I didn't find much attractive about the rest of the cast, either.

The film takes place in New York City.  I am a gay man who has lived all my life in New York City, and I have never met people who even vaguely resemble the characters in Shortbus, nor would I want to.  I can imagine (in fact, in the wild 1970's, I have even been to) places in NYC that resemble Shortbus (if for nothing else, the wild sexual orgies reflected therein) but such places, few and far between (and now largely extinct) would have been organized and run by the Mafia purely for profit, and patronized solely by the sexually compulsive, for no other reason than the sex itself.  One would certainly not expect to find such a place filled with whole rooms of the sexually repressed, working their way to sexual health through a sort of sexual group therapy.  And the first thing I noticed about the mythical Shortbus club (if one could call it a club - I still don't know what to call it) is that it seemed to be operated entirely on someone's charity.  I never saw anyone collect an entrance fee, or discuss ""terms of membership"".  I kept wondering how such a multi-roomed sex orgy / cabaret / sex therapy ""establishment"" could exist on the Island of Manhattan virtually for free, where a hamburger and a beer is likely to set you back $[...] these days, and even then you are hustled out the door of most restaurants in less than an hour.  I got the impression that some of the inhabitants of Shortbus had been there for days, a prospect that seemed to me to be possible for the super-rich only.

As I say, there were some aspects of the film I thought were genuinely worthwhile, mostly the comedic moments, and a few of those were genuinely funny (especially the appearance of a character clearly based on former mayor Ed Koch).  The celebrated ""Star Spangled Banner scene"" struck me as puerile and tasteless, and I have never been accused of being a prude.  I sure didn't enjoy it for the drama, which was strained throughout, and bordered on bad soap opera.  Soap opera with sex.  I have nothing against sex, but the soap opera-lives of the main characters were boring as could be.  At one point, I glanced at the digital readout on my DVD player, and sighed as I realized I needed to sit through this movie for another hour, never a good sign.  At the film's climax, everyone's self-absorbed problems seemed to be magically solved, and the whole cast gathered together for a good natured sing along.  As the credits started to roll, I realized with a jolt that the few minutes of entertainment I managed to glean from the proceedings were not worth the amount of time I had wasted watching the film as a whole, and I rolled my eyes as I yanked the disc from the machine and filed it on my shelf, probably never to be watched again.  Revolutionary?  Perhaps, but the lapses in logic, the extreme surrealism (especially for a film touted for its realism) and the shallowness of its main characters all contributed to my ultimate  dissatisfaction.

I have heard nothing but great things about the director's earlier work, Hedwig and the Angry Inch, but after reading various reviews, I decided it probably wasn't for me.  Now I guess I'll never know, because there is no way I intend to subject myself to another film by John Cameron Mitchell.

What he has created in this important experimental film SHORTBUS is not only a fascinating probe into the complexities of contemporary sexuality but also a group of relationship stories that stand on terra firma and are not merely a matrix for the frank sexuality from which they are derived.

John Cameron Mitchell visits the relationships of several couples: a Canadian Chinese couples therapist/sex therapist (Sook-Yin Lee) who describes herself as ""pre-orgasmic - she has never had an orgasm - married to a stay at home man (Raphael Barker): a young gay couple Jamie (PJ DeBoy) and James (Paul Dawson) who are considering opening up their monogamous relationship; a Dominatrix (Lindsay Beamish) and her long time male client among others.  The location is New York City and in this melting pot is a club called 'Shortbus' where all manner of people visit to observe and participate in orgiastic activities, all with the goal of improving their libidinous experiences and heightening their pleasure zones  And it is in this club that each of the couples meet and interface and change and grow.

The film shows just about every form of sexual activity, none of it hidden from the camera at all.  Mitchell has the courage and skill to draw from a cast of unknowns some particularly strong characters and he is able to show full frontal tumescent men and uninhibited women like no other American filmmaker has dared.  The rewarding aspect is that Mitchell has finally succeeded in making a quality film for the open minded intelligent public who will not shy away in puritanical fright.  Mitchell's first film was 'Hedwig and the Angry Inch' which has become a cult favorite. With SHORTBUS he steps further into the arena of successful American experimental cinema with a courageous and wholly enjoyable little work of art.  He is a standard bearer and hopefully will open the gates for other directors to bury the fear of filming the sexual being - especially the ages long phobia of male frontal nudity!

2701480,4,B000LAZDQA,"To say this movie isn't about sex does it an injustice.  The main characters in the movie are unable to connect sexually with their partners.  Sex is a metaphor for intimacy, therefore ""good, fulfilling sex"" will solve their relationship problems.  The ""principles"" all end up at the club ""Shortbus"" to sexually experiment. But this only serves to highlight their unresolved issues.  The director did give the principles a happy ending, but getting there is unclear.  Maybe its on the cutting room floor.

The storyline is imaginative.  The acting average.  But there is nothing ground-breaking about this movie, as demonstrated by its low box office and no clear path as to how the characters overcame their crisis.  Sex is as normal as drinking water. Sex is also an emotion not just an act.  The director said he wanted to make an honest movie about sex, well, his movie just showed sex acts with no emotion, no feelings.  You can't have the ""act"" without the emotion and try and call it ""art"".

People who disparage this movie (for its real-sex acts) prefer to keep their intimacy private.  People who high-five this movie have no issue with sharing their intimacy with strangers.

As for the pornographic label, this movie is weak at best.  I didn't notice people getting turned-on in their seats by the real sex acts filmed in this movie.  But if they did, so what!!!  Porn is a block buster industry in America.

I liken this movie to any ""Woody Allen neuroses New York"" movie but with ""money-shots"".",1174003200,,1507,4.797665369649805
2701481,5,B000LAZDQA,"OK, when was the last time you left the movie theater and felt like you had been part of something important and amazing?  This movie is so touching...  It's also extremely funny, HOT HOT HOT, and right on the money.

DON'T MISS THE AWESOME 'MAKING OF' DOCUMENTARY made by Michael Sean Kamisky.  I laughed so much watching this.  PLUS it was so cool to see how JCM came up with the concept and how he got all the actors on-board.  Two thumbs up to JCM and MSK.",1173744000,2,460,4.2298850574712645
2701482,5,B000LAZDQA,"When I saw Shortbus I laughed, I cried, and I left the theater feeling profoundly grateful to John Cameron Mitchell and everyone who worked on this film.

There are many ways in which our freedom and dignity are taken away from us, every day.  JCM and company are trying to restore some of that.  Feel like something's missing?  Maybe you should get on the bus.",1173312000,6,361,4.507692307692308
2701483,4,B000LAZDQA,"I must say that I was so curious about seeing this film for various reasons including the obvious why Sook-Yin Lee is this much talked about real-sex film by John Cameron Mitchell whose Hedwig movie was amazing. I have seen so much TV and films that are very far out there like Sex and The City, Nip/Tuck, and Queer as Folk, but it still didn't prepare me for a so suprisingly shocking film about sex, love, and relationship in New York. It's about gay, straight, bi, metro-sexual, and everything in between....

Even the first 10 minutes of the film we are presented with scenes of real sex: the sex of various positions between Lee and her husband, the auto-fellatio(they actually show entire genital and actual ejaculation on camera...). Then it gets very wordy or conversational for a while until a ton of various sexual activities and orgies in the Shortbus club which the main setting of the film where Lee's sex therapist visits in pursuit to explore the depth of sex and relationships and ultimately she's the only woman there who is trying to experience her first orgasm. There is numerous moments the film looks very pornographic and documentary like. The main actors are very good and they all seem to be very comfortable to be part of the physical stuff. Sook-Yin is amazingly daring and vulnerable, and she was welling to really push the envelop doing this film. No wonder her boss from CBC threatened to fire her after she was cast for this film. She can act and she's much better actress than I had expected considered that she's more experinced as VJ and musician. I wonder if her family would accept her doing this film.

Besides the shock value of the real sex appeal of this film, it very well dealt with various issues. I think Mitchell is such a daring and alternative director. Well, I didn't think that it was neccessary to have all these real sex, especially there is strong story and purpose emotionally and spiritually. It could have well been simulated sex. When I watched the credits, there is at least 30 ""Sextras"". I wonder how the crew handle working on those orgy scenes.",1173225600,7,2103,4.681081081081081
2701484,4,B000LAZDQA,"first, let me say that i did enjoy this film. very much. as a sexually open person myself who thinks that many people's hang-ups about sex (doing it, talking about it, watching it) border on the ridiculous, i found it refreshing and exciting and humorous and lots of fun. i admire and applaud john cameron mitchell for taking on such a project and actually making it happen. that being said . . . i wanted more from it. it played out like a standard issue porn flick, really: scene, scene, sex, scene, scene, sex. as it stands, you could take out all of the graphic sex scenes and it would play like a typical mainstream relationship film. i wanted something dramatic and cathartic to happen DURING the sex, some angry naked confrontation, or an intense and intimate monologue. some of my most open and frank conversations with another person have occurred before, during, or just after sex, and i wanted to see more of that. even some casual nude scenes between the actors - you can be naked with a person and not be screwing them. one of the best parts of being in a couple is the ability to ""hang out"" naked. granted, all the actors did a stellar job, and to appear in this film was a fairly brave thing to do. but why not push them further and really test out what they can do? the novelty of having the graphic sex in the film became almost dull after a while (maybe that was part of the point?), because none of it really, truly advanced the plot much. there were a couple great moments, though: jamie bursting into tears after his orgasm during the opening credits; the look that is exchanged between the woman being screwed in the club and the therapist watching; the older gay man talking to the young gay man in the club and then realizing that he is about to be ditched in favor of the younger, prettier man across the room (been there!); and the ""star spangled banner"" scene was terrific. but the therapist confessing her own problems to her patients? wouldn't happen - a very ""non-genuine"" scene - she should have her license taken away! and the remote control vibrator scene? i didn't believe it for a moment - true humor comes from truth, and that played very poorly - it was thrown in for the sake of a laugh, at the expense of the characters. and did i miss something: why was jamie suicidal? why couldn't the therapist have an orgasm? and how did both situations get ""fixed""? or did they, really? not that everything has to wrap up nicely in a pretty bow by the end credits (i really don't mind the ""unanswered question"" that seems to be so verboten in american films), but these were pretty important plot points. i did like that the man in drag who owned the club got to engage in some sexy stuff himself, but i am a bit tired of the earthy, world-weary, sarcastic, seen-it-all drag queen character who imparts wisdom and witticisms to her underlings. i did have a great time watching this film, and i want to see it again (for the plot points AND the sex!), but all in all i found ""hedwig"" much more moving, and was hoping for more of that sort of thing in this film. maybe in ""shortbus 2: jamie's revenge""? :)",1171065600,25,3131,4.428076256499134
2701485,5,B000LAZDQA,"How sex and love help us grow as individuals and add greater depth to our self-understanding. It's an exceptional film if you look at it as an exploration of how we break down our self-imposed limits, try new things, and - sometimes - discover whole new territories within ourselves.",1169078400,10,283,4.795918367346939
2701486,3,B000LAZDQA,"I got in trouble recently because I forgot to mention to someone that a really great film showed genitals and sexual activity. So--heads up, people! Shortbus is all about sex. Not only is it all about sex, but it shows sex and genitals. Actors and actresses are sometimes having sex on the screen.

Now that that's out of way, for those of you into a little love with your sex, you'll find that too. But Shortbus is about all kinds of love: frustrated hetero love, homosexual love trifectas, roomfuls of people who love lots of people at once. It's about love for oneself and love for others. It's about satisfying the need for sexual orgasm and satisfying the need for friendship, attachment, commitment, and more emotional love. It deals with a troubled gay couple, a dissatisfied dominatrix-for-hire, a couples counselor who can't have an orgasm, and a wild club called Shortbus run by a cross-dresser who says the name comes because ""special"" people ride the short bus. That's true, yeah, but also emotionally, intellectually and socially stunted people ride the short bus, and you'll find those people, too.

Try not to zone out when characters go off on extended monologues or when the musical scenes drown out the dialogue and drone a little too long, and you'll find some new, fun looks at relationships and sexuality for the 21st century.

My personal opinion, though it differs from my wife, is this film suffers from the collaborative storytelling that involved Mitchell spending two years working with his performers to develop the plot and the characters. It's not as strong as it could have been with a single artist.",1168819200,17,1631,4.88086642599278

8160568,1,B000LAZDQA,"I love this movie and had a copy a long time ago I loaned to someone which was never returned so I bought another. I didn't watch it immediately and when I finally did it wouldn't play on my DVD player or computer. Since it had been so long I figured I'd never get a refund or exchange, so I simply just ordered another one earlier this week. I just now went to watch it and again it won't play on my DVD player or computer. I read the reviews and saw that someone else had the same issue. There's nothing on it that indicates PAL... and even if it was PAL it should play on my computer as I've bought a number of DVDs from Scotland and they play just fine on my computer. To say I'm very disappointed is an understatement. I will be contacting the seller about this too.

**Update - I contacted the seller and said exactly what I said here. A guy named Bryan emailed me that no one else has reported this problem, even though there is another review on here from someone who had the SAME EXACT PROBLEM, then said it was unlikely the DVD. He asked if I tried a different player... as I said before I tried it in my DVD player and my computer and it didn't work in either. He asked if I used a region 1 DVD player. If he had bothered to check my order he would see I live in California. I replied back that his response was insulting and he hasn't replied further. Bottom line is I have 2 DVDs I can't watch. I understand it's probably been too long to get a refund on the first one, but I ordered the second one this week so a refund shouldn't be a problem, but apparently it is.",1508457600,,1579,4.060897435897436
