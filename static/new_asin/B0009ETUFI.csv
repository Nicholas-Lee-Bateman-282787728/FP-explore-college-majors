2285114,4,B0009ETUFI,"I too had the old Target Training VHS tapes.  The workout is really great because it works.  You have to be dedicated to about an hour a day if you want to see results, but the good news is that you can split that up into two separate half hour segments (one for each of the first two DVDs).  The results come quick too.  That 30 day guarantee is pretty accurate.  You can tell a difference in a week!  It's not inches, but you can still tell that you've been doing something.  It's an almost immediate boost to your self esteem if you've been disgusted with yourself for being too lazy.

I give it 4 stars instead of 3 because the exercises are easy to do even if you aren't in great shape.  I have a bad lower back and a bad knee, but I have no trouble doing this workout.  I have to wear my knee brace but that's all.  The reason I would subtract a star (or two) is because I paid extra for the DVDs so that I could skip from one exercise to the next.  There are three levels in one, but I think that you should be able to skip from the 30 or 60 second mark of the exercise that you are on to the beginning of the next.  Unfortunately, if you hit the skip button on your remote, you might end up in the middle of the next exercise or even at the end of it.  There is no rhyme or reason to it.  Therefore, you have to fast forward like you would with a VHS tape to get to the next exercise.  Of course, you still don't have to rewind, but it is annoying nevertheless.

The only other personal suggestion I have about this workout is that you make sure you have time to steal away from other family members to do the workout.  Tony gets a little annoying, but it's all in the name of motivation.  You don't mind listening half as much when you're alone, but if anyone else is around or within ear shot, you're more likely to be embarrassed.  He's not nearly as embarrassing or even comparable for that matter to Richard Simmons though, so I guess it's worth it for the fab bod.  :)",1226620800,15,1982,4.069767441860465
2285115,5,B0009ETUFI,I used these videos when I was a junior in high school (I'm 31 now) to lose weight. I ended up losing 40 pounds in 4 months before returning to school for my senior year. I just had a little girl 4 months ago and am trying to get back into a regular workout routine. I am so glad to see these are now out on DVD. Instead of heading off to the gym I can just stick one of the DVD's in the machine while my daughter's asleep and I get the same great workout I did 15 years ago.,1225065600,11,475,3.712871287128713
2285116,5,B0009ETUFI,"These are as good as I remember!  I'm so glad they're out on DVD.  Now I can get my personal fitness program back on track.  Tony makes the exercises fun and he talks you through them so that it's not just a bunch of mindless repetitions.  He also waxes philosophical during the ""cool down"" portion of the DVDs, but even that makes him seem more like a real person and less like the hyperactive ""cartoon"" we've often seen him depicted as in the media.  The bottom line?  I love this series and I truly believe that if anyone can get my lazy a$$ off the couch it's uncle Tony!  Thanks, man! :~)",1218499200,17,593,4.241071428571429
2285117,4,B0009ETUFI,I had these on VCR tape and used them twice to lose weight and get in shape after I had each of my kids and they work well. Like anything else you have to be dedicated to using them for them to work. I pretty much wore the tapes out over the last 14 years and was glad to see them available on DVD finally.,1209340800,25,306,3.723076923076923

2285130,5,B0009ETUFI,These are pretty much a remake of the old VHS version which I always loved and got very good results from.  Tony Little is easy to follow and low impact. Great set for older or people with some back problems.,1424217600,2,208,4.2

2285132,5,B0009ETUFI,"I was bummed when my video cassettes broke of his series, glad to find a dvd..many years to come of him yelling TECHNIQUE at me, while I curse him out doing it.",1406073600,,160,4.03125
2285133,5,B0009ETUFI,"Awesome DVD's and just like the old ones I used to have on VHS. This program really does work! I lost 20 lbs in 10 weeks by doing nothing more than working out for 40 minutes three times a week. Each DVD is about a 20 minute work out for beginners which includes the warm up and cool down exercises. You will love this program! If nothing else has worked for you, try this no matter what shape you are in now, you won't be disappointed.",1405123200,,436,4.0813953488372094
2285134,5,B0009ETUFI,I love these videos. I use to use these when they were on vhs. I can't wait to start this workout program again. Highly recommend them. They work!!,1402790400,2,147,4.285714285714286
2285135,5,B0009ETUFI,"Tony comes across as a goof ball, but the exercises work. I used it years ago with excellent results. I wish I would have continued even while recovering. These exercises can be done by just about anyone.",1393545600,2,204,4.54054054054054
2285136,5,B0009ETUFI,"I used the video cassette in the 90s, and got in shape for the first time in 32 years!  I now use it to prevent osteoporosis and stress-related problems.  The first 20 minutes is instruction on proper form, which is crucial to getting results and avoiding injury.  I really like this feature of Tony's program.  The routine takes 30-55 minutes (depending on your level) if you don't ""fast-forward"" between exercises.  It is a good free-weight program.  I now exercise to the DVD on mute, with music my iPad plays off Pandora.  Once I get to advanced (I am optimistic!), I will probably move on to more challenging body-weight type exercises (like those described on the Mercola.com website).",1374710400,2,691,4.854700854700854
2285137,5,B0009ETUFI,"I have Tony Little's Target Training in the vhs version and was scared that they would soon break (you can only rewind and fast forward a vhs so many times). I was worried that these would be a different version than the vhs ones and I'm happy to say they are exact copies in dvd format! Anyone who is looking, look no further! He's embarrassing, but he's a great trainer.",1374019200,3,372,4.328571428571428
2285138,5,B0009ETUFI,"He's a goofball, but he exercises without all the crazy moves, teaches how to do it right, and keeps you on track during the workout. You either love him or hate him, but Tony has been a lifesaver to me. These CD's replace my VCR tapes, and came quickly, fairly priced, as described.",1370476800,,283,4.3584905660377355
2285139,5,B0009ETUFI,"I got these for my sister because her VHS tapes were so worn down from years of use. These actually do work, I lost weight doing the exorcises in the tapes my sister had, Along with eating right. You will not lose 100 lbs in 3 weeks without surgery. However if you eat the foods you like, in an actual serving size, and exorcise in any way, you will drop weight. I do the exorcises to keep active instead of sitting in front of a PC all day working. What I like about these videos is that the guy in them isn't just going through the motions, he keeps you interested. Even if he is annoying at times.",1370390400,,600,4.093220338983051
2285140,5,B0009ETUFI,"These are very old videos but Tony Little has always worked for me.  I was replacing my old VHS videos.  Glad I ordered the set.

2285141,4,B0009ETUFI,Great workout but Tony talks too much and is annoying. Wish you could just jump to stretch and workout without all the pre chit chat.,1353628800,,133,4.36
2285142,5,B0009ETUFI,"I'm a Truck driver and was in desperate need of a way to exercise in a cooped up truck found these videos worked out 3 times a week then started with the stomach video's lost over 40 lbs,ended up misplacing the video's I was searching for em couldn't find em did one more search on Amazon and wala Now I'm back in the routine 3 times a week. I would suggest these videos for anyone just starting to work out If i'm not mistaken Tony made these after he was in a bad car wreck as physical therapy, I love the 3 levels of progress also come on you can do it!!!!",1348876800,,559,4.0
2285143,5,B0009ETUFI,nice spot on work out! i would recommend muting the volume and picking your own music for ALL the work outs. our vhs is still working so its still great and i still use it for my abs workouts.,1346803200,,192,3.948717948717949

2285145,5,B0009ETUFI,I used to have these videos on VHS 15 years ago. I was thrilled when I realized they were now on DVD. They are each about a half hour long but they do work! You go at your own pace which is nice. You see a difference on your body within a month! I loved them before and I love them now. My butt is tighter and my hips are slimmer!,1332115200,,330,3.6619718309859155
2285146,5,B0009ETUFI,"Like the others I had the VHS tapes and got great results. Within 6 weeks my core was in shape and I felt the loose excess that needed to burn off with continued exercise. I stood straight naturally as my core was toned up. Yes Tony can get annoying with his ""You can do it!"" but I have to say the man knows his stuff and his program works for anyone no matter how much weight you have on. Now that my son is grown it's time to get back to me, not to mention that I will be standing up in a wedding as Maid of Honor on New Years Eve,Yikes! I know I can count on Tony Little to get me to my fitness goal on time. The VHS tapes are near death and thankfully there are DVD's now. Tony if you ever read this, from the bottom of my heart, you make getting in shape truly attainable. Thank you Tony!",1298678400,5,793,3.871165644171779
2285147,5,B0009ETUFI,"I have used these workout videos before in VHS form.  Misplaced those so had to get the DVDs.  This is a very good way to get an exercise program started in your home.  I used these before when I was very heavy and out of shape, and it really works.  Sometimes you feel like whomping Tony in the head if he says ""you can do it"" one more time, but the workout is thorough and good for any fitness level except maybe body builder types.  Tony Little is a good positive motivator.  I highly recommend these tapes, especially if you're just starting to try to get in shape.",1232409600,7,569,4.222222222222222

I bought the first in the series and although my bad eating habits is my number one issue, I wore out my first video, and DVD, and I am so glad that I found this three video box series. It has been one month and already my lower body has lost inches.

If you want to loose you fat this is the video trio to buy, and please understand the when Tony says he will see you tomorrow, you really need to do it every day.",1438041600,,518,3.933333333333333
