8595591,3,B00DOZNHTY,"""As amusing as it is for you, Adan, the real world isn't just a bunch of commercials on TV."" Adan Kundle (Greenwood) is one of the world's best ad executives. He owns his own company and it is one of the best in the world. When he wakes up in the hospital he is unable to speak in anything but ad slogans. When Karen (Posey), a nurse at the hospital he is at recognizes him she agrees to take care of him for a few days. This is an example of a movie where you hear what it is about and your first reaction is ""really, that is movie?"" but when you watch it it really surprises you. While this movie will not win awards the acting is great and the dialog is actually very funny and witty, considering half of the dialog is nothing but commercial slogans. I really like Bruce Greenwood and he is the main reason I watched this but I am very glad I did. Overall, a very good movie with great acting that is very much worth watching. I liked it quite a bit. I say B.",1378425600,,962,4.015625
