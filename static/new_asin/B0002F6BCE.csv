I was planning to spend no more than 15 minutes watching it but instead I stayed hooked until the end and then I watched special features too. Everything what previous reviewer said is true, if you know something about paintball and you have seen any movies before, you will see it as a joke. Acting and playing paintball is amateur or unrealistic, the plot, etc. But it's fun, it was fun for me and fun for all other kids I know who watched this movie. I'm not recommending it to anybody over 13 years of age or anybody who knows something about this sport but I assure you that it is much better than Power Rangers. I give it 4 stars because I had fun watching it, I took one star off because everything besides fun sucked.",1100649600,3,817,4.243589743589744
2090108,1,B0002F6BCE,"Are you looking for:

Bad Acting?

Bad Paintball?

Bad Direction?

A hackneyed plot?

Bad portrayal of the paintball world?

Unrealistic action?

Bad camera work?

Poor dialogue?

A waste of 90 minutes?

Then THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU!  If you're a paintball fanatic - don't bother you'll be disappointed.  If you're unfamiliar with the world of paintball and want to learn more - don't bother it's not going to help there either.",1094428800,3,430,4.819444444444445

8027603,5,B0002F6BCE,I am an avid paintball player and now my kids r as well. In your face and the William Shatner splat movies have always made my mood of paintball all the greater. I love watching in your face. Even though it's a b rated movie. I will always love this movie.,1493683200,,256,4.03921568627451

8027605,5,B0002F6BCE,The only paintball movie that is really about the sport of paintball. Talks about teamwork and drills and leadership.,1471996800,,117,5.2105263157894735

8027607,3,B0002F6BCE,"Okay I bought this movie because I bought it when it first came out on VHS and was still called In Your Face. I still enjoy it for how bad some of the acting is, but upon getting this one they cut out a lot of the original dialog and almost have some old school kung fu film dub over on at least one line. That is the only reason I really gave this 3 stars otherwise from it is entertaining and if you enjoy paintball and have kids they may enjoy this film. Things that do not make sense is they redub ""He is just compensating for a tiny little dick"" to ""tiny little Ego"" yet they still left the line ""Dammit Brit is it too much to have some food ready when I get home""
Sadly a decent film about a sport I enjoy that went down hill big time thanks to over zealous re-editing that was entirely unnecessary",1344211200,3,804,4.0
8027608,5,B0002F6BCE,"Ive been playing paintball for about 3 in a half years and am in my teens and have been on teams before and I know a lot about the sport and I got to say this is a great movie. If you are looking to get into the sport or you have been playing it for a long time this is a great movie. Ok the good things about this movie the rules,guns,paint,and the biggest thing is its about paintball. The bad things about this movie the sliding and jumping when they are playing the game is not real,and the acting sucks BUT WHO CARES ITS ABOUT PAINTBALL THE BEST SPORT EVER AND THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE FOR ANYBODY WHO KNOWS ABOUT PAINTBALL BUT IF YOU DONT THEN ITS GOING TO SUCK BECAUSE YOU WATCH IT FOR PAINTBALL NOT FOR THE ACTING.",1333497600,,719,4.034965034965035
8027609,4,B0002F6BCE,"Okay, i've seen this movie about three times. There are a lot of things I liked and didn't like. This movie to me was a good movie because I haven't paintballed before, but all the rules seemed realistic and logical. The acting is not very good at all, but the paintball scenes are great, and the extra features ( quite a bit, about 45 minutes or more worth. ) are cool. A problem with this movie, though, is that they actually bleep out cuss words. Such as one time near the end of the movie a character says "" this is bull..."" and it is obvious he said it, but it got cut out. This isn't anything big, I just see how it's funny that it's sometimes cut out and other times it is not. For god's sake it is rated PG-13. This movie is great for any paintball fan or anybody considering to enter paintballing ( Me! ).

I didn't think i'd finish the movie after watching the first few minutes, but right in the beginning there is already a paintball scene, and they keep coming throughout the movie. The story line is not too great, but it doesn't matter that much because after a little while you'll appreciate it and find it actually isn't that bad.

It took me two times of watching this movie to understand that was going on, there are a lot of ties in the movie you have to watch out for ( or at least I had to. ) Nonetheless, this is a great buy for the price, especially for a paintball fan, or it's great for a rental.",1133222400,2,1422,4.148550724637682
8027610,5,B0002F6BCE,"This is a good family flick. Well, older family, it is rate PG-13 with good reason: the language isn't terrible, but it is more than PG or G movies. It is short, so it doesn't really bog down. Yes, predictable, but what family movies aren't?

As for paintball play, it was surprising accurate for MOST players. I play speedball every weekend and occasionally woodsball (like many, I started with woodsball). I see a LOT of things that actually happen on the fields. Critics have to realize that this is a MOVIE and not clips of actual tourney footage. I was pleased to see a lot of attention paid to safety, although there were a couple of things that could be improved.

There were a lot of little tactics and strategy thrown in, which is good in that it helps the sport and players grow. For a ""Hollywood"" movie, this is very good, especially considering some of the other farces that have appeared.",1114473600,3,901,4.555555555555555
8027611,3,B0002F6BCE,"Okay, the acting is not worthy of an oscar, but it's a great story for any teen who loves paintball. It's all predictable, but has several different strands going to keep your interest -- if you like paintball. The ""Ian Hunter"" character is memorable, and his pronunciation of paintball from England's perspective is now ingrained in our family lexicon.

The action is good, the paintball games real enough, safety concerns are considered very well, and the story keeps me watching even after seeing it a few times with my kids. The language is terrible, lots of four-letter words, but otherwise its great for my kids to watch when they're short of money for paintballs -- and if they like paintball.",1101513600,3,700,4.833333333333333
