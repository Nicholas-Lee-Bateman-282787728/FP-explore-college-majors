The series features Marshall Crown (Stuart Whitman) the Marshall at Cimarron in Oklahoma. The Hunted begins as Marshall Crown enters an outlaw camp somewhere in the Cimarron Strip to accept the surrender of the Gauge brothers, (one played by David Carradine) two men tired of running from a bounty on their heads for crimes they did, and some they did not, commit. They had agreed to surrender, do their time, and start a new life, but Crown is intent on making sure their confessions, and sentences, include all their crimes. The brothers are required to remain in town pending the investigation.

While Crown is completing his investigation, a rancher brings in two bounty hunters to get revenge for the killing of his son, which he believes was the act of the Gauges.  The brothers are lured out of their sanctuary area, the bounty hunters strike, but incompletely, and the surviving brother seeks revenge upon the rancher and the bounty hunters within Crown's rules that his amnesty ends if he draws first.

Unlike the other reviewer, I experienced no problem with picture quality

A good story, well enough told with characters sufficiently well-molded to keep one's interest.  And good enough to get me started on the rest of the series.",1198886400,,1398,4.848739495798319
8217013,3,B000V78NQK,"I purchased the ""Cimarron Strip - The Hunted"" DVD and even though it is great having this wonderful series on DVD, I wish someone had taken the time to remaster the video.  The audio is great, but the video is something greatly to be desired.  The picture was not clear at all and I viewed it on an HD TV set.  I even played this DVD on a regular TV set and the picture was the same, very poor.  Like I said, it's great to have ""Cimarron Strip"" on DVD, just wish the quality was better",1192406400,2,485,4.020833333333333
