For example, the solution for Christians  is to form a circle holding hands and pray like crazy. Have these people heard of NASA and giant telescopes that probe the Universe? Praying doesn't do it for the NASA folks and other scientists. Elaine, try a scientific path: face it, God died centuries ago. I will get my information about the cosmos from the Science Channel to learn about the Universe, but just for fun, I will continue watching your presentations to learn about the mindset of ancient civilizations. They cheer me up.",1387584000,2,654,4.7368421052631575
8340044,3,B001SQ1ZZY,"I have not had the opportunity to view the DVD, although it seems to have suffered no damage. That is not thanks to the surprisingly poor packaging in which it was sent. The padded package was torn, and the box for the DVD damaged. I wrote a rather surprised note describing the situation--this has never happened before, and I have have had purchases sent from the U.K. (Germany, actually), the U.S., and here in Canada. What was even more frustrating was that Amazon.com didn't even bother to respond to my e-mail. The Canadian branch seems much more responsive. This has been a very disappointing experience... I can find a substitute container, but not one that fits with the others on the shelf, one that will display the nature of the contents like a book on its spine.",1305590400,,775,4.664233576642336
8340045,2,B001SQ1ZZY,"Elaine Pagels is a pleasure to read, pointed and informative. I hate to say this, but unfortunately, her performance before an audience is poor.  Very difficult to follow her presentation- and I read her book. I had wanted to give this DVD to friends in order to introduce them to Elaine Pagels' absolute  brilliance. I will give them her books instead",1264723200,3,352,4.754098360655738
