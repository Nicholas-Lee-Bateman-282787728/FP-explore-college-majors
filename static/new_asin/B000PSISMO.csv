8193040,1,B000PSISMO,"Every so often, I go back and listen to old albums or movies that I bought but didn't like, in the hopes that I might change my mind and take to it.  I've just about given up on this DVD.  I'm watching it again now while I'm writing this, and still I'm kicking myself for spending money on it.

First, the physical quality of the DVD is very poor, enough that it only plays on one of my DVD players.  The disk has that purple hue to the data side that makes me wonder who's basement this was pressed in.  Spelling errors on the jacket only further the cheapness of the DVD (and not the good kind of cheapness Frank Zappa talks about).  I guess I should be happy the the label isn't falling off.

A person reading this review is probably a fan of better films in this genre: Koyaanisqatzi, Baraka, Chronos, etc ...  Fantastic imagery with a complementary soundtrack that is good enough to stand on it's own.  In Necesidades, there's very little that's musically interesting going on here.  Cheesy keyboard effects over a dance track that does nothing to enhance or even co-ordinate with the images shown, anymore than with the chapter/song titles.

The DVD description goes on about ""contradictions in our needs"", citing ""pressure, chaos, and stress"" as opposites to ""relaxation, rest, and awareness"".  Pure dribble, which appears nowhere in this film other than on the back of the CD.  Well, perhaps chaos, but not by intent as far as I can see.

My recommendation is to save your money, find some ambient soundtrack that you really like, and so and shoot your own film.  If you have anything remotely interesting to record, you'll probably do better than was done here.",1302048000,3,1670,4.613559322033899
8193041,2,B000PSISMO,"This movie is fine, but he image quality is not good, the sound terrible and the message was confusing. I've seen many alternative movies and I really like,  but this one i was expecting more by the description we got here on Amazon. Good description, bad movie.",1240704000,2,262,4.574468085106383
8193042,1,B000PSISMO,"Of the 'no-voice' documentaries I've seen, this one was by far the least interesting.  Perhaps due to it's age, the newer ones I've seen, such as Baraka, make Necesidades look like a college art project.  It's nice to play in the background...but not a sit and watch again and again type film.",1237593600,,293,4.615384615384615
8193043,1,B000PSISMO,"This is just a collection of bad shaky footage from somewhere else. The music is shallow and repetitious. In today's fast media you need more from video/music art. It is like the film maker had no tripod. and this gives a ""art collage"" kind of feel, (which is where he may have wanted but it, just seems a little thoughtless and convenient) Its little more than a collection of shorts, poorly edited (with bad in-camera and easy Mac effects) with shaky slow motion footage of bland scenes and dull music.

Great saxophone though, Mete Erker.

It seems like a nice video diary and would be nice for memories of a trip. but to sell this seems strange.",1236038400,4,649,4.538461538461538
