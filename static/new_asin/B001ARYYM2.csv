8279277,5,B001ARYYM2,This is one of my favorite books! And a good book remembering my trip to Venice in 215!,1493164800,,87,3.888888888888889
8279278,3,B001ARYYM2,Misleading title--its actually sail from Venice to Istanbul not all over the place. The author concentrates on Venice past glory  which I doubt is much interest to anybody but whatever.,1438819200,,185,5.166666666666667
8279279,5,B001ARYYM2,I highly recommend this 12 part series. It begins in Venice and ends in Istanbul with many picturesque stops along the way.,1431302400,2,123,4.636363636363637
