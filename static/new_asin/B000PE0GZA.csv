I really got into the anime, when I bought them and almost watched the DVD's everyday. Fun fact, I met Masashi Kishimoto fact-to-face and spoke with him at the NYC comic con. I got his autograph and put it right next to the DVD's I got here, since they where the first official Naruto items I ever bought and owned.",1493942400,,423,4.170731707317073

I don't really like edited animation but naruto is a great animation and i really didn't care if it was edited, i have the uncut naruto boxsets from vol1 to vol7 just waiting for vol8 to come out, but this was a great naruto series.",1211241600,,302,4.135593220338983
