7820100,3,6302034965,"Rather than indulge in premarital or extramarital sexual activity of any kind, in any way shape or form, throughout one's lifetime, should one not marry, view an occasional film such as The Perils of Gwendoline in the Land of the Yik Yak. Satisfy yourself with the fantasy. Do not indulge in out of wedlock mutually consensual or nonconsensual sexual activity. Regardless how legal or illegal, moral or immoral such activity, or activities throughout your life, you will deeply regret your sexual involvements DURING your life, and, most importantly of all, at the END of life. A few aforementioned words to the wise that will prove true in everyone's life experience. Remember these words if you read them. Richie",1302566400,2,714,5.059322033898305
7820101,5,6302034965,"I found out today that the strange, but compelling movie that my mother rented for me one day when I was 12 and home from school ill, was in fact this one.

She rented it thinking it would be similar to the ""Indiana Jones"" movies.  It wasn't quite like those at all.  I remember lots of scantily clad people romping around and the heroine searching for a strange butterfly.  I know it would be easy to dismiss this movie as a kind of exercise in just getting lots of scantily clad people on screen, but I have to say that I've seen many many movies in the 18 years since I saw Gwendoline, but I still remember it.  Which means it must be good.  More interestingly, I also found out today that TAWNY KITAEN was the heroine.  Maybe that explains my previously inexplicable obsession with forming a band and getting successful JUST so that I could pay Tawny Kitaen to roll around on MY sports car.",1118275200,28,894,4.349397590361446
7820102,5,6302034965,"Now,I saw this film in 1984 while I was living in Tahiti,as a horny 19 year old (I was sent there to learn French,but thats a

whole other story!).What a hoot!,I never had such a good time

watching such a bad movie!,though I must say the credit roll

and accompanying music track were a beauty to behold,and so was

Tawmy but most of all Brent Huff,what a babe!.The film had the

kind of soft porn flavour as the classic Barbarella but more so

...thouroughly enjoyable!,bout-a-bout as the French say. I hold

until it comes out on DVD..",1104883200,12,538,4.484536082474227
7820103,1,6302034965,"This is a movie that is based loosely on John Willie's ""Sweet GWendoline.""  Gwendoline, played by Playboy model Tawney Kitaen,  is seeking a rare butterfly that was originally sought by her father.  She eventually finds a society of all women.  The girls are man starved and wear thongs, though the warriors among them get full armor, which means that they can cover their chests somewhat, while the worker girls are not so fortunate.  There is bondage aplenty and even a pony-girl powered chariot chase.  There is little doubt what the point of *this* movie is!
The movie is half dubbed in the same way that the spaghetti westerns were.  Those that speak French, spoke it and were dubbed into English.  Tawney did not have to learn french, and her part was spoken in English, as were the other two in her expedition.
The movie was written by ""Just Jaekin"" who has written several such things including ""Emmanuel"" in 1974.  This is the guy that is the idea behind the ""Just Jack"" in ""Will and Grace.""
If you want to see a lot of cuties prancing about and cat-fighting when they are not tied up in one form or another, then this is the movie for you.",1088467200,17,1149,4.538834951456311
7820104,3,6302034965,"Despite what Leonalrd Maltin says, this film, though a French production, is based on a comic strip created in America by an English-Australian, John Coutts (aka John Willie), which first appeared in his amusingly erotic fetish publication ""Bizarre"" in the late '40's-early'50's. The title was ""The Adventures of Sweet Gwendoline"" and has recently been released in a deluxe hardcover collection. The original story involved the heroine constantly getting captured by the villains trying to prevent a horse from being run in a race to save the family farm, and a mysterious bob-cut agent keeps on helping her out. The whole point of the comic and its sequels appears to be showing impossibly sexy women in bondage and sexy clothing. This film keeps the names of some of the characters, borrows some concepts from ""Bizarre,"" and does put the heroine in perilous predicaments, but basically goes its own way in theme and story.
In the film, our 1930's heroine, along with her faithful French maid (who wears the bob-cut), are seeking a rare butterfly that her late entymologist father disappeared trying to find. Their adventures take them to a steamy, slimy, decadent Asian port city where they meet a tough, world weary, cynical mercenary who rescues them from an unscrupulous gangster. They travel through jungles and deserts meeting cannibals, river pirates, and other dangers, until they find a hidden civilization of women. To say what happens next would give away too much and besides, the shock of the bizzarre is half the fun of the movie. Suffice it to say that there is much nudity and various forms of imprisonment, bondage, restraint, and gladiatorial combat (even a human-powered chariot race). It is all very French it its creation of scenes, locations, and cultures. It's as if certain elements of old movies that were done but not considered very important really caught the imagination of French fimakers and now they were trying to create their own version.
Many of the actors obviously were not speaking English during filming, and its pretty obvious that the film was completely dubbed. This does get a little distracting.
This movie plays occasionally on TV, where every bare breast must be edited out. This makes the end of the film very choppy. To make up for this lost time, the TV version includes some extra dialogue that makes the character development slightly more believable, and some extra footage that adds some comedy. The video tape lacks this dialogue and footage.
Old fans of the comic probably already know this film exists, it having recieved a lot of attention from the bondage and fetish community. New fans of the comic curious about this film should be warned that the style and frequency of the bondage and restraint is very different from the comic; focused a lot more on the wierd sci-fi dungeon aesthetic and mostly in the last quarter of the movie, rather than the traditional damsel-in-distress style. This was one of Tawney Kitaen's first movies and the filmakers wanted her so much they were willing to scale down the sex and bondage to please her.
Few people would call this a ""good"" movie, though many people would enjoy it. If you want an actual ""good"" movie, subtract one star from this review. However, ther is plenty of stuff that will make an audience react: nudity, violence, blood, corny dialogue, bad dubbing, great production value, etc. If you enjoy this sort of thing, add a star.",988329600,92,3441,4.955017301038063
7820105,5,6302034965,"I find this movie to be hilarious.  It is truly BAD, but it's so much fun to watch.  It's like a bad romance novel made into a BAD romance/comedy/action flick with a little zest thrown in from Tawny Kitaen.  Most guys tend to like the eye-candy.  Most women like the bad romance novel aspect.  It's great for those who like BAD movies.  ENJOY.",984960000,17,343,4.365079365079365
