8557644,1,B00ATP23TM,"I haven't seen the movie but wanted to buy it.  From the description and write-ups it looked like a great one!  I don't understand why supposedly ""so-called"" Christian or ""family"" movies have to spoil really good ones with immodest dress and other inappropriate things.  Thankfully, the trailer for this movie showed a woman in a major low low low cut very revealing top and I didn't even have to buy it to see if it was a clean one.  Sometimes the trailers don't show it.",1466380800,,472,4.517647058823529
