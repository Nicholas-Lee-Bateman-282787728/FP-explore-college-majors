7904791,5,B000006QJX,"A&E's biographical spectial on David Copperfield provides a wonderfully endearing portrait of this masterful illusionist, who even as a pre-teen astonished seasoned magicians with his magical genius, dexterity and skills.",1285891200,,221,6.4
7904792,2,B000006QJX,"As much as I admire David Copperfield's skill, originality, charisma and innovation, I must admit that I was quite disappointed with this biography.  First of all, it is mostly promotional and totally superficial.  There is no insight into the character and no critique.  As a DVD it was sent to me on DVD-R format with no extra features and no chapter menus as a professional DVD should be.  The chapter points are haphazard and go right through the commentary at random points.  This is just a copy on DVD of the TV programme with no proper authoring.",1151452800,3,553,4.65979381443299
7904793,5,B000006QJX,"David Copperfield is one of the greatest entertainers alive, as well as one of the most famous.  This excellent biography has interviews with family, friends, crew members, and the main man himself.  This tape will show you why he is the best at what he does, and also shows you how he got there.  Every David Copperfield fan should own this, as well as any magic fan. He took this art to new levels, and will go down in history as one of our greatest!",1064707200,3,452,4.294117647058823

With his being a part of it, magic is given an heir of artistry, respectability and pride.
