8392285,3,B0039Q7WAS,"From The Forgotten Heroes Of The 20s To The New Olympic Dream

Let me begin by admitting Im an older guy who enjoys most sports, and also learning about anything new & historical. Probably the American product of too much National Football League, Im not all that familiar with international rugby. This past St. Patricks Day I happened upon the Six Nations Championship between England vs. Ireland, and though understanding little, it was very interesting. Hence, the acquisition of this 2010 DVD release. With a primary running time of an hour, this DVD is less about history & rules of the game, and more about emotion & camaraderie. Thats was wonderful, but a tedious amount of time was occupied in one-on-one soundbites, and the background music during these interviews annoyingly fought the dialog. The main 60minute program rapidly spans the 17 chapters listed below. The menu also offers a brief section of Archival Footage that lasts approx. 5 minutes total. Finally, theres another small selection of Bonus Sequences. Its well meant, if not a bit boring.

8392286,3,B0039Q7WAS,"Interesting documentary for the Rugby enthusiast, however, already outdated as it is basically about 2007 and there has been no real change or growth in the U.S. Sport going into the 2015 World Cup.",1438041600,,198,4.852941176470588

i really enjoy this movie because it shows allot footage and shows the growth of the rugby communities that i am a part of.

how ever i feel that this movie is more informative that entertaining. you would find it more interesting if you didn't know anything about american rugby.",1382572800,,370,4.676923076923077
8392288,4,B0039Q7WAS,"A Giant Awakens is a quick overall history of the sport of rugby in the United States. It is slickly produced with very high production values. The fact that the producers unearthed film of the United States beating France in 1924 is reason alone for any rugby aficionado to purchase the DVD. Other than that, rugby NEEDED this film as a way to introduce the game to the interested public, potential high school and college players as well as their parents, and athletic administrators.
I'd give it a 5 star rating except for one glaring omission, at least to these old Ohio eyes............Outside of a minor mention of little kids rugby in Colorado, anyone watching the DVD would think that the sport is ONLY played in California. Senior men, women, college men & women, little kids rugby - all California. It is played across the United States, and quite successfully I might add. I realize there was probably a focus issue, but some mention and a few feet of film would have been nice to broaden the scope.",1278806400,13,1010,4.679775280898877
