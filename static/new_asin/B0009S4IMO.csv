2318396,5,B0009S4IMO,"This is a great DVD.  The episode on erosion (Rocks and Rolls) and the power of water is one of our MSB favorites.  The water cycle one (Wet All Over?) is also very good, although maybe not so much for the particularly young (my littlest one lost interest in this one at 3yrs old).  The field trip to the bottom of the lake was ok, but we wouldn't list it among the best.  I was hoping for an exploration of a coral reef, but apparently I'll have to wait a little longer!",1145750400,16,471,4.086956521739131

2318398,5,B0009S4IMO,"My wonderful grand-daughter is 3 and uses a wide range of words making her
vocabulary well versed.  Videos like the Magic School Bus helps her look at
stories in an educational way.  For instance, at the doctor's office, she
was talking about the solar system.  People waiting in the area could not
believe she was talking about Pluto and Saturn, stars and moon.  Good job
done with the videos.",1287446400,,394,4.666666666666667

2318402,5,B0009S4IMO,"Intrepid Ms Frizzle and her curious young students are back with another great show, well, three episodes actually: In ""Wet all Over"", Ms Frizzle shrinks everyone to teardrop size to learn about the water cycle, in ""Rocks and Rolls"", the class goes on a rocky adventure to discover how erosion takes place, and in ""Ups and Downs"", the gang heads for the bottom of Walkerville Lake for another adventure.

Total running time is about 80 mins and the language options are English, Spanish and French. My 5 year-old loves this series and it's a great way to cultivate her interest in science. Highly recommended!",1275436800,14,609,4.855769230769231

2318406,5,B0009S4IMO,"Magic school bus is always a hit in our house, and catches a wave is no different.

2318410,5,B0009S4IMO,"I homeschool (unschool) my son, and the Magic School Bus series is GREAT for teaching kids science. We now have all the DVD sets and a few VHS's.

If you're unfamiliar with the premise, the central characters are Ms. Frizzle (a teacher), her class, Liz the lizard and the Bus. Ms. Frizzle takes her class on crazy field trips, where Bus--and sometimes the kids!--experience a transformation so they can get closer to the action. (For example, become a bee or turning into water droplets.)

I recently purchased The Magic School Bus: Catches a Wave for my son to complete our collection. As usual, it's excellent!

This particular DVD has a run time of 80 minutes and features these three episodes:

Wet All Over - The Friz takes her class on a rainy ride through the life cycle of a water drop.

Rocks and Rolls - Friz and the kids go on a rough-n-tumble journey as they see a boulder subject to water erosion.

Ups and Downs - This bubbly trip takes place at the bottom of Walkerville lake!

There's not much in the way of bonus material, as usual (only What Comes Next?: How Fast Can YOu Unravel These Water Mysteries). The languages available are English, Spanish and French.

Highly recommend edutainment for children, especially if you want to introduce or reinforce science concepts!",1189468800,10,1289,4.723214285714286
2318411,5,B0009S4IMO,"All the Magic School Bus videos are great...the best ""video"" education for your children for the $$$  !!!
My girls love this video because they love the water...as do most kids.  Each of the three episodes covers an aspect of the water.
I have quite a few Magic School Bus videos and the girls watch it on Discovery Channel in the AM, too.  It is colorful, interesting, and highly educational...without cramming the point down their throat.",1186963200,,440,4.7631578947368425

2318415,5,B0009S4IMO,"This DVD has been so helpful with my children.  I have 2 autistic children who Love this DVD series.  I decided to show them The Magic School Bus since it is educational and they absorbed and memorized it very quickly.  They now have a better grasp on science, math, every day life, the enviroment and much more thanks to this DVD and the many others like it.  I would recommmend these DVD's for both special needs and typically developing children. It is entertaining (even for adults) and it is brightly colored, peppered with humor and has great facts.
