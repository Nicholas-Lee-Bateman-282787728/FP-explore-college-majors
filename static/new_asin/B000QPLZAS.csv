8196727,3,B000QPLZAS,"Disclaimer:  The version of this film that I viewed was included in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crime-Boss-Collection/dp/B003XUC6ZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crime Boss Collection</a>&nbsp;put out by Pop Flix.  As such, I cannot comment on the audio or visual quality of this independent disc.  My review is concerned with the entertainment value of the film only.

Maurizio Merli, who plays former inspecter Tanzi in THE CYNIC, THE RAT, AND THE FIST, starred in several of the Poliziotteschi films from 1970's Italy - films that, taking their cue from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dirty-Harry/dp/B001EC0OQI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dirty Harry</a>&nbsp;and other like-minded gritty police thrillers, were known for their violent, over-the-top cops AND villians, and often including high-level corruption, vigilanteism, intense car chases and a scenic overview of the Italian criminal landscape, circa mid-seventies.  This is actually the second (and last) film he would play Tanzi, and would also, during the same time period play another police officer, Commisario Betti, in three films - though I can't tell a dime's worth of difference between them.  In other words, Merli plays Merli - and if you've seen any of his other films from this time, chances are you'll have a very good idea at what this one has in store.

Tanzi's left the force in this one, but the past hasn't left him.  A criminal named The Chinaman (Tomas Milian), whom Tanzi put away years before, has broken out of prison and is up to his old tricks.  He puts a hit out on the former policeman, and Tanzi, who survives, goes underground, putting out the story that he was killed.  From his new vantage point, he goes after The Chinaman, as well as a mob boss that China has hooked up with (John Saxon).  Tanzi begins to fan the flickering flame of disension between the new partnership, and if he can stay out from between them, he may get everyone else to do his cleaning up for him.

As a genre, Poliziotteschi has its charms, I suppose, but this one left me rather flat.  Most of that is Merli's fault - he's just not the same caliber actor as some of his contemporaries who took their turn in these sorts of films.  Think Dolph Lundgren or Jean-Claude Van Damme and you have the basic style, without the roundhouse kicks.  Even Tomas Milian seems lackluster in this one, and I've enjoyed everything I've seen him in up to this point.  John Saxon, as the requisite American name isn't too bad here, and Gabriella Lepori, is quite gorgeous, even though her main reason for being in the film seems only to get smacked around by everyone else.

Umberto Lenzi helms the picture (who would go on to explore the limits of good taste in helping perpetuate the cannibal genre a few years later) and, as relatively simple as the plot is here, I think he lets his material get the better of him.  Better, in my opinion, was VIOLENT NAPLES (also included in the Crime Boss collection), with many of the same cast members, including Merli and Saxon, but with a simpler story.  Throw in a repetitive score by Franco Micalizzi, and all together you have an average film when compared to others of its kind.

As far as who to recommend it to, I'd say it comes down to what you think of genre Italian Cinema from this time period.  If the more outlandish and outr aspects of the giallo, the western, the crime film, or the horror appeal to you, then this one might be worth a shot as a bit of average trashy fun.  It certainly won't change your mind if you haven't appreciated them before. If you are new to the genre but interested, I would highly recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fernando-Di-Leo-Crime-Collection/dp/B004D8P23U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fernando Di Leo Crime Collection</a>, which is also available in blu-ray, for a good look at some entertaining, offbeat films of this style.

The version that was included in the Crime Boss collection that I own, or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/this-one/dp/B002ID093U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">this one</a>, looked pretty good for the price.  Presented in widescreen and clocking in at 95 minutes, I might suggest that this is a very attractive alternative to the current secondary market price that is just north of 85 clams.  I'm a fan of these Pop Flix compilation sets anyway, but in the collection I bought each film averages out to about $1.07.  I don't know what extras come with this single disc, but I bet they're not worth eighty bucks.",1338336000,2,4664,5.28590785907859
8196728,4,B000QPLZAS,"This classic italian crime thriller finally gets a dvd release. The video footage is nicely cleaned up and in fine shape.  The sound however is not at it's best.  there are several drop outs (no sound spots) and the sound effects sound sometimes seems not to match the action by a millisecond.  but that hardly is a worry when you have such a well made crime thriller.
the great john saxon plays the sadistic demagio who likes to feed his enemies to his dogs. He's from new york and is trying to take control of Romes crime scene.  I suppose he is the Fist of the title.  He alligns himself with recent prison  escapee and lead crime figure; the Chinaman, played expertly by Tomas milan.  The Chinaman is a psychopathic killer who can kill you or leave you alone and not bat a eye.  I suppose he is the rat of this feature because he betrays his friends with little concern for them.  Standing in the way of these two killers is the cynic; a ex-cop played by  Maurizio Merli. The chinaman tries to kill him and draws him into the conflict between the two crime figures. The cynic is not bound by being a police officer anymore so he plots the downfall of his two enemies with a good reason for revenge himself.  You will have to watch the movie to see why he's so angry at the crime bosses.  But if you are in the mood for  a good crime exploitation movie from europe this movie might just be the ticket for you.",1213833600,4,1412,4.283018867924528
