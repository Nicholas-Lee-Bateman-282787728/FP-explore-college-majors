8098617,5,B000CEVC88,Interesting film and great restoration for a film as old as this one. Much better than the Alpha Video copy.,1494028800,,108,4.45
8098618,2,B000CEVC88,"It's fun to watch a 1933 movie just because filmmaking was generally so laughably primitive. (There are, of course, notably meritorious exceptions.) Jungle Bride couldn't possibly have a more ridiculous storyline, worse acting, etc. But it gets an extra star for being first in so many fields of atrocity (e.g., fake scenes of wrestling and killing a lion, boxing without landing a single punch, etc.) 2 stars.",1481068800,,410,5.134328358208955
8098619,5,B000CEVC88,"Great screen chemistry between the stars. Anita Page's character knows what she wants and Ms. Page is a very attractive pre-code bombshell in this one. Starrett is tall, good looking, laid-back and the perfect guy for a romantic shipwreck movie. ""Jungle Bride"" is just for entertainment but it delivers the goods.",1431129600,,313,5.1568627450980395
8098620,4,B000CEVC88,"JUNGLE BRIDE (Monogram, 1933), is a fun pre-Code adventure/drama that features a great shipwreck scene (actually more like a toy boat exploding in a bathtub), ferocious animal attacks, and a braless Anita Page in a torn dress.

 The plot concerns Page and her reporter/fiancee, Kenneth Thompson, shipwrecked on an island with a couple of entertainers, Charles Starrett and Eddie Borden. Thompson believes Starrett is guilty of a murder that Page's brother has been accused of and is determined to bring him in. Meanwhile, Page begins to fall for Starrett which only further infuriates Thompson.

Directed by Harry O. Hoyt, JUNGLE BRIDE depends on the appeal of its two leads, Anita Page and Charles Starrett to carry it through its lean 62 minutes. The shots of panic interspersed with stock footage aboard a sinking ocean liner are well done, especially for a low budget programmer. There's a revealing bit where the amply endowed Miss Page strips down and washes her clothes that wouldn't pass the censor the following year. Kenneth Thompson makes a good, sleazy villain - a role he specialized in, while the odd-looking Eddie Borden is okay as Starrett's faithful pal. I can't help seeing shades of GILLIGAN'S ISLAND, which only adds to the fun.

Alpha's DVD looks like a so-so VHS transfer and is missing a racy shot of Miss Page. By far the best quality on this title is VCI's pre-Code double feature which is off an excellent 35mm nitrate print, and includes the rarely seen HELL HARBOR (1930) with Lupe Velez.

If you enjoy early '30's jungle romps with lion fights, mischievious monkeys and scantily clad babes, JUNGLE BRIDE is recommended.

UPDATE: April 9, 2018,
I ordered Film Detective's 'restored' version of JUNGLE BRIDE, and while it's a step or two better than Alpha's, the whites still burn out. VCI is definitely the one to go with on this title. As I said, it appears to have been transferred from a beautiful, 35mm nitrate print.",1384041600,4,1949,4.908814589665654
8098621,2,B000CEVC88,"This film was very watchable when first released but......if I had to make a guess, this presentation from Alpha Home Entertainment is a VHS tape copy of a VHS tape copy finally transferred to DVD.  The detail is almost gone which ruins the tantalizing scenes featuring Miss Page.  It also ruins the excellent wild animal footage included in the film.

Only very serious collectors of pre-code films should bother with this one. Only someone who works for Alpha or Amazon.com would give this item 5 stars.  Be careful what you read.",1247616000,2,532,4.813186813186813
8098622,1,B000CEVC88,"This is a sub standard DVD-R copy and is obviously breaking many international laws infringing on the copyright of this film. The movie itself is poorly acted and the copy is blurry and a very inferior copy of a copy of a copy. My advice is to stay away from this DVD-R copy.
Shame on you Amazon!",1228262400,,296,4.2105263157894735
8098623,5,B000CEVC88,"JUNGLE BRIDE is an enjoyable ""B"" movie starring two of the best-looking personalities of the 1930's, Anita Page and Charles Starrett.  Anita's brother has been arrested for murder; he implicates Starrett, who has fled the country and gone to South Africa.  The movie opens where newspaperman John Franklin, who has been deputized, is bringing the much-publicized Starrett back to the states for prosecution.  Anita is Franklin's fiancee and is accompaning him.  The ship they are on sinks (in a superb segment that truly suggest the pandemonium of such an event) and Anita and Charles are among the few survivors, stranded on an uncharted terrain.  Just as Anita starts to see Charles is an honorable guy who should also happen to wash ashore but her fiancee Franklin.  It doesn't take psychic ability to predict who is her ultimate choice.

This rather routine movie is enliven considerably by two of the most undervalued actors of the era, Anita Page and Charles Starrett.  Lovely Anita is one of the most gorgeous women who ever made a name for herself in films and at times is quite scantily clad in best pre-code fashion.  Providing the beefcake to go along with Anita's cheesecake is handsome Charles Starrett.  Anita at age 23 was already on her way out in Hollywood, her golden years at MGM already behind her and this was one of her handful of post-Metro poverty row films.  In the 1990's, the media rediscovered the still-living icon and she gave a number of interviews and made a few additional films, playing small parts in some very minor films.  At this writing she is still with us and age 95, one of the very last survivors of the silent and early talking screen.

Charles Starrett, seven years Anita's senior, was just starting his career when he made this picture.  Two years later he would begin a career as a major ""B western"" hero, starring in well over 100 westerns for almost twenty years.  He retired in the early 1950's and passed away in 1987 at 84.

These are two appealing young stars I could watch in anything but I think anyone who enjoys programmers from the thirties will find this little hour-long potboiler well worth their time.",1140912000,14,2163,4.774193548387097
