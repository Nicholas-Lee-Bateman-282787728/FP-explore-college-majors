903144,2,6304636989,"What can you say? There's no great art here.  There's Teresa Graves, a long, tall good-lookin' woman, catch phrases (""You're under arrest, sugah!"") and lots of afros, bellbottoms, and butt-kicking as Christy Love cleans out a nest of drug dealers - her way.  There's nothing innovative here, and definitely no great acting, but this was only an ABC TV-movie meant to introduce the short-lived TV series.  Now, of course, it looks like tacky 70s kitsch, and that's exactly what it is.  Great fun but don't pay a lot for it, and don't expect too terribly much.",1010016000,9,558,4.78125
903145,4,6304636989,"Christie Love is funny and action-packed.  A black female cop out to keep the man out of her face and the drugs out of the hood.

I was like, ""wth man....is that Whitney?!""  Anyway, this is a great movie...solid plot, (mildly) action packed and the acting is up to par.  It puts you in the mindset of the 80's cop shows (mostly Charlie's Angels), but it delivers.  I was pleasantly surprised and extremely happy with my purchase.  I watch it often and when I watch it with/ recommend it to others they love it.  You won't be disappointed.",1463616000,2,555,4.851063829787234
903202,2,6304636989,"Not a great pilot, but you can see how the blaxploitation film era led to this ""first ever"" black female cop show.  The actress playing Christy gives the role a spirited go at it, her sass & attitude (yep - cant outrun those stereotypical traits) and her looks are fun to watch.  Beware - you may fall out laughing at how the show opens and closes with Christy's boss (Lieutenant or Captain) first criticizing her work/skills, then threatening to put her on crap duty, followed by this same Boss PANTING as he literally walks her to her apartment door (which is all the way up a long set of stairs), asking if he can come in for a ""nightcap"" , before insinuating that he'd really like for Christy (spitting image of a young Whitney Houston) to pour him some of her ""chocolate milk"".  That's Sexual Harassment 101, Captain!  We can only hope Christy sued and got to take early retirement after the show was cancelled.

You couldn't make this show today.  And yet I don't think THAT'S the main reason no one's made another black female cop show in over 40 years.",1463011200,2,1060,4.494791666666667

903273,5,6304636989,"A hilarious unapologetic trip back to the 70s when made-for-TV movies didn't have to be perfect. Witness the very popular 70s heavy sound of trumpets in the background music; sudden scene changes with obvious soundtrack interruptions; jumpy and scratchy film; harsh lighting; bad acting; silly fight choreography; horrible film editing, and so on. What was the very serious 70s norm, is highly hilarious now.

This is the made-for-TV film that started the Get Christy Love series. Christy is hired in this story to break up a huge drug-ring and there are some very funny situations and gags along the way.

I want to be called ""Sugga"" and ""Baby"" the way Christy said it back then. I want to eat at The Broken Drum restaurant - You can't  beat it! My favorite line is during a fight in a high-rise Hotel by Christy, ""Come on! It's only 15 floors down, and you don't have to worry about the first 14!""

903351,4,6304636989,"Seems like quite a step from JULIA (tv series), the first BILL COSBY show, to GET CHRISTIE LOVE (made for tv movie), in the slow progress to have an African American as prime time star - the latter showed a woman in charge, a strong, physical, defiant force, when ""smart and sexy"" was obvious and not repeated in the dialogue as a reminder.

A good script has Harry Guardino, as the stereotypical Police Chief, playing against the very a-typical Detective, in hip-huggers; he pulls the eager young Love off the complicated case. Don't have to tell you what happens next - she manages to penetrate the pysche of a troubled woman, all mixed up in the drug world, but one whose photographic memory has been a great benefit to the drug lords.

Guardino is stereotypical, as plotlines go, but there's a surprising twist in spots -he expresses interest in something impossible on TV as late as 1968 and still controversial after Feminism went Federal: something more ""social"" than occupational.

There's a small subplot involving the making of a martial arts movie, and it seems the Director missed a chance to have Christie show off *her* skills, in that arena. Further, the aforementioned, gifted, woman with the extraordinary memory banks, should have been given some more footage, utilizing her powers.

Altogether, an entertaining look-back; and chance to for many to say, Teresa Graves could do a lot more than dance (""Laugh-In"").

903357,3,6304636989,"Christie Love (Teresa Graves) is really a substandard cop who is too direct. She manages to subdue her opponent even though she can't kick her foot higher than a guy's kneecap. She goes after a heroin dealer with about as much tact as Peter Sellers. The film causally drops the n-word without anyone getting sued or charged with a hate crime. All the cops had big hair back then. There was no concern over warrants and jurisdictions. A credit card could open any dead bolt lock.

The film has camp value if you pay attention. Oh yes. It is nice to know a street hooker costs the same now as it did in 1974. How do they get by?

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.

In an early scene a would-be John calls prostitute posing Christie the N-word when she asks for too much money. She causally walks off calling him a ""N-lover.""

Get Christi Love was not cancelled for poor ratings. It was actually because she found religion. Now, that's not a bad thing. But she said she couldn't do the sexy stuff or shoot bad guys anymore. That made it tough to do a cop show on TV. After that she did a few other things and then concentrated on her religion thing. It's to bad she left TV and a real shame that she died at only 53. She was the first African American woman to star in her own TV show. Hard to believe it took that long to get past that. If you're a fan of the 70s or can remember that far back, you will also see some familiar supporting actors. The DVD quality is not great and her career was just starting. It is the 70s too. But if you are a Teresa Graves fan, it's a must have. Maybe the TV show will come out on DVD at some point as well. I gave it 5 stars. Four, plus 1 because it's almost all there is of Teresa to see today. Teresa Graves was real class, beauty, talent and full of energy. In person, her presence could fill any room.

903397,4,6304636989,"...P>I like it! A lot.
... The tape spent quite some time on the bookshelf but now that I have finally seen it I am in love!
It must be the box art that put me off, a garrish watercolor blending an approximation of Teresa Graves' face with Pam Grier's, uh, other attributes. Learn from my mistake and don't let that put you off, the movie really is a blast.
Production values for this film are definitely made-for-TV, B-grade standard. But for less than ten bucks you get two competently realised car crashes plus a couple of unequal struggles between Miss Graves and the evil drug-lords' henchmen.
The story isn' t too shabby either. It succeeds to put just enough motivation into both actors and actions.
Not that I would know anything about it but the dialog sounds  totally ad-lib and incredibly cool all at the same time. The IMDB lists what appear to be TV comedy gigs and Teresa Graves really displays the timing of a great comedian.

The IMDB bio for Teresa Graves consists of just one lousy cryptic sentence, saying that she curtailed her career because she allowed her religion to limit her role choices. On the basis of this one film alone I find that hard to believe. The title character is sexy, tough and cool, the very poster girl of an independent woman.
It was a bit weird watching this film because to me she looked so much like Whitney Houston, a taller, fitter, Whitney Houston with a great sense of humor. Oh, and one of her junkie contacts looks exactly like the girl from present day THE PARKERS TV show. So weird!
The only reason for me to withhold the fifth star is the bad audio and so-so visual quality of the budget tape published by Ideal Enterprises.",1015113600,22,1680,4.5230263157894735

Out of curiosity I decided to see what all the buzz was about and I have to say the show sadly was a let down. This is not to that the star Teresa Graves did not do a great job in the title role, but the story seemed so drawn out for very little pay off.

I will admit that considering when this show aired amongst all the blaxplotation films that were playing in the cinemas, the title character does not stoop to being just another ""jive talking street smart mama"", but more played to be a kinda smart pants lady who thinks on her feet. Which I thought made the character stand out.
