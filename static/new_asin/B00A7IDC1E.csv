8547895,2,B00A7IDC1E,"Author should have probably written as a book or short story before creating the screenplay and movie.  Terrible acting, bad dialogue and very uncharismatic actors for the most part.  With some serious editing, especially the court scenes, the movie could be improved.  Needs to be much shorter, and maybe the surprise twist at the end could be elaborated on, as it is the most interesting part of the movie. Nice effort, but more time should have been spent collecting the resources to make a good movie, rather than rushing to put out a bad product.",1389571200,,551,4.778947368421052
