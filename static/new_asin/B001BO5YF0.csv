8412272,2,B001BO5YF0,"This DVD version has been nicely remastered for sound and image. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT THE COMPLETE VERSION OF THE ORIGINAL FILM. There are whole scenes missing. Amongst them, the song by Antonio Badu ""Fue Casualidad"" which affects the meaning of the ""Coplas de Retache"" scene. Other critical scenes involving dialogue are also missing. There are at least 18 minutes cut in this version of ""Ay, Jalisco no te rajes!"" Since there is such a substantial portion missing from the original version, I give it only two stars for effort in picture and sound, but cannot give full marks to a product that has been arbitrarily mutilated in order make room for commercials when it is broadcast on TV.",1361318400,4,687,4.781512605042017
8412273,5,B001BO5YF0,"A great movie of the Mexico of the 40's.  Jorge Negrete, the Latin American idol. at his best. The music, the story, are great.",1360108800,,127,4.291666666666667

Amongst them, the song by Antonio Badu; ""Fue Casualidad"" which affects the meaning of the ""Coplas de Retache"" scene. Other critical scenes involving dialogue are also missing. There are at least 18 minutes cut from this version of ""Ay, Jalisco no te rajes!"". It is a pity and deceptive marketing. Amazon should warn prospective buyers that they are not buying the original version of the movie, but a badly mutilated one.

I don't know if the VHS version advertised here is also abridged, as it is currently unavailable, but the original VHS versions marketed in the 90s were complete.",1359590400,,659,4.883928571428571
8412275,1,B001BO5YF0,"The DVD quality is good, it has been restored, the negative and sound are good. This movie is a magnificent ranchera movie, a period piece, a master-piece. But I have the movie in video, and I am very unhappy, because the movie has been cut, of many beautifull scenes, many of them with ""Chaflan"" (Carlos Lopez) and Angel Garasa (Mala Suerte), how much been delected, probably 20 minutes or more. The quality and good transfer to the DVD are real good. The many, many scenes deleted, made the DVD a dissapoiment. A real pity .",1297814400,5,526,4.5473684210526315
