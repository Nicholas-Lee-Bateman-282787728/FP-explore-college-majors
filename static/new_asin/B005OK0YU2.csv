4852424,5,B005OK0YU2,"This was a wonderful series.  Yes, it was violent and bloody and graphic, but its obviously for adults.  The story was interesting and had a nice little twist at the end. The characters were likable and even evoked some compassion while killing (go figure). The animation was good and I thought the voice acting was decent.  It was only 13 episodes, but it gives a nice sense of closure at the end so that it doesn't leave you wanting more, while at the same time leaving a little door for a follow-up series.  I would definitely recommend this series to serious anime fans !",1258156800,3,575,4.5

4852426,1,B005OK0YU2,"Yeah yeah yeah, I heard it all. The majority claims this tripe is good because alot of people like it. Well alot of people love driving drunk but it doesn't mean its good. And Elfen Peed is the definition of very bad anime. Cliche ridden and beyond stupid characters. Plus it simply don't know what it wants to be. is it comedy, is it horror who the hell knows? People claim the naysayers simply don't get it. But I read some of the discussions going on for months. And I think the fans are simply fooled by the smoke and mirrors, plus they have poor debating skills too. You guys are the ones who don't get it. If you dig this and consider it a masterpiece. Then you don't know what a masterpiece is. Millenium Actress, Samurai X, Nausicaa, Grave of the fireflies Now that's what I call some masterpiece there.",1257379200,11,811,4.377483443708609
4852427,3,B005OK0YU2,"Hey all.  I bought this edition recently, and was pretty disappointed with the packaging.  The outside box is sturdy enough, but the inside discs are all kept on one spindle, rather than in separate cases or separate disc holders.  While this isn't definitely going to mess the discs up, I believe it does increase the possibility of damage happening.  If this type of packaging bothers you, then I'd suggest going with one of the previous editions.",1250208000,22,449,4.868421052631579
4852428,4,B005OK0YU2,"My niece (age 13) and a lot of other random anime fans that I know, would go on and on about how they loved this particular anime, so I thought I would watch it to see what in the world they were talking about.

This series reminded me a lot of the Tenchi Muyo series where there just happens to be one boy that all these women seem to be gravitating to, although in this series there is just happens to be a bit more nudity and a lot more blood.

With that being said, I found the underlying story itself very endearing of how this outcast who was subjected to brutal teasing just for being different by her peers was pushed to the edge and when she finally found someone who didn't see her as ""different"" but ""cool"" she ended up destroying their friendship by her own jealous nature.

In short, this was an entertaining tale and worth watching, the ending though leaves you wanting more, which is really my only problem with the series. It just seems like it was unfinished.",1246147200,49,976,4.3224043715847
4852429,5,B005OK0YU2,"I brought this box set at Best Buy when they had a special buy one get one half off anime sale, so i got this and a Dragon Ball Z box set. EL ended up being fifteen bucks. I actually didn't even want this title, but I couldn't let this deal pass me by.

I saw episode one once on the anime network & don't recall anything except that the beginning contained an ultra violent scene with blood everywhere and I just didn't care enough to be interested. I've brought many anime titles in the past few months & non have the x-factor to keep interested or hooked in the way Sailor Moon does.

I couldn't sleep last night and all i wanted to do was watch some anime before i finally got tired enough to go back to sleep. So i decided to finally give this series a second chance. I unwrapped this set since it was gathering dust on my DVD shelf, popped it in and from the immediate opening song i felt i was in for a good show. I've noticed that most series that have awesome opening songs tend to be good shows. Elfen Lied was no exception. To my surprise, i was hooked from the first episode and was doing my best to cram in as many episodes as possible before 3AM.

This is a great series and is only thirteen episodes. I'll provide a quick recap since everyone has already gone into full details in their reviews. The story is about a girl named Nyu/Lucy who escapes from some facility where she was held captive & under lock down. She has extraordinary powers and in one last attempt to capture her, a shot was taken to her helmet which skewed her memory somehow and has created a temporary memory loss or dual personality. Nyu/Lucy wakes up on the beach the next day completely unaware of what happened the night before. She meets 2 people on her journey to finding out what's going on. The show does have a sheer amount of violence, but at the same time balances the comedy, and light hearted areas really well. It wasn't non-stop violence. There were actually many moments of intimate friendship.

Anyways, this is a great series and ranks up there with some of the best anime titles in film history. Buy it and you will enjoy it. The price tag is a bit over the top on AMZ but it does occasionally go on sale so pick it up. But for thirteen episodes, try not to get this item at full price. I'll be spending the day copying the DVD onto my iPod Touch, so i can enjoy this on the way to work. I'm in shock i enjoyed this so much because it is an addictive series and i really liked that this wasn't as dull as all the other titles I've been watching recently. This coming from a fan of Sailor Moon only who isn't into gore, violence, or guns.",1245369600,12,2643,4.217391304347826

4852432,5,B005OK0YU2,"Elfen Lied, a show that is undoubtedly unforgettable, emotional, sexy, and all of the above, is indeed a production that will startle your senses.

Elfen Lied was the first animated series coming from a country outside of the Americas which I had really taken to heart. The first couple episodes will shock you due to the excessive amount of violence, but I pushed myself out of curiosity, eager to await the next round of brilliant hysteria that was perpetuating my overwhelming interest. From the deep psychological discourse of material presented in the character interactions, along with the evocative and emotionally pungent soundtrack, Elfen Lied is geared to deliver an original and haunting extravaganza of sheer beauty to many.

In the end, Elfen Lied is a profound human experience that will indefinitely bring tears to your eyes by the final thirteenth episode, and ultimately stir your senses as it did mine.

4852443,5,B005OK0YU2,"I'm a big Anime fan!!  And, as a woman, there's usually not that many action Animes that appeal to me, but Elfen Lied was one that I really loved.  Seldom have I ever watched an Anime that made me cheer and cry at the same time for the main character like Lucy.  I've never seen another Anime that was so tragic and beautiful simultaneously.  This show is geared towards mature audiences as it is filled with nudity and bloodshed.  But, its all vital to the plot.  The story is about a race of genetically superior women and the governments attempt to enslave and use them as weapons which backfires severely.  But the real story is one of star crossed lovers Lucy and Kouta whose tragic past has shaped them both to be who they are today.  Some Anime fans I know don't care for the excessive violence of this show or the alter ego of Lucy known as Nyu. However I find it to be beautiful and poetic both the violence and the innocent almost childlike character of Nyu who is Lucy's only defense against her own inner demons.  I really love this show and highly recommend it and am looking forward to reading the Manga version of it.",1503619200,4,1132,4.37799043062201

4852454,1,B005OK0YU2,"On one hand, had it not been for certain elements I probably would have given this show a 3 or maybe even a 4. The idea is intriguing enough and the VAs (voice actors) on both the sub and dub did a wonderful job. Not to mention the opening theme song is beautiful. Heck, I'll even admit I like gore from time to time when it's done properly. Really the gore wasn't my main problem with this show - sure the gore was over the top and too grotesque, but nothing I couldn't handle.

What dragged this down to it's lowest of low rating is that nonsense pedophilic scenes. Showing nude underage characters wasn't even the worst of it, what really messed with my mind was when they showed a pre-rape scene of a young preteen-teenaged girl. There was absolutely no reason for these scenes other than to titillate as it added nothing to the story and ambiance other than making me utterly disgusted. I kept watching only to give a fair review and now I wish I hadn't. Those scenes combined with the animal cruelty made me feel like I was ill.

This is an anime I will never forget but not for the right reasons.

4852481,4,B005OK0YU2,"Many reviews should give many people a good idea of what Elfen Lied is about.
With that being said, I will keep my review short.

It is true: I would not recommend watching this series you can't handle some depressing situations and adult themes. So, keep young children away.

This is a really great series! It is not a waste of time or too ridiculous. I keep coming back to watch more. I viewed this series five times now and I still enjoy it.

(Spoiler Alert) I love animals; although, I'm not an animal activist or a member of some animal rights movement. BUT...I feel that there is one scene (in particular) that bring some people to an absolute heartbreak, anger, and/or emotional upset. I was deeply disturbed by this particular scene. Unfortunately, these types of actions happen all too often in real life. I'm just glad that this was animated. My heart would be torn if it was real life footage.

If you are faint of heart, can't handle blood, violence, nudity, or adult situations, stay away.

4852483,5,B005OK0YU2,"Brutal, almost to the point of unwatchability. I struggled to get through the first episode, which is relentlessly and graphically violent, but it was well worth it. The plot unfurls into a gripping story of rejection, loneliness, fear, hatred, and revenge; but also friendship, love, belonging, and sacrifice. I began the series viscerally disgusted by the female protagonist, who is a literal and figurative monster, only to end it feeling deeply sorry for her.

I originally watched this years ago on VCDs (!) and the dub was absolutely horrible. It was only watchable using the subtitles. ADV apparently has redone the dub, and while it's not the best English voice acting, it's been mightily improved. The artwork and the animation are choppy. The earlier episodes are the best, but there is a noticeable drop off in the animation as the season progresses.

The story is engaging in a distressing way, The main protagonist is not one to like, and it's certainly hard to feel sympathy or empathy for her. But I did get hooked again on wanting to find out what was going to become of her, and the rest of the band of misfits she falls in with, To me, that takes some decent writing.

I cried when I watched it; it was without doubt the most touching and heartwrenching thing I've seen on television of any type. Fueling this sentiment is a combination of its aspects. For one thing, it gives us one of the most hopeless worlds for humans ever conceived; and it shows us that world through the eyes of a girl all at once small, naive and sad, and at the same time capable of unspeakably heartless killing. The juxtaposition of these elements had a great effect in making me feel the hopelessness. But it's not just her-- there are no human characters anywhere in this series who are without blame or innocent; it's impossible to find anyone to pull for; to hope for them they'll win out. Not one. There's only a single character with a shred of morals in this thing, and he is a teenage mental patient. I can't recommend this for children; it's really an R-Rated cartoon.

Well drawn, main character has an invisible, intriguing power capable of twisting steel like play-doh.  She escapes a high tech prison chamber of some kind, furthering the viewer's interest, takes a stroll through various security gates (more interest and questions), armed guards are trying to kill her (why?!), she tears them apart with something we can't see (eyeball tingling attention grabber) and leaves that one guy alive (suspense--why?!), winds up in the ocean and washes up on a beach (still alive thank goodness because the viewer's eyes are salivating for more) and theeeeeeennnnnn.... our super powerfully amazing non-speaking (so far) main character's invisible power disappears (why?) and she turns into a damn babbling child-like rendition of a retarded monkey.  Seriously?  All that amazing artistry, her interesting way of squatting, holding her knees with her head down while tearing apart that guard had me wondering who-what-why-when-where, her invisible power, her choice to kill the innocent girl and not that guy and then this babbling idiot takes her place?!!!!  Ruined the whole damn thing in my opinion, though I watched the rest as the original main character occasionally appears for a few moments here and there, baaaarrrreeely keeping my attention.

4852536,5,B005OK0YU2,"I saw the trailer for Elfen Lied many years ago but did not watch it until just now.  Most of the clips from the trailer were from the first episode of Lucy escaping.  Watching the series, there is a lot more to it.

  So there exist mutant creatures called Diclonii, a mutant creature that looks like humans but with horns on their heads and invisible arms.  The arms are called vectors and  they can use them to move objects, make themselves jump far distances and cut people in half or even decapitate them.  I have not read the manga but the diclonii are mostly female with four vectors.

  The government locks up the diclonii and do experiments on them.  It's never specified what experiments.  You only see the girls tied up naked and bleeding.  All babies that are born diclonii are killed and the medical reports label it as sudden infant death syndrome due to genetic abnormality.  If female diclonii touch a male with their vectors the male is infected with the ""vector virus"" and his sperm will create only diclonii.  Thus, the government is trying to stop the spread of this new species.

  The story opens with Lucy escaping from the research facility, located on an island.  She brutally cuts the guards in two, stops bullets with her vectors and breaks out.  As she is leaving, she is shot in the head.  This releases her metal mask and allows her to get away.  She is found by two college kids on the mainland naked.  She is now in a different personality, Nyu.  Nyu appears to be mentally challenged as she is completely defenseless while Lucy is deadly.  She also at first is only able to speak her name.  She says this over and over similar to Hodor from Game of Thrones.  It's very disturbing that while naked with big boobs, she likes to hug and tickle people.

  After the escape the scientific research center release another diclonii to capture Lucy.  This is Nana.  She is more optimistic than Lucy.  When she fights Lucy, her arms and legs are cut off.  Upon returning to the facility, the director who Nana has mistakenly thought is her father, helps her escape so she may have a life.  He gives her prosthetic arms and legs.  She leaves and doesn't know how to use money so she burns it to keep warm.  A runaway girl the two college kids took in brings her to their house.  Eventually, the house with Kohta, his cousin Yuka, Nyu (Lucy), Maya- a runaway that was sexually abused by her stepfather, and Nana.  They form a happy family, which I think is the heart of this show.

  The research facility releases another diclonii, the most deadly.  This one has 24 vectors and a reach of 11 meters.  Lucy has a reach of 2 meters and 4 vectors, and Nana has a reach of 4 meters and 4 vectors, but two of her vectors help her with her prosthetic arms and legs.  While Lucy kills but doesn't want to and Nana is very hesitant to kill, Mariko is genuinely evil and enjoys it.  It delights her to play with people and Nana with her arms, slamming them to the ground and killing them.  She is the daughter of Kurama, head of the reserachers at the research facility.  He vowed to her wife he would not kill her when she was born with horns.  During the fight with Lucy, he admits he is Mariko's father.  He takes her away and blows up from the bomb they inserted in Mariko should sh become uncontrolable.

  It is revealed that Lucy grew up in a foster home and was bullied because of her horns.  She found a dog that she took care of only to have the boys beat the dog to death.  She lost control and killed them.  She was on the run invading houses, killing their occupants and leaving days later.  This continued until she met and formed a friendship with Kohta.  She fell in love with him and he said he was going to a fair with a cousin.  When asked he said it was a male cousin.  She saw it was Yuka, his female cousin who is in love with him.  Later when he is leaving Lucy murders Kohta's little sister and father.  He spends years in the hospital and represses the memory.

  At the end, Kohta, Yuka, Mayu, and Nana are sitting down to eat when there is a knock on the door.  It is never revealed who it is.  This is a ""choose your own ending"" situation.  I choose to believe Lucy came back to live with them.

  There are many story lines that are not resolved in the series.  After the death of Kurama, the head of the reserachers at the research facility, Director Kakuzawa, the director of the research facility takes over.  it is revealed that he and his son are dicloniis.  The son set in motion the means so that Lucy could escape so that he and Lucy could mate and create new race on earth.  At the end, Director Kakuzawa is still in power.  He also wants to know who was the first diclonii to spread the virus allowing so many births of more.  The only thing I can think is that Director Kakuzawa created and began spreading the virus to become powerful as the first of a new race.

  Despite all this, I think this is a good series that seems to focus on overcoming a bad childhood.  Every character, except Yuka, have bad things happen to them.  Lucy was bullied and forced to murder after her bullies killed her dog.  Kohta had his sister and father killed in front of him.  Mayu was sexually molested by her step dad with her moms knowledge and forced to live on the streets for a while.  Nana was tortured in the research facility and was always trying to get Kurama's approval.  So I think this show's message is that you can be happy and overcome bad situations and even forgive yourself.",1444608000,,5532,4.360236220472441

The sub-plot lines are as intense as the main story (they are as fully developed and could stand on their own). The music takes on a life of its own, with the beautiful and disturbing ""Kyrie"" as lead in. Tears, wringing of hands, betrayal, infanticide, love at the deepest level all are involved (and that's in the first episode).

 I watched this three times (front to back) in the first two days. I have not watched anything as gripping in a long time (either live action or anime). The story-line apocalyptic, pertinent, and present in how we treat ""the other"" (see the present-day crisis in Europe from ""the Migrants"").

Elfen Lied goes so deep with pain and heartache, and almost a feeling of despair. There is a lot of action, but also a lot of story too. You get plenty of meaning and backstory too on the main characters. I don't know why I like anime's like this but they always seem to draw me in. You can relate to the feelings of the characters and you hope that in the end the best happens for them! I have noticed there are a lot more animes that is like Elfen Lied. Elfen Lied on Blu-ray doesn't look that great in my opinion. It doesn't seem like its been upgraded at all, maybe just a little bit, but nothing spectacular!

I originally watched the English dub, so I was stoked to be able to watch it again after so many years. Sadly, the English dub is not anywhere near bluray quality. The character voices, sounds effects, and even the OP and ED,  seem almost muzzled. The Japanese dub is perfect it every way, however.

I highly recommend this, even if it is just to say you've seen it. Sadly, this ends on a type of cliffhanger, and the anime strayed too far from the manga (and this anime covers roughly the first half), but if you want to see the story continue, read the manga.

Part of the reason this anime is a bit shocking is that I went into it knowing nothing about it. so, I won't go into the plot because I think that kind of ruins it. I will say that for people that are into the more serious and dark animes this is one that should make the list. It's not a must-see in my opinion but it's not a waste of time.

Three stars only because, well, those silly bits just annoyed me. As i said, i know they serve a purpose but I wish there would have been a way to go about this story without them.",1422576000,,815,3.760233918128655

There is quite a lot of nudity in almost every episode, topless mainly.  Mind you I am 35 years old and I have been watching anime practically since Akira made it over here so I am used to there being some nudity and sexually suggestive content in some anime movie's or series.  But I just wasn't expecting it in almost every episode lol and there is actually a scene, that while it does not show anything definitely is highly suggestive of incest or molestation, again nothing is shown but it is very suggestive.

Much of the story is often told through flashbacks, so it can be hard to follow.  The plot has some twists and turns and it is a good story, so it was worth the time invested.",1416096000,,348,3.7777777777777777
4852643,5,B005OK0YU2,"Well, I never thought the day would come where there would be a US release of this anime. This is one of my favorites, but I won't get into the story or try and upsell it. If you're hear to buy it, you already know how great of a show it is. You don't need yet another review praising this anime's subtle caveats. I might as well admit now that I am one of those suckers who created an amazon.co.jp account and ordered this Japan release blu ray for $300 upon release. It's considerably less now and the US release is amazingly cheaper. So I feel like a fool. Yet, I had to buy this because the Japanese releases unfortunately do not contain English subtitles (even though its not that hard to do). So this US release has pretty decent english subs. Not like a fan-subbed release, but still. Considering the low profile of this series, I still can't believe they released it in blu ray and that its not a Funimation release.

So I'll compare it to my Japan release:

(***as of 11/14/14, there is a cheaper version of Elfen Lied being sold in Japan. It is marked as ""blu ray import"" and is $51. This looks identical to the US release. Don't quote me but I think its exported (from the US) to Japan and is not what I am comparing it to. The boxset I am referring to on the amazon.co.jp site is now at $120 and was released in 2012. This is the original/first release.)

Physical Attributes
The Japan Boxset had a lot of artwork made just for the box. A small pamphlet with some excerpt pages from the OVA. A soundtrack cd as well. The boxset also contained 4 blu ray discs. Of course, nothing was written in english. But the box set was decent and pretty (not worth $300 though). The artwork on the discs are different than the ones in the US release. If I remember correctly it was a pic of one of the three girls on the cover with that brown symbol backdrop. Nothing really drastically eye popping.

The US release is a nice flimsy blu ray case. Has only two blu ray discs. Contains all the episodes and the OVA between the two discs. There is no extra artwork, no fluff. But to be honest, I can't complain for <$30.

A / V
The Japan release had some very good visual work done to it. Compared with this recent release I would still say the difference is too negligible to tell. I feel that the Japan 2012 release is a 9 (visually) and the 2014 US release is a close 8.5. Not too sure if from the same or different source (don't know too much about licensing companies and how they acquire/put content on new media formats). Haven't read the forums or message boards to know the exact details. I will say however, that over 8 years later since its dvd release, it looks amazing on blu ray. Yes, it doesn't look like Attack on Titan and other very recent blu ray shows, but it is very well done and they gave it more attention than I thought would be given to such an old and low profile series. Very impressed.

The audio is different. In the Japanese version we get Japanese 5.1 DTS-HD and Linear PCM. In the US version you get 5.1 DTS-HD English and Japanese (according to the back of the blu ray cover). For some reason, I'm reading it at 6.1. But maybe thats an error on my software end. This collection is well worth the money and is a worthy adversary to the Japan release.",1415923200,,3279,4.280645161290322
4852644,5,B005OK0YU2,"What can I say about this anime that hasn't been said? First, the opening of this was a lovely surprise. Given the violent nature I knew was waiting (cue rough techno theme) I wasn't expecting something so beautiful. In the art nouveau style of Gustav Klimt and a gorgeous melody - in Latin! Oddly, it does fit the nature of the message this anime seemed to project almost from the start. A song of peace and forgiveness, really more like a prayer - an invocation - given the past of Lucy. While it still is not a recommendation for the faint of heart, if you look beyond the surface,  this anime is really one of the best I've ever seen.

Basically, this girl washes up on a beach with a head injury and is incapable of saying anything but 'nyu'. The 2 cousins who find her have no idea who she is, what she has done, or the bloody tie she has to their past. What follows is a complex, ultra-violent, and emotion twisting story that spans 13 episodes and an OVA. At times the series is too emotionally manipulating (an incredibly violent, pitiful maiming followed by an attempt at humor), but that's what it was supposed to be. The scenery is wonderfully drawn, which I can't say about a few of the characters. The voice acting isn't great, even the original Japanese actors.

4852684,5,B005OK0YU2,"I first saw this show as a young teenager almost ten years ago. I have owned a DVD copy of this for a while, and for me to repurchase an item - even if it is an upgrade - is pretty rare.

I won't go into much detail about the show, but for a BD purchase of an anime of this caliber, the packaging is skimpy (no inlets or inserts) and the menu is haphazardly put together with no sound or functional design. I'm very disappointed in that because I like to keep movies on the menu for a while before I am ready to watch the show.

Other than that, this is perfect, and a great buy considering the Japanese import BD box set can run ya upwards of a hundred bones. The animation is okay, I won't say it's outstanding, but the overall work is [outstanding]. Depending on your taste for stories, this one will become a love or hate title. The story leaves a little something to be desired, but nothing is perfect. The way the story was told, however, was very unique and touching. The music is incredible, and very distinct. The tune of this anime will haunt you forever, and it adds that much more emotion to the show.

This is a standalone completed series with one OVA. It is somewhat dark, with little to no comical relief. Very gory at times, with a little sadism and malicious intent, not for those under 13 at least. Somewhat sci-fi, somewhat supernatural (not really but this isn't about normal humans so hey). The BD is really just an upscale of the original, but it's blu ray and it's got nicer subs than my DVD version, though still a bit mistranslated like most animes. The artwork is ridiculously colorful now, and some of the designs from the intro and such almost become optical illusions. It just seems to me that someone just boosted saturation and contrast and called it blu ray, but it's still nicer than the SD version.

You might like if you enjoyed: Tasogare Otome x Amnesia, RIN daughters of mnemosyne, C3, Blood+, etc etc. If you enjoy art, and aren't afraid of controversial subjects, then get this anime. It is a staple for this world, and a must for your collection.

4852687,5,B005OK0YU2,"This is hands down my favorite anime of all time and the blu ray really does it justice! Everything is beautiful and there is some special features for a change. Also this set has the long lost OVA that we never got in the states even after 3 or 4 DVD releases. The OVA is dubbed, which is totally surprising. Kouta and Bando have new voice actors ONLY in the OVA, but other than that I believe the cast is the same. Actually Lucy/Nyu is different too, but it isn't very noticeably because Lucy is only shown as a teenager and Nyu only says NYU! Anyways about the actual show I can see how it wouldn't appeal to everyone, but it has a incredibly powerful storyline that is engaging! That said it is extremely violent. Adults, kids even animals, no one is safe. If that disturbs you child rape probably would too so be warned, this show has both. Regarding the nudity, there is a lot of it, but it is not sexualized fanservice typical of most anime. The characters are naked usually because they are forced to be. Although their is some very dark subject matter, probably more than any anime I've ever seen by a longshot, the show also manages to throw in some good laughs and a few action scenes to make you not completely emotion drunk. Overall it paces its comedy and drama very well with some action tastes in between to keep your hunger sated the whole time.

4852690,2,B005OK0YU2,"Product, format, timeliness, and shipping were excellent - as always, Amazon is awesome.

The bad news then the good:

Though I am only halfway through the series, the plot content is awful.  The two main characters, Kohta and Lucy, are a liar to the public authorities which are trying to help and a homicidal maniac, respectively.  The other characters, save a few, have similar problems.  The characters moan and gasp when they could be filling character development.  The slight sexual references are much more tolerable than the sloppy logic.  There is almost too much of a misogynist ""wife beater"" mentality throughout.  Almost all of the characters are either passive agressive, or have split personalities, which they use as justification behind their amoral actions.

On the upside, the musical score is great, the animation is reminiscent of a mid-1990s anime classic style, and the characters are engaging once you get over it's a cartoon and learn to laugh.  Of course, the final production is a well orchestrated anime, despite the content.  I would suggest watching  Elfen Lied with a lighthearted friend + commentator.",1386806400,,1133,5.164835164835165

4852694,5,B005OK0YU2,"I've watched Elfen Lied 4 times now.  The first time, solo, and was convinced it was a master work.  The second time, I was trying to reccommend it to a group of friends, and we sat down to 'just watch one episode'...and ended up running through the entire show, up until 3 am, gibbering about it.  The third time, I got another friend and even my girlfriend to sit down and give it just a little try, and they were also sucked in, and five hours later, chattering away about how great it was.

The fourth time, was for the blu-ray.  And it was glorious to re-live the whole tale in such brilliant quality.

If you seek an exciting, dramatic and bloody anime, this is clearly one of the best ones to start with.  While Elfen Lied shifts gears from hardcore violence to poignant, moving vignettes, from Tenchi-like harem moments, to slapstick comedic interactions, it's heart and soul is that of a dark drama.  Underneath the bubbly, poppy surface of the bright colors and smiles, lies Lucy, waiting to be unleashed at a moment's notice.  The anime shows that humans are often just as monstrous as the monsters that we seek to exterminate.
Excellent quality and production design.  The voice acting is completely acceptable, and the music is uneblievably top-notch.  You will not quickly forget the haunting main theme of the show.
What's especially nice is how the show is able to eventually provide explanations for everything, all at once, and have an exciting, massive conclusion that gives about 99% resolution that leaves you feeling...good....melancholy...sad...and thankful for it. You won't really care about the unxeplained 1% when the final frame hits the screen, and the final note plays on the music box.

Call it a must-watch, because it is.  Never totally degarding into fan service, sillyness, or becoming a complete and utter bloodbath, Elfen Lied skirts all of these, takes the best portions of each for dramatic effect, and ends up as a compelling piece, with believeably motivated characters and a great storyline.",1385337600,21,2033,4.892128279883382

4852698,3,B005OK0YU2,"Elfen Lied is a 13 episode anime series based off the seinen manga of the same name by Lynn Okamoto (who's a guy by the way, despite the first name). It deals with various dark and tragic themes such as Love, Hatred, Regret, Innocence, Forgiveness, and the duality of human nature. It follows the main protagonist, Lucy, who is the ""queen"" of a mutant offshoot of humanity known as Diclonius, who are only distinguishable from ordinary humans by two cat-ear like horns on their head and invisible arms known as ""vectors"" which have the ability to slice through objects at lightning fast speed, and yes that includes human flesh. These vectors also have the ability to infect ordinary humans with the Diclonius virus, so that their children are born as Diclonius instead of ordinary humans. It deals with the interactions between these two races and the prejudice and animosity that exists between them due mostly to the fact that Diclonius have ""horns"" and human do not. It seems rather silly on the surface, but as you delve deeper into the prejudice that results from such small differences, such as skin tone, it makes far more sense. All in all, Elfen Lied is a mixed bag, on the one hand the animation, sound quality, and music is all very detailed and beautiful most of the time, really giving the series a very deep and hauntingly beautiful feel to it. The blend of dark and light elements is also quite good, as the series jumps between scenes of dark horror, sadness, and tragedy, to scenes of wacky comedy hi-jinks and ultra moe cuteness, mostly revolving around the split personality of Lucy, the innocent, childlike Nyu. It all blends quite nicely. However, there are also many negatives to this series, most notably the endless slew of blood, gore, and nudity, which all feels incredibly forced and unnecessary. In addition to this, the cruelty and malice of many characters, both human and diclonius, feels incredibly forced and unnatural, most notably a certain scene involving a lost dog and it's owner.

In addition to this, the voice acting in the English version is decent at best, some characters, most notably Bando, Lucy, Nana, and Yuka are pretty good, but others like Kouta, Kurama, Mayu, and Kanae definitely could have been better. Last but not least, the entire anime series length, as well as the ending, could have been much better. In order to finish the series you have to read the manga which the anime is based off of, and it is quite clear by the ambiguous ending of the anime that it wasn't the same ending of the manga. There are still many mysteries untold and unexplained by the end of the anime series, and because of this, perhaps above all else, that ruined the overall score of the series for me. Elfen Lied had the potential to be great, but it only turned out good in the end. Quite a shame really.

Now, as for the plot and characters themselves, the basic plot focuses on two teenage college students, Kouta and Yuka finding a naked horned girl on the beach after said naked girl brutally murders and decapitates hordes of armed soldiers in the first scene of the first episode, she is now far more innocent and harmless and can only say Nyu, so they take her home (without bothering to contact the police), and name her Nyu. However, her murderous, sadistic personality is not gone, and it emerges time and time again over the course of the series during the repeated attempts by the staff and scientists of the facility that contained her, to first capture and then kill her. Meanwhile, Kouta as well as Lucy, seem to share a strange mysterious bond that is left supposedly unknown until the last episodes of the series, but any well educated viewer will guess the ""bond"" they share, long before the big reveal occurs. It is these elements as well as numerous flashbacks that add a very psychological element to this series that is quite mysterious and frightening, definitely one of the strong elements. Overall, I would only recommend watching this anime if you have a hardened exterior and can easily digest such a dark, depressing, and tragic series.",1383868800,,4102,4.735664335664335

4852711,1,B005OK0YU2,"As we get older, we should mature mentally and attain more knowledge. It's been about four years since I made any serious revisions to my review of the worst thing ever stamped on to film, Elfen Lied, and even a review with this much airtight logic needs some tweaking.

I first saw Elfen Lied back in May of 2008, after a bunch of its fans swindled me into buying it by telling me that this anime was one full of gore and nudity yet also had a brilliant story with a strong message about the human condition. I was so disgusted and enraged by what I saw, I nearly gave up on the entire anime genre. Thankfully, some hope was restored after opening my mind up more to anime put out by the likes of Studio Ghibli and Satoshi Kon (RIP), though I'm honestly not too optimistic of anime today, but that's a different topic altogether.

STORY

The plot is that there's a mutated race of humans called the Diclonious, which are mostly girls that have horns that look like cat ears and invisible arms called vectors that can tear apart anything. Their goal is to wipe out humanity, many of them are studied in a research facility in Japan. One of them named Lucy breaks out of her cell and begins killing people left and right. A sniper nearly kills her but only winds up shattering her helmet and causing her to plummet hundreds of feet into the sea. Kouta and Yuka find her naked on the beach and decide to take her home. The research facility wants her back and sends assassins, the army, and other Diclonious to get her back or kill her.

CHARACTERS

Elfen Lied is an anime meant for adult viewers that not only wants to be taken very seriously, but also wants to be seen as one of the deepest and smartest anime titles out there. However, in order to be taken seriously by an intelligent adult audience, you have to flesh out a story and characters that are believable in a real world context. Elfen Lied drops the ball bigtime because all the characters in this anime are some of the most contrived and absurd for an anime that's supposed to be serious, deep, and intelligent.

The best example of this is that the main characters, Kohta and Yuka, are walking around the beach one day and find a stupid, naked girl bumbling around, and take her home without telling anyone about it. You think they would at least take them to the police department or a public shelter, but no, because logic is apparently scorned heavily by this anime. Other examples are with Kohta and Mayu. Mayu for the fact that she's way too upbeat for someone who's been molested by her stepdad and had to live off scraps thrown away by a benevolent baker. Kohta has some of the worst character development because aside from being the clich mousy male that's been done-to-death in harem comedy anime, he doesn't show a single shred of resentment towards Lucy after he finds out she killed his dad and little sister when he was a kid. I wasn't expecting him to go ""Rambo"" on Lucy, but you think he would at least give her a back-handed slap and scream at her.

Lucy is quite possibly the most abhorrent character in the entire anime genre (possibly in the entire world of animation as well). She has the extremely clich split personality in the forms of Lucy and Nyu. Lucy is nothing more than a naked meatgrinder with a melodramatic backstory you'd read in the lyrics of your typical nu-metal song and an extremely uncreative split personality.

We're supposed to see Nana as some sort of tragic figure since she's constantly getting torn up and pummeled but I think it's just her fault since she's so unbelievably passive.

It also doesn't help that so many of the female characters feel extremely clich as they perfectly fit the mold of those you'd see in a stupid harem anime like Tenchi Muyo.

CARELESS GENRE MIXING

It's like the monkeys operating Microsoft Word couldn't decide to write a serious anime loaded with gore and nudity or a silly one with plenty of erotic humor and dumb faces, so they made the most detestable decision and made an anime that had both in great quantities. The truth of the matter is that the extremely serious and extremely silly types of anime have totally different audiences and are just too different from each other to exist in the same anime. I honestly hate the overly silly anime replete with diabetes-inducing cuteness, and that's the last thing I want to see in an anime that's advertised as something full of gory and lightly erotic grindhouse content. It also doesn't help that Elfen Lied's attempts to be funny are some of the most cringe-inducing in the entire anime genre. Oh look, Yuka is berating her loser male cousin and Nyu is grabbing Yuka's mammary glands, how hilarious!!

In my last serious revision of this review, I originally described the grindhouse content in Elfen Lied as ""pornographic,"" and I take this back because that's insulting to even the worst pornography out there.

PLOT-HOLES, CONTRADICTING THEMES, BAD ENDING, AND BAD CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT

Right from the beginning, Elfen Lied is asking you to leave your brain at the door prior to watching it. Lucy escapes the research facility as is knocked unconscious by a sniper's bullet striking her helmet and forcing her to fall into the ocean. Aside from not dying on impact from the water (she fell hundreds of feet), how does she not break any bones and not drown? She's unconscious, she can't swim, so how does she survive being in the water?

There's a smorgasbord of other things in this anime that don't make a lick of sense within its own context. It turns out that light caliber firearms are ineffective against Diclonius beings, though grenade launchers and .50 caliber firearms can kill them, so why are the security staff at the research laboratory armed with guns that can't do squat to them? It's also shown that Kohta moved in to the house to where he's at in this series to go to college, yet he's only shown in class ONCE in the whole series. Even worse, given that Kohta and Yuka don't want Lucy/Nyu to be discovered, they take her to class, even though she acts like a complete idiot (and does so in class in a desperate attempt to provide even more terminally-unfunny comedy to the table).

Apparently, EL's theme is that humanity is monstrous to beings it sees as ""inhuman,"" which is supposed to explain the scientists torturing and killing the Dicloniuses. I wouldn't have a problem with that if the message didn't contradict itself. The Dicloniuses kill people on instinct and the head of the company doing these experiments, who turns out to be a Diclonius, WANTS them to kill of humanity. Also, the fact that this guy is a Diclonius doesn't make sense since he's in charge of this company and therefore in charge of the torturing and killing of his own species. If I cared about anyone in EL (I don't), I'd want to see the Diclonius race get exterminated because the writers screwed up their ""message"" that badly.

EL leaves a lot of things unexplained since it not only reveals that the company head is a Diclonius towards the end, nothing is fleshed out about that afterwards. It also has the worst ending I've ever seen in film since NOTHING is explained. I don't mind ""spoiling"" it for those who haven't seen this abomination since it leaves you thinking that Lucy MIGHT have been killed (of course, they take the pretentious route by not showing it to leave you guessing) but Kohta comes to open the front gate of his house with a shadow on it and once he reaches for the handle, it ends. WORST ENDING EVER.

Many fans have tried to defend the painfully incomplete ending by saying you have to read the manga source material to get the whole story. This is the worst defense of bad writing of all time, because that would be like watching Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of The Shining, having it suddenly end, and finding out you had to read Stephen King's novel of the same name to get the whole story. The purpose of an adaptation is for a creative mind to not only create their own interpretation of an existing piece of fiction, but also for it to be able to stand out on its own. The fact that you have to read the Elfen Lied manga to understand what should have been fleshed out in the anime adaptation renders the anime adaptation totally worthless.

We're introduced to Lucy as seeing her as a beast, but they later change her a little to make her sympathetic to audiences. Apparently, seeing Lucy as Nyu is supposed to make me like her, they failed miserably. All Nyu does is shamble around naked and say ""Nyu"" as she breaks things, this is supposed to make me overlook her insatiable blood thirst? It's like they can't decide if they want me to see Lucy as a monster or an infantile bimbo; either way, she's an abhorrent character. There's a lot of ""deus ex machina"" moments that really kill off any plausibility this might have had like when Bando and his comrade corner Nyu and RIGHT before they kill her, she turns to Lucy and attacks. This is some of the worst writing in animation, period.

SENTIMENTAL GARBAGE

There's plenty of sentimental gunk that would fit right at home with a Lifetime or Hallmark movie. One that immediately sticks out at me is that pukey scene with Mayu's birthday, the baker who gives her unwanted scraps made her a very small birthday cake, and I guess Kohta and Yuka get it before Mayu does, and they throw her a birthday party. I think that scene had Mayu crying and whatnot, and I was groaning at how sappy this was. I thought that scene in Fist of the North Star where one of the female characters finds a flower and cries over ""how beautiful it is"" was bad, but this was way worse.

Another is towards the end, where Lucy apologizes to Kohta for what she did to him and goes on about how he was the only one who was nice to him. Again, this feels like something right out of a Lifetime movie, except I would feel less cheated in the case of a Lifetime movie because I would know what I was getting into.

APPEARANCE

I hate the way everything looks in Elfen Lied, especially the character designs. Since EL is extremely violent and pornographic, the fact that the characters look like they were plucked right out of Love Hina or Chobits (they have a ""cute"" look) will make any rational person grasp their skulls with both hands and groan continuously out of anger. In and of themselves, the overbearing saccharine appearance of those girls with their freakishly big eyes makes me want to vomit my guts out. Mixing ""cute"" with gratuitous violence and nudity is like using 20 year-old motor oil as a condiment for the Classic Italian sandwich at Quiznos. It's certainly different, but it's the polar opposite of good.

The animation and artwork certainly had a lot of effort put behind it, but for an anime that's supposed to be gritty and harsh, the extremely clean imagery totally works against it. I detest the Diclonius designs since they're basically the stereotypical catgirls, despite the fact that this anime's fans will go out of their way to tell you that those are horns on their heads, when it's all too clear they're meant to cater to those who gush over catgirls.

VIOLENCE, NUDITY, AND INCEST

None of the above things offend me whatsoever since I'm not a stranger to either. However, these things look like they were shoved in EL to attract fickle anime fans (which it unfortunately has) and to offend anyone who is a ""prude.""

This anime has a ton of bloodshed, limbs getting torn off, female nudity, and even some moments of ""cousin lovin'"" between Kohta and Yuka. The first episode really overdoes the bloodshed to the point that it becomes rather boring after the episode is over. To top it off, there's a scene of Nana and Mayu taking a bath together (who are both underage), and while many fans will try to defend this by saying that it's supposed to show the innocence of the two characters and in Nana's case, shows a contrast to how she was treated in the laboratory. These defenses are totally wrong because so many of the nude scenes in this anime are meant to be exploitative in nature, and the ""tasteful nudity"" scenes just feel like they're adding more exploitative scenes just for the sake of it.

These also aren't really that offensive taken by themselves since they're used so numerously that they no longer have any provocative value to them after about 20 minutes of exposure. For those of you who are claiming that the constant use of these three things is somehow ""extreme,"" go watch Doomed Megalopolis for an excellent horror anime that utilized violence, nudity, and incest to make the overall experience unnerving rather than tedious.

SOUNDTRACK

It's time to focus on the most overrated anime song ever, ""Lilium."" Everyone thinks this is such a strong and emotional song, but it's a joke. It's nothing more than extremely boring symphonic music with female vocals and Latin lyrics to make Elfen Lied look ""deep"" and ""artistic."" Take a look at Kenji Kawai's dark ambient tracks found on the first Ghost in the Shell soundtrack or Joe Hisashi's music for Grave of the Fireflies for truly chilling and emotional anime music. Also, this type of music fits NOWHERE in this Love Hina-style dramedy disguised as Hostel. Not only does ""Lilium"" have such a non-existent effect on me, these monkeys with Microsoft Word thought it would be great to put a freakin' J-pop song at the end of each episode, which further nullifies any provocative effect the over abundant violence and nudity might have had in this POS. Also, ""Lilium"" is played ad nauseam throughout the episodes of this anime, wearing out any artistic credibility it might have had really fast.

SYMBOLISM

When symbolism is incorporated into a movie or series properly, it enhances the viewing experience. With EL, however, the symbolism is carelessly thrown in to make it look ""deep"" and ""intellectual."" For one, the clock symbol in EL didn't do anything to make this any better. ""Oh look, the broken clock represents Kohta's broken past and at the end it's fixed, and so is he!! How genius!!"" Give me a break.

I guess there was also supposed to be a symbolic link between Lucy and that stupid music box, as I think there was supposed to be a moment after that moment in the last episode where we thought that homicidal moppet was killed and the music box stopped working, but again, it's more lazy use of symbolism to cover up deplorable story and character development.

While not really symbolism, I find the use of German names in the series's name and of the names of the episodes to be loathsomely pretentious, and I don't care that this anime is named after a German poem.

This probably isn't symbolism, either, but as a pretty big fan of Batman, I was extremely disgusted by the fact that the animators decided to have Kohta wear a Batman shirt in some parts of this deplorable series.

ABUSE OF GUSTAV KLIMT'S ARTWORK

The use of Gustav Klimt's paintings on the opening credits is more examples of self-awarding pretentiousness since Klimt's artwork is splendid and when saccharine-looking anime girls are thrown into his paintings, it's a severe clash in artistic styles and looks just plain silly. If Klimt was alive to see this happen, he'd be highly revolted by this bastardization. This cheap move is just one of the many, many fronts used to cover up the ultimate lack of good story and character development. You know, the qualities that really matter when making any sort of show or movie.

Contrary to what the Elfen Lied fans convince themselves and others to think, referencing 20th century painters isn't enough to make anything good. You need those basic principles I mentioned above because those are universal in making any movie or TV show worthwhile. Without those, you can reference Gustav Klimt and old German poems all you want and it won't change the fact that the final product is a detestable cocktail of various toxic slop. This is like trying to make a giant pile of elephant excrement appetizing by covering it with butter cream frosting, sprinkles, and candles then selling it to an unsuspecting customer as a birthday cake. Smart people would immediately realize what they're really eating is sheer filth, but so many anime fans fool themselves into believing what they're eating is really cake in this case.

FINAL WORD

It's like the people who created Elfen Lied wanted to have their cake and eat it, too. Contrary to what the Elfen Lied fanbase would say, Lynn Okamoto (original author of Elfen Lied) and Mamoru Kanbe (creator of the anime adaptation) aren't people who work to provide artistic merit in their entertainment, they feel more like soulless salespeople who are out to line their pockets by creating cheap entertainment disguised as high art loaded with all the worst anime and manga cliches out there. The more scathing criticism these swindlers get, the better.

I think it's amazing that Hey Arnold, a cartoon mainly geared for children (though it's a really good show appealing to kids and adults), had two episodes dealing with the human condition called ""Pigeon Man"" and ""Helga on the Couch,"" and despite being labeled ""kids' entertainment,"" did a far, far superior job of executing its messages than an anime made for adults. Those Hey Arnold episodes had plenty of subtlety (though the show itself is rather subtle as well), whereas Elfen Lied had less subtlety than a Union Pacific locomotive hauling flammable liquids in a head-on collision with a Barnum & Bailey circus train.

If you're looking for a dark and gritty piece of media dealing with just how awful the human condition can be, read Punisher MAX Vol. 5: The Slavers. That comic is replete with down-to-earth realism in its story and charaacter development that makes it such a masterpiece in graphic novels geared for adults.

If you want anime titles that are much superior, seek out these titles instead.

4852713,5,B005OK0YU2,"Elfen Lied is one of the best anime series that you could possibly turn to for a glimpse into the darkest parts of artistry. While most would label things like gore and nudity as juvenile, Elfen Lied is typically very mature about how it handles these matters, and while in many cases these are things that would turn you away from the series, this series makes it so that it keeps you gripped to your screen as it celebrates some of the most vicious parts of imagination.

In other series renowned for their extreme violence such as Corpse Party, the brutality of it all becomes too dampened as it hyper-saturates you with mangled bodies. Elfen Lied however, while still glorifying the savagery of extreme violence, feels as though it is derived from the plot rather than the driving force of it. All of those darker elements are wisely placed to give the anime pacing, and every death weighs heavily in your mind as the ferocity of the characters comes to the forefront. There is also a lot of nudity, Lucy arguably spends more time naked than with clothes on. However, it's never especially titillating; I never felt as though the anime was trying to flash me fan service for the sake of having naked girls.

I can't talk too much about the plot without giving away massive spoilers, but it is especially interesting, even more so if you are very into darker themes such as what the mind does when it is tortured. The story mainly centers around the cover character named Lucy, an other-than-human entity with horns on her head that bears psychic control over these very powerful invisible hands known as vectors. While initially she appears to be this robotic murder machine, there is much more going on with her as she actually has split personalities. One personality, the one you see the most often, is of this immature shrinking violet who can't even communicate outside of making one particular noise, and then her other side is.... well, you know. When she is discovered on the beach by two cousins, naked, scared and alone, they grant her shelter. But the facility she broke out of has not forgotten her, and that is where the story expands.

The animation feels a bit older than most modern anime, but is still very fluid and holds up fine. Literally seeing the vectors is the only part that kinda sucked me out of the moment as far as animation is concerned, as while sometimes the anime needs to show you what Lucy is doing with them to give context to what is happening, I find that the vectors are best left invisible instead of transparent. The characters have a ""moe"" type of style drawn to them, however this cutesy setting it puts up only serves to eclipse the darker tones of the show as themes such as murder, torture, and rape contrast the art style. The music is incredible, the main theme is rightly ominous, melodic, and haunting as it should be, but even the background pieces are worth remembering. The dub for this series holds up just fine as well, while some characters sometimes awkwardly deliver lines, it never breaks your immersion from what is going on.

If you are at all interested in Elfen Lied, it is definitely worth picking up. It's not that long of a show, but it is a very powerful story with disgustingly beautiful characters. This could easily make for one of your most memorable trips into the darker side of your imagination, and will be one that you remember for a long time to come.

I first saw Elfen Lied back in May of 2008, after a bunch of its fans swindled me into buying it by telling me that this anime was one full of gore and nudity yet also had a brilliant story with a strong message about the human condition.  I was so disgusted and enraged by what I saw, I nearly gave up on the entire anime genre.  Thankfully, some hope was restored after opening my mind up more to anime put out by the likes of Studio Ghibli and Satoshi Kon (RIP), though I'm honestly not too optimistic of anime today, but that's a different topic altogether.

STORY

The plot is that there's a mutated race of humans called the Diclonious, which are mostly girls that have horns that look like cat ears and invisible arms called vectors that can tear apart anything. Their goal is to wipe out humanity, many of them are studied in a research facility in Japan. One of them named Lucy breaks out of her cell and begins killing people left and right. A sniper nearly kills her but only winds up shattering her helmet and causing her to plummet hundreds of feet into the sea. Kouta and Yuka find her naked on the beach and decide to take her home. The research facility wants her back and sends assassins, the army, and other Diclonious to get her back or kill her.

CHARACTERS

Elfen Lied is an anime meant for adult viewers that not only wants to be taken very seriously, but also wants to be seen as one of the deepest and smartest anime titles out there.  However, in order to be taken seriously by an intelligent adult audience, you have to flesh out a story and characters that are believable in a real world context.  Elfen Lied drops the ball bigtime because all the characters in this anime are some of the most contrived and absurd for an anime that's supposed to be serious, deep, and intelligent.

The best example of this is that the main characters, Kohta and Yuka, are walking around the beach one day and find a stupid, naked girl bumbling around, and take her home without telling anyone about it.  You think they would at least take them to the police department or a public shelter, but no, because logic is apparently scorned heavily by this anime.  Other examples are with Kohta and Mayu.  Mayu for the fact that she's way too upbeat for someone who's been molested by her stepdad and had to live off scraps thrown away by a benevolent baker.  Kohta has some of the worst character development because aside from being the clich mousy male that's been done-to-death in harem comedy anime, he doesn't show a single shred of resentment towards Lucy after he finds out she killed his dad and little sister when he was a kid.  I wasn't expecting him to go ""Rambo"" on Lucy, but you think he would at least give her a back-handed slap and scream at her.

Lucy is quite possibly the most abhorrent character in the entire anime genre (possibly in the entire world of animation as well).  She has the extremely clich split personality in the forms of Lucy and Nyu.  Lucy is nothing more than a naked meatgrinder with a melodramatic backstory you'd read in the lyrics of your typical nu-metal song and an extremely uncreative split personality.

We're supposed to see Nana as some sort of tragic figure since she's constantly getting torn up and pummeled but I think it's just her fault since she's so unbelievably passive.

It also doesn't help that so many of the female characters feel extremely clich as they perfectly fit the mold of those you'd see in a stupid harem anime like Tenchi Muyo.

CARELESS GENRE MIXING

It's like the monkeys operating Microsoft Word couldn't decide to write a serious anime loaded with gore and nudity or a silly one with plenty of erotic humor and dumb faces, so they made the most detestable decision and made an anime that had both in great quantities.  The truth of the matter is that the extremely serious and extremely silly types of anime have totally different audiences and are just too different from each other to exist in the same anime.  I honestly hate the overly silly anime replete with diabetes-inducing cuteness, and that's the last thing I want to see in an anime that's advertised as something full of gory and lightly erotic grindhouse content.  It also doesn't help that Elfen Lied's attempts to be funny are some of the most cringe-inducing in the entire anime genre.  Oh look, Yuka is berating her loser male cousin and Nyu is grabbing Yuka's mammary glands, how hilarious!!

In my last serious revision of this review, I originally described the grindhouse content in Elfen Lied as ""pornographic,"" and I take this back because that's insulting to even the worst pornography out there.

PLOT-HOLES, CONTRADICTING THEMES, BAD ENDING, AND BAD CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT

Right from the beginning, Elfen Lied is asking you to leave your brain at the door prior to watching it. Lucy escapes the research facility as is knocked unconscious by a sniper's bullet striking her helmet and forcing her to fall into the ocean. Aside from not dying on impact from the water (she fell hundreds of feet), how does she not break any bones and not drown? She's unconscious, she can't swim, so how does she survive being in the water?

There's a smorgasbord of other things in this anime that don't make a lick of sense within its own context.  It turns out that light caliber firearms are ineffective against Diclonius beings, though grenade launchers and .50 caliber firearms can kill them, so why are the security staff at the research laboratory armed with guns that can't do squat to them?  It's also shown that Kohta moved in to the house to where he's at in this series to go to college, yet he's only shown in class ONCE in the whole series.  Even worse, given that Kohta and Yuka don't want Lucy/Nyu to be discovered, they take her to class, even though she acts like a complete idiot (and does so in class in a desperate attempt to provide even more terminally-unfunny comedy to the table).

Apparently, EL's theme is that humanity is monstrous to beings it sees as ""inhuman,"" which is supposed to explain the scientists torturing and killing the Dicloniuses. I wouldn't have a problem with that if the message didn't contradict itself. The Dicloniuses kill people on instinct and the head of the company doing these experiments, who turns out to be a Diclonius, WANTS them to kill of humanity. Also, the fact that this guy is a Diclonius doesn't make sense since he's in charge of this company and therefore in charge of the torturing and killing of his own species. If I cared about anyone in EL (I don't), I'd want to see the Diclonius race get exterminated because the writers screwed up their ""message"" that badly.

EL leaves a lot of things unexplained since it not only reveals that the company head is a Diclonius towards the end, nothing is fleshed out about that afterwards. It also has the worst ending I've ever seen in film since NOTHING is explained. I don't mind ""spoiling"" it for those who haven't seen this abomination since it leaves you thinking that Lucy MIGHT have been killed (of course, they take the pretentious route by not showing it to leave you guessing) but Kohta comes to open the front gate of his house with a shadow on it and once he reaches for the handle, it ends. WORST ENDING EVER.

Many fans have tried to defend the painfully incomplete ending by saying you have to read the manga source material to get the whole story.  This is the worst defense of bad writing of all time, because that would be like watching Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of The Shining, having it suddenly end, and finding out you had to read Stephen King's novel of the same name to get the whole story.  The purpose of an adaptation is for a creative mind to not only create their own interpretation of an existing piece of fiction, but also for it to be able to stand out on its own.  The fact that you have to read the Elfen Lied manga to understand what should have been fleshed out in the anime adaptation renders the anime adaptation totally worthless.

We're introduced to Lucy as seeing her as a beast, but they later change her a little to make her sympathetic to audiences. Apparently, seeing Lucy as Nyu is supposed to make me like her, they failed miserably. All Nyu does is shamble around naked and say ""Nyu"" as she breaks things, this is supposed to make me overlook her insatiable blood thirst? It's like they can't decide if they want me to see Lucy as a monster or an infantile bimbo; either way, she's an abhorrent character. There's a lot of ""deus ex machina"" moments that really kill off any plausibility this might have had like when Bando and his comrade corner Nyu and RIGHT before they kill her, she turns to Lucy and attacks. This is some of the worst writing in animation, period.

SENTIMENTAL GARBAGE

There's plenty of sentimental gunk that would fit right at home with a Lifetime or Hallmark movie.  One that immediately sticks out at me is that pukey scene with Mayu's birthday, the baker who gives her unwanted scraps made her a very small birthday cake, and I guess Kohta and Yuka get it before Mayu does, and they throw her a birthday party.  I think that scene had Mayu crying and whatnot, and I was groaning at how sappy this was.  I thought that scene in Fist of the North Star where one of the female characters finds a flower and cries over ""how beautiful it is"" was bad, but this was way worse.

Another is towards the end, where Lucy apologizes to Kohta for what she did to him and goes on about how he was the only one who was nice to him.  Again, this feels like something right out of a Lifetime movie, except I would feel less cheated in the case of a Lifetime movie because I would know what I was getting into.

APPEARANCE

I hate the way everything looks in Elfen Lied, especially the character designs. Since EL is extremely violent and pornographic, the fact that the characters look like they were plucked right out of Love Hina or Chobits (they have a ""cute"" look) will make any rational person grasp their skulls with both hands and groan continuously out of anger. In and of themselves, the overbearing saccharine appearance of those girls with their freakishly big eyes makes me want to vomit my guts out. Mixing ""cute"" with gratuitous violence and nudity is like using 20 year-old motor oil as a condiment for the Classic Italian sandwich at Quiznos.  It's certainly different, but it's the polar opposite of good.

The animation and artwork certainly had a lot of effort put behind it, but for an anime that's supposed to be gritty and harsh, the extremely clean imagery totally works against it.  I detest the Diclonius designs since they're basically the stereotypical catgirls, despite the fact that this anime's fans will go out of their way to tell you that those are horns on their heads, when it's all too clear they're meant to cater to those who gush over catgirls.

VIOLENCE, NUDITY, AND INCEST

None of the above things offend me whatsoever since I'm not a stranger to either. However, these things look like they were shoved in EL to attract fickle anime fans (which it unfortunately has) and to offend anyone who is a ""prude.""

This anime has a ton of bloodshed, limbs getting torn off, female nudity, and even some moments of ""cousin lovin'"" between Kohta and Yuka.  The first episode really overdoes the bloodshed to the point that it becomes rather boring after the episode is over.  To top it off, there's a scene of Nana and Mayu taking a bath together (who are both underage), and while many fans will try to defend this by saying that it's supposed to show the innocence of the two characters and in Nana's case, shows a contrast to how she was treated in the laboratory.  These defenses are totally wrong because so many of the nude scenes in this anime are meant to be exploitative in nature, and the ""tasteful nudity"" scenes just feel like they're adding more exploitative scenes just for the sake of it.

These also aren't really that offensive taken by themselves since they're used so numerously that they no longer have any provocative value to them after about 20 minutes of exposure. For those of you who are claiming that the constant use of these three things is somehow ""extreme,"" go watch Doomed Megalopolis for an excellent horror anime that utilized violence, nudity, and incest to make the overall experience unnerving rather than tedious.

SOUNDTRACK

It's time to focus on the most overrated anime song ever, ""Lilium."" Everyone thinks this is such a strong and emotional song, but it's a joke. It's nothing more than extremely boring symphonic music with female vocals and Latin lyrics to make Elfen Lied look ""deep"" and ""artistic."" Take a look at Kenji Kawai's dark ambient tracks found on the first Ghost in the Shell soundtrack or Joe Hisashi's music for Grave of the Fireflies for truly chilling and emotional anime music. Also, this type of music fits NOWHERE in this Love Hina-style dramedy disguised as Hostel. Not only does ""Lilium"" have such a non-existent effect on me, these monkeys with Microsoft Word thought it would be great to put a freakin' J-pop song at the end of each episode, which further nullifies any provocative effect the over abundant violence and nudity might have had in this POS.  Also, ""Lilium"" is played ad nauseam throughout the episodes of this anime, wearing out any artistic credibility it might have had really fast.

SYMBOLISM

When symbolism is incorporated into a movie or series properly, it enhances the viewing experience. With EL, however, the symbolism is carelessly thrown in to make it look ""deep"" and ""intellectual."" For one, the clock symbol in EL didn't do anything to make this any better. ""Oh look, the broken clock represents Kohta's broken past and at the end it's fixed, and so is he!! How genius!!"" Give me a break.

I guess there was also supposed to be a symbolic link between Lucy and that stupid music box, as I think there was supposed to be a moment after that moment in the last episode where we thought that homicidal moppet was killed and the music box stopped working, but again, it's more lazy use of symbolism to cover up deplorable story and character development.

While not really symbolism, I find the use of German names in the series's name and of the names of the episodes to be loathsomely pretentious, and I don't care that this anime is named after a German poem.

This probably isn't symbolism, either, but as a pretty big fan of Batman, I was extremely disgusted by the fact that the animators decided to have Kohta wear a Batman shirt in some parts of this deplorable series.

ABUSE OF GUSTAV KLIMT'S ARTWORK

The use of Gustav Klimt's paintings on the opening credits is more examples of self-awarding pretentiousness since Klimt's artwork is splendid and when saccharine-looking anime girls are thrown into his paintings, it's a severe clash in artistic styles and looks just plain silly. If Klimt was alive to see this happen, he'd be highly revolted by this bastardization. This cheap move is just one of the many, many fronts used to cover up the ultimate lack of good story and character development. You know, the qualities that really matter when making any sort of show or movie.

Contrary to what the Elfen Lied fans convince themselves and others to think, referencing 20th century painters isn't enough to make anything good. You need those basic principles I mentioned above because those are universal in making any movie or TV show worthwhile. Without those, you can reference Gustav Klimt and old German poems all you want and it won't change the fact that the final product is a detestable cocktail of various toxic slop. This is like trying to make a giant pile of elephant excrement appetizing by covering it with butter cream frosting, sprinkles, and candles then selling it to an unsuspecting customer as a birthday cake.  Smart people would immediately realize what they're really eating is sheer filth, but so many anime fans fool themselves into believing what they're eating is really cake in this case.

FINAL WORD

It's like the people who created Elfen Lied wanted to have their cake and eat it, too.  Contrary to what the Elfen Lied fanbase would say, Lynn Okamoto (original author of Elfen Lied) and Mamoru Kanbe (creator of the anime adaptation) aren't people who work to provide artistic merit in their entertainment, they feel more like soulless salespeople who are out to line their pockets by creating cheap entertainment disguised as high art loaded with all the worst anime and manga cliches out there.

Some anime just take to high definition, and Elfen Lied is one of them. Something about seeing that blood, bone, and brain matter splatter across the screen in 1080p just brings a warm fuzzy feeling to my heart.

Odds are, if you're considering this product, you've already seen Elfen Lied. If you already own the old DVD sets, or you aren't that huge a fan of the series, then maybe the bumb to BR quality isn't worth your money. However if you enjoy the series, and you haven't already purchased a box set, I encourage you to buy this one. In today's age of torrenting and streaming, it's more important than ever to support the shows you enjoy. Especially in America, where anime isn't as popular as it is in Japan. We all had the ache of waiting for new Hellsing dubs after Geneon went out of business, and Darkhorse stopped printing the old Berserk volumes because not enough people buy them. Can it really be that brilliant, artistic shows like these and Elfen Lied struggle for support while shows like Naruto and One Piece make millions of dollars on the DVDs alone?

On the other hand, if you haven't seen Elfen Lied, then I cannot recommend it enough. Before Gasai Yuno came around, Lucy was the original pink-haired, split personality psychopath. This series is violent, beautiful, emotional, and bloody as all Hell. Due to its dark nature, Elfen Lied is not for the feint of heart.

4852732,5,B005OK0YU2,"Ok EL Fans, I've done my research, and this Bluray is definitely worth it. Im going to reiterate ""EL Fans"".

First, I have to touch on the background. The anime adaptation pales in comparison to the manga (to be short & sweet, it was completed before the manga was); it makes it a little difficult to ""highly"" recommend the anime. This does not mean the series is bad; it is well worth the watch [and purchase if you like it]. The ending was very open to viewer intepretation, which I liked.

DISCLAIMER* The ending could be very dissatisfying if you didn't read the manga, which has a more definite conclusion.

Features a lot of blood (gallons and gallons of it), gore (limbs flying everywhere), some nudity, and typical anime sexual references; a very appropriate TV-MA. Reminds me of Evangelion, you'll either love it or hate it. This series is a hardcore tragedy, almost on a Romeo & Juliet scale. English dub is pretty bad, stick with Japanese. Trying not to be repetative, so I recommend reading the other reviews if you want more info on the story. On to the Bluray.

BLURAY
- I own the box set collection, which is now ragged and bare in terms of extras. This BluRay was comparible in price, is BluRay and includes extras. This, to me, is a worth-while upgrade, or the perfect introductary item to the EL world.
- Section 23 is releasing this version of EL in lieu of ADV, and seems that they want to set themselves apart from the rest of the US anime distro' realm. None of the US distributors included the OVA in their releases, which made it only obtainable in Japan import format... UNTIL NOW!
- Other extras: character artwork, production artwork, clean opening and clean closing.
- Can't speak of BluRay quality, but am confident I will be pleased.

CONCLUSION
It is a tad expensive for 13 episodes. I reccommend watching it first, and HIGHLY recommend reading the manga.

If you have any of the following:
a playable set that you're content with
a budget
a lack of conviction towards the EL anime,
no urge to help the anime industry, I say to you keep what you have.

Elfen Lied is no different. I watched part of the first episode on theanimenetwork.com and became hooked. I thought the bloody overtone shown in the first scene would be the entirety of the show, but it really ended up showing some depth. The characters all had background stories and weren't just typical ""this"" or ""that""; by that I mean they were unique and you could see how they became the way they were.

The animation is phenomenal. The artists really knew how to put the proper emotion into a face or a scene. The nudity wasn't gratuitous and was nothing more than what one would see in an R rated film. As a bonus, the intro song is pretty great too.

Ok this series is for sure my favorite. solid Action, gore, mature, romance & tragedy all in 13 episodes.

THAT BEING SAID, the anime was completed before manga was even finished. That left the producer to force in his own ending to wrap up the anime (was only alloted 13 episodes). I think he did a god job at doing so, but just the mere fact that the anime will only tell maybe half of the whole story will leave you with a ""WTF, that was it?"" feeling at the end. Also, aside from 1 or 2 characters, the voice overs are horrible if you're looking for a dubbed edition. Recommend subbed.

4852747,5,B005OK0YU2,"Elfen lied use foreshadowing to play with viewer's expectations. This is by far the most controversial anime ever made.

STORY

Elfen Lied takes place in Kamakura, Japan, focusing on a new strain of the human race, Diclonius, similar to human beings with invisible arms called vectors but different at the genetic level and notable due to physical abnormalities, particularly a pair of short horn-like protrusions. One such Diclonius, Lucy, is the main character of the series: Initially held in a facility built for experimentation, located off the coast of Kamakura, she manages to escape and wreak havoc, but is injured in the process, an event which causes her to develop a secondary, childlike personality known as Nyu.
Lucy is found by two locals, Kohta, who studies at the local university, and his cousin Yuka. They take her in, and become involved with the numerous, often brutal, attempts to recapture her by a Special Assault Team and a number of other Diclonius, who shift frequently from oblivious to murderous.

I would hate to tell you any spoilers to this flawless anime. The story is so complex that it makes you want to keep watching to see what is next to come. This is truly the best story arms has to offer.

SEXUALITY

I warn you, the sexuality is rather explict, and it is not recommended for any child to watch. You will see constant breast shots, butt shots, also, this may exceed your low tolerance, but there is child molestation depicted, incest, and rape. However, these thing bring a much deeper tone to the anime.

VIOLENCE

There is non stop gore throughout the entire anime. You may get a headache from all the blood, guts, and gore flying out. It's really cool too.

ANIMATION

This is definitely the best animation that has been used in anime history. The amount of value, texture, contrast, line, and color used on the characters is beyond great.

VOICE ACTING

The voice acting is most memorable, especially lucy/nyu. The english dubbing is terrific! I didn't hear the japanese dub yet. But the english dubbing is surprisingly really good.

CHARACTERS

Each character has their own part. No one steals the show. Since many characters are introduced throughout the series, you will be trying to focus on as much detail each character as they present themselves.

SOUNDTRACK

Lilum, is a memorable soundtrack. It conveys meaning throughout the entire series. There is a reason fans love this soundtrack so much.

VERDICT

Elfen lied is arguably the greatest anime ever made because of it's compelling story, it's use of symbols and foreshadowing. The series is only 13 episodes long, it includes an OVA which was never released on the North American import. Otaku's, if you have not seen elfen lied yet, you are in for something special. So check this anime out, there is a reason everyone loves it.",1364860800,,2834,4.883089770354906
4852748,5,B005OK0YU2,A truely wicked anime series that you just can't help but really feel for Lucy. The set arrived in a timely fashion and was packed with upmost care so that nothing was damaged. :],1364688000,,179,4.294117647058823
4852749,2,B005OK0YU2,"Just finished watching this and I'm surprised it's so highly rated. If you turn your brain off you can enjoy the violence and nudity but don't think too much or you'll realize how silly the whole thing is. Major spoilers (stop reading if you haven't watched the series): So imagine you're walking on the beach and a naked woman washes up with big boobs are horns sticking out of her head!!! When you ask if she's OK she can't even speak properly. Do you A. Take her to the police B. Take her to the hospital or C. Take her home. If you chose C Elfen Lied will make perfect sense. If you chose A. or B. get ready to be frustrated because the characters here have no logic or sense to their actions. So here's the basic rundown: An evil government organization gets these mutant girls, all of whom happen to be teenagers and below, and does evil experiments on them while the girls are naked. If even one of these girls escape they can destory the human race just by touching male foreheads with their vectors (invisible arms that can slice and dice) and the unfortunate male will have more of these horned girls as children. Gosh I hope the facility is secure. Not surprisingly, despite years of research, the only way to stop these girls is to have soldiers shoot nonstop hoping that one single bullet will get through their defences. Of course this doesn't work and the main character, Lucy, kills tons of soldiers. For the rest of the series these soldiers show up, shoot her, she blocks and kills all the soldiers over and over and over again. The evil organization can afford huge cells for these girls but can't afford satellites or any tracking devices since once Lucy escapes they have no way to find her. So they send soldiers, then other horned girls who are tougher and tougher to find her. The last girl is so tough she has a bomb implanted into her in case she ever escapes. Wait, why didn't they implant a bomb into Lucy? These basic questions just keep popping up this anime makes no sense. Lucy has a split personality so she goes from stone cold killer to dumb bimbo that likes to fondle the main male character. He just happens to live rent free in a hotel/restaurant with his cousin who has the hots for him. He's Mr. Nice guy even when Lucy throws her big boobs at him every chance she gets. As the series goes on this dude gets a whole harem of abused women who all love him despite him being a kidnapper and pretty clueless about whats going on around him. Some other reviewers feel sorry for Lucy because even though she kills dozens of innocent folks she's really nice when in her bimbo personality. If it wasn't for some nasty children who made fun of her for being different (you know having horns) and killing her puppy (yikes what kind of schools do the Japanese have over there) Lucy would have been a real benefit to society. Sadly, all this teasing made her into a psycho killer. If only these anime schools had adult teachers maybe the outcome would have been better. But wait you say she's so complicated and she had a messed up childhood. I guess society made her a monster oh goodness how deep. But that doesn't change the fact that well all she really does is kill people and later in life she kills some more, becomes a bimbo, then wakes up and kills again. So yeah she pretty much is a monster. In conclusion, this series has lots of violent killing and lots of useless nudity so there's where the 2 stars come from. Too bad you have to deal with idiotic love triangles (oh I loved this boy since I was a kid but he likes someone else oh I'm so jealous), really stupid behavior from the female characters (oh Lucy acting like a bimbo is so cute uhm no she's just really annoying), and really really stupid behavior from the bad guys (before shooting this girl who just killed an army of soldiers let me make a speech about how she won't kill me because I'm so good). Pretty forgettable stuff, no wonder the anime didn't do so well in Japan.",1364256000,3,3977,4.404891304347826

4852772,3,B005OK0YU2,"Usually, when you remember the best moments you had in the past watching your favorite animes you recall moments like the opening and ending songs, the zenit of the plot (e.g. watching Goku turning into a Super Saiyan while fighting Freezer), funny parts, and many other memorable moments. I think Elfen Lied has many pros but it has a serious drawback -from my humble perspective-, the story plot leads the audience nowhere. For example, one more time I cite Dragon Ball, the main goal of Goku is to be the strongest warrior of the universe; Naruto wants to be Hokage; Luffy wishes to find the One Piece; Light Yagami (AKA Kira) sacrifices himself to wipe out the bad people from the world; Seiya and comrades protect Athena and the Earth; Oliver wants to become the best football player in the world; and so on. Each main character has a goal in his (her) existence; either Kohta nor Lucy show any apparent goal in their existences. Anyway, concretely, I find it really silly the way the characters leave the restaurant each time they discuss, it is confusing.

It is too sad Elfen Lied and High School of the Dead suffer the same drawback.

However, discounting the plot issue (sorry, I think I was too hard but honestly I think Elfen Lies could have been better), I think Elfen Lied has its charming moments, namely excellent opening theme, excellent visual appeal, it has light fan service.

This set is not actually ""complete"".  The OVA (episode 10.5) is not included.  It has never been released in the USA, so you will have to acquire it by alternative means.

The video has some occasional blocking artifacts.  In the most part it's perfect, but for a few frames it looks awful (I removed 1 star for this).  It's probably not noticeable when watching it normally.  The episodes themselves are progressive (partly with duplicate frames).  The Op/Ed are interlaced.  The Op was interlaced before editing (this makes it impossible to do inverse-telecine properly on it).

As with all DVDs, the subtitles are ugly.  I spent a week converting the subs to nice (fansub quality) Advanced Sub Station format (sign formatting, panning subs, prettied up the OP/ED, etc.)  Nice looking subs make quite a big difference.

The case fits all 3 discs, but if you aren't careful, they can come loose.  Mine came with a scratch because of this.

I enjoy toughing it out for the ending just like the next guy, so don't worry.***

Okay so: Elfen Lied. I didn't joke about the emotion part. If you are familiar with ""Ekman's List of Basic Emotions"" or ""Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions,"" you WILL feel all of these emotions at least once during the course of the show. This show on the outside is bloody and gory, but It is so much deeper that what is stated 100 times in people's reviews. I found this series, riveting, beautiful, accurately planned (japanese voices matched characters portrayal perfectly), and refreshing from the norm. I really got touched by this anime. I knew for a while that so many people said it was a gory mess that would end up leaving you depressed. It does have dark/twisted themes that most people are not used to being exposed to for copious amounts of time. This is arguably its drawback, but its what sets it apart from the others. There is nudity, but when I say this, I don't mean in the hentai (brutal/ intercourse) fashion. It's artistic nudity that is not aimed specifically for male audience pleasure but to augment realism relevant to the situation. The girls are young, but by no means is it created for perverts to get their rocks off like some ecchi anime you would expect. I think that the scenes with nudity that involve escaping bullets, dripping blood, and scenes in the experiment lab are definitely not scenes anyone should appreciate. But the numerous scenes of the characters nude in nature, the baths, or just walking around *not being harmed* - are beautiful. I appreciate the human body very much and the nudity didn't bother me becuase it wasn't in your face in the anime. They just made it natural and unshameful, which is also very rare. I appreciated the effort to break from the norm.

It is extremely rare for me to come across a story/book/anime series that ends the way you exactly want it to. As if you were essentially directing it and said, ""I want so and so to kiss and be forgiving."" And something like that did! Against all sensible story plotlines and totally against the manga. So I was pleasantly surprised when my theoretical absolute best-ending-moment appeared! :D  Some parts of the last episode were so beautiful it made me cry I out of happiness. If you appreciate an agaisnt-all-odds romance (in the case of two individuals), you'll be really pleased and surprised. I'm very glad the ending of the anime differed from the manga. Even if its confusing a bit, it's satisfactory becuase trueeee feelings come out just before the last 10 minutes of the episode. The gore was annoying at times, but not repuslive. I haven't seen so many limbs come of ever since watching Dead Space aftermath. There are some scenes that really tug on your heartstrings and play with your morality. It really affects the human brain to be thrown into viewing such a hostile environment episode after episode. I did an all nighter cuz I loved it so much, but def. take some mini breaks. Just warning you: there is a scene involving a puppy and some school bullies and...well... if you're an animal lover like me who was on the verge of nearly punching a hole in the tv, where the lead bully's head is- just be prepared for that one unpleasant scene and maybe skip it. ;) It was hard to watch and left me in the foulest of moods. I hope that they would issue a Blu Ray version. The music is so wonderful and series was great in its natural japanese audio. This is definitely one to put on the display shelf.",1350777600,2,3777,4.567846607669616

She is shot in the head while escaping the facility where she is being studied. She washes ashore after her escape and is found by Kohta, a college student. Lucy has lost her memory after the accident so Kohta tries to look after her. The military starts sending other mutants after her. The battles cause her to revert back to her old violent and cold self. She also remembers that she has a past connection to Kohta from childhood. She begins questioning the love he has given her and the love she has begun to feel for him.

This anime is way cool. It has some great characters and a good story. There is a lot of brutal violence and nudity. In my opinion the violence and nudity go too far. Violence doesn't bother me, but there is too much stuff that I would call torture porn. If these things bother you, you should probably not watch Elfen Lied. I just don't let it bother me, it's only make believe after all. It's not worth getting bent out of shape about. I like this anime. The story is character driven, and the characters are very good. They mixed the violence and love in this story very carefully. It is brilliantly written. The animation and voice acting are very good. The soundtrack isn't all that memorable, but it's not bad by any stretch of the imagination. If you can handle people getting cut open and having their limbs torn asunder, then you will really enjoy this anime. People consider Schindler's List a masterpiece, and it goes way too far. This is no different.

To sum it up. If you just accept the hardcore stuff as make believe and watch Elfen Lied for the well written love story it is, you will most likely enjoy this anime.",1350086400,6,1801,4.405405405405405
4852814,1,B005OK0YU2,"So I read some reviews and thought, ""hey why not check this series out"". There seems to be a lot of contention between what I can only assume are fanboys, and people with broader tastes in anime.

Let me break it down for you in the simplest possible terms:

This is a mediocre harem/fan-service anime which attempts to supplement this with excessive violence which in many cases crosses the line into torture porn.

Let's go deeper.

Some of you won't like this review, and I sympathize with you, but I also would question your taste. Let's dive right in and address some of the common issues. Lucy is clearly a catgirl, call it horns if it makes you feel better. If catgirl anime is your thing then check that off the list. The character development is terrible, as are the characters. They are completely uninteresting, outside of several of them are pitiable to the point of making you occasionally sympathetic to their plight. This doesn't fit well in a harem, but hey, neither does the violence. The inclusion of the harem concept just feels weird. Ask yourself ""Would the Akira novels (or anime) been better if suffused with a harem theme?"" There is only one correct answer to that, but in the event that you answered ""yes"" to this and also enjoy catgirls then just stop reading and buy the damn thing. Enjoy your future wanking.

Many people will point out the symbolism. This is something I actually find hilarious, because this isn't symbolism, it's ""OMG I'M A CLOCK IN THE BACKGROUND NOTICE ME"". It couldn't be any more overt if they gave it a goofy face and made it dance. Some point out the paintings in the introduction. Sure. I guess that's a selling point. I'll go ahead and agree, although they are pretty much just a bunch of still homages of some 20th century art that in my opinion is better without the half naked catgirl.

The violence itself is overused and a crutch that the plot uses to barely stand. Period. It's over the top and conflicts with the rest of the anime. Essentially this series is like a sloppier version of Rin, which is in my opinion barely worth watching either. Really the only way I could conceivably justify the entire mix of elements from an artistic standpoint is that maybe it was secretly designed to parody the over-reliance on violence and the desensitization that it creates, and then contrasts this to parody the thematic elements of harem anime. It gives 0 evidence to support that idea however.

This is a solid anime if you enjoy torture porn levels of violence, jerking it to catgirls, or have very low standards for harem anime. It's not terrible, I mean I watched the whole series. The animation itself is a solid B-, and I think overall I'd give it a D+ which o course will anger a lot of people. I'm sorry, the presentation, characters, and plot are just terrible. Would I watch it again? Nah I'm good.

Violence can be used in tandem with a story and be just fine, allow me to recommend Darker than Black season 1 or even the substantially weaker season 2. It uses but doesn't overuse violence, is very serious in tone (aside from the detective and his assistant which thankfully lighten the mood) and the romance is very understated, but Hei and Amber's relationship is barely even suggested and stuck with me more than the entire EL series.

For harems, I'd even prefer Rosario + Vampire or Ah! My Goddess to this. I'm sorry if that upsets you, but at least those have interesting and amusing characters.

Lastly if you actually like this series, you might as well watch Rin. It's got plenty of torture, death, and nudity in the first episode and gets weirder from there on out.

You should have no qualms about ignoring the reviews that make this out to be some sort of pillar of ""good"" anime. It's average at best, and I've been quite generous in this review. NOW HERE'S A PICTURE OF A CLOCK THE END. (lulz)",1349913600,29,3874,4.583815028901734
4852815,2,B005OK0YU2,"No, cousin, I don't want to fondle your breast.

That pretty much sums up my feelings for this show right there. Elfen Lied, despite what so many sappy, shallow people would tell you, is no where near a masterpiece; I wouldn't even go so far as to call it good. It is, for all intents and purposes, a woefully inadequate attempt at a drama which falls far short of tragedy greats in anime such as Grave of the Fireflies , Kino's Journey, Now and Then, Here and There, and yes EVA. It is an ant amongst giants, an ant in a world of humans. Fans of the series will point to the many instances of drama and ""tear jerking moments"" as proof that there is substance of any kind to be found here, but they would be wrong. Instead of coming off as depressing instances of heartbreaking suffering, the more tragic moments in the show come across as more disgusting then anything else. Where as moments in shows like Now and Then, Here and There and EVA showed tragedy in ways which were designed to not only depress its viewers but also go leaves them with ""heartbreaking fondness,"" Elfen Lied simply wants to gross you out, as much as humanly possible.

Almost every moment of this show is saturated with fan service almost to the point, no, take that back, TO the point of absurdity. Some fan service here and there is okay, I don't really like it but its fine, but THIS MUCH!? How many times do I have to see Lucy (or Nyu, which is her alter ego) shamble around on screen wearing nothing but socks? How many times must I have to see Myu (who's 13 BTW) take a bath with Nanna (who is also 13)? Nothing makes you feel like a pervert more then watching a couple 13 year olds take a bath together for ten minutes.

The show starts off with a ten minute bloodbath as a naked Lucy strolls though the hulls of a heavenly protected government research lab killing literally hundreds of well armed soldiers and guards (and one very unfortunate, very clumsy secretary). She manages to escape (leaving behind a LOT of blood) but is shot in the head, which then causes her to lose her memory. Washing up on a nearby beach the next morning (naked, as always) she is taken in by a pair a well meaning college students (who only go to class once during he series. I guess class attendance isn't really a top priority in Japan), Kohta and Yuka. Now lets play a little game; you see a naked, clearly mentally ill girl wash up on the beach without the ability to speak. Do you...
A) Call the police.
B) Give her some food and cloths and THEN call the police. Or would you...
C) Take said naked girl who can't even speak home with you and NOT tell anyone.

If you said A or B then TADA! You're a normal person. If you said C then you are a character in Elfen Lied. YEAH! I know anime isn't a genre where characters always act and talk like real people, but COME ON! Who wouldn't call the police if they found a naked mentally ill girl on the beach? (Other then perverts, that is). Is it too much to expect these characters to act at least somewhat realistically?

And that's pretty much the problem with this show from beginning to end; the characters do NOT act like real people. The love triangle that's started up between Nyu (Lucy), Kohta, and Yuka, I guess to add a second layer of ""depth"" to the story (you know, give it something other then the whole naked girls killing lots and lots of people) comes off as more of a soap opera then anything else. What person actually asks their first cousin to fondle their breast? YUCK! Every time Kohta does anything with another girl (oftentimes just helping them out) Yuka gets jealous, calls him a jerk, maybe slaps him around, and then runs off crying. Now I can sympathize to a point, but girl GET OVER YOURSELF! It isn't the end of the world if your first cousin isn't romantically interested in you.

But it isn't only that, characters who really are likable and DO have interesting back stories (Myu for instance) are introduced, and then almost ignored. Myu had possibly one of the saddest back stories in the whole show, and yet her past was never fleshed out or used to propel the story. I would have loved to see her run into her step father in the streets someday, or maybe she, with the help of her friends, could have tried to confront him. Although the creators of this show get props for attempting such an ambitious story, they get no credit for execution as the whole thing is more disgusting then sad and is not elaborated on during the course of the series. Myu serves as a plot device for the rest of the series, and it is very unfortunate for the series as a whole because instead they decide to focus on Khota and Yuka who are, quite frankly, uninteresting and boring.

So now for some good stuff. The little Diclonius (the race of horned mutants of which Lucy [or Nye], and Nanna are a part) girls are SO adorable that it was almost impossible to find any fault in them, even when they went on bloody rampages and killed dozens of innocent people. All they had to do was look at the screen with those giant red eyes of theirs and cry a little bit and my heart would break for them. Who knew such sadistic killers could be so easy to sympathize with? Despite my trashing the linier story of this show, the back story for Lucy was actually quite stunning (if a little too convenient). The part with her dog was SO depressing I was tempted to give this show more then two stars, but alas the ending didn't give it any hope of such a high rating. My favorite part, by far, is when Lucy goes to the zoo as a child and is amazed by the size of the elephants and giraffes. It reminded my so much of my own childhood, going to the Omaha Zoo (one of the biggest in the country BTW) and begging my parents to let me see the elephants because they were my favorite. Yes, I'm a sucker when it comes to little girls suffering; probably explains why my favorite shows and Now and Then, Here and There and Gunslinger Girl, and if Elfen Lied had focused on this back story as a focal point instead of the inane love triangle/government conspiracy nonsense Elfen Lied could have very well been a masterpiece. As is, with only a few episodes dedicated to back story, the show could not stand the weight of its own self importance. Nanna was also a pretty interesting character, though at the very end of the show she did get a bit annoying.

The animation for this show was actually quite good; better in fact then most anime I've seen. The backgrounds were quite stunning in their detail and the character designs were oh so cute. The music was pretty plain, although the main theme wasn't bad at all, if a little less impressive then other shows. It's the opening and ending that get on my nerves. More naked girls shuffling around while the camera zooms in on their breast. Don't believe me? It's true. The ending is some Japanese rock song with a still picture of a naked Lucy while we slowly zoom in on her left breast.  What kind of person does it take to watch that ending to its end? I wonder... maybe the same kind of person it takes to give this show a give star review.

So if you're looking for tragedy, look elsewhere at the shows I've already mentioned. Elfen Lied is nothing special, that is unless your looking for underage girls taking showers together, in which case I'd suggest you tern yourself in to your local authorities and get immediate psychiatric help. Good night.

4852816,5,B005OK0YU2,This item was very enjoyable for the person I gave the movie to. Which says something since they are very picky. Plus the best part is it arrived ahead of schedule.,1349568000,,164,4.32258064516129
4852817,2,B005OK0YU2,"Elfen Lied. The story about a female diclonius named Lucy, who has two horns on her head (imagine like cat ears) and used her 'vectors' (which are, basically, invisible arms that kills people in an instant within her vicinity) who escapes from the Diclonius Research Facility and meets a young adult male and female, name Kouta and Yuka. However, Lucy was shot during the escape (in the head though the metallic helmet took the impact) and emerge a new personality called Nyu due to the only word that she can say and had an idiotic appeal of childlike state that would just lure in false innocence (which I will explain later on this review). Apparently, Kouta and Lucy/Nyu had a secret past which will unlock Kouta's 'repressed' memories later on in the anime. Even though this plot seems simple, the creator of Elfen Lied, Lynn Okamoto, enjoys putting a large sum of ineffective subplots that will hinder the main storyline(though there is a possibility that the subplots were an emphasis to the themes of Elfen Lied) and the portrayal of the Nyu personality disgusts me of what the producers wanting to convey the audience about her.

Regarding to the storyline, it is actually had a good concept, but the outcome is terrible. The series is actually a harem after I watch the anime for the second time (I did not know that it is a harem genre until I watched the show again). The first time I watched the show, it was incredible and was in one of my top favorite anime. The use of emotions to lure the audience to pay close attention to the show is actually very effective, which I will admit. However, I will not be fooled by this deception and watch for the second time. This time, I was actually focusing on character development, themes/arguments, and the storyline. Now, there is some decisive flaws. The anime shows a lot of flashbacks, since flashbacks does establish the connection to the characters. Unfortunately, there was a major flashback scene that is not even about Kouta or Lucy/Nyu. That flashback is about Mayu, one of the supporting characters in Elfen Lied that actually had no involvement to the storyline. This is one major flaw. The other is actually at the outcome of the main storyline and the failure to bring in the accountability of Lucy's sins against humanity. Lucy is actually a mass murderer who kills humans..well, because the person is a human being. There is a sequence in the anime that shows the viewer of what caused Lucy to do such horrific actions, but this reason is absolutely halfwitted (like Hilter ordering the Nazis to wipe out the Jewish population because they are Jewish). The characters in the story are absolutely flat from the beginning and to the very end of the anime (though there were some small dynamic change in character development, but is not enough).

The Nyu personality is one of the central attention to the audience in Elfen Lied. Nyu can be very adorable, cute, and innocent, but this brings major contradictions. The producers use extreme levels of pathos (emotional) appeal/argument to deceive the viewer that Nyu is so cute and innocent, which actually angers me. Does the producers wants to show the viewer (intentionaly or unintentionally) that even though Lucy/Nyu shares the same body and Lucy kills thousands of human beings, Nyu can be 'forgiven'? The answer is absolutely yes. This factor is a major problem and a contradiction. There is something wrong when an individual kills so many people, especially without reason and the anime greatly failed to mention her atrocities. Is the viewer suppose to love Nyu? That is what the producers 'expects' to happen as they used so much pathos appeal/argument that the storyline has lost its effectiveness. There is one point in the anime that she states that the only reason why she still lives is because she wants to make an apology to Kouta. However, she continues to kill people even after her involvement in Kouta's mysterious past is another example of contradictory. Overall, the producers enjoy the use of radical, emotional manipulation to the audience to think that Nyu is so cute, up to the point that the viewer thinks that Nyu is a different person and not a personality, especially (regardless of what personality) the person responsible for 'genocide' against humanity.

Elfen Lied does have some good themes of social isolation and the debate of nature vs. nurture, but the rest is not justified. Is there some sort of justice to the victims that she killed or her involvement in Kouta's past? Unfortunately, that is a big 'no' answer. The anime did not reference about the other victims that Lucy took though there was one scene that she randomly kills a young girl just to test out her vectors' strength. Basically, this is up to you to decide if you like the show or not. The fanbase of Elfen Lied seems to not tolerate negative reviews, even when there is some strong arguments to justify his or her reasoning of why they hate the show, including here at Amazon. The fans likes to bring in cliche counterarguments of why Elfen Lied is an excellent show and never seem to even listen to negative reviews (since a few of them were actually very valid and well-supported). I actually read the manga version of Elfen Lied, and if I have to rate the manga, I actually would rate it the same as to the anime. The reason why I give Elfen Lied 2/5 is because the storyline actually had great potential, but it is very shortcoming. The overused of the innocent Nyu will absolutely distract you from the main storyline, using so much emotional manipulation to make you fell in love with Nyu. Good concept, but the flaws are too great to make me give a better rating. In a warning note, never be distracted by emotional manipulation when watching Elfen Lied for the first time.",1348704000,3,5811,4.762896825396825
4852818,2,B005OK0YU2,"This is a well-paced story with a good initial concept. However, it also is a very bad experience.  The impact of movies, manga, and anime that tell a story can often be hyped-up in emotional effect by crossing boundaries.  We don't have many boundaries these days, but this thing sure managed to find some to cross.

Any ""entertainment"" product that works largely because it makes you sad by showing images of extreme brutality is (unless you're a sadist) really just disguised cheap sensationalism.  I will grant that it's sensationalism for a new century.  It breaks new ground--for example an extended scene of a girl who looks about 15 having her arms and legs cut off and then lying on the ground helpless for a while. And There are lots more similar scenes in this thing, some even more heartbreaking.

This is literally the FIRST media experience I've ever had in my long life that made me think that censorship might be a good thing, for two reasons:
1) Society has no need for entertainment for sadists;

2) When a show like this takes a ""bold leap"" into ultra-disgusting imagery, you can be sure someone else will soon go it one better. It may become difficult to avoid images like this in anime in future.

I'm betting that the mangaka and anime-creators of ""Elfen Lied"" made a calculated business decision here: The story is good, but we can make it great--in emotional impact on the audience, at least--by thoroughly grossing out some normal people and putting others in touch with their own inner sadist.

4852834,5,B005OK0YU2,"I fell in love with the anime Elfen Lied within the first few seconds of hearing and watching it's opening. I was completely blown away by the art and music. Thankfully the show itself, and not just the opening, was amazing.

Elfen Lied is a very graphic show. The show is filled with violence (both mental and physical, I guess you could say) coming from, and usually directed towards, younger girls. I should also mention that there are a lot of young, nude girls in this show (just watch the opening and you'll know what I'm talking about). Some say that it's perverted, but I think that the nudity of certain characters is perfect at illustrating the theme the show is going for, which would be how cruelly we can treat others simply because they are different from us. Plus, anyone who can watch an anime with a plot like Elfen Lied and then get turned on by a naked under-aged girl is just sick.

Speaking of plot, this show is about a mutant girl with horns and pink hair who escapes from a research facility and is found on a beach by a young man named Kouta and his cousin Yuka. I really don't want to say anything else about the plot because the best thing about watching Elfen Lied is going into it not knowing what's going to happen.

Let me just make this clear: this show is NOT for everybody. I showed this anime to my older brother and cousin and several episodes made my brother get angry with me. He was mad because I didn't warn him that some of the actions characters in this anime commit are so... sick. Elfen Lied is bloody, gory, and contains nudity-- not to mention that so many parts of this story are just so dam heart-breaking and depressing. So why did I and so many others enjoy watching this show? I really don't know.

4852837,5,B005OK0YU2,"To say that I was stunned at the conclusion of this anime would not be doing Elfren Lied justice. This was one of the best animes I have ever seen. Elfren Lied is a smart, dark, tragic, and well-written anime that deserves all of the recognition that it gets.

This series is about a mutant human named Lucy whose purpose is to destroy mankind by controlling a set of telekinetic hands called Vectors that have the ability to kill or infect people. After she escapes from the facility where she is held, she is shot in the head by a 50 cal (and doesn't die somehow) and is found by a pair of teenagers. After she is shot, her personality splits between her vicious and unforgiving side (Lucy) and her gentle, kind, and language deficient side (Nyu).

This is a hard anime to review because it's plot is rather basic in nature and as a reviewer, I don't want to give away the story as the story aspect is where Elfren Lied shines.

It does have it's problems though. Some of the characters spend a lot of time naked and that can be a turn off for some viewers. When people say this show is dark, they are telling the truth. This anime is seriously dark. This show includes torture, murder, rape (thankfully not shown) animal abuse (which was tough to watch) and so on, but this anime is still pure genius. This anime understands exactly what it is and it takes the gloves off to deliver an unforgettable experience. This series is short and that is probably for the best. Highly emotional series such as this and Gai-Rei Zero are short (12 and 13 episodes). They hit you hard and then leave you to your thoughts.

This anime touches on many themes and does it well. It looks into acceptance, love (parent to child, and boy to girl, friend to friend,), honesty, a place to call home, sacrifice, good and evil, and parenting just to name a few.

If after watching the series you still feel the need to know more and to further understand all the plots of this great tragic story, read the manga. it's beautifully drawn and it goes into more detail about many things.

It's got everything in gratuity and it's like someone thought to themselves 'how can I make the most horribly violent, messed up, psychotic anime ever and still include the harem/cute innocent cat girl themes into it? Well, that's basically what you get. The show basically flip-flops between Lucy either being a cute, stupid bimbo catgirl who is just dying to get the main male character to touch her in sexual ways, to suddenly being a sadistic hellhound out to make mincemeat of everything that moves. The show is bloody and horrifying in all the wrong ways, like the creators were trying their hardest to squeeze in more gallons of blood and torture in every fight scene just because. Then the harem aspect, ya know, just because. And in case that's not enough, you get animal cruelty, child pornography/sexual harassment/abuse/murder, and every other thing they could throw in to make you even more depressed.

For me, watching anime is about seeing the creation of characters and story in ways that make me care about them, to want to watch right to the end, to laugh and cry. Elfen Lied gave me absolutely none of those things. It is depressing, loaded with gratuitous atrocities and the characters are shallow and play out every stereotypical role that has given anime a bad rap. I honestly have no idea *how* this anime has been given such a large amount of great reviews, but I am not one to follow the crowd on this one.

No element is atrocious, and nothing falls flat, but nothing is original, surprising, or clever.  The show simply lacks inspiration.  I might have enjoyed it when I was 15 and hadn't seem the formula it follows so many times before, but now (at age 30) it simply has nothing new to offer.

The story is a pretty standard killer-machine-wants-to-be-human combined with a busty-but-angsty cat girl acting like an infant.  Except that it's not as clever I just made it sound.  The characters are flat and predictable, but tolerable.  The episodes are willing to cross some lines that most shows will not, but ultimately they are following a predictable story arc.  There is an ongoing plot, but not one with much real suspense.  The production quality is good, but not enough to carry the show.

Despite the front and back of the casing, the show is not at all pornographic.  There is nudity, but it is tasteful (if a bit gratuitous).  The gore is under control, but occurs just enough to keep you unsure of what will come next.  It's just too bad the directing and art weren't paired with with characters or a story that I cared about.

I don't regret watching the series although I wish I hadn't paid any money for it.  I have absolutely no desire to watch it a second time and I would not have regretted missing it entirely, but once I owned it did watch the whole thing.  I kept hoping it would get better, and in the end I mildly wish I hadn't bothered.  Overall, I can't recommend it, unless you want to see yet another excuse for a scantily clad (or unclad) cat-girl feeling angsty.",1339027200,9,1703,4.604651162790698

This is not just because there is tremendous gore and nudity, nor because it can be depressing at times, but because there are some quirks that can be ridiculous. Those quirks aside, this anime will surprise you and is definitely worth watching. It deals with some very heavy concepts and will tug at your emotional heart strings. There is a lot of violence, but after the first few episodes everything begins to make sense and come together. I laughed out loud when, after what seemed to be a lot of senseless gore followed by silly sexual humor, I became captivated by the character's back stories. This resulted in me becoming much more focused on what each character did and why, and ultimately made this short anime very special. It is over the top at times, but if you can handle a little over-the-top-ness then you might love this show.

  In terms of what made this anime so great to me, the deeper concepts I perceived to be played out on the screen really made me think. How damaged the human condition is that our more innocent and pure nature becomes corrupted, turning us into monsters. How there are not any ""good guys"" in this show, and even the seemingly perfect male figure ""Khota"" has his own flaws such as not being honest in order to protect the feelings of others. The Juxtaposition of truly horrible violence and the bubbly character traits can make sense if one observes how, deep down, none of them are really all that bad. It gave me the sense of wanting everyone to stay alive and safe so that their bizarre domestic bliss/shenanigans could continue in the next episode. Ultimately, this anime made me care about the characters even though I did not expect to in the beginning, and I like being surprised.

  Some of the villains are a little two dimensional which can be somewhat frustrating. Also, some of the scenes are a little hard to stomach, particularly in regards to the treatment of females both children and adults. However, all of this comes together as the show progresses and makes the character progression that much more meaningful.

  I do not want to spoil the series for anyone, so I won't go into further detail, however I think it is important to say that this series is worth watching. Since it is on Netflix I highly recommend watching it there if you do not feel like buying the whole series first, and then after giving it a try you should definitely add it to your collection. If you are like me you will probably enjoy this anime very much despite its flaws.",1338768000,6,2568,4.601750547045952

4852846,5,B005OK0YU2,"I had heard so many things about Elfen Lied.  Mostly how it was so violent, brutal and horrific.  I finally watched it and I'm kinda blown away.  I'm left with a mixture of feelings.  So many brutal moments, so many sad moments, so many nice moments.  And the ending is also a mix of happy and tragic.  I guess what I'm so impressed with is how everything fits together in this story.  Its actually a pretty complex story for only 13 episodes.  But as the series goes on, everything comes together and fits together like pieces of a puzzle.  It seems like it was a really well thought out story!  Different events happen during the course of the show, which may seem unrelated, but in the end you see how everything is interconnected.  The 1-star review trashed this show and said it was a combination of every cliche in anime.  Well, I cannot speak to its 100% originality or any ground-breaking new concepts, as I am not that experienced or vexed of an anime viewer.  All I can tell you is that in my opinion, this is an amazing show.  If you don't feel touched emotionally at some point while watching, then something has got to be wrong with you.  There are horrendous and heart-wrenching parts, but there are also heartfelt scenes about loving, caring, values of family and friedship.  If themes like this have become too cliche for you then you might as well pass on Elfen Lied, as you have probably watched too much anime for your own good anyway.  I think its amazing how they managed to combine so many different aspects together in 1 show, and it does NOT seem forced in my opinion.  I was afraid this show was going to be too dark and depressing.  But there is enough happiness to balance out the dark, and somehow through all the horror it manages to have a satisfying ending.  Highly Recommended.",1334016000,39,1809,4.49079754601227
4852847,5,B005OK0YU2,"Elfen Lied has been given a lot of praise... and you know what?  It Deserves it.  A friend of mine had told me about this anime and I watched it and was completely blown away.  After I had started watching more anime, and going on anime forums and speaking with others, it seems as if many anime fans dislike this series.  After a bit of speculation, I think I know why.  It's popular.  That's all.  It's because it's gained a popular status, and anime fans seem to hate this.  Dragon Ball Z is quickly written off when discussed with anime fans.  why?  Because of its popularity.  Inuyasha?  Same deal.  not that I was a fan of Inuyasha, but I'm not going to go out of my way to say it's a horrible anime, or to go so far as to say it's not even considered anime due to its popularity in the U.S.  Just because I personally am not attracted to an anime, does NOT mean it's bad, and that goes for everyone.  A final note, being Naruto.  I HATE Naruto.  Is it a bad anime?  well, lets see.  It has a huge following of fans, although many are high schoolers, but I digress.  also, it has been going on for a long time, and has well over 200 episodes.  well, damn.  if it did that well, there's obviously a reason.  Fan Base possibly?  haters gonna hate.

on with Elfen Lied.  Many write it off saying it's trying too hard to be this deep story.  I also hear a lot of people saying that the gore is the reason people love it, and the gore alone is the reason people think it's so ""deep"".  uhm... yah.  when people are talking about the word ""deep"", they're talking emotionally and in terms of the plot.  gore has NO impact on this.  Another thing that seems to be brought up is the nudity.  once again, this ISN'T that bad.  So, Lucy/Nyu and Nana are nude for a bit.  first of, the Diclonius females, if I'm remembering correctly DO NOT have female reproductive organs, so, there's no lower nudity at all.  second, their breasts are out.  big whoop.  I could see this being a big deal if MAYBE their breasts were bouncing around all Highschool of the Dead style, but THEY'RE NOT.  as a matter of fact, I don't think those breasts EVER bounced a single time in the entire series of Elfen Lied.  People need to stop complaining about these two stupid matters and get on to what REALLY matters.

the only thing I can say that I don't like are the two protagonists, Khota and Yuka.  they're not horrible characters, they're just not what they could have been.  The romance between these two is kind of strange, considering they're cousins, so, I like to just imagine they're long time friends, but whatever.

now, about the theme song, Lilium.  Seriously?  THIS song is trying to make an ENTIRE show look ""deep""?  it's a damn song!  If I never heard this theme song ONE time during the show, it wouldn't have changed my opinion.  if I watched the entire series, THEN listened to lilium, I wouldn't see the show as being ANY deeper than it was before.  I think people are angry that this show actually HAS an amazing opening theme, and they can't accept that.  it's seriously the only explanation i can come up with.  this song is very heartwarming, yet cold at the same time.  it's very well composed.  I also read one person who hated the fact that the ending song for each episode was a J-POP song.  WHO THE HELL CARES is my response.  the episode's over.  you don't NEED to listen to that if you don't want to.  I for one like that song as well.

TL;DR

haters gonna hate because they can't accept that something's popular.  AKA hipster anime fans will hate this.",1333843200,13,3559,4.343511450381679
4852848,2,B005OK0YU2,"After watching Elfen Lied I had a lot of questions. Above them all being what exactly did I just watch? What was it trying to accomplish? Is it a romance? An action show? An ecchi harem thing? A psychological drama? The show could be all of these things, but I was left feeling as if it failed at being any of them.

I say for a romance to be successful the audience must at least like the characters. The characters in Elfen Lied are much too easy to hate. From their irrational decisions to cardboard personalities every character is frustrating to watch and hard to care about. So, I was left unable to enjoy the romance of Elfen Lied.

The art was nothing special, looked good enough though. Character designs could have been more creative. I like action shows that have great art and interesting fight scenes. While descent on the art side of things, Elfen Lied's fight scenes are more often then not one sided and bland. Then there's the blood everywhere. Not at all scary, and if anything it's gross. I can see people enjoying the action in Elfen Lied though. But because it's dispersed between all of the romance and drama I wouldn't recommend the show to anyone based solely on the action.

Other things to look at would be the ecchi/harem-ish aspects of the show, also the source of it's comedy. I believe there's nothing special or inventive about the various situations and didn't find them very funny. Then there is the, quite random, nudity everywhere. So if you like action, blood, harems, and random nudity you should give Elfen Lied a shot.

The opening song,Lillium, is cool and anything else they bother to play is decent. Voice acting is average.

What ticks me off about the story besides it not being complete is that there was something interesting going on. I hate to be disappointed and that's what Elfen Lied gave me. The primary focus of the story seems to be the psychological drama aspects of the show. Which is hard to take seriously with the random nudity and silly ecchi scenes. The subject matter they deal with is nothing new, some secret organization and mutants, but my interest had been piqued. Then the logic of Elfen Lied slapped me in the face.

In Elfen Lied the characters are either good or bad, and there are an awful lot more bad characters. It's fine to explore the evil within people, but Elfen Lied doesn't do that. It rather shows you people doing evil things. I know there are not that many sociopaths in the world. Then with the incomplete story too much is left unexplained. It's so extreme it's unforgivable.

What Elfen Lied often accomplishes with it's story is tugging at people's heart strings. Now I don't have a heart of ice, many movies and series have left me in tears, but Elfen Lied even failed to impress me there. I just found myself incapable of empathizing with the terrible characters; some gained my pity, but that had no effect on me.

I can see the appeal of the show, but in many ways it just wasn't my thing. To sum all of this up, Elfen Lied failed to impress me and I found the show to be below average. For all of the people who love this show, I can see why. But if you expect everyone else to love the show as well, then you're crazy. Elfen Lied is just not for everyone. I say it's all up to your taste and interpretation.",1331337600,11,3301,4.49
4852849,3,B005OK0YU2,"This is a comprehensive review where I try to show the pros and cons of the Anime. Reading this should tell you if you're going to buy the product or not which is why I'm going to be as explanatory as possible. Alrighty let's get this thing started. First of all let me explain how this will work I'm going to put my rating justification first, then a little plot summary, the pros, the cons, various warnings and examples of what to expect, then an afterword
. No I will not give this a comprehensive plot summary because it would ruin the show.

The plot focuses around Lucy/Nyu (the main Diclonius, I'll explain dicloniuses later) and Kohta (the main human). The main support characters are Yuka (Kohta's cousin), Nana (another Diclonius), Mayu (a young girl who is mostly just a supporting character), Bandoh (a merc), and Kurama (the SIC of the main villainous organization). Now because the story is about them I guess I have to explain them. Dicloniuses are mutants who have telekinetic powers that manifest in the form of invisible arms and vibrate at a frequency high enough to cut through objects, pick up objects, or stop bullets. These manifestations are called ""Vectors."" Dicloniuses are very noticeable because they have horns growing out of their heads (hard to miss right?) That's all I'm giving out. Wouldn't want to ruin the fun XD

My first thing will be to justify my rating. I gave it the three it deserved because even though I loved the anime there were certain things I did not agree with them putting in. That and the things that are listed below added to my reasoning for the rating.

Now the pros. They will be numbered so you can compare the number of pros and cons to make your life easier.
1.) Lucy- her character development is deeper and more underrated than anything I've ever seen before. Long story short she grew up a being tormented by her peers because of the horns even though she is a relatively good person which can be seen throughout her backstory. However she does unfortunately give in to her hate. Much to the misfortune of her tormentors.
2.) The rest of the characters are all well explained in their own right except for Yuka she's just there being a jealous crybaby which makes her relatively hate able. But all the other characters are pretty cool.
3.) Now this isn't much of a pro but in the first episode the first five minutes is pretty much a naked woman slaughtering a bunch of security guards, now I don't know about anyone else but I thought it was awesome.

Somewhere in the middle (These are things can be good or bad, depending on how you look at it)
1.) The Story- now I'm not going to ruin it but it is very well written depending on how you look at it. However I enjoyed it so much because I am good with empathy. Now I feel that's how you have to look at this show because it helps you understand the predicaments of the characters and understand why they do the things they do. However on the flipside there are some plot holes, I thought the backstories fixed them but some people don't. To each his own right? Anyway the way I see it the best way to get the whole story is to just read the manga, which I hear fixes the vast majority of them. However that is not saying the anime isn't worth it. It's just not as comprehensive.
2.) The Length- Now, the series is only 13 episodes. That's bad because they had to condense 107 chapters of manga into 13 anime episodes and the manga ends at a point in the story after the anime. Its good because for someone like me with only a little bit of time on their hands this show is great because it condenses  a cool story into 325 minutes and only 3 discs, ya know, one of those things you can get out in one sitting.
3.) Plot Continuity- This is probably the most common problem I've read about in other critical reviews and unfortunately it's true. However, another thing I've noticed is that practically EVERY anime has this problem, except for Bleach, which is incredibly story driven. Yet even in all theses animes you can find the plot and storyline, you just have to pay attention and you can understand everything relatively easily.

Cons (the cons are all of my general warnings if any of this deters you this show may not be for you.)
1.) There is a scene in episode 5 that goes from 3 minutes in to 6 minutes in and I'm not going to describe it but it was quite depressing and disturbing. I felt it completely killed anything good they did in the episodes before it just because it was so sad. (DO NOT LET YOUR KIDS OR ANYONE UNDER 18 WATCH THIS SCENE) That's my opinion anyways. However I will say that this scene revolves around Mayu and when you think about it shows why she's so nice because she can't bear to put people through the kind of sadness she went through. Just an absolutely pure soul. (Wow I made the con a semi-pro)
2.) The Nudity- believe it or not there wasn't too much however there were 3 scenes with underage nudity COMPLETELY NON-SEXUAL but it definately kills the mood of the scenes it's in. If you're against this kind of thing like I am then don't bother but if you can just try to ignore it then you'll be able to enjoy everything else.
3.) Graphic Violence- The violence is very graphic and very bloody however it's also detailed (when they cut something off you can see the muscle and bone...... very interesting feature) just depends on if you can stomach it. If so have fun if not well that's your choice.

Afterword
So, in conclusion, if you can look past the cons then it really is at the least worth the time to watch. I feel it's an interesting add to any collection but hey that's your choice I'm just trying to give some input. PLEASE NOTE: I didn't do any nitpicking in this review because I don't see the point, I just pointed out the biggest problems and good points I could think of. If you'd like to point out something I missed I'd appreciate if you took the time to write it in the comments. Be thorough and I will respond to your comments as soon as I possibly can.

4852850,5,B005OK0YU2,"Just want to stop on by and say this was pretty cool. I'm not a fan of this type of thing (Anime), but seriously, this was was a pretty decent little series. I seen some of it at a friends apartment while he was watching it. He's (STILL!) in college for that kind of crap, but I got sucked in. Went out and well, had him buy it for me. I couldn't bring myself to actually go put that on the check-out counter being 26 and all. But yea, watched it and loved it. If you're American, you enjoy creepy opera music, naked chicks running around killing people, and lots of blood. All while eating that bacon cheesburger on your couch. It's a cartoon, sure, but whatever. It's better than most of the recent horror movies that came out last year.

Oh, and if this isn't your type of thing, I wouldn't leave it laying out. My brother and girlfriend made me the ""proud"" owner of several Lion King posters, a Mighty Mouse blow-up punching bag, and several other crappy stuff they thought would be funny after seeing I was watching this.

4852851,4,B005OK0YU2,"This is a series that starts with a naked girl kept captive by some government agency and wearing a helmet that blocks her vision escapes from a top-secret facility, laying waste to a lot of people in the process.

We aren't shown who she is, or how she can seemingly cut down hordes of people without lifting a finger.

The series then seems to jump to a young man finding a strange girl washed up on the beach.  She has no memory, but latches onto him as a friend.

Such is the world of Elfen Lied.  As the tale spins out we learn the history of the main characters and how they both ended up in the situation.  We find out the great secret the government keeps regarding this girl, and others like her.  We find out about the betrayals committed, the vengeful mistakes and the many unshed tears.

All of this is wrapped up in just a few episodes.

If I had any major complaint it would be that the series shortens some of the storylines, and there are a few Deus ex Machina type events used to spur the tale along.  Add in the typical over-the-top villains who got beyond even unreasonable levels of force trying to capture/kill other characters and I had to take away one star.  This series is interesting and fun, but lacks a little in the plot and character development.  The villains especially are two-dimensional.

Good, but very bloody series.  I wouldn't let your children watch this.",1327536000,21,1395,4.462450592885376
4852852,5,B005OK0YU2,"Elfen Lied is an anime of legend these days.  Touted by many as being ""the most violent anime series created"", there is more than meets the eye to the short series.  The anime does an excellent job of incorporating several various themes and subjects into the episodes, and captures a wide range of emotions in the process.  At first appearing to be nothing more than a exploitative series about gore, violence, murder, and the super natural, the series is actually quite deep, quite touching, and yes it is also quite depressing.

The story begins in a laboratory, where a young girl is seen escaping her confines within the depths of the storage chamber in which the scientists contained her.  The girl has no problem or hesitation in killing everyone who gets in her way.  Yet, her manner of dispensing of her foes is not yet explained.  Magically all of the soldiers and scientists who confront the girl are torn to pieces, while the girl is free to continue walking, as if nothing occurred whatsoever.  The girl's name is revealed to be ""Lucy"", and it becomes obvious to the viewer that something is not right about Lucy.

After escaping from the restraints of the laboratory, Lucy is found on shore of a local beach by two adolescents, one male (Kouta) and one female (Yuka).  Upon discovering her body upon shore, Lucy no longer appears to be the same violent person that was just depicted within the lab where she escaped.  Reverting to a somewhat ""child like"" personality, Lucy is no longer capable of speaking full words, resorting to one word and one word alone ""Nyu"".  As a result, the two teenagers decide to take her in as family and name her ""Nyu"".

As the story progresses, the viewers find out the backstory behind Lucy/Nyu, and why she was within the lab to begin with.  Here is where the story takes a turn in emotions.  The backstory behind Lucy and her actions is quite sorrowful, and tear-jerking.  The troubles she encountered formed a psyche within the girl that she could no longer control.

At times the series can depict images of things such as human decapitation, animal slaughtering, and disembowelment.  However, there are moments where Elfen Lied is sexual, with nudity and sexual jokes and innuendos.  Other times the episodes can actually be quite depressing and hard to watch.  This wide range of emotions keeps the viewer intrigued and coming back for me.  As the series progresses it becomes difficult to stop watching as the story becomes more clear and more surreal to the viewer.

Elfen Lied accomplishes several things that no other anime can claim: providing a violent anime series while creating a story with characters that people can actually care about and feel for.  Not just another violent anime that goes nowhere, Elfen Lied has a story to tell, and it's a story that any anime fan should listen to.",1326844800,13,2849,4.7693877551020405
4852853,5,B005OK0YU2,"Finally, a decently priced Complete Collection of Elfen Lied...

This is a show that I would consider a ""core show"" of anime. IE: it is not unreasonable to say that any fan over the age of 18 (and most fans under it) need to have this show under their belt. It is almost common ground for all fans of anime. The beauty will astound you, the gore and themes will shock you, and, at the very end, Elfen Lied will leave you in awe.

Now then, onto the actual collection.

This set comes in 3 disks, having all 13 episodes of the show (and unfortunately not the OVA) all wrapped in a nice little case! No special features with this set, which is a bit disappointing, but not unexpected.

All in all, very happy with it. It could be better of course, but for this price I won't complain. I'm going to give the rating based on the show itself, and I give it a big 5 stars simply because I can't give it a 4 and a half. There are a few things that could be better about the series, but there aren't any things I would call ""glaring problems"".

4852854,1,B005OK0YU2,"I saw Elfen Lied in May of 2008, thinking it would be a masterpiece (given the large amounts of gushing reviews), but what I got was an anime so awful, I was nearly turned off the entire genre because of it. Fortunately, AD Police and the works of Satoshi Kon roped me back in. What disgusts me more than Elfen Lied are the legions of imbeciles that are fellating this dreck to death because after you read my review, you'll know that these people aren't really bright.

Lots of people will tell you this is a masterpiece in anime but they're DEAD WRONG. I'm not focusing on the well known over abundance of violence and nudity, I'm focusing on how everything is contrived beyond the point of there being any shred of plausibility or coherency. I will provide examples as of why.

The plot is that there's a mutated race of humans called the Diclonious, which are mostly girls that have horns that look like cat ears and invisible arms called vectors that can tear apart anything. Their goal is to wipe out humanity, many of them are studied in a research facility in Japan. One of them named Lucy breaks out of her cell and begins killing people left and right. A sniper nearly kills her but only winds up shattering her helmet and causing her to plummet hundreds of feet into the sea. Kouta and Yuka find her naked on the beach and decide to take her home. The research facility wants her back and sends assassins, the army, and other Diclonious to get her back or kill her.

CHARACTERS:

The characters have no semblance to reality whatsoever. Aside from the fact that Kohta and Yuka take in a naked mentally ill girl without telling anyone, there's other examples of this problem. Why is it that when Kohta finds out that Lucy killed his little sister and dad, he doesn't show any resentment towards Lucy? I'm not expecting Kohta to go all ""Rambo"" on Lucy (thought that could have been a little satisfying), but wouldn't be a little more realistic if he at least verbally blasted her in a relatively passionate manner? Also, why is it that Mayu doesn't become a severe pessimist after being molested by her stepdad and having to live off her pet dog's food? The characters aren't deep, either; they're all shallow stereotypes. Kohta is the clich mousy male character who finds himself surrounded by women, Yuka and Lucy/Nuy are among the several women feuding each other for Kohta's attention, and Lucy has a split personality; when haven't we seen this stuff before? The more snob-ish type of EL fan will over analyze this clich and try to justify its existence by comparing it to the concepts of C.G. Jung or Freud in an attempt to make this look deeper than it really is, but it's nothing more than ripping off Tenchi Muyo or Love Hina. Lucy's backstory about how she became a naked meatgrinder isn't the least bit impressive. Oh look, she was bullied as a kid and they even killed her dog, how sad!! Didn't every nu-metal band in existence abuse the whole ""I'm a victim, I hate the world!!"" theme to death in their faux-aggressive music? Another thing is that we're supposed to see Nana as some sort of tragic figure since she's constantly getting torn up and pummeled but I think it's just her fault since she's so unbelievably passive.

CARELESS MIXING OF GENRES:

Elfen Lied carelessly mixes genres of anime and while the legions of shallow people hailing this as the greatest thing ever see that as original, rational people like myself are absolutely disgusted by it. Look, certain genres don't go together. Seeing cheap pornographic grindhouse action in one moment and seeing sappy harem comedy the next just doesn't work.

PLOT-HOLES, CONTRADICTING THEMES, BAD ENDING, AND BAD CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT:

Right from the beginning, Elfen Lied is asking you to leave your brain at the door prior to watching it. Lucy escapes the research facility as is knocked unconscious by a sniper's bullet striking her helmet and forcing her to fall into the ocean. Aside from not dying on impact from the water (she fell hundreds of feet), how does she not break any bones and not drown? She's unconscious, she can't swim, so how does she survive being in the water?!! Apparently, EL's theme is that humanity is monstrous to beings it sees as ""inhuman,"" which is supposed to explain the scientists torturing and killing the Dicloniuses. I wouldn't have a problem with that if the message didn't contradict itself. The Diconiuses kill people on instinct and the head of the company doing these experiments, who turns out to be a Diclonius, WANTS them to kill of humanity. Also, the fact that this guy is a Diclonius doesn't make sense since he's in charge of this company and therefore in charge of the torturing and killing of his own species. If I cared about anyone in EL (I don't), I'd want to see the Diclonius race get exterminated because the writers screwed up their ""message"" that badly. EL leaves a lot of things unexplained since it not only reveals that the company head is a Diclonius towards the end, nothing is fleshed out about that afterwards. It also has the worst ending I've ever seen in film since NOTHING is explained. I don't mind ""spoiling"" it for those who haven't seen this abomination since it leaves you thinking that Lucy MIGHT have been killed (of course, they take the pretentious route by not showing it to leave you guessing) but Kohta comes to open the front gate of his house with a shadow on it and once he reaches for the handle, it ends. WORST ENDING EVER. We're introduced to Lucy as seeing her as a beast, but they later change her a little to make her sympathetic to audiences. Apparently, seeing Lucy as Nyu is supposed to make me like her, they failed miserably. All Nyu does is shamble around naked and say ""Nyu"" as she breaks things, this is supposed to make me overlook her insatiable blood thirst?!! It's like they can't decide if they want me to see Lucy as a monster or an infantile bimbo; either way, she's an abhorent character. There's a lot of ""deus ex machina"" moments that really kill off any plausibility this might have had like when Bando and his comrade corner Nyu and RIGHT before they kill her, she turns to Lucy and attacks. The writers for Elfen Lied were either a bunch of monkeys with Microsoft Word or a bunch of lobotomized people that are equivalent to said monkeys.

APPEARANCE:

I hate the way everything looks in Elfen Lied, especially the character designs. Since EL is extremely violent and pornographic, the fact that the characters look like they were plucked right out of Love Hina or Chobits (they have a ""cute"" look) will make any rational person grasp their skulls with both hands and groan continuously out of anger. In and of themselves, the overbearing saccharine appearance of those girls with their freakishly big eyes makes me want to vomit my guts out. Mixing ""cute"" with gratuitous violence and nudity is like using battery acid as a condiment for the Classic Italian sandwich at Quiznos. Yeah, it's different, but it doesn't mean it's good. The animation and artwork looks like it was made with digital imaging and animation programs, giving it a really stale look (like all other anime nowadays). So not even the artwork and animation has any charm to it. I really hate the Diclonius designs since they're basically the stereotypical ""catgirl"" thing infesting anime nowadays.

VIOLENCE, NUDITY, AND INCEST:

None of the above things offend me whatsoever since I'm not a stranger to either. However, these things look like they were shoved in EL to attract fickle anime fans (which it unfortunately has) and to offend anyone who is a ""prude."" These also aren't really that offensive taken by themselves since they're used so numerously that they no longer have any provocative value to them after about 20 minutes of exposure. For those of you who are claiming that the constant use of these three things is somehow ""extreme,"" go watch Doomed Megalopolis for an excellent horror anime that utilized violence, nudity, and incest to make the overall experience unnerving rather than tedious.

SOUNDTRACK:

It's time to focus on the most overrated anime song ever, ""Lilium."" Everyone thinks this is such a strong and emotional song, but it's a joke. It's nothing more than extremely boring symphonic music with female vocals and Latin lyrics to make Elfen Lied look ""deep"" and ""artistic."" Take a look at Kenji Kawai's dark ambient tracks found on the first Ghost in the Shell soundtrack or that for Grave of the Fireflies for truly chilling and emotional anime music. Also, this type of music fits NOWHERE in this Love Hina-style dramedy guised as Hostel. I want to find the music crew responsible for composing this junk and beat them for creating such a loathsome song that every anime n00b is fellating until their teeth rot away. Not only does ""Lilium"" have such a non-existent effect on me, these monkeys with Microsoft Word thought it would be great to put a freakin' J-pop song at the end of each episode, which further nullifies any provocative effect the over abundant violence and nudity might have had in this POS.

SYMBOLISM:

When symbolism is incorporated into a movie or series properly, it enhances the viewing experience. With EL, however, the symbolism is carelessly thrown in to make it look ""deep"" and ""intellectual."" For one, the clock symbol in EL didn't do anything to make this any better. ""Oh look, the broken clock represents Kohta's broken past and at the end it's fixed, and so is he!! How genius!!"" Give me a break. While not really symbolism, I find the use of German names in the series's name and of the names of the episodes to be loathsomely pretentious, and I don't care that this is named after a German poem.

ABUSE OF GUSTAV KLIMT'S ARTWORK:

The use of Gustav Klimt's paintings on the opening credits is more examples of self-awarding pretentiousness since Klimt's artwork is splendid and when saccharine-looking anime girls are thrown into his paintings, it's a severe clash in artistic styles and looks just plain silly. If Klimt was alive to see this happen, he'd be highly revolted by this bastardization. While the more snobby Elfen Sheep will automatically praise this move on behalf of the anime simply for referencing a 20th century painter, it's just one of the many, many fronts used to cover up the ultimate lack of coherent plot structure, lack of interesting characters, lacking a consistent message, and lack of an ending that ties up at least some of the loose ends. You know, the qualities that really matter when making any sort of show or movie. Contrary to what the Elfen Lied fans convince themselves to think, referencing 20th century painters isn't enough to make anything good. You need those basic principles I mentioned above because those are universal in making any movie or TV show worthwhile. Without those, you can reference Gustav Klimt and old German poems all you want and it won't change the fact that the final product is a horribly, horribly jumbled mess. This is like trying to make a giant pile of elephant excrement appetizing by covering it with butter cream frosting, sprinkles, and candles then selling it to an unsuspecting customer as a birthday cake.

SUMMARY:

Elfen Lied can be seen in several abhorent ways. It can be seen as an anime that wants to have its cake and eat it too. It wants to be seen as ""deep"" and ""smart"" but at the same time wants to appeal to a bunch of hair-brained anime fans who can't get enough of harem comedy anime. It also somehow achieved the impossible by appealing to every anime-interested demographic out there, which wouldn't happen in a rational-thinking world. It's like the writers said to their staff ""Hey, let's make an anime that absolutely loathsome but will include every anime clich and fetish that will draw in the furries, perverts, action fans, slasher fans, and harem fans!! This will catch like wildfire!!"" Sadly, it has done just that. I can't find any newer anime fan who hasn't heard of this abomination. Lynn Okamoto (original author) and Mamoru Kanbe (made the anime) are some of the worst scum on the planet for making Elfen Lied. They come off as horribly, horribly self-indulgent people who roll around in their own filth and because they think they created something ""unique"" and ""deep,"" they're immune to any sort of criticism. They aren't immune to criticism and the more they receive, the better.

FINAL WORD:

For those who haven't seen it and will heed my advice and those who previously liked it and had ""second thoughts"" after reading my review, kudos to you; it shows that people can still think properly. If you want a truly heart-wrenching anime, watch Grave of the Fireflies.  I'll stick to MUCH, MUCH superior anime like Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Armitage III (OVA), Paprika, Perfect Blue, Neo Tokyo, Memories, Doomed Megalopolis, and AD Police (original OVA) for adult anime that actually functions properly. Finally, if I get a terminal disease, I'll spend my remaining days on Earth finding Lynn Okamoto and Mamoru Kanbe and horribly quelling their lives with a variety of heavy mining equipment and heavy duty power tools which would make the fate of DJ in Event Horizon look like child's play in comparison.",1322352000,37,13248,4.767989533362408

There are so many fine details that the storywriter and director actually paid attention to that makes this series so wonderful, so sublime. The story is the star, but the details make this story shine like a polished diamond. The music, the artwork, the character development, the roller coaster ride of violence and tenderness - all are carefully thought out and shown with care. This is no anime for the faint of heart. There are scenes that are simply so horrifying and gut wrenching that it may leave an indelible impression that you can't get rid of. This is true of both the violence of the ""monsters"", as well as the evil in the hearts of men. At times in the story, you will understand the violence, even expect it- maybe even want it. However, be prepared for what happens to the ""innocents"" and the innocence. Like I said, this is not for the faint of heart.",1321056000,95,915,4.485029940119761

However I am annoyed with this packaging. Rather then it having a middle flap and whatnot, and each disc going in its own separate holder- they just stack all three discs on top of one another. I assume this is the legit copy as it was ordered for me through amazon for Christmas. It is very disappointing to realize that the S.A.V.E packs of anime have MUCH better packaging, safer too for the discs, then this overpriced pack. While it does have the whole series on three discs, it's simply horribly packaged. Especially with an over-sized case like this, where there is a sheet of foam on the right hand side. Hint- if you need foam on one side of the case to prevent damage, you need to use a different design on it. Also, there was no information packet or anything in it. Just discs and foam. For the price asked... I just don't know. If I can I'm going to buy jewel cases for the dvds, as I am seriously worried that they will become damaged in this flawed package. While I am stressing this, this is a GOOD SERIES! I am not saying that it isn't, just that for the price paid this needs to come in a safer package for the DVDs.

There are parts of this anime that are extremely haunting and rather disturbing, but this is just my personal opinion. Just be prepared when you watch it, and I'd also recommend not watching it around children. That being said, it's graphic, but not comically graphic (more along the feel of sin city rather than kill bill) the drawing is nice and smooth. Although it did seem to me like some parts of it they were focusing making it more and more twisted rather than character development, but it could be that it was hard for me to focus on the character development with everything else going on.",1292284800,2,765,4.510791366906475

No matter how many times I watch it, the ending makes me cry. This is part of why I love it.

I watched it for the first time a few years ago, and it instantly became my favorite anime.

The emotions one gets when watching this are everything from love, friendship, and remorse to hate, revenge, and betrayal.

The only thing that might get some people is the violence and nudity, however I feel that these two factors were essential in making it the great anime that it is. The reason for the casual nudity is that the artist is portraying things the way they are. Without the nudity and violence, it wouldn't strike as strong emotions, and overall would seem fake and not as good of a series.

When it comes to this anime series, this one has it all. There were very little things that I didn't like in this series. I will tell you a little about the story line in the next paragraph.

It starts out with Lucy who is a mutant( She has invisible arms that can kill people and horn like bones sticking out of her head) escaping the facility that had trapped and kept her for experiments. Then the story shoots over to the other main character Kouta. He just got off the train and is heading to his new home that his relatives are letting him use while he is in college. On the way there him and his cousin pick up Lucy(who cant remember anything at all) and has developed a language problem. Eventually they go through all sorts of trouble trying to keep Lucy a secret and try to figure out where she came from. She sometimes returns to her normal self though, but only for short periods of time. The crazy part is that Kouta has memory loss as well and him and Lucy met in the past. I really can't tell you anymore.

This series takes you on an emotional rollercoaster. You will experience emotions like love(indirectly if that makes sense), hate, happiness and sorrow. I would have easily have paid ten times more for this series if I had to. This is one of the best series I have seen(I have viewed around fifty) and has one of the best sound tracks as well. The characters in this series are great and even the characters with the smallest roller play a major part.

The nudity is sometimes cool, sometimes gratuitous, sometimes boring, sometimes very disturbing.  Likewise the violence, the social themes, etc.  This is a towering example of ""anime ain't cartoons""- no child should be allowed to watch this.  Child abuse, animal torture, disabling mental illness, random nightmarish murders.
But it all works and it is very stirring and impressive.

I eventually, after the third time watching it became adept at mastering the video controls and a greater understanding of the anime. The world of humans became callous and mean spirited and nature fought back by producing a new species whose purpose was to destroy the human race and take over. The new species however had the same flaws as the humans and the conflict between humans and the new species resulted in a twisted ending short of providing a clear understanding.

4852875,2,B005OK0YU2,"No, cousin, I don't want to fondle your breast.

That pretty much sums up my feelings for this show right there. Elfen Lied, despite what so many sappy, shallow people would tell you, is nowhere NEAR a masterpiece; I wouldn't even go so far as to call it good. It is, for all intents and purposes, a woefully inadequate attempt at a drama which falls far short of tragedy greats in anime such as Grave of the Fireflies (2-Disc Collector's Edition), Kino's Journey - The Complete Collection, Now and Then, Here and There (Complete Collector's Boxed Set), and yes Neon Genesis Evangelion: Platinum Collection. It is an ant amongst giants. Fans of the series will point to the many instances of drama and ""tear jerking moments"" as proof that there is substance of any kind to be found here, but they would be wrong. Instead of coming off as depressing, the more appalling moments in this show come across as more disgusting than anything else. Whereas moments in shows like ""Now and Then, Here and There"" and EVA showed tragedy in ways which were designed to not only depress its viewers but also leave them with ""heartbreaking fondness;"" Elfen Lied simply wants to gross you out as much as humanly possible.

Just about every moment of this show is saturated with fan service almost to the point, no, take that back, TO the point of absurdity. Some fan service here and there is okay, I don't really like it but its fine, but THIS MUCH!? How many times do I have to see Lucy (or Nyu, which is her alter ego) shamble around on screen wearing nothing but socks? How many times must I have to see Mayu (who's 13 BTW) take a bath with Nanna (who is also 13)? Nothing makes you feel like a pervert more than watching a couple 13 year olds take a bath together for ten minutes. Am I supposed to watch or should I look away?

The show starts off with a ten minute bloodbath as a naked Lucy strolls though the hulls of a heavenly protected government research lab killing literally hundreds of well armed soldiers and guards (and one very unfortunate, very clumsy secretary). She manages to escape but is shot in the head, which then causes her to lose her memory. Washing up on a nearby beach the next morning (naked, as always) she is taken in by a pair of well meaning college students (who only go to class once during the series; I guess class attendance isn't really a top priority in Japan), Kohta and Yuka. Now let's play a little game; you see a naked, clearly mentally ill girl wash up on the beach without the ability to speak. Do you...
A) Call the police.
B) Give her some food and cloths and THEN call the police. Or would you...
C) Take said naked girl home with you and NOT tell anyone.

If you said A or B then TADA! You're a normal person. If you said C then you are a character in Elfen Lied. YEAH! I know anime isn't a genre where characters always act and talk like real people, but COME ON! Who wouldn't call the police if they found a naked mentally ill girl on the beach? (Other than perverts, that is). Is it too much to expect these characters to act at least somewhat realistically?

And that's pretty much the problem with this show from beginning to end; the characters don't act like real people. The love triangle that's started up between Nyu (Lucy), Kohta, and Yuka, I guess to add a second layer of ""depth"" to the story (you know, give it something other than the whole naked girls killing lots and lots of people) comes off as more of a soap opera than anything else. What person actually asks their first cousin to fondle their breast? YUCK! Every time Kohta does anything with another girl (oftentimes just helping them out) Yuka gets jealous, calls him a jerk, maybe slaps him around, and then runs off crying. Now I can sympathize to a point, but girl GET OVER YOURSELF! It isn't the end of the world if your first cousin isn't romantically interested in you.

But it isn't only that, characters who really are likable and DO have interesting back stories (Mayu for instance) are introduced, and then almost ignored. Mayu had possibly one of the saddest back stories in the whole show, and yet her past was never fleshed out or used to propel the story. I would have loved to see her run into her step father in the streets someday, or maybe she, with the help of her friends, could have tried to confront him. Although the creators of this show get props for attempting such an ambitious story, they get no credit for execution as the whole thing is more disgusting then sad and is not elaborated on during the course of the series. Mayu serves as a plot device for the rest of the series, and it is very unfortunate for the series as a whole because instead they decide to focus on Khota and Yuka who are, quite frankly, uninteresting and boring.

So now for some good stuff. The little Diclonius (the race of horned mutants of which Lucy [or Nye], and Nanna are a part) girls are SO adorable that it was almost impossible to find any fault in them, even when they went on bloody rampages and killed dozens of innocent people. All they had to do was look at the screen with those giant red eyes of theirs and cry a little bit and my heart would break for them. Who knew such sadistic killers could be so cute? Despite my trashing the linier story of this show, the back story for Lucy was actually quite stunning (if a little too convenient). The part with her dog was SO depressing I was tempted to give this show more than two stars, but alas the ending didn't give it any hope of such a high rating. My favorite part, by far, is when Lucy goes to the zoo as a child and is amazed by the size of the elephants and giraffes.
""Oh, it's so big, how did it get so big?"" (that's what she said) Elephant trumpet ""whow, amazing!"" (Just imagine this in the cutest little girl voice possible).
It reminded me so much of my own childhood, going to the Omaha Zoo (one of the biggest in the country BTW) and begging my parents to let me see the elephants because they were my favorite.

Yes, I'm a sucker when it comes to little girls suffering; probably explains why my favorite shows are ""Now and Then, Here and There"" and ""Gunslinger Girl"", and if Elfen Lied had focused on this back story instead of the inane love triangle/government conspiracy nonsense it could have very well been a masterpiece. As is, with only a few episodes dedicated to back story, the show could not stand the weight of its own self importance. Nanna was also a pretty interesting character, though at the very end of the show she did get a bit annoying.

The animation for this show was actually quite good; better in fact then most anime I've seen. The backgrounds were quite stunning in their detail and the character designs were oh so cute. The music was pretty plain, although the main theme wasn't bad at all, if a little less impressive then other shows. It's the opening and ending that get on my nerves. More naked girls shuffling around while the camera zooms in on their breast. Don't believe me? It's true. The ending is some Japanese rock song with a still picture of a naked Lucy while the camera slowly zoom in on her left breast. What kind of person does it take to watch that all the way through? I wonder... maybe the same kind of person it takes to give this show a five star review.

So if you're looking for tragedy, look elsewhere at the shows I've already mentioned. Elfen Lied is nothing special, that is unless you're looking for underage girls taking baths together, in which case I'd suggest you turn yourself in to your local authorities and get immediate psychiatric help.

4852879,5,B005OK0YU2,"Elfen Lied has its fair share of gratuitous nudity.

Elfen Lied contains lots of gratuitous violence.

Elfen Lied has one of the most gripping, emotional storylines I've ever experienced in any medium. I love this series.

I think this is one of those things that is best to just watch without knowing anything about it before hand. I had no idea what the hell it was about before my friend brought it over, indicating only that it was ""disturbing"" and he'd only seen the first few episodes but he thought it might be all right to watch it togther. Because I knew nothing about it, I was surprised every step of the way - I think that is a crucial part of truly experiencing a story that is nearly lost in our age of overly detailed plot summaries, dust jackets, and reviews that don't seem to pay any respect to the route the author intended you to take. However, if you prefer knowing most of the details beforehand, you can look at the other reviews as well.

But anyway, without being too specific, the violence and nudity are integral to the story, accentuating themes of anger and tragedy against youth and innocence, and playing a huge role in character development. Yes, some of it is just for the sake of violence and nudity, but again they're part of the core of the story and it wouldn't have the same impact or depth without them. The nudity gets fanservicey but it's also to be a relief between the darker elements of the story. Even if these aspects sound off-putting to you, at least try to *tolerate* them - I think you'll find it was worth it.

Anyway, once again I found the story very powerful and compelling - it unravels perfectly, strengthened by an excellent musical score. The story is what elevates this. Maybe in the end I'm just a sap, but I hope you like it too.",1260230400,3,1790,4.461773700305811
4852880,5,B005OK0YU2,"An experiment by the name of Lucy who is a beautiful but powerful mutant girl with two cat ear-like horns on her head was being conducted. She is a perfect being with psychic/telekinetic powers that can create multiple invisible tentacle-like arms that can destroy things and people whenever she is mad. She is programmed on destroying humans to have her kind to take over the human race but when she escapes to a Japanese city, she gets an alter ego named Nyu whom is friendly yet kind as she befriends with a man named Kota and has new friends. But the labs are still on the look for her as they created another assassin just like Lucy only smarter as they are hellbent on killing her but can Nyu keep her secrets to herself and even change her ways?

Ultraviolent, sexy and powerful Sci-fi horror anime drama series that is one of the best recent anime shows ever made. It's based off a Manga and this is quite a show that goes for the jugular and never lets go. It offers beautiful girls like Lucy whom gets naked often, a good storyline and lots of action with gory graphic violence like heads blowing off, eyeball gouging and more. There's also some hard subject matter like childhood rape (Not shown by the way but almost there), animal abuse like a puppy, child murder and that kind of thing that might be too much for some people but for those who are brave enough. There is some humor and of course sadness at times, this is a must see for animation fans but not for the weak of stomach or heart.

This DVD contains both Japanese language with subtitles and English Dub with no extras except previews of other ADV anime.

8481355,1,B005OK0YU2,"This disc set is advertised as ""Dvd"" or ""Blu-Ray"" or ""Multi-Format""!

I ordered the ""Multi-Format"" ($19.32) but received the ""Blu-Ray"" ONLY disc.

This is not a low rating for the movie but for the seller because the (more expensive) Blu-Ray disc will not play on my Sony DVP-SR500H HDMI/CD/DVD Player.  I'd send it back through Amazon but soon I will probably buy a Blu-Ray disc player anyway.",1525132800,,394,4.850746268656716
