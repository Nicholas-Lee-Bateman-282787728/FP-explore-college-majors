1876763,1,B000092Q40,"Another gay theme film I watched holding my finger on ""forward"" button. Of course it is an american production. I write ""of course"" because I have never seen movies with gay issues so bad as those made in US (WITH ONLY A FEW DECENT EXCEPTIONS).
""Mr Smith gets..."" is boring. The director tried too much to shoot...yeah, what kind of movie is this btw. A thriller? A drama?
The whole enterprise is amatourish. Acting, pictures, script...

1876765,4,B000092Q40,"Those viewers used to (and who enjoy) the sub-prime stuff like Mulligans or similar will have a hard time with this title. It's subtle: look to Rod Steiger's The Pornbroker and you'll see where I'm coming from. It's not jusy=t the story that engages with this, although I was on the seat edge for the climax, it's the way the film-maker takes us into the gritty, grimy underbelly of not only the hustler community but organised crime and of the not so pretty bits of New York.

This is a closed, smouldering title with scenes set up as well as or better than Mystery Train and a score to match. Don't buy this for the (essentially irrevalent, but engaging, hustler story) buy this beacuse it's a visual feast.",1291420800,2,709,4.5390625
1876766,2,B000092Q40,"""Mr. Smith Gets A Hustler"" is one of those gay-themed films that frequently plays to GLBT film festivals and leaves audiences with a big ""What?"" at the end.  Well acted, directed, and filmed the problem doesn't lie with what's happening on-screen, but the predictable formulaic script and its inconclusive ending.  Populated with characters that aren't quite fully-fleshed it's hard to feel any connection or empathy for the characters that come across as two dimensional.  Hustlers and Pimps are portrayed as money-hungry and profoundly amoral.  The mysterious Mr. Smith reveals perhaps the most of any character in the movie; a former bank vice-president on-the-run after bilking a customer out of money.  He's in New York to try and reconcile with his son, Bobby Blue, by his estranged lover, only Bobby has no idea that Smith is his father.  His discovers the secret of Mr. Smith's true identity in a way that screams predictability and the film unfolds as an equally shady character tries to track down Smith via the hustlers, although its never clear why.  Mr. Smith's pursuer finally entices Bobby Blue up to his hotel suite to get the goods on Smith only to have Bobby's pimp spare him by ratting out where Smith is.  Another hustler, Abe, comes to save Bobby only after Smith's pursuer has left to get Smith.  Rather than trying to save Mr. Smith from his pursuer Bobby and Abe instead commiserate about what to do.  The following day Bobby coaxes a hotel staffer to let him into Smith's suite only to find it emptied, neat, and tidy.  The film ends with Bobby getting into a taxi going who knows where; the end!  Yeah. No indication of what happened to Smith, no insight into why Bobby wouldn't try and save Smith, no reflection on what Bobby is feeling other than his facial expressions as the credits roll.  My hunch is he doesn't really care about Smith, life goes on.  The sound quality is terrible...very muddled and mixed very low; I had to max out the volume of it on my DVD player and STILL could barely hear the dialog.

""Mr. Smith"" is emblematic of the current rash of gay-themed films without neat tidy endings that not only leave far too much to the viewer's imagination (not necessarily a bad thing), but that fail to engage the viewer.  You feel no connection or interest to the characters and as a result none to the film.  The theme here is that life is brutal, nasty, and short...if you care about people you'll only get your feelings hurt.  Trapped in the Me-First zeitgeist of the 1990s it reveals nothing about the characters and there really is no moral to the story other than to look out for yourself and your own interests; how depressing.",1149379200,9,2673,4.711827956989247
1876767,1,B000092Q40,The only thing that might be good about this film is its cover art work. Even that leaves a lot to be desired. I wish I hadn't wasted the time watching it. I would have given it negative stars but it wasn't an option.,1107907200,5,217,3.9545454545454546
1876768,1,B000092Q40,"Having trouble getting to sleep? Get this movie with its bad acting, bad music, bad lighting, bad sound, and a restaurant that never has any customers, and you'll be out cold before the second act.

The only reason I made it through this snorer is that I was waiting for the twist. The relationship between Mr Smith and his hustler is so obvious that I figured it must be a setup. Well, it's just exactly what you think it is, so there's no need to wait around.",1101600000,3,461,4.2988505747126435
1876769,1,B000092Q40,"The title of this DVD made me laugh, and when I laughed I decided to take a chance.  Fortunately, playing Russian Roulette with DVDs isn't as dangerous as playing it with guns, because if it were MR. SMITH GETS A HUSTLER would have killed me dead.
MR. SMITH is based on a way-off-Broadway play by writer Matt Swan, who appears to have survived the opening night audience at least long enough to adapt his play into an incredible barrel of tripe for the screen.  A handsome young male prostitute named Bobby (Alex Feldman) supports his single mother's alcoholism by working for a semi-evil pimp out of the most boring looking bar you can imagine--and he meets an older and distinguished looking man named ""Mr. Smith"" (Larry Pine.)  Pretty soon the two are up in Mr. Smith's hotel room, but much to Bobby's surprise the client doesn't want do anything but talk about how Bobby's such a nice kid.  Gee! What's going on?
Well, I'll tell you what's going on: a total waste of your time.  The two leads aren't bad, really.  Larry Pine seems to be a somewhat talented actor, and Alex Feldman is at least passable. But... the rest of the cast ranges from dismissible to flatly inept. Swan's script is atrocious, Joe Labisi's idea of cinematography is wannabe-arty angles that were passe fifty years ago, and Ian McCrudden's direction consists of putting the actors in front of the camera and hoping for the best.
Frankly, if I had been involved in this movie, I wouldn't admit it, much less put it on my resume.  Don't give up your day jobs, people. Dire to the nth degree!

7988509,3,B000092Q40,"Certainly there is a Mr. Smith, and certainly theres a Hustler, but it is as far as it goes while talking about sex. This is not a romantic comedy, or a comedy as one could expect. Its a drama with dark tones because of the photography and mood of most personages. Once set this path, it can be most times agreeable for the viewer. The forces go swiftly on a drama where gay elements are not the sole reason for movement, but are greatly present.
The principal actors play pretty well. Larry Pine is a classy Mr. Smith, and Alex Feldman a handsome face and not that built up body Bobbie. The supporting cast plays fine. Its of particular interest the evolution in Bobbies character, as he lingers through the film from a mindless hustler to a more sensitive person, who can respond to the dilemmas proposed by the film.
