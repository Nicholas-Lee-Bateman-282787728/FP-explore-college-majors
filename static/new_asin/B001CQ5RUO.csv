3515512,5,B001CQ5RUO,I purchased this movie as a present for my husband.  He enjoys the films of this genre.  He recommends this movie highly.,1379635200,,121,4.454545454545454
3515513,2,B001CQ5RUO,"This particular item was purchased because my son had heard that it was an exceptional movie from a lady friend.  He told me it was a so so movie.  Inever saw it myself, so I'll take his word on it.",1345593600,,198,3.925
3515514,5,B001CQ5RUO,This is up there with American me and blood in blood out! Bad ass homeboys kicking ass in the streets of the barrio. With some bad ass music too! probably the best soundtrack to come out of chicano and black rap. Thumbs up yo!,1322438400,,226,4.159090909090909
3515515,1,B001CQ5RUO,"Talk about some terribleness!!!  This was bad acting, with a predictable plot, and actors with bad timing.  Lines that should have been said with passion were said deadpan.  These ""actors"" may have been reading from a monitor or lines written on their arms.  I love seeing actors of color getting paid and lengthening their resumes.  However, this was just bad.  This could have been a strong meditation about tough choices, but the main character chooses the wrong action immediately.  I know that the camera is supposed to add ten pounds, but some viewers might not be able to get past the chubbiness of the actors.  This was just as bad as ""The Dope Game,"" a predecessor.  This comes nowhere close to the quality of ""American Me"" or ""The Street King.""  The work had fake gunshots, fake blood droplets, and fake dying.  I hope the rap soundtrack does help the musical careers of its contributors.  Wearing my militant cap, I encourage films with Latino themes to have Spanish language subtitles in order to expand its audience, but this DVD lacks that feature.  You have been warned, readers!",1262736000,,1094,4.817204301075269
