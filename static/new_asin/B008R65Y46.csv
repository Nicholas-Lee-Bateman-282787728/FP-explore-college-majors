5178812,5,B008R65Y46,"3 good movies for the price of 1! I think I paid under $15 for these blu-rays. The three movies come in one case, with 3 separate discs. Good buy if you can get if for cheap!",1386028800,,174,3.72972972972973

5178814,5,B008R65Y46,I am rating this 5 stars based on the price for the movies. Everyone likes something different so I won't get into reviewing the movies. Came when it was supposed to and for three movies its a steal.,1369699200,,199,4.2631578947368425
5178815,5,B008R65Y46,GREAT combo pack! All the movies on this 3-pack are great. I had seen 2 of the 3 (not Green Zone) and was totally worth the proce even for just 2 great films. After watching Green Zone I am even MORE pleased with this purchase. AWESOME gift for a guy.,1363046400,5,251,4.04
5178816,3,B008R65Y46,Green zone bluray came with hiccup. While you watch the movie it skips or video bounces in a way that it's not normal,1360195200,,117,4.130434782608695
5178817,5,B008R65Y46,"All 3 movies are just different enough to keep you watching.  Matt Damon is always good, Jamie Foxx is surprising and Jake Gyllenhal is getting better in action movies.",1359504000,,168,4.793103448275862

5178823,4,B008R65Y46,"This isn't really a review, but as I found the product description lacking, I decided to compile this list of helpful information below. I hope this will be useful for prospective buyers to know what they're getting:

JARHEAD (2005): 125 minutes - Director: Sam Mendes - Starring: Jake Gylenhaal, Peter Sarsgaard, Jamie Foxx - Genre: War, drama - Plot: Based on former Marine Anthony Swofford's best-selling 2003 book about his pre-Desert Storm experiences in Saudi Arabia and about his experiences fighting in Kuwait. R

THE KINGDOM (2007): 110 minutes - Director: Peter Berg - Starring: Jamie Foxx, Chris Cooper, Jennifer Garner - Genre: Action, war - Plot: A team of U.S. government agents is sent to investigate the bombing of an American facility in the Middle East. R

GREEN ZONE (2010): 115 minutes - Director: Peter Greengrass - Starring: Matt Damon, Jason Isaacs - Genre: War, drama - Plot: Discovering covert and faulty intelligence causes a U.S. Army officer to go rogue as he hunts for Weapons of Mass Destruction in an unstable region. R

Now let's crunch some numbers. This collection costs $13.22, and contains 3 films. To find the value of the individual film you're getting, we divide the price by the number of films to get an individual price of $4.40 per film, a steal for this well-crafted and action-packed set of Iraqi war films! I hope this information is useful to you. Cheers!",1418947200,4,1402,4.90295358649789

5178825,5,B008R65Y46,"i haven't received the package yet, but the one reason i bought this is because of Jarhead. but the other thing that made me buy this instead of just the single disc Jarhead is because it was only $2 more and 2 more movies that come with it. for the price this is an amazing deal!",1413849600,,280,4.017857142857143
