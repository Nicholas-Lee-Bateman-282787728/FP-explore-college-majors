8192968,5,B000PQLY5Y,Everything that boys who want to learn how to wrestle may be found is this splendid step by step series.

8192969,5,B000PQLY5Y,Mills has produced an excellent DVD series; Youth Wrestling by the numbers 1 2 3.  The filming is well done and easy for youth wrestlers to pick up the skill being taught.  It's like have Coach Mills in the room with you.  Young wrestlers can follow the teaching because Coach Mills keeps the teaching focused on the skills being taught.  I recommend this series for all youth wrestlers.,1363564800,,387,4.647058823529412
8192970,3,B000PQLY5Y,"This series of 1-2-3 videos is done well, good for beginners and laid out in a very clear matter.  The issue is that they are way too short.  20 or so clips, most are around 1 minute with 20 seconds of that being a repeat of what was covered the first 40 seconds.",1361232000,,263,3.943396226415094
