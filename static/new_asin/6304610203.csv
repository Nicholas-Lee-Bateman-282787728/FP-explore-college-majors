7875949,5,6304610203,"This is one of the most delightful children's videos I have seen. I enjoyed watching it almost as much as my daughter did (and she's watched it at least 20 times).  The characters, the stories, the lessons and the humor are wonderful and safe for kids to watch.  The magical city under the famous Scottland Loch is very enchanting and fun filled for the 3 children who visit regularly.  I wish there were more of Happy Ness videos and I wish more children's videos/shows were this wholesome and FUN!",974073600,,499,4.584269662921348
