8099978,5,B000CPH9JI,"We have now used this with both our cubsouts and at church with children ages 6 through 12.  It is great and you can pause it to actually practice what they show.  I would recommend the groups are small (4-6 children if younger maybe 8 if they are older ages) and you have at least 2 adults to help supervise the practices.  We plan to show it again next year to refresh everyone on the techniques as well as include any new youth.  My grandson was able to use it about a month ago.  He is 6 and was playing with a 4 1/2 year old friend when someone walked into the front yar.  The  younger child started wandering over to the person while my grandson started screaming at the person to get away and for his friend to come to him and not go to the person.  It was probably a harmless situation per my daughter.  However, the person did back away and my daughter came to find out what the commotion was about.  As our area has had some recent attempted kidnappings with stalkers at a couple schools I feel much more confident that our grandson is well prepared.  I think this out to be mandatory for all the schools in our area and will be discussing this with my grandson's teacher this fall.",1342656000,,1192,4.230088495575221
8099979,5,B000CPH9JI,This is a very well done self defense video that kids will relate to and remember.  The instructors teaching the moves relate as a parent would treating the children with respect.  The children pick up the instructions very well and gain confidence as they go along.  The defense moves are simple but effective both for kids and adults.  Highly recommended for anyone!  I hope these instructors will produce additional videos - and maybe for adults too!,1333584000,,453,4.907894736842105
8099980,5,B000CPH9JI,"This video is excellent.  It not only details defense techniques that are easy for the smallest child to use, it also illustrates how easy it is for a stranger to seem legitimate when he may not be.  It is filled with talking points.  The first time we watched it, I paused the video many times to discuss what had been shown and practice techniques.  Nothing in it is presented in a frightening way and it is appropriate for all ages.  I believe it has made my children more aware of their surroundings and critical of what they choose to believe.  We watch it again at least quarterly because I think they take a little more from it each time.  And I don't think it hurts me to see it either.  My children don't seem disappointed at all to see me popping it back in the DVD player.",1328227200,,783,4.27891156462585
8099981,4,B000CPH9JI,"Got it for my kids (who are Karate students) and have loaned it out to the parents of my kids friends.

Get it, and watch it with your kids!",1270425600,,140,3.8275862068965516
8099982,4,B000CPH9JI,"This video was very educational and it had a lot of very good techniques on how a child can defend off an attacker.  There is one thing I would of liked to see more in this book was actual situations where kids put these techniques to use.  They did show some actual situations but I would of liked to see more.  Overall, I would recommend this video to other parents to help there children be safe.",1220313600,,399,4.223684210526316
8099983,4,B000CPH9JI,Great starting point for child self defense.  I paired this with the Safe Side Super Chick series by John Walsh to teach my children how to be smart about their own safety.,1207440000,,172,4.375
8099984,5,B000CPH9JI,"I Am not a target teaches the proper techniches in situations when a stranger is trying to attack or luer you in.  This along with Stranger Safety has taught me and my son, and the babysitters alot.  They use real kids and teach them how to get away and they practice with them.  They also teach what to watch out for.  ""It has facts to keep you safe"" my son just said.  He watches the two several times every day.",1180051200,,414,4.125
8099985,5,B000CPH9JI,"Parents, this is a must have for your collection... our local libraries now have copies of this as well.... why? Because its good---- interaction of adults and children in situations address sfae stance, using awareness, voice, role-play, code words, etc. I've been in eductaion for a decade and this is THE BEST video I've seen for young children-- very reasonably priced as well!",1166227200,6,381,5.063492063492063
