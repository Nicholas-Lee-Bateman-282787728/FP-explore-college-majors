I am a swim instructor/swim school owner and I added many of Rob Mckays ideas. I love his philosophy on fins and how he explains to parents that fins are a tool to help develop a strong straight leg kick, then work with the child without the fins and see the great results in the development of the kick. Great video series! Dolphins 1 and 2 are both worth buying!",1217030400,,472,4.2555555555555555
