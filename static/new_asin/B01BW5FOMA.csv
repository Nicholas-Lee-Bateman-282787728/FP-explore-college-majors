8751696,2,B01BW5FOMA,"For a casual fan there isn't much to get out of this. To start, some of the stories are based on characters and mobile suits you won't have heard of (Red Zeta anyone?), and what's left doesn't really add much to the series you already know. The mobile suits themselves are more of the focus than the characters or plot.

It's not especially pretty to look at and it adds almost nothing to the stories you already know. Spend your money elsewhere.",1524096000,,446,4.439024390243903
8751697,4,B01BW5FOMA,"I enjoyed Gundam Evolve quite a bit, but fair warning to any potential buyers: these are ""shorts"" put out by Sunrise, most of which are only about five or ten minutes, serving as sort of an alternative or unmentioned side-story.  A healthy understanding of the Universal Century timeline is almost a must to enjoy the majority of these stories, with a few side-stories coming in to mix things up.

Spoilers below.

Episode 1 consists of different animated clips from Mobile Suit Gundam with Amuro Ray remembering his battles and those who died.  A neat clip that serves no purpose.

Episode 2 focuses on a training mission Kamille Bidan took part in while he was still the pilot to the Gundam MK2 in the beginning of Zeta Gundam.  This one was one of the better in terms of exploring Kamille and, if you pause the report at the end and have good enough eyesight to make out what's written, can be pretty amusing.

Episode 3 involves the God Gundam and has two characters sparring.  I've never seen or cared about G Gundam, so this episode did nothing for me.

Episode 4 involves a test piloting of the GP03 Dendrobium from 0083, before it's given over to Kou Uraki.  This was one of the better clips to me.

Episode 5 shows a alternative scene between Amuro Ray in the v Gundam attempting to speak to Quess Paraya and deliver an alternative ending to the character.

Episode 6 involves a clip from Gundam 00, but since I've never seen the series, I didn't know anything about it.

Episode 7 is one of the weaker stories involving Wing Zero.  It's very continuity doesn't mesh well with the anime unless one's seen Frozen Teardrop or read the alternative mangas that help explain what leads up to Mariemaia's Uprising.

Episode 8 involves another series (SEED?) that I have never seen, so I have no comment.

Episode 9 brings us to another Zeta sidestory, with three Zeta Gundams being used to fight against a Mobile Armor.  One is Red Snake, piloted by Yurii Ajssah.  Another is White Unicorn, heavily implied to be piloted by Amuro Ray.  The last, Grey Wolf, is Shin Matsunaga.

Episode 10 serves as a side story for Judau in ZZ Gundam, where he's defending a defecting Qubeley.

Episode 11 involves a Ball pilot after A Baoa Qu.  This is probably the more depressing episode in the lot.

Episode 12 concerns Quattro Bajeena in his Rick Dias, who fights a simulation of himself as Char Aznable.

Episode 13 is one of my favorite episodes.  It features a Marasai pilot during AEUG's deployment to Earth against Jaburo in Zeta Gundam.

Episode 14 is a crap SD Gundam short.  Not a fan.

Episode 15 is the last episode, a re-imagination of Challia Bull.

Is it worth buying?  For hardcore fans, especially ones who have a vested interest in the Universal Century and Zeta in particular, sure.  It's decent enough for the $16 it was listed for when I purchased it.  If your on the fence or a more casual Gundam fan, then a resounding 'No!'.  The material would make little sense and there's not enough substance to carry it forward.",1511049600,,3029,4.612359550561798

8751700,3,B01BW5FOMA,Gundam Evolve is a compilation of 15 short films from various Gundam series's. No English dubbing for this release though. Graphics are mostly 3-D variations and mostly look like they came from video game feeds. Although the premise of it was an interesting idea I found it to be a little under whelming. Some of the stories where good but most were round average at best. A little disappointing but still a decent buy for the price if you want something to add to a collection.,1466294400,3,478,4.569767441860465
8751701,5,B01BW5FOMA,"RightStuf continues its Gundam releases with an obscure one this time. Gundam Evolve is a collection of 15 short films that were made to promote the various Gunpla released over the years. These shorts are typically not canon but interesting nonetheless. They usually use computer generated animation as well. Some notable ones are the Zeta Gundam units (that has a cameo from Shin Matsunaga and a name drop for Johnny Ridden!) as well as the Nu Gundam film that changes Quess's story from Char's Counterattack. My favorite is probably the GP03 episode which explains why the Dendrobium's cockpit was an older style in the anime even though it was a new prototype suit and it also briefly cameo's the GP04 Gerbera. Others aren't so great like the first episode that is basically a Mobile Suit Gundam clip show and the Mark II testing episode. Overall not something vital to a Gundam collection but nice to finally have a subbed American release of this. The DVD set itself is very plain as it's just the box and the disc. However, it's more of a budget release anyway.
 It's a nice set to have and, although only subbed, is still interesting.",1465084800,7,1142,4.738693467336684
8751702,3,B01BW5FOMA,"This dvd is for a diehard completest only.  If you are looking to use this dvd as an intro to the Gundam world it will only leave you confused.  each segment is either so abstract and without a storyline that it could have been left out or in some cases just a condensed retelling of episodes.  I was hoping each segment would be done in a similar style to the original series it related to but it was all over CGIed.  Some parts looked like plastic.
I will keep the dvd in my collection but from this point on it will only be gathering dust.",1464912000,2,542,4.133333333333334
8751703,3,B01BW5FOMA,A nice collection of short films that only the most avid gundam fan would thoroughly enjoy.  The films are from across the various gundam universes and timelines so some background knowledge is definitely needed.  Almost all of the shorts use computer generated animation to varying degrees of skill.  These shorts encompass several years between development so the advance of technology can be seen.  It's not a necessary addition to your collection. There also isn't anything inherently bad about it either.  No dub so prepare to read subtitles if you don't know Japanese.,1464220800,5,574,5.195652173913044
