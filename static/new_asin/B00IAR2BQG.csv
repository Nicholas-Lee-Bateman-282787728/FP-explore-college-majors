6255950,5,B00IAR2BQG,"To understand one's mind, you need to be able to ask a question and get answer. Animals can not speak so researchers conduct different tests. Learning cultures and mastering mental time travel has its advantages. To solve new problems it really helps if one can understand cause and effect, think flexibly, apply what one has learned in those situations and plan into the future. Well, that is exactly what animals accomplish in order to survive. No wonder as I go mountain biking, I always notice how curious those crows are regardless what activity they may be involved in. Watching those Corbett in action it seems that they have a better grasp of the past and anticipate future needs much better, a skill so important to survival especially when food is scarce. Very informative, educational and I have to admit, those monkeys were the funniest of all. 180 minutes of fun entertainment that you can watch with your loved ones with curiosity. Bravo.",1398556800,14,952,4.882716049382716

8640499,5,B00IAR2BQG,"Perhaps there is not as great of an intellectual divide been humans and animals as many people believe.  Inside Animal Minds reveals that many mammals and birds posses problem solving abilities.  Crows not only use sticks as tools, but fabricate them into tools.  You'll be amazed how new research shows that animals evaluate situations and truly think like humans.",1519948800,,365,5.1525423728813555
8640500,1,B00IAR2BQG,"I could not stomach the narrators style. He sounded like he was dissecting a VERY long boring piece of David Blane street magic. Very boring. Also, Ive seen trained animals before and the experiments were just plain staged and dumb. Millennials will love this show.",1510099200,,265,4.911111111111111
