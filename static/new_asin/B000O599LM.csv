2789778,5,B000O599LM,I really enjoyed this DVD!  The photography is outstanding and the narration very informative.  A great addition for all the animal lovers and Crocodile Hunter fans.,1186185600,12,165,5.3076923076923075
2789779,5,B000O599LM,"I watched the television program version. I'm not sure if the DVD differs, but the program was great. If you're an ocean loving person it is absolutely worth owning. It is, however, hard to stay emmersed in the content while knowing that Steve Irwin died in the making.",1179878400,,269,4.625
2789780,5,B000O599LM,I liked it a lot but I have been crazy about Aussie animals since I was a kid. I have been to Australia and was lucky to see a few of these animals. I had seen all before on the Crocodile Hunter series. It was nice to see a scientific as well as entertaining show. It was a heart breaker that is was the last time seeing Steve Irwin. I have been watching him for about 10 years. It was like losing a favorite teacher. I was in tears watching this. The program is in a similar format to the vet show Steve Irwin did on Animal Planet. The DVD is NTSC region 0 so it plays on all players. Phillipe Cousteau is hot so that was a bonus. Best wishes to the Irwin family and thanks tons for releasing the DVD.,1176768000,,702,3.9507042253521125
2789781,4,B000O599LM,"This was a project unfinished when Steve Irwin died.  What the exact format was supposed to be I don't know. As it turned out, the narration and 'framing' of the various segments stars Phillipe Cousteau, grandson of Captain Jacques Cousteau.  Phillipe Cousteau and Steve Irwin were apparently working on this project together.  There are various segments about different Dangerous ocean creatures, filmed by different naturalists.  Steve and Phillipe are the common threads.

It's not a bad show.  There is a very slight disjointed feel because of the different segments with different naturalists and film crews and only Phillipe Cousteau alive to do narration.  And yes, there is a certain morbid creepiness in the viewer who knows that Steve Irwin was killed by one of the least dangerous of the ""dangerous"" creatures.

I have not seen the DVD version yet, if there is additional footage I am not aware of it.  None is mentioned in the advertisement.",1176163200,,953,5.0576923076923075
8182842,5,B000O599LM,Really good documentary and Steve's last one worth watching,1478563200,,59,5.666666666666667
8182843,5,B000O599LM,"I love it!  Sad, but true that we humans are the ocean's deadliest.  Yet, we still learn to consider the environment and its inhabitants.  Steve Irwin and Philippe Cousteau had shown the world of the deadliest animals on the planet.  One thing for sure is giving these creatures respect and even ourselves too.  A powerful message at the end how we have to be careful with the ocean and what we shouldn't do.",1465430400,,408,4.534246575342466
8182844,5,B000O599LM,"love it, Steve was a great protector of wild animals. love great white, like this documentary!",1421625600,,94,4.9375

8182846,4,B000O599LM,"At first I was a bit disappointed because there were segments with other experts without Steve. I had failed to read the review before purchasing. My disappointment soon dissipated  as these other experts of ocean life shared their knowledge and love of what they do with Steve. It was sad for me to think that the ocean was Steve's last adventure. The flim was very respectful and discreet the way it did not focus on this tragedy. It was ""just right"".",1365033600,2,453,4.592592592592593
8182847,5,B000O599LM,"I ordered this for my son because he is an animal lover and fan of Steve Irwin, sadly we know that this was Irwin's last film. The video highlights the ocean's deadliest creatures as the name implies and the images are really beautiful. I have not yet watched the full video yet, but my son told me that they did not include any of the stingray segment. I would recommend this DVD for any Irwin fan.",1325721600,,399,4.2631578947368425
8182848,4,B000O599LM,"I saw this when it first came out, I'd have to agree with the other reviewers that it is a little weird to watch it knowing that Steve was killed during filming. However it still shows love for the ocean animals which I think was what Steve would have wanted. Anyway, I would reccomend this video and have people keep in mind that this isn't a typical Croc Hunter episode.",1323216000,,372,4.328571428571428
8182849,5,B000O599LM,"If you love nature show about ocean animals, then you will love this show.  Kids love it too!",1226707200,,93,4.166666666666667
8182850,5,B000O599LM,"Steve Irwin again lives his life on the edge.  Although you know this is his last venture, you can really see his passion and enjoyment of the earth's sea creatures in this video.  You can see the mutual respect for the other comrades on board his research vessel and especially Jacques Costeau's grandson who is on this venture as well.  Most enjoyable for the whole family!",1199664000,15,375,4.651515151515151
8182851,4,B000O599LM,We enjoyed this video.  It not only show various dangerous sea creatures but also has a couple of stories of Steve and his friends capturing 2 crocodiles.  We wanted to have a video as a memory of Steve Irwin. We will miss Steve's crocodile hunter adventures.,1199577600,13,259,4.608695652173913
