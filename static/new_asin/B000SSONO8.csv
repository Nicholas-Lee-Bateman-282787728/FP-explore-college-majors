2890050,4,B000SSONO8,"If you've ever been curious about who Vampira is and how her presence has affected the genre of goth/horror film, this DVD has the answers. Glamor-goul Vampira as she is today walks you through how it all began; and how films changed her life. She was WAY ahead of her time, and this shockumentary is a fantastic chronicle of her journey with insights and commentary from a host of goulish actors, musicians, filmmakers, etc. There's lots of reflection on her appearance in Ed Wood's film ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"".

This is clearly a DVD made by a knowledgeable fan of old horror films who brings many of the names of horror-hosts old and new to one fascinating discussion on the Queen of Horror!

At the end of the shockumentary, we get the chance to listen to the filmmakers and how they brought it all together. If you like horror films and are fascinated on how it all began, you'll enjoy this immensely.",1193184000,6,909,4.570552147239264
2890051,5,B000SSONO8,"I just finished watching this documentary, and I've decided to be very, very kind, despite how frustrated I was watching it.  I'll give it the full five stars, because as a fan of ""The Wood Spooks"" this was the single best and most informative Maila Nurmi interview ever.  When she is on the screen, she is fascinating, humorous, lovely and incredibly entertaining.  Absolutely wonderful.

Much of what she imparts here you may have heard before in prior Ed Wood related documentaries, but since those have always been edited in such a way as to retain focus on Wood, Maila's story was always a bit more vague.  Here, although intercut with some of the most useless and irritating sound bytes from poseurs and fans alike, she is for the most part allowed to speak her mind and tell her story, creating her own legend and spinning her own web as she'd like it to be understood.  This should have been the entire ""documentary"".  Point a camera at her, ask her a few guiding questions and let this woman speak.  Period.

Instead, the director interrupts her with clips of horrible reenactment footage, nonsensical and off topic comments from lowlifes, and fan-made performances in tribute to Vampira.  This is his first error:  We don't wish to see or hear from these people, and it hurts your film.

The second problem is that towards the end, the movie forgets what it's even about, turning into another round of contrary people tributing the great misunderstood genius Ed Wood.  Who cares how Lloyd Kaufman feels about the Golden Turkey Awards in this context?  Especially since he's only parroting sentiments made in The Plan 9 Companion by other contrary people.  It has nothing to do with Vampira, and if Ed Wood is spoken about at all, as I'm afraid he must be, it needs to be from the honest point of view of Maila Nurmi and NO ONE ELSE'S. It's called ""VAMPIRA THE MOVIE"" afterall.  The director can't seem to stay on topic.

And so, look, what we have here is a beautiful 6 LB Maine Lobster prepared by a horrible chef.  I'm grateful for the clips from Vampira's old television show (which I'd assumed were gone forever) and for more of the wit and wisdom of this great lady.  I'm upset that I share my interest in her work with the characters that insist on squatting in this documentary.  Yet, I'm glad to add it to my library, and hope that by showing my enthusiasm for the subject matter, a more worthy film will be made soon.",1193011200,54,2436,4.607888631090487
2890052,4,B000SSONO8,"There are so many great lines in this film, most of them said completely deadpan.  It took a while for the hilarity to sink in, but once it did, I really appreciated this movie.  Maila ""Vampira"" Nurmi is very well-spoken in her eccentricity, as are horror luminaries like ""Toxic Avenger"" director Lloyd Kaufman and actors Sid Haid and Bill Moseley.  It's also a treat to see horror hosts both classic (Elvira, Zacherley) and new (who knew there were so many?  Each with their own entertaining ""schtick"").  One of my favorite parts shows Zacherley split-screen, as he is now (still as cool as ever) and as he was in the 1950's.  But I think my favorite thing about this documentary is what's not said: Maila ""Vampira"" Nurmi repeatedly states that her main goal was always to be an evangelist, but she never explains why (although one gets the impression that it may be due to nothing more than a love of doing monologues) -- and really, *could* she explain why?  Is there any possible logical reason that the ""goth-mother"" (as one of the young horror hosts puts it) of horror somehow *just* missed an alternate career path as an evangelist?  No, there isn't.  Likewise there's no explaining Maila's casual assertion that she was known as ""the first woman in California to wear backless shoes,"" and other dubious claims.  I was surprised to see some other reviews that faulted the filmmaker for not doing more to research and verify Maila's various surprising claims.  I think anyone who expects this film to be some kind of hard-nosed investigative journalism is kind of missing the point.  What it's good for is learning about Maila's personality, her life and career as she understood them, and the influence she's had on horror and popular culture in general.  If I were a goth, I'd be thrilled to hear her say that she loves seeing a beautiful goth!

It's clear that this was not a big-budget production -- the footage looks distinctly digital in spots, and there are occasional peculiarities with the editing.  Oddly, the editing seems to get better as the film goes on -- was this a learn-as-you-go project?  Still, it's also clear that care was taken -- there's none of that annoying herky-jerky camera movement I associate with low-budget documentaries, and overall the lighting and sound are good.  The instrumental score by Ari Lehman (Jason from Friday the 13th) is interesting, and makes some of Maila's monologues sound like spoken-word performances.  (With Maila's wacky lines and Ari's jazzy noodlings, I bet someone could remix these into a really cool dance hit . . .) There are also a few great indie rock songs (as an independent musician myself, I'm always glad to see filmmakers supporting independent music!).

The extras are uneven, but again funnier than they appear from a cursory look.  Like, the one of the director speaking in front of a German audience seemed kind of boring until the subtitles came in, and they had me ROTFL.  I don't *think* that was an accurate translation of the German?!?!?  I especially liked the one of Ari talking about how he composed the music.  I should note that what's described on the box as ""music videos"" really aren't -- one is the aforementioned Ari ""making of""-type clip, and the other is Count Smokula singing his song ""Vampira"" live -- it's an entertaining song but not a ""music video"" per se.

So despite its flaws (which are no greater than that of any other low-budget doc, and maybe less so), I recommend this film to anyone interested in Vampira, the world of horror, or just interesting eccentrics in general.",1193011200,12,3581,4.813725490196078
2890053,1,B000SSONO8,"It really is a shame that we earthlings don't have ""stupid minds"" as those uptight aliens from Plan 9 suggest. Perhaps if we did have lower mentalities we could better enjoy Vampira: The Movie. Leave it to Alpha Video, the company responsible for putting out some of the most pitiful of public domain prints on video to destroy what little dignity Maila ""Vampira"" Nurmi has left. Within an hour's time Vampira's mysterious, other worldly charm is chipped away until we are left with nothing but an old lady surrounded by a gang of freak show rejects. The film starts out on the right path, but quickly goes astray with a bizarre and useless reenactment of an actress in a cheap blonde wig posing as Maila Nurmi during her days as a pin-up model. We are later treated to some footage of this actress putting on a black wig to illustrate the transformation into Vampira. These silly, contrived bits can be overlooked, but the real problems are still to come. While Vampira is given plenty of screen time to tell her abridged life story, she is shot from only one angle with no special makeup, wardrobe, set or lighting. The setting is very pedestrian and the producer's should have splurged and spent the extra $100 for a backdrop. Vampira's story is interesting and it's a great asset to hear the words from her mouth, but over much of her talk is some ear bleeding synthetic stock music which is distracting at the least. The rest of the picture is made up of unknown horror ""stars"" who haunt the convention circuits. Most have never even met the woman. This is made embarrassingly clear when they generically chatter about black dresses and fingernails which could be applied to any Vampire character. There are so many ignorant interviewees that one feels that Vampira really has no fan base outside of a carnival sideshow. As if they were not bad enough one at a time, we are then treated to a four star spectacular that flashes them on the screen one right after another with stock music playing in the background. One would think if they planned to fill the movie with unknowns, they would have chose Vampira's actual friends rather than this gaggle of ghouls. The only interesting aspect of this movie is hearing Elvira's side of the Vampira lawsuit (though Vampira herself never mentions it) and seeing clips from Vampira's famed 1950s television show. The movie could have been much better if it were trimmed down to about thirty minutes and completely scrapped the weirdos. The editing is perhaps the worst ever in documentary filmmaking. It seems to have been edited by a child learning how to use the free software included with their new DVD burner. The still photos featured in the movie have been taken from web sites and eBay auctions, which explains the pixilation problems. The editing of these photos is ridiculous in itself. The editor obviously used random zoom filters which zoom into the center of the photos... usually right into someone's chest. Other times, the photos will fade into another before the subject's face is seen! Clearly this is the work of amateurs and Alpha should have left such an intriguing subject to more capable hands. Vampira is an artist, poet, actress, model, dancer even a singer, but this poor excuse for a documentary paints a very vague picture and leaves the uneducated viewer to believe she should only be remembered as a kook who clings to a 50 year old black wig. I give it one star - simply because Amazon does not have zero or negative ratings.",1192665600,33,3504,4.736497545008183
2890054,2,B000SSONO8,"In the early 90's, there was an excellent documentary, a good two hours long with very well done visuals. This one comes nowhere near it. For someone who knows absolutely nothing about Vampira, it might be somewhat interesting. But if you are ""seasoned"" or knew her, you will find very little of value herein. The cover erroniously claims ""The SHOCKING TRUTH about Horror's First Host"" and there is nothing shocking of any kind in this DVD. It is very disjointed, and not in the ""artsy"" way, but in a way that makes the viewer think a true amateur made this brief film, and rather hastily at that.

  There are no rare photos (and Johnny Coffin could have well supplied hundreds---but maybe he wasn't asked) and no rare video footage, with the exception of a few seconds here and there from Vampira's TV show, but even that was shown in the mid 1990's on L.A.s channel 7 and can be seen on YouTube today. There were MANY more people they could have interviewed (myself included) who really KNEW the lady and could have given insight to the REAL person behind the Vampira persona. Instead, like so many other pieces on Vampira, they obsess over the 'Plan 9' thing, till you can hardly stand it any longer. This is not a ""deep"" documentary and you will learn nothing you couldn't find online, or in any Maila Nurmi interview. They never mention her Vampira Vegas act with Liberace, NOTHING of her films from the late 50's and early 60's, nothing about her ""black listed years"", nothing in depth about her personal life or what she did once her career was obviously over and so much more--not included.

  The extras contribute nothing to the whole project. In fact, they have little to do with Vampira at all.

  But if you actually COLLECT Vampira memorabilia, I guess you should buy it just for the sake of having it. But buy it used....",1191283200,16,1837,4.5932721712538225
2890063,5,B000SSONO8,"This is not a movie but a documentary about Maila ""Vampira"" Nurmi.

Coming from Lapland with her parents when she was two years old, to
Ellis Island then Massachusetts.

Not being able to adjust to life outside the womb she took to the
evening instead. As a child Maila feel in love with the Dragon Lady
in comic books as nothing could touch her and feared no one, so Maila
thought it would it would be a nice way to be, and this started the
concept of Vampira.

She gave up acting because she did not want to go on interviews or
have any competition, so she wanted to become an evangelist but could
not raise the $20,000 (a lot of money for the 1950s).

There are interviews from Forrest Ackerman, Julie Stain, Debbie D and
Debbie Dutch, Jerry Only, Kevin Eastman, David J. Skal, Cassandra
""Elvira"" Peterson, Sid Haig Lloyd Kaufman and more.

Never knowing her until I got ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"", I got this
dvd on the assumption that it was a movie, but I am glad it was a
documentary her life as Maila intrigued me.

There are also shots from ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"", a send-up of
the movie and many interviews of the movie. If that is not enough,
the extras have Count Smokula's Music Video in the Special Features
which I enjoyed but for one thing, the count read his lines.

This dvd as it not a movie it is a documentry, so I deduct 1 star
for the misleading title and cover, and give it 4 stars. It is a
great dvd for anyone's shelf who is intrested in the historical
side of Vampira and Maila Nurmi.",1297555200,,1513,4.2508710801393725
2890064,3,B000SSONO8,"Misleading title!!

It's like an extended DVD extra. Good interview but would have liked better directing!! And please who cast the interviewees?????

Nice to see some rare footage of the show. Vampira herself id quite interesting to listen to!!",1282953600,,245,5.256410256410256
2890065,3,B000SSONO8,"A more difficult project then rating this attempt is defining what exactly it is.
It's not a movie. I know that much. Kevin Michaels looks to me like he attempted to tell Maila Nurmi's story in biopic format with Maila telling the story of her life ( when prompted) & then there is the audio commentary dropped in over the visuals if you want a different take. Still with me? Good, because now it gets crazy. Insert a young woman who might have resembled Maila back in the day to in a limited way boost the product & allow us to visualize in a more real manner selected scenes ( from Maila's life) that presented a more youthful balance to the story. Add to that snipit communtary during the feature from seemingly every B Movie actor/actress, Vampira Wannabe, Horror Memorabilia person or just about every other person on the planet that ever heard the word Vampira uttered. Besides the non-movie there are the extras & there are lots of extras but the only 2 I appeciated was the Ted Mikels Limited Comments & the Count Smokula Vampira theme which is excellent. I give this DVD 3 stars. One star for Maila telling her story which I appreciate, 1 star for a million guest cameo appearances & 1 star for the Smokula Vampira theme & the only known/available footage from Vampira's Horror show from back in the day. If I was making this film I would have had an actress act out her life  from beginning to end, no interruptions & play her up. Then in the extras have Maila tell her story. Done deal, nothing else required. Thats the way I see it. I was glad to hear Maila's story as she died not long after this film was produced. It was a nice tribute but didn't come together the way it should have.",1282867200,3,1699,4.410828025477707
2890066,1,B000SSONO8,"The great thing about this movie is the interview with Maila Nurmi (Vampira). As the reviewer Ethan put it, she was ""fascinating, humorous, lovely and incredibly entertaining."" She was 82 years old when she did the interview. The movie would have been better with more of that, and less (or none) of the other interviews.

Another really nice thing is the old footage of Maila. In one sequence she posed not as Vampira but as herself wearing a light blue bathing outfit. The other footage was from her TV show, as the Vampira character. I had thought there was no such footage available. I really wish this DVD included the old footage uncut and complete. In this movie, the old footage is sliced up and shown as excerpts.

Another thing I liked were the glimpses of print media coverage of Maila and the Vampira character from that period. Again, I wish the entire material had been presented on the DVD, which would certainly have been technically possible, even if only as an appendix or special feature. I did pause the DVD to read the stories, but I could see only short excerpts of the text.

I also liked the brief interview with Cassandra Peterson (Elvira), in which she talked about how her character was created, and about the law suit with Maila. (Maila did not tell her version on this DVD.)

There you have a comprehensive list of all that is good about this movie. Everything else was terrible. Ethan and others have already done a better job than I could do explaining why this movie is terrible. I agree with everything Ethan wrote, and I particularly endorse his Lobster analogy. However, he left one thing out: the music, which was terrible in every respect.

In this movie, the music during the opening credits was hard rock music that has no connection with Vampira or her era. We were assaulted again by similar terrible, anachronistic music during two montages later in the movie. You can turn the sound completely off during those parts. What is beyond forgivable is the electronic music (apparently composed for the film) that played during the interviews. Remember that the best thing about the movie is the extended interview with Maila? Practically throughout the interview you have to listen to really bad electronic music, obviously created well after the Vampira era. This annoying music is so unimaginative and formulaic that it may in fact have been ""composed"" by a computer program. Imagine watching a fascinating interview in a theater that's filled with a really bad smell, except something prevents you from holding your nose.

When I started watching this movie, I anticipated hearing fun, kitschy music from the period, perhaps including bongo drums, a vibraphone, a theremin, and maybe a mono-syllabic soprano. With better choices in music, this movie would have risen above awful-terrible to passable. I had thought it would be nice to keep this movie to experience again the good stuff listed above, but I know I'll never again be willing to sit through the awful music that defaces the Maila interview.

I just now watched this movie, and maybe you can tell I'm kind of angry. That's because I believe I was I was abused and tortured by the music, and because I believe the film maker defaced his precious material. This is a lesson for me in how our beliefs are responsible for negative emotions.",1251763200,7,3339,4.816753926701571
2890067,4,B000SSONO8,"Kevin Sean Michaels has enlightened me as to the first original Gothic horror television host, Vampira! I loved the candidness of Maila Nurmi's interviews and all the supporting commentaries that were included, especially David J. Skal, one of the most knowledgeable authorities on horror anywhere.

The film is just filled with dvd extras and interviews with many fans and horror industry legends, such as Forrest J. Ackerman,Bill Moseley, Ari Lehman, and David J. Skal, as well as Svengoolie, Elvira, and Johnny Coffin of Coffin Cases. Such an eclecticism of horror personalities and hosts.

Her thoughts, her memories, her experiences as Vampira and afterward. I don't think this kind of footage exists anywhere else. It also includes segments from Vampira's short-lived but legendary TV show, which I had thought lost to the fog machines of time. These two elements alone make this film worth having for any fan of Vampira, or collector of Vampire lore and legend. Rather than tearing down the director for technical problems, real or perceived, I think he should be congratulated for managing to get Ms. Nurmi to sit still for his camera in such a relaxed and informal way. Some of the critical reviewers make good points, but I'm happy that I have this video so I can watch the parts with Ms. Nurmi over and over again. She is such an interesting person, and the fact that she inhabits such a strong, quirky and artistic persona at the age of 85 is truly inspirational!",1195862400,11,991,4.767441860465116

2890072,5,B000SSONO8,"I was blown away by how much you get for your money with this documentary of extremely rare and vanishing information on Maila Nurmi a.k.a. Vampira.  One thing you would never expect--and the disk is worth it for this alone--is the many sage lessons in life that Maila shares.  The documentary holds a tight weave of deep insights from those who knew her before her fame, and tributes from her horror host ""descendants,"" almost none of whom have ever been coaxed to talk before.  But the main star, as it should be, is Maila herself, breaking new ground in fresh interviews, and never-told stories.

Just like when any cult hero gets honored, we can only be amazed by how many stalkers and frauds with an axe to grind come out of the woodwork to say they should been the ones interviewed instead of the celebrities on film.  But what I notice is that the documentary doesn't try to be the be-all and end-all encyclopedia on the subject. I'm thankful for that because it doesn't get caught up in the repetition you might expect. The truth is it is packed with anecdotes and analysis that obviously doesn't exist anywhere else.  The documentary is also worth it for the extras alone, mostly Count Smokula's hilarious tribute song ""Vampira.""  The packaging of the disk itself adds to the mystique, perfectly capturing her life and times, and helping to make it a must-own collector's treasure.",1193443200,9,1390,4.742738589211618
