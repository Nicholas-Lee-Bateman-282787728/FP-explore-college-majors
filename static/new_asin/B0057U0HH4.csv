This item contains Volumes 1 & 2 of the second season (New Vestroia) & it is from Italy, so it's a Region 2 disc & you need  either a Multi-Region or a Region Free Blu-Ray or DVD Player. It contains a total of 13 episodes & a lot of battles.",1397520000,,351,3.943661971830986
8461153,5,B0057U0HH4,"I bought this DVD because I own the previous season of Bakugan. I bought this disc from Italy & it was a Region 2 disc, so I had to buy a Multi Region Blu Ray Player in order to watch this disc. Now the cover of this item was in Italian, but when you place it in to a Multi Region Blu Ray Player then it automatically turns into English, so you can still watch it in English.",1390780800,,375,3.8205128205128207
