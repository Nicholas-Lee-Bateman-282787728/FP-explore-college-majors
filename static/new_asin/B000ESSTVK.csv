2533460,4,B000ESSTVK,"There are a coupla different styles in this movie, which I guess some viewers may find disjointed ... but it worked for me.

The first 20 minutes are just plain funny, highlighted by Katy Davis as Jean, the most amazingly self-obsessed, annoying and hilarious character I've seen in a while.  But, after Jean has a little accident, the movie becomes more serious ... though with some moments and dialogue that reminded me a bit of Guy Ritchie.

The last half of the flick is pure thriller, very well done and not at all predictable.  You will NOT be bored.

You also get to see the wonderful Kelly Reilly (Viv) in a fairly early role ... she's beautiful, and she definitely can act.  Sadly, I suspect her days of low-budget thrillers now is past, so you'll have to settle for this one.  For later roles, check her out in ""Eden Lake"" and ""Sherlock Holmes.""

Enjoy!",1305763200,3,863,4.558441558441558
2533461,3,B000ESSTVK,"The first 45 minutes had all the excitement of a Beverly Hills 90210 episode.  Maybe not that much.  When the main guy goes to bury his dead girlfriend and lo-and-behold finds another dead body in the ditch he's just dug, you know believablity is not going to be a high point in this movie.  The series of unbeleivable scenarios is just beginning to unfold however, and at a rate that's much quicker than the first 45 minutes.  The unbeleivablity would have been more forgivable if other elements had been more interesting, but those other elements were missing for me.  OK, the second half was at least an improvement on the first in terms of generating interest.  Not a terrible movie, but not a great one either.",1203552000,,715,4.634920634920635
2533462,4,B000ESSTVK,"This is a gripping drama in which the various characters keep revealing deeper, darker layers to their personalities.

The main characters are of the ""trainspotter"" generation - involved in partying hearty. But mature viewers who enjoy an Agatha Christie mystery will find just as much to identify with here.

All the acting is superb. The lead actor sets the dark chain of events in motion when he confesses to his buddy that he killed his girlfriend - accidentally, during one of their regular bouts of disaffection. He enlists his buddy's help in disposing of the body. When he finds that the secluded spot he picked as a burial site is already occupied - by another corpse - things get dangerously complicated for everyone involved.

There are surprises and jolts all along these characters' paths. Although the script is generally literate and well-crafted, there are several loose ends to contend with.

I think though that the main loose end was left dangling intentionally. That is the introductory voice-over narration the main character delivers. He refers to the grisly death of his dog in the opening sequence. This revelation, alluding to dark motives and indifference, sets the tone for the whole movie. However, it constitutes perhaps the biggest mystery of all. It will leave you guessing exactly how this little death fits into the larger, pervasive villainy that's the subject of ""Dead Bodies.""",1158278400,3,1412,5.0995670995671

It's not great but it's got that one guy in it. Yeah, the bad guy from Sherlock. I think his character's name is Murdock or something.",1470614400,,231,4.133333333333334

8113944,4,B000ESSTVK,"Clearly low budget but very well paced, decently written and competently performed. The one flaw is that none of the characters are particularly likeable. The lead is a self indulgent petulant man-child too lazy and disinterested to end a clearly terrible relationship with his equally selfish narcissistic girlfriend, his best friend who is a carpet with a car and a fundamental lack of sense, even the cops are repellent. The film walks a fine line between obnoxious characters and interesting plot. Well worth viewing, particularly for any Andrew Scott fans.",1424044800,,561,5.2444444444444445
8113945,5,B000ESSTVK,"If you have been watching the most recent Sherlock Holmes you will have discovered Andrew Scott playing Moriarty. He is absolutely REMARKABLE. Therefore as is part of my ""Movie / tv hobby I searched out something else I could see him in. This was the first. Dead Bodies is a truly slick murder mystery. Hard to guess the end even for those of us that are pretty good at it. Treat yourself. Seems like his films are mostly produced by an Irish film production company. I hope to see much more of him. P.S. You can also find him in Bachelor Weekend. Something of a sweet surprise of a film.",1420329600,2,588,4.3545454545454545
