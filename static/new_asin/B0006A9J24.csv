2180079,5,B0006A9J24,"As a daycare provider, I have utilized these videos for several years and found that all children benefit greatly from them. All of the children have learned their phonics prior to completing letter name recognition due to the catchy song, and since I do quarterly assessments on these skills starting at 2, I have data to prove it. It really enhances what they are exposed to and learn through standard curriculum. Most of the parents end up buying them as well so that their children have something truly educational and worthwhile to view. I just asked my school-age son what the vowels are and he told me. I asked how he knew that, and he said it was from Letter Factory. He also learned silent e from it. Even though his teacher and I have gone over it before, he REMEMBERS it from the videos and songs. I have seen these DVD's listed on several pre-school and daycare MUST HAVE lists, and STRONGLY agree. There is no better out there, and through these, children simply absorb the knowledge through repetition. I also recommend Rock and Learn's Shapes, Colors and Numbers.",1209081600,5,1078,4.678947368421053
2180080,5,B0006A9J24,"At first I was sceptical, but my 4 year old son is absolutely in love with these videos. We watch them every evening before dinner. He has become infatuated with letters and reading as a direct result of these videos alone. In 3 months he has polished his knowledge of the letters, understands the difference between vowels and consonants, the function of both in words, knows exactly what sound each letter makes individually, knows what sound combinations of letters make (e.g. s+h), regularly experiments with his bathtub crayons, trying to write words, and is actively interested in asking about how words are formed. Some of these videos take a while before the 'real action' begins, but this builds up anticipation. They run 30 mins or so and therefore never become overwhelming. I wish the Math video was as effective as the letter/words combo; the visuals seem a little counterintuitive and do not clarify concepts adequately. Overall, combo is highly recommended.",1207526400,2,972,5.08125
2180081,5,B0006A9J24,"We bought this for our 22 month old daughter on the recommendation of a friend of ours.  She absolutely loves the Letter Factory DVD and would ask to watch it over and over.  As a result, she can identify just about any letter we show her AND she can tell us what sound the letter makes.  I was blown away!  I'd highly recommend it!",1188000000,3,332,4.140625
2180082,5,B0006A9J24,"I brought these for my kids when they were 18 months and 29 months. I played the first dvd for them and after 1 month, they knew the sounds of the letters and could find the letters if i asked them to find a letter.  I would recomend leapfrog dvd's they are awsome.",1126051200,11,265,4.0
2180083,3,B0006A9J24,"My fault. My grandson is to young for these.

I had gotten rave reviews from one of my co-workers about these DVD's. Her daughters, age 3 & 5, love the Leapfrog DVD's. Her son, age 18 mo., mimics his sisters and sings along. I thought it would be a good idea for my grandson to 'hear' the DVD's - I knew he was too young. He ended up having no interest.",1121990400,2,353,3.971830985915493

8040904,5,B0006A9J24,I have a 2 and 3 year old and they both LOVE these DVDs and have both learned their ABCs already from the Letter Factory and the oldest can add & subtract!,1269216000,,155,3.875
8040905,5,B0006A9J24,"I bought it for my 3.5 years old son and he loves it. I love it too - it's teaches letters, sounds, numbers, animals, word building and also sometimes he dances and sings. I am very happy with purchase - my son watches them over and over again. The only thing that I bought a set of 7 DVDs for just $69.99 and now they sell it for much more.
  I have:LeapFrog 7 DVDs: Learning Set: Letter Factory, Talking Words Factory, Let's Go to School. Plus Talking Words 2 (Code Word Caper), Learn to Read At the Storybook Factory, Math Circus & Math Adventure to the Moon (Leap Frog) from Mommy Bear Media here on Amazon.
  Now they sell all 7 of them on website [...] for 79.99",1268784000,,668,4.1953125
8040906,5,B0006A9J24,My daughter is 2 and a half and before this video she knew NONE of her letters.  After watching the Letter Factory one a few times she now can point at letters and tell me what it is AND the sound it makes!,1247529600,,206,3.7906976744186047
8040907,5,B0006A9J24,"I bought this series after I learned that my 2 1/2 year old often watched ""Letter Factory"" at daycare on rainy days.  Without any lessons from me, that video taught him all his letters and letter sounds.  Now he LOVES letters.  He will announce letters all the time and tell me their sounds. ""Mommy, there's a B!  It says Buh!""

So, I bought the series.  Now, from watching ""Word Factory"" he can put letters together to make simple words.  He can't actually read the words he makes, but he can sound them out.  But, I will not be surprised if he is reading by the time he turns three!

He is also in love with ""Number Circus"".  He loves counting to 10 on his fingers.  Since he showed so much interest, I played lots of number games with him.  He can now count to 30 and to 10 in Spanish (thanks for helping with that, Dora).

We haven't watched much of the 4th video since it is about spelling bigger words.  My son isn't ready for that yet, but I know it won't be long before he will be watching it.

Again, my son is only 2 1/2.  I am pretty sure he is ahead of the curve academically due to these videos.  I don't think he is especially gifted or anything, I just think these videos are geared perfectly at his age group(or older) and the catchy songs help it all sink in.",1246924800,,1276,4.163934426229508
8040908,5,B0006A9J24,These videos are very well done. My son was glued to them and was singing the songs when they were over.  Well worth the money.,1245974400,,127,4.08
8040909,5,B0006A9J24,"I got these because my 5-year old is improving his reading, my 4-year-old still needs to master his letters, and my 1-year old can always use a head start.  Within a week or two, my 4-year-old is saying ""C, like C-C-Cold!""  I also wondered how to introduce the simple math, and Math Circus is awesome.  I totally recommend these for just about any age (my 10-year-old nephew is also entertained by them), and they're well worth the price!",1245715200,,438,4.589743589743589
8040910,4,B0006A9J24,"I had recently purchased ""The Letter Factory"" at a retail store. I liked it so much that when I found this 4 pack, I went ahead and got it, and gave the other copy to my daughter for her child. You can't go wrong with these DVDs. They are educational, as well as entertaining. I do agree with other reviewers that ""Math Circus"" would have been improved if it had been slowed down a little bit. It's very fast paced, but it's still good.",1245369600,,436,4.2023809523809526
8040911,5,B0006A9J24,"My son loved Letter Factory so much, I had to buy more.  At age 2 (and 3 months), the only two that he enjoys are Letter Factory and Math Circus.  I'm expecting the other ones to be good as he gets older.  His ability to learn the letters and sounds through the Letter Factory has been nothing short of phenomenal.  If he doesn't know all of the letter names and sounds, and all of the number's names, he is 90% of the way there.  Plus, they are decent entertainment.  Not just drill and repetition, but cute.",1242864000,,509,4.25
8040912,5,B0006A9J24,We purchased these DVD's for my 2 year old son and I didn't realize how valuable they were going to be.  My son loves to to watch these DVD's and we're truly amazed at how much he's learning in a short time. I would highly recommend these to any parent and would say these are a great gift to give to any new parent!,1238371200,,316,3.9375
