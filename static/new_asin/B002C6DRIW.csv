Petr Lom, a director from Czechoslovakia, has recently released his new poetic documentary On a Tightrope.  The film follows the lives of four Chinese children, learning how to tightrope in two very different ways. Lom presents the film artistically, allowing his audience to be pulled into a culture not known to most, however the story can be lacking at some points. The plot of the film is fun and ultimately redeeming, with some dull issues that do not pertain to what I believe Lom was trying to achieve.  The film offers the chance to learn more about the country we hardly know yet so heavily rely on. The more we understand Chinese culture, the more we are able to continue to develop our world.

The film begins with Lom speaking to a Chinese official trying to explain what he is doing in China, the official though dubious at first allows Lom to continue on his way, but not before he tells Lom's crew to never translate the conversation. The opening of the film introduces the viewer to the strict Chinese society that rules the world of the four children. The children who are slowly introduced throughout the first half hour of the film, talk about their life in the orphanage where they all live. They also speak about their new life, tight roping.  Mehmet Tursun, the professional tight rope walker coaches the children in the afternoon. He is a good coach, and most of the young orphans agree that he is like a father to them. Many of us westerners could easily see him as a negative influence upon the children, because of his belief that boldness and courage are far more important than safety and fun.

The film continues to follow the children but goes into further detail about the culture in the region where they live and how the Chinese communist government has an effect on their daily lives. I found this to be  the most interesting part of the film.  The children talk about who they are and what it means. They tell us that they are known as Uighurs (the largest muslim ethnicity in China), and that the government wants to expel them for their ethnicity. Even though they are ""Muslim"" they do not practice, or rather they cannot practice Islam.  The law forbids it, so while they are given the curse of being a Uighur in China they also are being ripped of the blessing to practice their own religion. Even though they are told not to pray they still do, however very rarely when they visit their elders in the countryside. One particular scene shows the local schoolchildren reciting an oath to not practice religion.

At this point in the film it seems that Lom has taken time off and then come back several months later, only to find out that the coach Mehmet has left because he had no money to continue to coach for free. A new coach has taken his position though, Mehmet says he is just a ragged old street performer with no real talent and who won't teach the children anything, but when we meet him he seems quite the opposite. Yasin, the new coach is loving to the children and treats them with respect, but isn't too easy on them either. The most valuable thing Yasin gives to the children are his morals. He teaches them values and beliefs, about what is right and wrong, and how to respect others. While the children seemed distant from Tursun and afraid, they love Yasin and enjoy being with him. The film culminates with the childrens tightroping performance to the whole village, which adds some drama to the experience.

The film is well built, but lacks character, and in the end I found it to be dull and disappointing with only a few good parts. You do not feel an emotional attachment to any of the children by the end of the film, and are left with a simple story with no real value save for the lessons learned about the culture and China. I wish Lom had delved deeper into the children and what they thought about their world. Lom tended to focus on the outside of things instead of going into the issues and presenting an opinion or at least enough information to let the viewer build an opinion on. The film was meant to portray the two sides of being on a tightrope the physical stage of actually performing on a tightrope (what Lom focused on), and the cultural aspect of the tightrope.  Lom meant to show us how these children are trying to balance preserving their culture, and living in modern day China. But what he ended up accomplishing, was giving a bland story about four rather uninteresting children who play on tightropes all day, while giving subtle mentions to the real big picture of their story, which more people will find interesting. In short Lom made the classic documentary mistake, focusing too much on the small picture, which he originally intended to give meaning to the big picture.",1302566400,,4797,4.571594877764843
8363301,5,B002C6DRIW,"This is a wonderful, wonderful film. Watching the children grow up in such a tough environment makes me feel guilty of all the times I ever complained life was miserable. The children in the film give some of the most honest observations on life I've ever heard, and they are each so relatable. The film truly lifts the human spirit - the children show us what can be achieved through courage, determination and hard work.

Buy the DVD through Amazon. I tried almost two years ago to buy it through their website but never received it due to overseas copyright issues. In short, it's been a hassle trying to get my hands on this DVD but it was well worth the wait.",1267660800,,664,4.442622950819672
