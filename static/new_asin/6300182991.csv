This TV series from 1974-75 (""Kolchak"") featured a newspaper reporter who covered strange events. It showed the culture and tools of that time (typewriters, teletype printers, Instamatic cameras). Its office life showed personal conflicts. Best of all, it had no laugh track so you could decide what was funny. Why did ""Kolchak"" have a short run on TV? The story about a reporter finding monsters is self-limiting. How many vampires, werewolves, ghosts, or weird murderers can be discovered every week without a feeling of dja vue?

""The Ripper"" tells of the murders of young women in the Chicago area. A mysterious man with great strength wearing a black cape and a strange cane is the suspect. Kolchak was assigned the ""Miss Emily"" column as punishment, but his replacement doesn't work out. The slaughter continues. Reporter Jane Plum is meeting a man who claims to be the Ripper. Kolchak's plan goes awry. The suspect is captured, but escapes from maximum security! Kolchak meets a letter-writer to get information about a mysterious stranger. This story has its dull spots, like a low-budget film. There is a ""haunted house"" with a secret room, suspense, and high tension. But Kolchak manages a happy ending. ""Who would believe it?""

The Las Vegas story tells of a vampire that rose from a grave that was disturbed by highway construction. Kolchak manages to get the assignment to Los Angeles. Again a fantasy situation is played seriously for laughs. Did two Satan worshipers kill two men and drain their blood? Kolchak goes to investigate, and finds a suspect. Lieutenant Matteo does not believe him. Kolchak stumbles and finds the vampire, and ends the killing! People don't believe Kolchak even when it turns out to be true. No matter what happens, Kolchak gets blamed.",1173139200,,1824,4.993421052631579

I had been waiting a long time for it to come out on vhs and maybe, I've missed it, but now I'm glad I've found it.  I don't own it yet, but you can be sure I will own it shortly.
I also have a comment about the certain ""federal agent"".  I can't help it.  I adore Mulder.  And it shows a compliment to the creaters of Kolchak that an unknown writer, (Chris Carter) would use the ideas and put a twist on it.",1030492800,,525,3.850467289719626
