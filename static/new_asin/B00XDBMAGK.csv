8715777,5,B00XDBMAGK,"Another fascinating documentary series from Athena documentaries (they have also produced all kinds of documentaries from WWII to monarchy, math, medicine, and wildlife).  This documentary series goes in dept into some of the most shocking art heists in history.  I cannot tell you how much I enjoyed this series.  Munch's ""The Scream"" in Norway, Davinci's ""Mona Lisa"" in France, Nazi's stealing priceless art and claiming it as their own, Boston's shocking St. Patrick's Day theft, and many more.  You will definitely enjoy it.",1474156800,,528,5.325301204819277
8715778,3,B00XDBMAGK,"I can't put my finger on it, but somehow this series manages to be quite tedious while ostensibly covering such compelling subject matter. I lost interest in each of these episodes before they ended; the filmmakers obviously think their presentation is suspenseful enough to keep you enraptured. Hardly. Not helping matters, the reenactments are unnecessary and amateurish and the music is typical of second-rate documentaties: heavy on ride cymbals and replete with awful synth.",1454371200,,479,5.486486486486487
8715779,5,B00XDBMAGK,"ART OF THE HEIST. This dramatic television series, little seen in the United States aside from a run on the Ovation channel in 2007, presents some of the most daring, notorious art thefts of recent history.  It uses detailed dramatic reconstructions, reenactments. Interviews with thieves, museum personnel from guards to curators to public relations and security officers, police and various experts. Also archival pictures and live footage; stills and film of various pictures; radio broadcasts, and more. Each of the 14 episodes delivers a headline-making art heist, examining how masterpieces by Leonardo da Vinci, Edvard Munch, Paul Cezanne, Johannes Vermeer, Gustave Klimt, Pierre-August Renoir and Rembrandt Van Rijn were snatched from some of the world's most prestigious museums.

Mind you, art theft is one of the world's largest, most intriguing criminal enterprises, accounting for over $6 billion in annual losses. This lively documentary gives us many, including Leonardos Mona Lisa from Pariss famed Louvre museum  twice, once in broad daylight.  A version of Munchs The Scream, and the Madonna, from the small Munch Museum in Oslo, Norway. Klimts portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer by the Nazis, a Vienna-Austria-based story told in the recent film WOMAN IN GOLD.  The biggest art theft ever, when gangsters hit Boston, Massachusetts Isabella Stewart Gardner museum, stealing Impressionist paintings  worth a fortune, in a burglary long attributed to Bostons infamous Irish American gangster, James (Whitey) Bulger.  And ART OF THE HEIST follows the trail of stolen art as it passes through the hands of unscrupulous dealers, shadowy smugglers, often then into obscurity. It shares insights into crimes committed in galleries, tombs, and mansions from Egypt to Sweden, Massachusetts to  Cypress, Norway to Austria. Some of the colorful characters suspected in the heists include Nazi Hermann G&ouml;ring, Bulger, even painter Pablo Picasso. And it illustrates how some of the art work has been recovered. The episodes are:

Episode 1 ""The Big Sting."" On December 22, 2000, two men stole Munchs The Scream, and The Madonna from Norways small Munch Museum.

Episode 2 ""The World's Biggest Heist.""  St. Patrick's Day in Boston. Celebrations were noisy, perfect cover for two fake policemen who talked their way into the Gardner Museum.

Episode 3 ""The Forger and the Con Man.""  ""One of the greatest frauds the art world has ever seen.""

Episode 4 ""The Search for 'The Scream."" Long and drawn-out.

Episode 5 ""Chasing C&eacute;zanne."" In 1978, thieves broke into a home in Stockbridge, MA., stole 7 paintings, including one by C&eacute;zanne that art history considers to be the fount of cubism.

Episode 6 ""Den of Antiquities."" The island nation of Cyprus was embroiled in civil war in the 1970s.  Thieves attacked the near-abandoned church of Panagia Kanakaria, cut out beautiful mosaics created about 1500 years before, showing Christ, in an unusually fresh way, as a young man.

Episode 7 ""The Lady in Gold."" Gustav Klimt painted Adele Bloch-Bauer in 1907. During World War II the Nazis stole the luminous picture from her family: the picture later ended up in the Austrian Art Museum.

Episode 8 ""The Pharaoh's Head. Since 1983, Egypt has had laws against removing antiquities from the country, but Jonathan Tokeley-Parry ""was confident he was not breaking any British law."" He removed hundreds of antiquities over 65 trips to Egypt.

Episode 9 ""Miami Heist."" Two works were stolen in September, 1985, from the art museum of the small town of La Coru&ntilde;a, Spain: a theft which began as one of the most perfect heists.

Episode 10 ""The Man Who Stole the Mona Lisa."" On Monday, August 21, 1911, Vincenzo Peruggia, a 30 year-old carpenter, took Leonardos Mona Lisa from the Louvre. Not easily, as the picture is painted on a board, cannot be rolled up. The carpenter became a minor celebrity in Italy, as he was trying to return the treasure to that country where it was made.

Episode 11 ""The Russian Conspiracy.  In August, 2006, over 200 items from the Russian collection were stolen from the world-famous Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg, Russia.

Episode 12 ""On the Trail of Moche Gold."" In 1988, looters found and emptied the 1500 year-old grave of the Peruvian Lord of La Mina, of the Moche culture that predated the Incas.

Episode 13 ""The Disappeared."" Christmas Eve, 1980, men entered Argentinas Buenos Aires Museum of Fine Arts, stole 16 impressionist works. A witness stated that a green Ford Falcon was parked outside the museum. That stopped the investigation cold; green Falcons were used by the junta's greatly-feared plain clothes secret police.

Episode 14 ""The Thieving Don Juan."" The famous gold salt cellar, or saliera, made by Benvenuto Cellini, was a great treasure, with an insured value of $65 million, of Austria, Vienna's History of Art Museum. Until it was taken by a man in an impulsive smash-and-grab.

This DVD box set, which I received as a review copy, contains all 14 episodes from series 1 and 2, running approximately 13 hours.  It also contains subtitles, a necessity with the numerous international interviews, and a 12-page viewers guide with articles about the discovery of an art hoard with Nazi ties, notorious forgers, politically motivated art heists, and museum security.

It is noticeable how many of the museums had poor security; also how few of the paintings were insured, for how do you price something world-famous, of which there is only one? It is also noticeable how difficult it is to make a profit on a famous picture or art object, even with the help of unscrupulous merchants.  It is of further interest to me that former FBI agent Robert Wittman, author of PRICELESS: HOW I WENT UNDERCOVER TO RESCUE THE WORLDS STOLEN TREASURES, which I reviewed on its web site here, takes part in the recovery of some stolen artwork here. Wittman, who created the agency's Art Crime Team, believes that the theft of art is a theft from all humankind, goes undercover to deal with art thieves in order to catch them. This in-depth series will certainly appeal to those who know and love art.  However, even if you know/care little about it, you will most likely learn some art history here; will enjoy this show if you like detective dramas or police procedurals. As the Observer said, Art thefts in movies such as The Thomas Crown Affair might look like Hollywood exaggerations, but as this illuminating new series shows, the real- life crimes can be just as elaborate."" The production is illuminating, authoritative and entertaining, too.",1447718400,2,6597,5.114525139664805
8715780,5,B00XDBMAGK,"You will probably not have seen this terrific series on television unless you subscribed to Ovation Network on cable TV in 2007. This was an original series for that network. Thanks to the folks at RJL (which releases mostly fictional crime dramas on their Acorn imprint), everyone can now see it as it is on RLJs cultural imprint  Athena.

Each of the 58 minute episodes is devoted to a large (or at least very valuable) art heist. Using re-enactments of the events and blending it with new interviews with the important people involved (except the criminals themselves)  police, museum directors, lawyers  the story unfolds like any procedural crime series.  The heists were large and often international in nature but Im willing to bet many did not make your local paper. Yes, there is the heist of the Mona Lisa (actually stolen twice) and the famous painting The Scream  which was also covered in another recent documentary on millionaire Ronald Lauder  but others were taken from small museums in Argentina, Norway, Vienna and Peru. The big heist in the US was in Boston at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.

With the exception of one heist, most took place at end of 20th century or within the fist decade of the 21st century. And many were not solved until 2004-2006. I won't call it a spoiler but some of the art was recovered and some wasnt. Youll have to watch to see which were which.
One theme that runs through the series is that in most cases the theft was due to inadequate security and most works were not insured. (How can you insure a priceless work of art of which only one exists.

I was really impressed that the producers were able to get interviews with virtually everyone involved in a case  and how personable the subjects were. The music added a lot to each episode too.

This series will appeal to those who know and love art but  even if you know little about art (and you will subtlety learn some things here), if you like a good detective or police procedural you will find this more than satisfying.

I see other reviewers have listed the detail of each episode in their review. Personally, I would dice into the series without knowing more than that each is considered one of the biggest heists in the art world.  The package comes with a nice 12 page viewers guide with essays but  again- Id suggest reading that after you have watched all 14 episodes.

I think it would be great if EVERY public and school library had a copy of this 4-disc set. Its that good and should provide education and ENTERTAINMENT for many years to come.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8715781,5,B00XDBMAGK,"This is an amazing series. Each of the 14 episodes is told through re-enactments, interviews, surveillance videos, contemporary TV and newspaper coverage and such. It's not just police and owners interviewed  sometimes they have interviews with the former art thieves themselves.

You may not want to binge-watch ""Art of the Heist"". Because the format and narrator is the same for each episode, you can get the feeling of sameness if you watch 5 episodes in a row as I did.  But other than that, I really enjoyed this series.

""Art of the Heist"" originally aired on the Ovation TV channel. It is produced by Athena Learning. The DVD set has 4 discs totaling about 13 hours of viewing. The show is presented in 16:9 widescreen and Dolby digital stereo. English SDH subtitles are available.

There are no bonus features on the discs, but a 10 page booklet, a Viewer's Guide, is included in the case. This tells the stories of art thefts that didn't make it into the show. Such as the English heiress who robbed art for her IRA boyfriend.

This is a long review, because of the episode descriptions. But there is so much of interest in these episodes that there's a lot for me to be enthusiastic about.

Episode 1 ""The Big Sting"" On December 22, 2000, two parked cars caught on fire late at night near the National Museum of Stockholm. Since the museum is situated on a peninsula, the snarled traffic effectively kept the police from responding when men stole 3 paintings worth $50 million  and escaped by boat.

Episode 2 ""The World's Biggest Heist"" It was St. Patrick's Day in Boston, MA, and celebrations were noisy and perfect cover for two fake policemen who talked their way into the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. Their robbery of $500 million worth of art was made easy by poor security measures. Geoffrey Kelly, FBI Special Agent, says, ""We continue to get leads on a regular basis."" Because the loot has not been recovered, even with a $5 million reward. This is an intriguing episode because of who was, or might have been, involved.

Episode 3 ""The Forger and the Con Man"" You know how it seems a U.S. spy isn't found out until his woman is unhappy? Well, ""one of the greatest frauds the art world has ever seen"" may never have been discovered but for a woman scorned. This is a great story.

Episode 4 ""The Search for 'The Scream' "" Edvard Munch (pronounced moonk) painted more than one version of ""Skrik"". One could be viewed at the Munch Museum in Oslo, Norway. In the summer of 2004, masked and armed men stole it and one other Munch painting, together worth $100 million.
Munch once described how he came to paint ""The Scream"": ""I was walking along a path with two friends. The sun was setting. I felt a breath of melancholy. Suddenly, the sky turned blood-red. I stood there, trembling with anxiety, and I felt a great, infinite scream pass through nature.""

Episode 5 ""Chasing Czanne"" In 1978, Michael Bakwin and his family were away for the weekend, when someone(s) broke into their Massachusetts home and stole 7 paintings, including ""Bouilloire et Fruits"" by Czanne. It isn't just a painting by a past master, it is known in art history as being the ""foundation of cubism."" I think it's beautiful because of the colors and composition.
This story has a wistful ending, 30 years in the making. That's a long time to wait for your painting.
I've attached a customer image of this painting, which doesn't do it justice. It looks better in the TV show.
Episode 5 has our first meeting with Julian Radcliffe, who runs the Art Loss Register, London, ""an international business that finds stolen works of art."" It keeps a huge database. According to Radcliffe (in episode 13), ""We register about 10,000 [new] stolen items a year, and we have on our database about 180,000 stolen items. And we check over 300,000 items being sold every year.""

Episode 6 ""Den of Antiquities"" In the early 1970's, the island nation of Cyprus was embroiled in a civil war. The country had thousands of displaced people, which was bad news for the church of Panagia Kanakaria. About 1500 years before, its monks had created beautiful ceiling mosaics.  In 1979, two men hammered out the priceless art, even taking photos as proof of from where they got them.
Years later, Peg Goldberg, an art dealer in Indiana, was offered medieval mosaics for sale. She checked Interpol and others and found nothing about them being stolen. It was going to be her find of a lifetime. Instead, as she says, ""My reputation had been destroyed in the process, and people now thought I was an idiot and a crook."" This art theft and recovery turned out to have international repercussions for the art world, dealers and museums.

Episode 7 ""The Lady in Gold"" Gustav Klimt was one of those happy incidences where an artist is rich and famous while he is still alive. He was a celebrity of pre-war Vienna, sought by international patrons for his portraits. The wealthy Ferdinand and Adele Bloch-Bauer commissioned him to paint Adele more than once. The most famous, from 1907, is now known as ""The Lady in Gold"". Adele died young, and the painting was still in Ferdinand's possession when Hitler invaded Austria in 1938. Ferdinand fled, leaving behind a mansion full of priceless artwork.
""The Lady in Gold"" ended up in the Austrian Art Museum. In September, 1998, Maria Allmann, Adele's niece now living in the U.S., started an 8 year-long process of trying to reclaim the Nazi-looted painting. At the time, her lawsuit had no legal precedent. As the 92 year-old Maria says in her interview, ""They were hoping I'd die. I mean, I was old enough.... But I didn't do them that favor.""
This is a fascinating story.

Episode 8 ""The Pharaoh's Head"" Egypt has had a law since 1983 against taking antiquities out of the country. It had little effect on the looting, though. And once people made it to another country, the object was as good as lost. That's why Jonathan Tokeley-Parry ""was confident he was not breaking any British law.""  Over 65 trips to Egypt, his favorite method was to cover a real artifact in plaster to make it look like a cheap reproduction, and bring it home as a tourist souvenir.  This case changed the laws regarding a nation's cultural heritage.

Episode 9 ""Miami Heist"" The small town of La Corua, Spain, has a Museum of Fine Art. In September, 1985, two of its prizes were stolen.  ""It started as one of the most perfect art heists.""

Episode 10 ""The Man Who Stole the Mona Lisa"" On Monday, August 21, 1911, Vincenzo Peruggia, a 30 year-old carpenter, stole the Mona Lisa. No small thing considering she is painted on a board and cannot be rolled up. This story is a lot of fun, actually. And Peruggia became a minor celebrity in Italy, as his wish was to return the treasure to Italy, where it belonged.

Episode 11 ""The Russian Conspiracy"" In August, 2006. the Director of the Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg, Russia, made a dramatic announcement. Over 200 items from the Russian Collection had been stolen. ""All hell broke loose in the press."" This was during Putin's first term as President and it was very unsafe to be suspected of a crime causing embarrassment to the state. Mikhail Shvydkoi, Russian Fed. Agency Culture & Cinematography, comments: ""Of course, everybody have an enemy. If people in their 50s or 60s haven't an enemy, they lived a very sad life.""

Episode 12 ""On the Trail of Moche Gold"" In 1988, looters found and emptied  the 1500 year-old grave of the Lord of La Mina. He was of the Peruvian Moche culture, predating the Incas. Authorities had some photos/descriptions, though, and in 1992, were astounded to find that the largest object, a gold headdress, was included in a Spanish exhibition catalog. I loved Michel Van Rijn's description of this headdress: ""It is cruel and beautiful at the same time and it absolutely talks to you.""
This case illustrates the difficulty in regaining a treasure from another country.

Episode 13 ""The Disappeared"" The history in this episode is fascinating. Christmas Eve, 1980, a group of men entered the Buenos Aires Museum of Fine Arts and stole 16 impressionist works. One witness said a green Ford Falcon was parked outside the museum, which pretty effectively stopped real questioning. Green Falcons were used by the junta's plain clothes secret police.  As journalist Maria Avigmola tells it, ""I will never forget this fear each time we saw a Falcon verde.""

Episode 14 ""The Thieving Don Juan"" Even I have heard of the fabulous gold salt cellar, or saliera, made by Benvenuto Cellini (pronounced Chell eenie). It holds pride of place, with an insured value of $65 million, at Vienna's History of Art Museum. Except for the period when it was held by a man who was having a bad week and basically stole the treasure in an impulsive smash-and-grab.
This is a cautionary tale. Don't steal something famous unless you have contacts who can fence it for you.

There is a lot of viewing in this series, and as a history lover, I really enjoyed it.
