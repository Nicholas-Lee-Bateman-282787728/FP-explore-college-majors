8688640,2,B00PLYU8JS,This show is great and I would recommend it to all animal lovers.  My complaint is with the product description which is not accurate.  You will only receive two discs with six episodes which is ONLY SEASON ONE!  If you are ok with the price for just one season then go ahead and purchase it.  Just an extra note: I thought maybe I got a defective product (missing seasons) so I sent for a new one but the replacement was also just season one.,1457913600,9,443,4.238095238095238
