5661689,5,B00BNWWXR2,Powerful movie!,1414108800,,15,7.0
5661690,4,B00BNWWXR2,"I thought the movie was thought provoking and we see what it is like to become homeless and have to live in a car. I used the film with my Jr. and Sr. High students, stopping the film at various points to ask them thought provoking questions, like where is grace seen in the car, and what would you do if you were in these situations.  The kids loved it.",1393200000,,354,4.057142857142857
5661691,4,B00BNWWXR2,The story line was good.  Reminds you that everyone struggles.  You have to keep faith in someone or something. Dont loose hope.,1380672000,,128,4.7727272727272725
5661692,2,B00BNWWXR2,I was very intrigued with the plot of the movie prior to purchasing it and thought it would really be interesting.  However after receiving it and watching the movie I was not impressed.  It had nothing to do with the movie being 'low budget' but the scripting could have been done much better.  I felt there were 'holes' in the story and some parts of it did not make sense to me e.g.  where did the white family go??? and what happened with the black family when they got the voucher?? we just see them dropping the daughter off.  That could have been developed more (the step up from poverty).  The ending seemed incomplete to me.  The dialogue as well felt unnatural.  I hope as time and experience goes along Christian films should develop a lot more.,1377475200,,756,4.467153284671533
5661693,5,B00BNWWXR2,This video will definitely open your eyes and really make you take notice to the people around you. There are some people who I have actually saw in a situation like this. It is really sad knowing that you're doing all that you can and you're forced into a situation like this. It is a must see movie for the entire family to watch together.,1377216000,,341,4.2615384615384615
5661694,5,B00BNWWXR2,Bought the DVD mostly because my niece is one of the actors in it. Found it was a good movie with good characters and acting.,1376265600,,125,4.04
5661695,5,B00BNWWXR2,This is a movie that needs to be seen by all especially by todays Christian church. We are so caught up in our own motives and agendas that we have been blinded.,1374796800,,161,4.0625
5661696,5,B00BNWWXR2,Love the small budget films and this one was one of the better films I've seen all year. Give it a gander and I think you'll agree.,1369699200,,131,3.888888888888889
5661697,4,B00BNWWXR2,"Just reviewed this film.  Hiding in Plain Sight.
It captures the story of low income families who are living on the street.
How often do we drive by the roadside motels in our own cities.
These are the families who are LUCKY enough to live there...  It will open your eyes to a lost community that is all around us.

this film has a great message but be forewarned it is a lower budget film.  Some of the scripting doesn't play out smoothly...
Yet the message of this film is one that we all need to see and understand.
Something as simple as a hotel voucher can change the life of a family in need.",1369267200,4,599,4.182608695652174
5661698,4,B00BNWWXR2,"This movie was pretty good the only thing is that there is no closure with the white family, however, I think it is trying to say that for lack of better words the white folks got everything. Yet I like that the movie make you think what would I do if I was in that predicament? Its a good one plus my uncle was the executive producer so I suggest you watch it.",1369008000,,361,3.958904109589041
5661699,4,B00BNWWXR2,"PRIDE can keep Anybody down. People care more about themselves than getting the problem solved!
Solve the  problem! I am talking to both the characters in the movie and all those who view the movie. If your family needs food, shelter and it only takes ""Asking' than You ask. I know a couple of homeless people a few are women who do not want to live in any ones home. because they do not want to follow the rules of the shelter or the families they know WHO WOULD!! take them in. One was married and is estranged from her own children because of her pride. Even in this movie if they would ask the church the pastor his mom they would have bought him boots!! steel toed boots so he could get a job!. On the other hand when depression hits,...you loose the ability to think.",1497744000,,773,4.258503401360544
5661700,5,B00BNWWXR2,"I found it a bit confusing at first. I wasn't sure what was going on or what to expect, from the way the movie started out. I came back to it and kept watching. It all unfolds and is actually a really good movie. I don't agree with everything going on in the movie, but it's still a very good show. Mm, well, I say that I didn't agree, and I didn't, but it all sort of made some turns and turned out really well. I really liked most of the characters in this movie. I thought they were very good actors and really brought some things to life.
Did anyone else catch at 58:20 where the lady officer said they were pulled over because they failed to signal ""100 *yards*"" before their turn. Last I checked, it's 100 *feet*. :)",1497484800,,722,4.127659574468085
5661701,5,B00BNWWXR2,"My first thought, where is the Christian church in all of this? Maybe that is the message.  Have they just become feel good clubs with self absorbed members? I have an easily found 20 year old local website for struggling people where I give out a $50 Walmart gift card any day of the week. Though they have little, most folks today find me using a cell-phone on their hand or at their forehead.

With email, I do this give away anonymously because often I give out extra, some unexpected amount of cash. No I am not rich but was once a single parent and very poor back in the 70s. My faith is based upon doing something, not rituals and idols. All of the families in this movie get a big hug from me as I have known you.",1497484800,,721,4.142857142857143
5661702,5,B00BNWWXR2,Really great show.  I spent a few years researching and interviewing people in the USA who had become homeless. Most had done everything in their lives right and had done nothing that should have caused such an outcome. This story is part of it.  There is a lot more...but what a great education for many people who know nothing about the homeless in our country.,1496793600,2,363,4.569230769230769
5661703,4,B00BNWWXR2,"Inspiring story from anywhere and everywhere USA. Some wonderful acting - thought I was watching a Tyler Perry movie!! Always be thankful for family, education,.....",1496534400,,165,5.64
5661704,5,B00BNWWXR2,"Excellent, I am thankful for my life.",1496534400,,37,4.428571428571429
5661705,5,B00BNWWXR2,"There are so many people with the same story.  Unfortunately, many people don't have the same outcome as the characters in the movie and some have much better outcomes.  People don't realize how Pride can truly impact their lives in a negative way.  But when you surrender, Let Go and Let God things start to fall into place.

Kudos to the writer",1496448000,,346,4.532258064516129
5661706,4,B00BNWWXR2,Nice movie.  A real story.  Suitable for the whole family. Nice change from the usual Hollywood garbage.,1495929600,3,104,5.0588235294117645
5661707,5,B00BNWWXR2,"Dear God - It so REAL in today's TIMES, 2017.... I almost could reach out and touch the screen.  I could see how many folks watching this would have mix emotions.  You don't know whether to be Angry or Happy!  It could and would shake all your foundation in LIFE, even to Believing that God would see you through it ALL.  Only Folks that are truly walking the LIFE understand - And its MANY ... to many in today TIMES.

5661708,5,B00BNWWXR2,This is a great movie from start to finish.,1492646400,,43,3.888888888888889
5661709,3,B00BNWWXR2,"I have mixed emotions about this movie. Honestly, I don't know what to think. I'm torn between hating it and liking it. The movie made me want to go help anyone in need. I didn't like the fact that they were living out of their car and had to struggle. I did not like the fact that the father had so much pride that he would not accept help from anyone and they had to live out of their car for six months. But at the same time I understand that he was scared that he would lose his family if anyone found out. What is so sad about this movie is it is real life for many people. You never know what is going on with people in their lives. So many people are homeless and go to public restrooms to clean up. I wish more could be done for our homeless in America. And more grants and more money could be donated to helping people and their families get back on their feet after a tragedy happens. What happens when you get sick and start losing your home and your job because the bills and medical bills become to much to pay? I think the movie did a good job of showing America what happens. I just hope that this is a wake up call for many people to be thankful for what you have because everyday is not promised. Sometimes, there is a misconception going on that makes some people think the homeless is lazy or drunkards. Life happened and when you don't have a job to provide you with money, this can happen to anyone. I think the movie will be good to watch to keep us humble and thankful. But let me warn you that it will be sad and hard to watch at times. But I liked the fact there were teachers that cared. And I think the movie just wants people to care. We need to pay attention to others and help them and not look down on them. When life happens...we can help.",1489708800,6,1771,4.048433048433049
5661710,5,B00BNWWXR2,"This movie was so realistic for me, as I manage a program for homeless individuals and families.  It was a very good depiction of a family struggling to stay hidden so they can keep the family intact, and how they also struggle just to find the resources available to them.  Very good movie.",1485820800,,291,4.471698113207547

8571791,4,B00BNWWXR2,"This was a decent movie with a positive message.  It detailed faith in God and Christian values while definitely teaching a lesson about the sin of pride.  The story is about Darius and the Blackmon family who are living out of their car due to rough financial times.  Darius is a proud man, who wants to follow God's ways and take care of his wife and two children.  Unfortunately, he is out of work and the family found themselves living in the car for 6 months.  I liked that the film showed some of the small difficulties people in this situation face, such as where to shower, shave, or use the bathroom.  It detailed how the children dealt with the situation as well, such as the daughter having a friend bring her a sandwich and a change of clothes to school so she wouldn't be wearing the same thing every day.  The title was very appropriate, because that is in essence what the family was doing- hiding in plain sight of everyone around.
I only gave the movie 4 stars for a few reasons.  First, we never find out what happened to the white family that was living on the street after they got the hotel voucher.  I think some closure would have been nice, since they were likable characters that we got to know throughout the beginning of the film.  Second, Darius was frustrating at times because of how ridiculous his pride was- such as offering to give $500 to the pastor at church when he barely could feed his family.  He also had a grandmother who raised him who didn't seem rich, but who liked to cook and visit with the kids- so why not be honest with her as she could have helped with food and getting him the steel toed boots he needed to get a job and back on his feet.  Finally, with both Darius and the wife being able bodied and not suffering any mental illness or substance abuse, I couldn't understand why one or both didn't find a minimum wage job at McDonald's to pay for food and the boots?  I know that's not glamorous work, but it might have provided a few things in the meantime.  I understand the point of the movie was to to illustrate the difficulties of being homeless and the evil of pride- of that it did a great job.  Overall, it was a good family friendly film that makes you think and be grateful for what you do have in life.",1529625600,,2266,4.311320754716981
8571792,5,B00BNWWXR2,My five girls and I completely enjoyed this movie!!! It was a real look at how god can change things when we go to him in prayer. One of the things that really hit home was the homelessness that those two families were dealing with and how pride can sometimes be in the way of a blessing waiting to come. My daughters were quite moved by this movie and we have added it to our watchlist. I highly recommend it!,1529452800,,410,4.1375
8571793,5,B00BNWWXR2,I thank God I was able to watch this movie. I needed this at this moment. This put things into perceptive. Thank God in Yahshua's name. Amen.,1520035200,,141,4.2592592592592595
8571794,2,B00BNWWXR2,"The film is a drawn out story of being homeless and living in a car.  It does show the pain and hurt of being homeless.
It's way too slow moving.  I almost couldn't get through the movie.  At times the film was hard to follow and the story was boring.
I can't recommend this movie.",1515024000,,281,4.072727272727272

8571798,5,B00BNWWXR2,"It is difficult to watch a movie about homelessness from ones own perspective because we all handle difficult situations differently.  Watching this movie a person would say to themselves, I would do this, I would do that.  This should serve notice to most of us that we are all just a step away from homelessness depending of circumstances beyond our control.  In this case, pride got in the way of asking for help.  A family needs to stay together and asking for help could cause the children to be taken away.  It is a difficult situation.  If relatives take homeless family members in, those homeless people need to share in the chores, and follow the rules of the house, save their earnings so they can get out on their own again and learn to live way beneath their means so this does not happen to them again.  It is far better to own a mobile home that is paid for than a $300,000 home that one cannot even afford the taxes and insurance on.",1498521600,,948,4.413793103448276
8571799,5,B00BNWWXR2,"Very good movie.  I have a desire to go and help the homeless, this movie makes that desire stronger, to go and do that...  Been there, years ago, did not have any children though.  Thank You for this movie...  :)",1498435200,,213,4.25
