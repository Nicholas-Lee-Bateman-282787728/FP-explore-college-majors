4386657,5,B004IH63PM,"See what paradise really looks like.
Great movie about hippies in Hawaii.
A great character study of a truly eclectic group of people experiencing a modern day paradise.",1417737600,2,169,5.071428571428571
4386658,4,B004IH63PM,"A fun film to see . . . especially if you are of the 60's generation.
Ahhhh, to have enjoyed the camp during it's heyday.",1412467200,,121,3.88
4386659,5,B004IH63PM,"Great film that evokes the experience of 60s hippies, the courageous one's of the generation who escaped to a utopian  ideal.  I visited there and this film and the book, accurately depicts the time, the people,  and  the vision.",1409011200,2,229,4.794871794871795
4386660,5,B004IH63PM,Brought back memories of the 60s and 70s and the joyous hilly days when we were hopeful and believed that we could create a simpler more loving lifestyle away from the corruption. I forgot how much fun those days were.,1394928000,3,218,4.475
4386661,5,B004IH63PM,Very interesting & had some humorous moments. I ordered it because a good childhood friend was in it and I was curious about her life in Kauai. What an adventure she had!,1382745600,,170,4.34375
4386662,5,B004IH63PM,"I live on Kauai and was here when 'Taylor Camp' took place, but even if you weren't this film is beautifully done.  It totally captures a movement in the 60's and if you were around then, so many memories come back of the ""feeling in the air"" of the times. Plus the added bonus of beautiful Kauai and it's natives. Love, love this film.",1380672000,5,336,4.25
4386663,4,B004IH63PM,Very interesting piece of history. Visited Kauai last spring. The location of Taylor Camp is like paradise at the beginning of the Napali coast.,1357776000,,144,5.041666666666667
4386664,5,B004IH63PM,"You have to appreciate the 60's and 70's to appreciate this movie. Those were the times of change and boy was it. This goes through from beginning to end on how they separated themselves from main stream society. They were very clever in how the surrvived and the openness of their life style. The misunderstandings of people looking on. It took me back to those times and I truly wish I would have been there at that time.

If you don't like the movie as far as the peoples lives went you will absolutely adore the scenery. It is gorgeous. Every turn on that island is simply paradise. So, you will enjoy all of the beauty for sure. I do recommend this highly. But, I would rent it first if you're not sure.",1350777600,2,708,4.323308270676692
4386665,5,B004IH63PM,"...on a remarkable subject.  I'd highly recommend this to anyone who is even slightly curious about Hawaii in the 1970s and/or the countercultural happenings in the US during that time.
All of the people profiled are engaging, and the atmosphere this beautiful doc creates in telling the story is potent.  Given our current times, watching the tale unfold makes one feel that
it must have taken place in a different country.  Well, perhaps it did.",1342051200,4,447,4.933333333333334

8430695,5,B004IH63PM,"A really entertaining and honest film about the 8 years of Taylor Camp on Kauai.  I really wish in this case, I was born 10 years ahead of schedule.  Like many others I would have been right there. Both the DVD and the book are great viewing, but offer those who were unable to participate in communal living a glance back into the past. The films producers did a fabulous job. If you have not seen Taylor Camp the film, check it out!",1475107200,,434,4.216867469879518
8430696,5,B004IH63PM,A very interesting part of our history.,1469404800,,39,4.714285714285714
8430697,5,B004IH63PM,Absolutely fabulous work that documents that period of time while Taylor Camp was in existence. For those of us who passed through during those years it does bring back fond memories of that idyllic life. It is very well done. I heartily recommend it to everyone who is interest in exploring the Taylor Camp fanominum.,1457049600,,318,4.8
8430698,4,B004IH63PM,Good documentary. A bit pricey. Documents with a little bias an interesting piece of Hawaii history.,1443398400,,100,5.3125
8430699,5,B004IH63PM,"A beautiful documentary (DVD) that captures a magical experience that developed spontaneously, and like Woodstock, could probably never be replicated. By the end of the film I cared very much about all the ""campers"" whom I had gotten to know, and had a hunger to know what they were doing today. Happily, the movie fills in those blanks.
John Wehrheim's black & white photography is gorgeous, and brings to life the spirit of the community. Kudos to all the campers, who permitted the use of photos that were often as vulnerable as they were striking. Both the sexuality and the innocence of the camp shone through. I also enjoyed the balanced nature of the story-telling, hearing from both campers and from people in the surrounding Kauai community. Through the many recollections of the campers, both highlights and shortcoming of the camp were brought to light. By the end of the film, I was deeply moved by the portrait of Taylor Camp, and by the people who had lived there 40 years ago. My favorite line from the documentary was from the man who said that the values he had taken from Taylor Camp and brought back to the mainland, made him ""a better person every day.""",1438646400,3,1173,4.699029126213592
8430700,5,B004IH63PM,Gave as birthday gift. Can't wait to watch it myself!,1437264000,,53,4.4
8430701,5,B004IH63PM,"Tho this movie will, and has, resonated with baby boomers and very liberal people through the entire socio-economic spectrum, this movie is really for the people of Hawaii - a time capsule of old Hawaii and the impact Camp Taylor had on a paradise of old lost.  A few tears welled up during some scenes in the movie.  There's no way, people could ever hope to live like this in this day and age.  It's arguably the best documentary movie I've ever seen.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone!",1431388800,3,514,4.494623655913978
8430702,5,B004IH63PM,Very informative,1427673600,,16,7.5
