1646997,1,B00005QAS3,"I purchased this double for Richard Boone's performance.  Unfortunately, the movie was terrible and his much vaunted performance was not comparable to many of his other films and his iconic TV personna, Paladin.  The production itself is also very poor.  Looks like a copy off a poor VHS tape which has seen too many days.  If you're into quality westerns just re-watch The Searchers and give this a complete miss.  I gave it one star for Richard, the film and the DVD transfer are not even worth a star.",1317427200,,504,4.617977528089888

1647001,3,B00005QAS3,"Fictional, haphazard account, poorly plotted, but with enough character interest to keep it alive, throughout the many horse chases. Scenery not up to par.  Otherwise, time consuming and with the typical Custer finale ...CRH",1212019200,9,224,5.588235294117647
1647002,1,B00005QAS3,"Rebecca: ""This is so bad it's almost good"".

Enid: ""This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again"".

You could make a pretty good case that this silly little 1954 movie represents the bottoming out of Hollywood. There had been and would be worse movies, super-cheap independent productions and exploitation films by second tier studios, but it is unlikely that a top studio like United Artists has ever been associated with something quite this God-awful.

""Sitting Bull"" was intended as a historical epic (or at least a modest budget example of one), another in a fast growing line of movies dealing with the Battle of Little Big Horn or Custer's Last Stand. What is amazing about Hollywood is their continued unwillingness to tell the straight story about the engagement, as the true events of this military action have generated a sustained interest for over 130 years. Like the James gang's raid on Northfield, Minnesota, the true story is far more interesting that any of the embellished movie versions. If Hollywood is going to distort the events then they should change the names and call it by its correct name, fiction.

I've seen most of these Hollywood efforts and ""Sitting Bull"" is pretty much in a class by itself in the distortion department. Curiously, it appears that a fair amount of historical research went into the production as recognizable names are bandied about throughout the movie but rarely are they linked to the individual's real actions. A relatively obscure officer like Miles Keogh, who was killed with Custer, is a character in the film but his rank is incorrect and he not present at the climatic battle.

Earlier comments point out the most absurd of the movie's inaccuracies and distortions. It is certainly sympathetic to the Indians as Hollywood was actually remarkably quick to adopt this attitude. But even here there are distortions as the film specifically shows the Chief ordering that brave dead troopers not be desecrated. In fact the Indians stripped the bodies and went into mutilation frenzy at the conclusion of the fighting.

Dramatically the film is flat with Dale Robertson wooden as the lead actor (too bad they didn't use Cliff Robertson instead). Mary Murphy (""The Wild Ones"") is his love interest and Douglas Kennedy is Custer.

Indian sympathizer Major Bob Parrish (Robertson) sacrifices his Army career and his romance because of his Indian sympathies. He stands in the way of greedy prospectors who want the Indian Territory opened up so they can search for gold. This was actually Custer's position but in the film Custer is portrayed as a rabid Indian hater.

Murphy's relationship with Robertson is unintentionally hilarious and devoid of  basic logic. So if you are forced to watch this thing, you can at least look forward to their scenes for some much needed (if unintentional) comic relief.

""Sitting Bull"" doesn't limit its social conscience factor to the red man, Parrish finds time to free a runaway black slave Sam (Joel Fluellen) from prison. It turns out that Sam has lived with the Sioux and he takes Parrish to their camp for a peace conference. The mad dog Custer messes up his efforts by disobeying President Grant and attacking the Indians at Little Big Horn. Of course nothing like this actually happened. Nor did Custer find himself standing up in the middle of a flat piece of prairie as the Indians rode around and around his command like it was a wagon train in an early Hollywood western. How do you say pathetic in Sioux?

Than again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1185148800,4,3563,4.872727272727273
1647003,1,B00005QAS3,"amazing how a movie about sitting bull can have a white man as the star and the title man is really just a costar! as history this worthless and as adventure it does a little better,but not much!

1647004,1,B00005QAS3,"I was shocked the quality of this DVD was so bad.  One wonders why a company would even attempt to market something so bad, unless it is merely to make a few extra bucks.  Unfortunately, once bitten, twice shy.  I would be very skeptical on purchasing any more DVD's from Alpha.  Suffice it to say, they put more money into their catalog than the product featured in the catalog.  My 8mm home movies from the early 80's were better quality.",1138752000,12,440,4.45
1647005,1,B00005QAS3,"Just watched this on TCM.  It is amazing that somebody made a movie where President Grant and Sitting Bull were going to sit down together between the two armies and discuss peace, but that Custer screwed the whole thing up on purpose by disobeying orders and attacking the indians while Grant was waiting to be taken to the meeting place.  It is certainly sympathetic to the indians, and a bit ahead of its time in 1954 in this respect.  Sitting Bull chides one of his braves not to scalp Custer because we do not scalp brave men who died in battle.  I recommend that you watch ""Little Big Man"".",1137888000,4,596,4.440366972477064

any video I've seen, compared to what has been written.  Dale Robertson did a magnificent job in his role as the major who
tries to find justice for the indians.  I haven't seen Robertson in many romantic roles such as this.  Mary Murphy becomes Mrs. Robertson in real life for a short short time in 1956.  I would recommend this video if you like westerns.",1021161600,3,550,4.46

1647126,3,B00005QAS3,"Sitting Bull, 1954 film

This is a Hollywood History of the Indian Wars on the northern Great Plains after the Civil War. This is a romantic drama set in a Cavalry fort. There were no wooden palings, guns prevented any attack. You can find the true facts in a good history book, such as the recent biography of George Armstrong Custer. Custer, like other soldiers, only followed orders. Custer was in disfavor in the spring of 1876 for testifying about War Department scandals before a Congressional Committee. The movie They Died With Their Boots On was a better history about the youngest General in the US Army (promoted at age 23). Without his death in battle at age 36 he would be no more remembered than the other two Cavalry Captains who were also promoted to General in June 1863. Enjoy this movie as dramatic entertainment, it is not an education documentary. Before the 1950s Custer was regarded as a hero by most Americans since the 1860s. This film is an example of the propaganda used to change peoples perceptions, the mind control that goes on still.

There is a quote from one of Custers writings about how if he was a Sioux Indian he would prefer to live free on the open range rather than be cooped up in an reservation. Some say Custers body was not mutilated like the other 265 soldiers who died at the Battle of the Little Big Horn because he married the sister of an Indian Chief the year before. Or was this said to spare his widows feelings? Sitting Bull was a Medicine Man or advisor who probably spoke no English then. Chief Crazy Horse was the famous leader in this war. The Sioux nation allied itself with the other tribes to create the largest Indian Army that ever existed in North America. These other tribes were enemies and rivals of the Sioux, but allied with them against a common enemy after the Sand Creek massacre. Days earlier they defeated another Army General, but Custer was never informed of this. Custers big mistake was to underestimate the strength of his enemy, and their new tactics. Around 1794 there was another General who was defeated in battle, about 1,200 of his soldiers were killed. Those who were captured alive were tortured to death. This event is still censored from school textbooks today.

The Army enforced the treaties by removing white men from Indian lands. [The Little House on the Prairie tells how Pa Ingalls, a squatter, was ordered off Indian lands.] Chief Crazy Horse was invited to a peace discussion afterwards, then killed or assassinated. Sitting Bull joined Bill Codys Wild West Show, then returned to the reservation. He was killed resisting arrest by the Tribal Police. In 1862 a corrupt Indian Agency official started the Great Sioux Uprising in Minnesota when he withheld their promised supplies. The 1876 war on the Great Plains started when the War Department ordered the Sioux to travel to their reservation, even though the snow on the ground made travel impossible. The War Department must have known this. But a successful war could help in the coming election. The Indians had no defense against cannon (the gun that shot twice) that outranged a rifle. Their lands were given to railroads, homesteaders, and gold miners who produced wealth. The buffalo were slaughtered to force the Indians into reservations where they depended on Government issued food. By 1890 the Frontier and the Indian Wars were over. One general (Sheridan?) said there were no Indian wars in Canada because their Indian agents were honest. William Tecumseh Sherman was quoted by a reporter as saying the only good Indian was a dead Indian but strongly denied saying this.",1407974400,,3633,4.800319488817891

1647130,4,B00005QAS3,This is and alright western pretty good cohesive plot. Good scenery that looks realistic for the times. The acting is good and befitting of a 1954 western. And even though they used Iron Eyes Cody to play chief sitting bull who was not of Indian decent at least they director tried to give the Indians some dignity. For this time period this was a huge step forward to show a white man having remorse for the plight of the Indians and it make sense. Their is some okay battle scenes too. So not bad for 54.,1370390400,,506,4.28125
1647131,5,B00005QAS3,A wWELL ACTED AND FINE OVIE...TELLING THE STORY OF A GREAT AMERICAN. SITTING BULL HAD A QUIET DIGNITY AND WAS EXTREMELY EFFICIENT IN HIS DEALINGS WITH OUR GOVERNMENT,1361577600,,165,4.928571428571429
1647132,3,B00005QAS3,"First, I watched the instant video here and there are no problems with picture quality like some people are saying about the DVD. It's a great print and the film is beautifully shot. I'll let others deal with the accuracy of the story. It's true there is quite a bit that does not jibe with the true events. However as just entertainment this is a fun western and native Americans are for the most part given given their due and they are not ""disrespected."" Quite a bit of location shooting and the widescreen lens really do justice to the scenery.",1354492800,,548,4.49
1647133,5,B00005QAS3,This movie has been entered into our Native American collection at our tribal library.  It is a replacement copy and we are so thrilled to find it at such a reasonable cost.,1342742400,,173,4.40625
1647134,4,B00005QAS3,"As his tentative fiance abandons him for not having achieved enough worldly success, the major / captain proves himself to be the bravest, most intelligent and least hot-headed of all of the cavalry.  There's some suspense, humor, action, etc.  Ironically enough, over on AllRovi.com they say this is one of the more historically accurate of all the movies about Sitting Bull.  During the viewing I was assuming I would find this film was way off from actual history and was surprised by that statement.  Whether it is true or not, I could not say.

The guy who plays U.S. Grant is a good choice--dignified and stately.  So is the actor playing Sitting Bull--I think they made a good choice with him too.  Overall I'd say it made for a good watch.  I didn't buy this DVD...  I just VCR'd it on ThisTV and it may be from the same source as the DVD since it seemed slightly out of focus sometimes and a little grainy.  But not bad enough that I stopped watching.",1333238400,,960,4.497109826589595
1647135,1,B00005QAS3,Absolutely the poorest quality video of any product that I have ever purchased. I have downloaded video files from Internet Archive that are 100% better than this product.  I would not award this item with one star if I could have selected none.  It appears like the product was produced using various individuals who did not have the same ability.  On one occasion Custers hair is red and then later it is blond like it should be.  Best guess is it was actually produced outside the US.  This product is not copy protected but I can't imagine anyone would want to copy it.  Unfortunately the story line is probably correct.,1325462400,2,624,4.627272727272727

7950088,4,B00005QAS3,"I like this adventurous story. Dale Robertson's Major Parrish is thoroughly engaging as the hero who tries frequently to help the Native American in their dealings with the U.S. Army at a cost to his career and very nearly his life. J. Carroll Naish, as Sitting Bull, is a scene-stealer at the end, pleading for Parrish's life with President Grant.",1517961600,,348,4.816666666666666
7950089,5,B00005QAS3,The history is in there and I like Dale Robertson. The quality of the DVD isn't good but okay.,1516147200,,94,4.0
7950090,1,B00005QAS3,This DVD did not play correctly I am not sending back I live in rural area and not worth time and effort,1515283200,,104,3.772727272727273
7950091,3,B00005QAS3,"This story is one that shows the Native American point of view fairly. Dale Robertson play a US Cavalry officer who tries to keep the peace. However the story is highly fictionalized as supposedly Robertson playing Major and later captain Parrish goes to Washington D. C, and talks General Ulysses S. Grant into a peace treaty meeting with Sitting Bull in the Black Hills. However before Grant can arrive, General Custer disobeys his orders and attacks the Indians. The battle of Custer's Last Stand was nothing like the real battle at all, with the Indians riding around Custer and his command in a circle like riding around a circled wagon train. They do not show anything even remotely close to the real battle. They don't show anything of Benteen and his men or the attack on the Indian village. I will say most of the Indians were well costumed in correct clothing for the Sioux and other tribes that followed Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse. Iron Eyes Cody who plays Crazy Horse was in charge of providing cast and costuming for the Native Americans. However Sitting Bull was played by a white actor, J. Carroll Naish. He did a good job of it and the make-up was good. Other chiefs and braves looked to be authentic Native Americans. The script was not well written, nor was the director job anything to rave about. It was filmed in  Ciniema-scope best viewed in widescreen only. Color has faded over the years, but scenery was very good. It was an entertaining yarn not to be confused with true history except for the white man's incursion into the Black Hills looking for Gold which was not supposed to happen because of the Peace treaty signed with Chief Red Cloud and the Sioux. Also the conduct on the man in charge of the Little Rose Bud reservation cheated the Sioux out of the food and other things they promised so he could sell the items to make himself rich while starving the Sioux on the reservation. I know this did happen on several so called Indian reservations, but I'm unsure if this was one of them or not, but I would say it is most likely correct. Parrish the main character is a work or fiction. The best I can say about the movie is it did shed a good light on the Native Americans and was mostly from their point of view. Dale Robertson who starred as Parrish had a beautiful head of hair. Maybe one of the best in Hollywood at the time. I do enjoy his acting. If you watch this not as history but pure entertainment then I would recommend it if you enjoy cavalry movies.",1507766400,2,2498,4.49010989010989

7950094,2,B00005QAS3,"Pure fantasy... no indian is this stupid and these is not the indian way .... pure liberal BS.... the battle of little Bighorn didn't go down this way at all.... so you can't say this is historical... now if you consider it to be fantasy (which it is) then it's a story based very, very loosely on truth (very few general big picture facts actually in this movie) and made into a fantasy tale with Indians misrepresented, indian perspectives blindly misrepresented... and white character parts wholly fictional only loosely abusing real names ....",1500163200,,547,4.89247311827957
