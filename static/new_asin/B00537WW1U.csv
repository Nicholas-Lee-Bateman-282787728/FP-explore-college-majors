8623614,5,B00537WW1U,"I was at the original screening of this video while visiting my brother in Texas.  It was extraordinary.  I had no idea of the rich culture and history preserved on these literal islands of natural resources. It starts with Spanish land grants evolving to ranches the size of Rhode Island. The video was filled vivid images, with nail biting action with the coastal cattle roundup with modern cowboy helicopters dodging huge wind turbine rotors to more tranquil scenes of family ranch headquarters.  I was inspired to buy western boots.  What a change from Manhattan the concrete jungle where I now reside.  Highly recommended.",1321747200,,627,5.048543689320389
8623615,5,B00537WW1U,"This documentary is beautifuly filmed. It provides excellent insight into the rich heritage of South Texas ranching. The authenticity is confirmed with the well done interviews of direct descendants of the ranches founders and their devotion to the land and its sustainability.
An enjoyable, worthy addition to any Texas history buff's library.",1309737600,,344,5.634615384615385

I love history, I can never get enough TEXAS history; but I am getting closer now!
I have often heard it said, ""that if you don't pay attention to history, it's bound to repeat itself.""
Trust me, this is one time when it is obvious that ""repeating"" is crucial and of the utmost importance for future generations of TEXANS;  my thanX to the creative presentation and all involved. This is what Texas is about!
GOD Bless Texas!
