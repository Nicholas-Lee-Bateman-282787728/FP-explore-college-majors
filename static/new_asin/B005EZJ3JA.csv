4670159,4,B005EZJ3JA,"My daughter LOVEDDDDD ""Meet the Fairies"" that we got for $4.88 at Walmart, and watches it a LOTTTTT. In fact, when she is having temper tantrums, I sing her some of it and she calms right down. So, I got this one (because I now know the entire script AND all the songs to ""Meet the Fairies"", by heart, and needed a change), and its pretty cute! The songs are a little slower, so she is not QUITE as interested, but she still likes it. I recommend the series... HIGHLY. My daughter is 15 months old and now tries to sing along and dance to ""The Fairies"". It literally has taken her love of music to another level.",1338854400,,612,4.194915254237288

4670161,5,B005EZJ3JA,We purchased this for our 2 granddaughters ages 3 and 4. They love dressing up like Fairies and dancing to this video. They enjoy singing along with the Fairies on the video. Pretending to be little fairies. We got them costumes to go along with the video. We were glad to find this video on Amazon. I had first rented it from Red Box and they watched it 20 times at least. I know we will get hours of enjoyment watching them dancing away.,1332720000,,439,4.238095238095238

4670163,5,B005EZJ3JA,"I thought this DVD was tacky and silly but wow!  The children in my summer camps loved this! They loved the fairies house and how they sent the mail to their friends. The songs were soothing and the tap dancing was fun.  The children liked trying to dance along.
I highly recommend this for girls ages 4- 9.",1412121600,,307,4.275862068965517

4670172,5,B005EZJ3JA,"This is the third fairies video I bought for my daughter's 3rd birthday.  We have watched all of them, and although we love this one it doesn't get as much viewing time as the Meet the Fairies and Fairy Fun videos.  This storyline feels a bit more forced.  Even so, the tunes are cute, the dances are well choreographed, and we enjoy this video a lot.  That goes for me, my 3 year old, and my 6 year old.  Even my husband has been known to get one of these songs in his head and start belting it out while cooking!  LOL!",1377216000,,520,4.049019607843137
4670173,5,B005EZJ3JA,Easy choreography for my 4 year old dancing queen to follow. She loves all the Fairy videos and their characters. My only complaint is that there is just too much pink! LOL,1370390400,,172,4.40625

4670179,5,B005EZJ3JA,"THis video is super huge fun because these ladies are having such a grand time. They are very much in touch with their inner child who is happy and not afraid to show it or shy to be dancing on camera.  I will buy more by these ladies or rent it at my local library. They dance slower on this tape and it is easier to follow along with them.  The guys in the video are so much fun to watch also.  It is a 5 star dvd and
the set is beautiful!",1362268800,,441,3.7204301075268815

8469331,1,B005EZJ3JA,The most god-awful children's dvd I've ever seen. Do yourself a favour and never welcome it into your home,1438560000,,106,4.631578947368421
