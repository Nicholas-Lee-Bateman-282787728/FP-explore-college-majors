All else bad acting, bad writing, bad casting. The leading lady was pathetic. What could have been a good story was butchered.",1400544000,,263,4.739130434782608
4129879,2,B003JHXS7S,"This movie had a very obvious story line -- everything that happened was totally predictable.  With the exception of a one maybe two minor characters, this movie was poorly acted -- perhaps partly because the script was so weak.  There was no chemistry at all between the two main characters.",1388793600,,292,4.82

4129882,2,B003JHXS7S,"It is exceedingly rare that I give a 1 star review. The movie has to be god awful. While this film wasn't exactly that, it still wasn't very good. I can understand that a low budget movie is going to have significant limitations, but that does not excuse a lot of what's wrong here.

The acting was, to put it nicely, subpar. Natasha Lyonne did as good a job as you could expect and she did shine a little from time to time. However, it felt like the lack of acting chops from the players around her made her performance seem lackluster. Vincent Pastore did a decent job as well. It almost felt like these two actors wanted to do a friend a solid and agreed to act in this film. Unfortunately, the other actors just weren't very good. The actor playing Oliver came in as over the top and it felt as if he were trying too hard. Scott Elrod was alright. His acting wasn't terrible, but I think the script really made his character seem one dimensional. The actor playing the creepy neighbor was just awful.

The script right from the start is chalk full of idioms. While some seemed well placed within the context of the dialog, many of them were bunched so close together that it felt like the writer ran out of things to say so they just threw them in to make the scene flow. Some of the dialog was alright, but often times as the actors performed their lines the action just didn't mesh well with the script. Through most of them film, I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable listening to the characters are they spoke to each other, even when the story wasn't in an awkward moment.

The production values for the film are quite low and often times feel as if they were contrived on the spot. This did not play well with the continuity of the movie. One example of this is when Desi's character goes home and finds a neighbor in her room. The room is set up in a particular way and the doorway is very unique. Later on though when another visitor comes to see her, the doorway changes completely and her room is not only rearranged differently, but her furniture has changed.

The quality of the film itself is questionable. I know a lot of newer, ultra low budget movies are shot digitally as it's much more affordable than film, but the cameras used did not produce an authentic cinema feel. I have seen some very low budget films where the texture and grain are still present in the presentation which gives it that unique feel, but this movie lacked that. At times, it almost felt like I were watching video at 30fps and not a film shot at 24fps (24fps is pretty much an industry standard in movie making while 30 is normal for home videos). The cinematography was boring and uninspired. There were a few shots that I liked such as when Desi was standing in the fish market as the camera slowly zooms in on her. Her expression was fairly well acted and I'd hoped they'd try more shots like this, but they didn't.

I wanted to like the film. I really did. It's a tale that's been told before, but sometimes it's fun to see how someone else can tell the story. You want to see how they can change things up a little and reimagine what we've probably already seen. Elika Portnoy tries hard here, but it just didn't quite work out the way she intended. I'm not writing her off though. Hopefully, she can take this experience and apply her newfound wisdom to her next project. The next time around I would try for actors with a little more experience as far as the supporting cast goes and hope that my new selections don't try to oversell their characters. Sometimes subtly works far better than throwing your character at us. Let's hope next time the effort is more focused and can stir more emotion than this excursion did.

4129883,2,B003JHXS7S,"Only reason why I purchased movie was because I am big fan of Scott Elrod. Movie was excruciatingly awful but for the acting of Scott - whose performance, in my opinion was the only redeeming feature.",1364169600,,200,4.583333333333333
4129884,4,B003JHXS7S,"My expectation of this film was a simple chick-flick Pygmalion story with bad adaptation to the screen and even worse acting. My hope was to have a little noise in the living room while I ate dinner and then did some reading.

The story is not particularly earth shattering and follows the typical Pygmalion theme. There are some interesting and entertaining tidbits and a few truly funny scenes. The overall plot is readily anticipated and involves only a few minor twists which are not surprising but nonetheless entertaining.

The film features several newcomers and a few established actors also. The male lead is Scott Elrod and this is his first major role in a film. The female lead is Elika Portnoy. She also wrote the screen play and produced the film. Vincent Pastore and Natasha Lyonne are among the established actors in the film and their contributions carry several of the weaker scenes.  Predictably, there is no great character development but fortunately the film assiduously avoids caricature and triteness.

There is no nudity or overt violence to justify the R rating, but some elements of dialog seem to have elicited it. While a few phrases may startle the more puritanical, most middle school hallway conversations would be far more offensive.

Should you decide to watch the film, pay close attention to scenes and dialog which foreshadow future elements of the film. For many this will result is a hearty chuckle if not a good laugh. Filming was done in Boston and for those who know the city the location scenes are very nice.

I found the film surprisingly watchable, entertaining and worth a second viewing. More from Elika Portnoy is welcomed. Her followup film 'Immigration Tango' shows significant development both as an actor and screenwriter.",1334275200,4,1775,5.0

Her love story with her photographer,is not appealing or dreamy ,there's no chemistry between them . This movie sucks and makes no sense,it's stupid,cliche.

Overall a good movie and I would watch it again just to watch Natasha's and Jordan's characters.  It was good to see Vincent Pastore again, too.  The industry needs to cast Scott Elrod in some roles that have some meat to them.  He seems talented and that should be showcased.",1404000000,2,453,4.6835443037974684
