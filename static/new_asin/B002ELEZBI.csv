8367828,3,B002ELEZBI,"Many outside France will not have heard of Mesrine, but apparently he is a bit of a folk hero to some there. I read about him in 'East End Gangland & Gangland International' which was handy, because if I had not, I would almost have assumed from the film that he was a fictional character (opening disclaimer aside). This is because of the levels of both ruthlessness and audacity displayed by the titular protagonist.

Here lies one of the main problems with the film. While it is well directed and Cassel is always fully switched on, it's hard to give a monkey's about anyone in the film, and certainly not the preening Mesrine himself, who seems ready to kill and maim innocent bystanders (or at least Forest Rangers and journalists) at the drop of a hat. Actually, I was quite sympathetic to the woman and child he abandoned and perhaps that's why I found the prison scene with his daughter one of the stronger ones in the film. Similarly the scene with Mesrine's father in the hospital was nicely done.

Whilst the attempt to evoke the atmosphere of the 70s seemed more or less succesful, and the film as noted above is generally well directed, the interlude in London was set up by a shockingly cliched sequence featuring truncheon swinging bobbies on the beat, red double-deckers, and the Clash's 'London Calling'. An unecessary stylistic jolt.

Ending on a positive note in two senses, the final 20 minutes of the film is very strong and suspenseful, and both acting and direction are very tight here. A powerful ending to an action filled but strangely empty and amoral film.",1377734400,,1584,4.7111913357400725
8367829,3,B002ELEZBI,"I remember vividly in November 1979 when Mesrine was gunned down in Paris. The film starts with this. It appeared to be state sanctified execution. At the time there was chatter amongst some of us left wing socialists that Mesrine was ""political"". Reading Carey Schofield's biography aptly subtitled ""The Life and Death of a Supercrook""-which is most likely all that he was. The film, both parts, are well filmed. The acting (except for the wonky appearance of Monsieur Depardieu in the first film) is competent, especially the lead Vincent Cassel who carries both films. The story is well told although, if Ms Schofield's bio is accurate, somewhat exaggerated. But overall, I was disappointed. Although making an attempt to present the complexity of Mesrine, I think they over cooked the ""master criminal"" lifestyle aspect. Whereas the pig of a human being was well presented. The lack of being there for wives, children, girlfriends. The colossal ego and easy to take offence alpha male were well described and I hope sufficiently off putting for anyone watching who might see Mesrine as a warped role model for kicking out against the state. However, it was the mix of macho sex, violence and excesses of living made this a bit nauseating to watch. Shades of Tarratino saved by that the violence was presented realistically and eventually you were left in no doubt, despite being loved by his daughter, his dad and various advocates, Mr Mesrine was nothing more than a villain in the same league as the Krays, the Camorra and others who see themselves as outlaws but are just bullies with weapons and power to inflict harm. Worth a watch but with some cynicism about the authenticity of what is being presented. By the way, i would give these films a combined 3.5 stars as the film making is better than most.",1366848000,,1812,4.867313915857605

8367832,1,B002ELEZBI,It's a mystery to me when a site like AMAZON plans on getting it together and stops selling stuff like movies that don't play in the U.S. due to the region code!!! Wake up!!! Call me crazy but i think there should be a system incorporated that protects the U.S. buyer and finds that sort of stuff out. Instead they just sell ANYTHING and then the buyer gets stuck with it. THANKS AMAZON!!! One star was given because it's required to review a product. In reality it deserves -5 because it has become a drink coaster.,1313712000,3,516,4.385416666666667
8367833,5,B002ELEZBI,"Even at more than a combined four hours and two films spanning three continents, the hugely ambitious epic crime biopic Mesrine can't fit in all of the exploits of France's own public enemy number one of the 60s and 70s in, but it does manage to combine some exhilarating setpiece robberies, getaways, shootouts, prison breaks and even, bizarrely, a real-life attempt to break into a maximum security prison he'd just escaped from to free the other prisoners alongside an increasingly convincing tendency to undercut Jacques Mesrine's own inconsistency, hypocrisy and hollow self-aggrandizement and self-deceiving rhetoric he constantly conjures up on the spot to play up to the media (admittedly mostly in the second film). Aside from a superb career-best lead performance from Vincent Cassel, there's an especially impressive supporting cast, including familiar faces like Mathieu Amalric, Gerard Lanvin and Gerard Depardieu, lesser lights like Cecile de France, Michel Duchaussoy, Samuel Le Bihan, Olivier Gourmet and Georges Wilson and unfamiliar but perfectly cast faces who still manage to make an impression with brief scenes in a huge ensemble.

Part one, L'Instincte de Mort, sees Mesrine recently demobbed from military service in Algeria. Stifled by civilian life, he drifts into crime and finds that he's good at it, soon finding himself working with the criminal wings of failed terrorists like the SAO and QLF. Even though Depardieu's gangster tells him that crime is a game you can't win, he initially seems to be beating the odds, even balancing a married life with a criminal career before things escalate and he finds himself on the run in America and Canada. Although it hints at the darker parts of France's recent past - not just the torture in Algeria we see him participate in but also an older generation who collaborated with Nazis who now lack the moral authority to be listened to - the first part observes rather than judges, often playing like a superior gangster picture directed with real verve and style by Jean-Francois Richet. But although the real dramatic meat is to come in the second half, Richet and co-writer Abdel Raouf Dafri manage to pull off the feat of being exciting without excusing his more reprehensible acts. We may be carried along with the terrific excitement of a prison breakout and attempted prison break-in finale, but he remains a contradictory, Quixotic figure, as likely to torture a pimp for mutilating a whore as to put a gun in his own wife's mouth to end a domestic argument.

Part two, L'Ennemi Public No. 1, makes more of an attempt to find an explanation and undercuts his myth-making image as he gets caught up in his own impulsive hyperbole and self-deception as he goes from far right to far left without ever believing in anything but whatever he's just thought up to justify himself, no matter how inconsistent it may be with his previous actions. When visiting his father in hospital - while on the run - all he can offer in explanation of his life of crime is ""It's how I am,"" but his victims and partners in crime have a clearer picture. A slum landlord who knocks down his own ransom points out that for all Mesrine's posturing, they're fundamentally similar - both like fine things and don't mind extorting honest workers to get them - while a revolutionary points out that Mesrine doesn't `attack capital,' he flatters it. One cop even accuses him of overacting during his arrest, while at times he seems to reinvent himself in the image an initially infatuated press suggest if he thinks it sounds good - at least until he loses their support when he beats and shoots a reporter. He always has to have the last word, self-justifying and egocentric, constantly left by his sidekicks and partners in crime, and it's pretty clear that he's the architect of his own destruction as he increasingly careers off the rails. Having made his way to Public Enemy Number One, he's determined to play the part to the end while never really taking in what that really means.

There are problems: there's one hysterically funny shot-in-Canada `London' street scene that throws in so many clich&eacute;s - red buses, black cabs, brollies, bowlers and Bobbies - it's like an outtake from an Austin Powers film, and Ludivine Savignier still can't act her way out of a paper bag but at least has nothing to do here as his last moll that's beyond her limited ability. Perhaps more worrying, there are a couple of major sins of omission (inevitable with a criminal career as prolific as Mesrine's), particularly regarding a couple of the more brutal murders he was accused of in the first part that feel like they were removed in case audiences felt less inclined to sympathise with the brutal treatment he receives in prison, but the film does subsequently make amends with further acts of unnecessary violence to avoid turning him into too much of a tabloid hero. But overall there's far more to admire than disappoint here, and it manages to do what Michael Mann's Public Enemies failed to do - explain how and why one criminal caught the public imagination in a vividly realized period setting, carrying you along with the sheer audacity and momentum of his crimes but not overlooking the dangerous character flaws that drove him to his own destruction or the fact that he took plenty of innocent people with him along the way. Easily the best crime film from any country in years.

The UK DVD release includes both films on a two-disc set with excellent 2.35:1 widescreen transfers - and the film itself looks terrific throughout - though with fewer extras (just a 45-minute documentary for each film and a combined trailer for the two) than the BluRay release, which doesn't really show any noticeable improvement in picture quality due to cramming too much onto a single disc.",1284768000,,5840,4.901921132457027
8367834,5,B002ELEZBI,"The French two-part biographical film traces the life of Jacques Mesrine, a real-life criminal and France's ""public enemy number one,"" whose activities remind us of John Dillinger. Vincent Cassel (""The Hate"" ""Ocean's Twelve"") plays Jacques Mesrine. Director is Jean-Franois Richet, responsible for the remake of ""Assault on Precinct 13.""

""L'instinct de mort"" (""The Death Instinct"", 113 minutes) covers the life of Jacques Mesrine, 1959 through 1972. Recently back from the Algerian War, Jacques Mesrine is welcomed by his parents at home, but soon he embarks on a criminal career, hired by a gangster named Guido (Grard Depardieu). While traveling in Spain he meets a beautiful girl Sofia (Elena Anaya) and marries her, but he soon returns to criminal life before fleeing to Canada. The film's highlights include the protagonist's harrowing experiences in prison and his carefully laid escape plans.

""L'ennemi public n1"" (""Public Enemy No. 1"", 133 minutes) opens with Jacques Mesrine, now back in France, in 1973, robbing banks with Michel Ardouin (Samuel Le Bihan). The second part follows the life of ""Public Enemy No. 1,"" who is arrested more than once, but always succeeds in escaping. He also kidnaps a millionaire and even writes ""L'Instinct de Mort,"" autobiographical writing in prison and has it published. The 133-minute film concludes with the last days of Jacques Mesrine, living in a time of political unrest, who claims he is a revolutionary.

The action-paced two-part film has a slightly episodic narrative, which is effective in portraying the complex character of Jacques Mesrine as charming lover and violent killer. The second film is a little overlong and its story repetitious, and though some of the supporting characters are sketchy at best, it is compensated by great acting from the impressive cast including Grard Depardieu, Elena Anaya, Ccile De France, Mathieu Amalric, Samuel Le Bihan, Grard Lanvin, Olivier Gourmet, Ludivine Sagnier and Georges Wilson. The costume designs that reflect the fashion of the 60s and 70s is another plus.

Though the running time in total exceeds four hours, you will never be bored with lots of actions (often violent ones). The two-part film is truly thrilling and Vincent Cassel's fascinating performance as Jacques Mesrine should not be missed.",1270857600,9,2309,5.317808219178082
