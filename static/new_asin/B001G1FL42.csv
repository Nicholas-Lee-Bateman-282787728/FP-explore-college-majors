3594899,5,B001G1FL42,"I've been watching TV for as long as I can remember, and I've never seen a show quite like ""Skins"".

The program centers around a group of teenage friends living in England. They smoke, they drink, they do drugs, they party, they have sex. They do what teenagers around the world do (or more often, especially with the sex part, merely wish they were doing). Pretty standard fare for most teenage dramas, actually, except that since this is British TV, they don't censor everything; you actually get to see bits of the sex, hear lots of the swearing and see quite a bit of naked flesh.

Nothing like a bit of titilation.

But had the show been nothing but titilation, it wouldn't have kept my interest. From the very first episode, I found myself really drawn into the storylines, and coming to like most of the characters. I started to care about them and their lives.

Consider for example the character of Tony. He seems initially to be just a total wanker, but as the show goes you see that he actually has some layers to him, ones he doesn't know are there.

Or consider Anwar, a reasonably devout Muslim who finds himself torn between faith and friendship due to the fact that his best friend, Maxxie, is gay.

Or consider Cassie, an anorexic girl who is falling rapidly in love with Sid, who happens to be in love with Michelle, who happens to be Tony's girlfriend. Who Tony might be in love with the viewer is welcome to guess, though I'm inclined to suspect it's both Michelle and Sid...

Or consider Jal, the sweet young clarinet player. Or Chris, a wonderful young man with more teeth than brain cells. Or Michelle. Or Maxxie. Or Sid. Any of the characters, all the of characters, are fascinating.

The show isn't without its imperfections, of course. It's a bit exaggerated and unrealistic, but who cares? Most TV is. On the other hand, ""Skins"" is daring, entertaining, effed-up and wonderfully brilliant! What other show would've given such a ""WTF?!"" ending to the first series as this one did?

""Skins"" isn't for everyone, but I loved it, and can't wait to own it on DVD!

*** UPDATE ***

So amazingly I got the DVDs today, the day before the street date. I won't tell if you won't tell. :) Because of this, I can answer all the questions we've been wondering. Well, most of them, anyhow. I don't know if the music was left intact from the broadcasts cause I never really paid attention.

Anyhow, the DVDs are not the episodes as they were broadcast here in the USA. They are not censored for language or nudity, which is a plus for those of me who like to see these sorts of things as they were intended!

There is one thing that was completely cut out from the DVDs however. At the end of the last episode of series one, there was this very odd, very surreal moment where the cast, more or less in character, were singing Cat Stevens' song ""Wild World"". Due to copyright issues that entire scene is cut. You get the moments right before and right after, but the scene itself is gone. Happily that's what the YouTube is for and if you go there, you can see the last scene as it was meant to be.

Sadly there's no commentary on the DVDs, but you do get the video diaries and ancillary storylines the Brits got, so that's all good. Overall, a package well worth getting your hands on!",1223596800,68,3297,4.473333333333334
3594900,5,B001G1FL42,"""Skins"" is one of the best ""teen dramas"" in existence, and one of the few for which this label isn't actually an insult. Intelligent, gritty, unpredictable and sporting one of the most likable casts in existence, it's a must-watch, no matter what type of shows you normally like.

BUT the Region 2 DVD editions of First AND Second Seasons are missing about 80% of the original music. It's replaced by cheap ""background"" songs. And the music is a vital part of what makes ""Skins"" so special. Without them the DVDs are only worth so much as the extras on them. I really hope the Region 1 edition will have the normal OST. If that's the case, I'm buying it, even though I already have the UK DVDs.",1221782400,31,694,4.464566929133858

However, be warned this particular version of the first series is not the same as the original.

the strides forward this show makes in the teenage dramedy genre can be compared to that of 'freaks and geeks.' it is a very different type of show from 'freaks and geeks', but like that show, it is full of the love and pain that goes along with growing up. in addition, it is truly funny.

one caveat- this american dvd release does not include the final scene in the finale because they could not get the rights to the song that plays during the seen. this scene is not required to understand the finale, but it is awesome. look up ""wild world skins"" on youtube to see this final scene. otherwise, if you have an all-region dvd player, just buy the british release of the dvd.",1341964800,3,886,4.462962962962963

I'm not sure I've seen a show with such evocative character development.

Where are the parents? Why are these teens allowed to run free and do all that they do? What are the consequences of their actions? There are many questions, and they are terrible role models.

The finale is more than I ever could have asked for in a television episode: thoroughly mind-blowing. If you want intense, emotional, messed-up (not in a this-never-happens way) drama, do it now.

3594939,5,B001G1FL42,"Teenage drama ""Skins"" is about the evolution of misguided teens -- some of them are violent, others are mentally ill, and the rest are just... lost. I started watching ""Skins"" in April 2010, and I became instantly hooked on the series. Not only was it brilliantly structured, well-acted, and extremely bizarre, but the morals were there. I read reviews in the past on the show saying that it was despicable, and that parents and teens should both avoid the series. Trust me, it is revealing, but that is the beauty of the British teen drama: nothing is held back (and I mean nothing!).

Generation One - Classy, wild, determined. The characters were wild, but there was a precedent with the characters. Although they did drugs, had sex, and went to ravenous parties during all hours of the night, they knew it was something they'd outgrow. Some characters did, earlier than others actually, while others didn't. The storylines were based around love, family issues, mental illness, and death.

The show has become so popular that America has adapted the series into a poor, more controversial, MTV series. Not as brilliant as the original, but more depressing. Watching the show becomes like watching reruns of Degrassi or the Skins UK original. Yes, they dubbed the same exact story as the original. Same characters, different names -- except for Tony, Michelle, and of course, Chris. It brought tears to my eyes knowing that America would try to ruin something great by adapting it. The purpose of why the show is so great is because it doesn't hold anything back, as does Americanized shows. So what's the purpose of watching a teen drama, when you know it is a TEEN DRAMA. ""Skins"" may involve teens, but we all know that more adults may appreciate it more than kids do. It deals with ADULT situations. My mom, sister, and brother love it: and they are way older than me!

Season One focuses mainly on character development. The storylines usually begin mid- to second season. Amazing performances by Dev Patel, Larissa Wilson, Hannah Murray, and of course Mike Bailey. Don't get me wrong, the cast is great, these are just some of my favorites.

Whoever found this show before the MTV version should receive a medal of television honor! I have mine so you deserve one too!

This show will live forever in television history, so BUY IT, or, use your credit card to use Amazon Prime for a $1.00 fee for a month to watch all three brilliant seasons, right here! Must have fast internet, and remember to go to your Prime settings to turn the automatic upgrade OFF!

If you are too lazy for all of that, watch it on MotionEmpire.com or Netflix.

Anyway, I just wanted to offer a helpful tip for those of you who purchased Season 1 on DVD but are heartbroken over the deletion of the AMAZING final scene (where Sid and friends sing along to Cat Stevens' ""Wild World"").  If you buy the season or episode from Amazon's ""Video On Demand"" instant episodes section, rather than on DVD, that scene remains totally intact.  :o)  I recommend buying the season that way rather than on DVD - I mean, I honestly can't imagine the final episode having such an impact without that crucial, beautiful scene.  For those of you who bought the DVD, I am truly sorry you got robbed!  Buy the On Demand episode!!  And by the way, the On Demand season is less than one third of the price of the DVD set ... and you can download it to your PC or TiVo!!

3594944,5,B001G1FL42,"Skins encapsulates young adult life like no other show has ever done through compelling characters that, after watching only a few episodes, you'll become totally and completely addicted to. Carried in from the first season (which is equally as great), we follow the lives of a group of teenage friends from Bristol, England who deal with with typical issues from sex and drugs to going to college, parental issues and death. What makes Skins stand out from other young adult soaps (and Skins is a soap, for all inclusive purposes) is how gritty, uncensored and real the subject matter is portrayed. Sex and drugs are shown for what they are, a very big (and not always damaging) part of life for teens/young adults. Social issues (like homophobia) are brutally present and characters show their vulnerability in a way that captivates any young person (or adult) who has dealt with similar topics.

Unfortunately, MTV is remaking the series and will undoubtedly be toned down for American (read: conservative, prudish) viewers and will suffer for it. Actors Nicholas Hoult (Tony), April Pearson (Michelle), Joe Dempsie (Chris) and Mitch Hewer (Maxxie) - just to name a few - are seemingly un-jaded and fresh. You'll wish you were a part of their circle.

3594945,5,B001G1FL42,"Flicking through the channels I saw the part of the Season Two episode where Michelle takes her new stepsister and most of the Skins gang out to a seaside holiday for her birthday.  It looked pretty dire, especially the part where Dev Patel is tricked into skinnydipping while the rest of the boys keep their trunks on.  But, I have never understood British humor, and seeing that Skins is set largely in Bristol I just didn't want to get involved in it.  And yet somehow we started watching Series One, and what do you know, we were instantly hooked after one episode with Nicholas Hoult as Tony, and then the second show with Cassie acting really, really crazy and absent due to her eating disorder.

There's really no US show like it.  There are better US shows of course, but few try for the heights of Skins (nor, for that matter, that plumb its really abysmal depths)...  I don't think, for example, that one instance of parent-child relationships runs at all true in Skins.  All the adults are figures of fun and most of them are louche, disgusting, embarrassing.

That's neither here nor there.  What is with all the mothers, though, who run away from their children, leaving the dads to hold down the fort?  There are only 8 or 9 characters in Skins, and how many of them have their own mothers?  What's that saying about UK society?  Here it would be a culture of absent fathers and wayward children, in Skins the note is set early on when poor Chris wakes up and finds that his mother has left him 1,000 pounds and then made herself scarce.  She just couldn't take it?  Jal's mother too?

Never caught on to Sid (Mike Bailey).  He too must be an acquired taste like Worcestershire sauce or summat.  And Maxxee, the gay boy with a supportive lug of a dad, yeah extremely convincing!  But all in all a great show with three outstanding actors in it....",1267660800,,1861,4.520958083832335

3594948,5,B001G1FL42,"`Skins' is a comedy-drama that follows the adventures and misadventures of a group of community college students.
I classify `Skins' for mature audiences. A mature teen will enjoy the programs. Caution, there is adult language, drug use, and there are sexual situations.  Also `Skins' is not a morality play - `bad' behavior does not necessarily have consequences outside the group of `Skins' characters.
The acting is wonderful, as good as entertainment gets.
Outstanding performances: Hannah Murray, playing `Cassie'. Joe Dempsie, playing `Chris'. I hated coming to the end of the second season, because it was so sad.
I cannot try to rank the characters. The performances of all are extraordinary.
My favorite character was `Cassie'...

3594949,5,B001G1FL42,"OK, so you take your wildest teenage escapades. And then you add them all up. And then times them by a factor of several. At which point you'll be somewhere in the vicinity of one episode of this series about British teenagers growing up in the city of Bristol. Nowhere near as flippant as it may first appear and nowhere near as far off the mark for some people I knew when growing up, this is still a flip out of a show where ridiculous caricatures promenade over the screen in cliched hysterical teenage style while at the same time these self-same characters command your attention as they run smack bang into all sorts of real life dramas such drug use/abuse, sexual awakenings and lessons in love. And that's the lighter bits!

The series revolves around a tight knit group and a few other peripheral members of the crew. The writers of this were certainly spot on regarding the way teenagers clump together for self affirmation and to find a sense of belonging. As the series progresses the characters are fleshed out and the episodes certainly pack a lot into them given how well you feel you know them all by the journeys end.

Of course this sort of stuff isn't going to be everyones cup of tea. These kids certainly can cuss with the best of 'em and the blantant drug use, open homosexuality and narcissistic cod philosophy of some of the characters will all grate with anyone with any puritanical leanings. Or with anyone squeemish about the above topics. Those with more open constitutions or those who can identify with many of the personality types and their motivations will probably get more out of it as will anyone who has known - and perhaps lost - friends and acquantances to the fast lane.

A collection of nicely realised vignettes highlighting a number of social issues all within a madcap not-quite-serious yet not-quite-joking style what won't appeal to all. But some beautifully drawn character and motivation studies of some tragically broken creatures holding it together through collective strength. And if you like this series definitely get series two as well where certain plot threads move ever deeper into the darkness as the solidarity of the group fractures and members get isolated from that group strength and suffer the consequencs.

This is a brilliant series about what it is like to be a teen today. The quality of acting and writing is consistently at the highest level. While the series is not judgmental about lifestyles and sexual preferences, it is very judgmental in well reasoned ways about the fate of the human psyche today. It is entertaining to the point of addictive, beautifully produced, and plotted with many surprises that are never contrived. I admit to a prurient fascination with the Hills, but the Hills is dull and dim witted by comparison. The content is adult and some scenes will push of buttons of puritans. But this is really not to be missed.",1254528000,,921,6.368
3594951,5,B001G1FL42,"I've read all the reviews about the sex and the drugs and the nudity, etc. etc....but that is so not what makes this show stand out.  It's the intelligence and care that is put into every aspect of the production.  I have not seen a tv show about teens handled this well since ""My So Called Life"" was taken off the air.  This show is so beyond the inane drivel that passes for the life of the American teen we get here in The States.

The cast is outstanding.  They are not just a bunch of pretty faces cobbled together with hopes that they will create a following on thier good looks and fashion sense.  These kids are individually interesting. They act like seasoned pros and are given ample room to shine.

And...I have to say the writing was such a huge surprise to me.  As I'm watching each episode, I've come to realize that where an American show would dumb it down, or take one idea or emotional issue and make a full hour of tv out of it, Skins just takes every idea as far as it will go.  Just when you think an episode is about to end it takes off in another surprising and intelligent direction.  The writing and directing is so emotionally precise and magnetic you are just unable to look away.  Each episode is like a mini movie...the level of care on every aspect from character, soundtrack, emotion, writing, directing, cinematography, editing, etc etc is something we just don't get on American television anymore.

My only disappointment is that British tv shows that I love only seem to last about two seasons, which is just so sad.  I could have definitely followed this lot into adulthood. I want to continue to laugh and cry with these kids....they're so interesting to watch.",1253232000,8,1698,4.49185667752443

3594953,4,B001G1FL42,"Thanks to BBCA and DVD, I now have the opportunity to catch up with Britain's hit television series, which may be a bit worse for wear as it travels across the ocean.

I was reluctant to purchase Skins on DVD after reading many complaints over the replacement of music due to licensing issues, most notably the final musical sequence in the finale to Season 1.

I have yet to find a definitive source of information to detail the changes, if any, between the original airing of the shows on British television and the recent broadcast on BBCA, but I have thus far been taking great pains to compare the DVD versions of episodes from both Seasons 1 & 2 with those aired on BBCA.

As far as Season 1 is concerned, aside from the first and final episodes, the DVD versions are musically identical to the versions aired on BBCA. Again, I do not know if the BBCA versions are different from the original broadcasts on E4.

In the series opener, Tony wakes, turns on his stereo and works out to Chingy's ""Right Thurr"", a hip-hop single that has been replaced with a less-than-ideal incidental track on the DVD. Although the song replacement here makes little sense, especially as the scene evolves with Tony's father screaming to compete with the blaring music, it's a minor nitpick and can be overlooked even if it is the opening scene - and, hence, sets the tone - for the series. The real question is whether we believe that Tony would be playing (and working out to) the incidental music on his stereo and if he would use it to distract his father while his sister returns home from being out all night; probably not.

Later, Tony's rendition of ""On the Street Where You Live"" from the show ""My Fair Lady"" has been replaced by an original composition, whose words have been carefully written in an attempt to keep the on screen singers' lips synched with the new vocals. This effort succeeds to a certain extent, but it does not take a sharp eye to notice that the song does not quite match. Still, even this musical adjustment can be forgiven, even if the original song choice does play better leading into the shot of Sid landing on the street where Tony's drug dealer lives.

The only other noticeable musical alteration is, indeed, the most significant and the most aggravating of all. I'm referring, of course, to the notorious ""Wild World"" montage, a sequence that has been completely removed from the DVD version. For a season finale to lose its ""finale"" due to a music licensing issue is a shame, but this instance is an even greater shame in that the deleted sequence lends its episode a powerful punch, surreal as it may be, that is sadly lacking in the edited version. I watched both versions and found myself sobbing uncontrollably during the musical montage and its subsequent bench scene; the bench scene, which remains intact, draws barely a tear when preceded immediately by the shot of Michelle in the bathroom stall.

The montage works on so many levels. It provides stark contrast to the gravity of the scene immediately preceding it; shots of couples with expressions of post-party elation on their faces as they rest in each other's embraces while they remain completely unaware of the tragedy that has befallen one of their companions. It also heightens the emotion of each character performing the song and offers a moment of reflection on all that has gone before in Season 1 while Sid searches desperately for Cassie, who moves toward her own destination. The surreal imagery of this montage cements ""Skins"" as an extremely unique program.

I've only watched and compared the first five episodes of Season 2 but, aside from scenes edited for television (due to sexual content), the musical content appears to be precisely the same between the DVD and the BBCA versions. I did notice that a graphic sex scene between Chris and Angie had been cut for television broadcast, but that's to be expected.

In conclusion: Although I have decided to record the first and final episodes from Season 1 onto DVD from BBCA, I am confident enough to view the remaining episodes as they appear on the DVD.

UPDATE: I have finished viewing Season 2 and can confirm that, between both seasons, only the first and final episodes of Season 1 on the DVD have been altered musically from their respective versions on BBCA.",1245628800,20,4324,4.71523178807947
3594954,5,B001G1FL42,"Skins is a wild freewheeling party of a show that draws you in with the lurid title and hot actors and keeps you hooked with great, sometimes surreal storytelling. If these are typical British Teens than ""God Save The Queen""! Everything in these characters lives revolves around sex, drugs, and partying which surprisingly doesn't instantly make you want to kill most of them. Some are pure evil (Tony) while others are complete angels (Jal), but most are in between young people trying to discover who they are and where they fit. All the adults in ""skins"" are as messed up as the kids, and the realism and care taken developing all the show's characters is commendable when the show probably could have skated by on its hot cast and been a lame 90210 rip-off. Religion, Metal Health, Body Image, Sexuality, Death. All are covered in Season 1. So sad this show's original cast only hung around for two years.

Whether you believe the drug abuse, child abuse, self abuse, friendships, relationships, parties, raves, duffs, people characters actually is a true representation is irrelevant. What is relevant is that everyone can identify to the characters in one way or another. Skins makes you believe in what is Real. It is a Sensation.",1244592000,9,602,4.911764705882353

3594957,5,B001G1FL42,"Rarely do you see a teen drama (or TV show for that matter) with such strong and instant character development. My friends pushed me into trying this series. I expected what you are probably expecting: shallow characters being pushed into cliche situations to the token theme of drugs, sex, and violence. And while there is certainly a fair amount of drugs, sex, and violence... there's also a riveting plotline and a great balance of comedy and drama.

The characters from Skins really come to life, and each one (well Maxxie really gets the short end of the stick in Season 1 but all the others...) get a thorough character examination. You know what they love, what they hate, and you'd be suprised how Skins skirts the predictable checkbox character profile.

I begrudgingly watched the first episode, and about 30 minutes in I was hooked. I made it halfway through Season 1 in a single night because it really hooks you on what is going to happen next.

I also find myself applauding the writers and directors because they seem bound to follow the story wherever it leads, no matter which characters, come, go, die, live... lead character or not, they are all subject to the will of the plotline.

As for it's US appeal... it is going to be a bit shocking to those who aren't familiar with British TV. It's certainly not for kids, and most Americans would consider in inappropriate for teens as well. If it were a movie in the US it would be rated R for sure. That being said the graphic content is organic for the most part and belongs in the plot. For the most part it's got enough mainstream appeal for the target audience on either side of the pond.

3594963,5,B001G1FL42,"Another great British TV import that I hope will gain the status of other well loved Brit programs such as ""The Office,"" ""Spaced"" and ""Absolutely Fabulous.""

US shows like ""Gossip Girl"" look like ""Anne of Green Gables"" when compared to ""Skins.""  Not that ""Skins"" is such a departure from the teen television drama format; it just takes all the issues and situations into new and exciting directions.  Yes, the show is set in an incredibly randy Britain where people are hooking up everywhere you look - as evidenced in a scene where Sid, one of our poor hapless heroes, catches some strange goings on across the way.  But the sex, as shocking as it may be at first, is really only a gateway into the world of these characters.

Each character may seem to be an archetype at first, but as we are introduced to their back stories from episode to episode, they become fully realized.  One particular episode had me veering from hating to pitying then again hating the character of Tony, played by ""About a Boy""'s Nicholas Hoult.  This is melodrama at its best- sure, it's not always believable but the performances keep the show grounded.

My favorite characters are Sid and Michelle.  Despite much attention being given to this show now that Dev Patel has become much more well known, Patel's character is more comic relief than always at the forefront, but he does show the promise that he exhibited in ""Slumdog Millionaire.""

This is addictive TV, so if you only plan to watch one episode at a time, you may find you've watched an entire disk by the end of the evening.",1236124800,,1569,4.6521739130434785

I still catch the reruns on BBA America every Friday night because going back over the series facinates me (for example- who knew you'd end up rooting for Tony and Michelle as a couple??). Ordering the DVDs was a necessity to me. This show turned into something I'd actually miss Sunday Night Football to catch- even though it was replayed all night, the idea that a new episode was airing was too much for me to bear. And I am the kind of person who will pass up a date or schedule plans with friends around sports.

But I digress. This show definitely rules but the DVD does not live up to the standards. That they cut the ""Wild World"" scene isn't even something I can logically discuss. The music is integral to the show and, as others have mentioned, disrupting that with ""filler"" takes away from the show as a whole. It's so disappointing that what was originally going to be a mass Christmas gift to all of my friends not fortunate enough to catch the show was quickly scrapped.

I wish I had read reviews prior to purchasing (much like the original 90210 series- I read the reviews and didn't purchase based on exclusion of the original music)...

In many other scenes the volume just goes up and down like someone is playing with the volume control on the remote. Just terrible.
