This is a fascinating installment in the ""Tales of the Gun"" series that no gun aficionado will want to miss. This iconic American company is endlessly fascinating and this episode does not disappoint.  Highly recommended.  RJB.",1370563200,,403,4.882352941176471

8077053,5,B000AABL6M,"Great Show... If you like guns, especially revolvers and more specifically even, Smith & Wesson revolvers, then you'll LOVE this ""Tales of the Gun"" program. Also... This History Channel program provides a good history of the company, the guns that where developed, constructed, and sold... It also gives the viewer a bit of background information about Smith and Wesson, but it is not a documentary of these two men's lives, but rather the company and guns they inspired and built.",1337558400,,481,5.025
