8032768,5,B0002VAQQ0,"Raymond Buckland, as would be expected, presents a masterful overview of the Old Craft, and the modern Craft as it has evolved through the years.  A valuable resource for both Wican and modern Neo-Pagan, ""Witchcraft: Yesterday and Today"" offers a concise, informative talk about the Craft from the inside, by the one who brought it to the shores of the US so many years hence.  The writings of ""Uncle Bucky"", as so many fondly refer to him, are staples of the Craft Revival, and it is a very great pleasure to sit and enjoy this history, as well as his personal antecdotes, from the Elder himself.

Whether one is a linaged Witch, or simply a follower of one of the other Neo-Pagan paths, this tape is both informative and entertaining.  I would personally recommend relaxing in ones' favourite chair on a quiet evening, pouring your favourite drink, and perhaps enjoying a smoke or two as you allow Dr. Buckland to share his insights and experiences of decades in the Craft.",1425340800,,975,4.7176470588235295
8032769,5,B0002VAQQ0,I want it on dvd hopefully you guys can find it for me really soon. It is informative and very useful tool for us in the religion of Wicca. I don't own a VHS so I would need it on DVD.,1356652800,,184,3.5121951219512195
8032770,5,B0002VAQQ0,"Does a good job of covering the history of The Old Religion and its persecution. Also shows some basic wiccan/pagan rituals. I personally enjoyed learning about the religion that I'm interested in through this video. Also awesome to see the great Raymond Buckland on screen!

I read the 1-star post and I don't know what that guy was talking about. Presentation was a tad dry but I don't think this will bother you if your new to the craft and looking to learn. If your interested in this kind of thing what he said will be minor complaints. I didn't hear any lisp in the video.

Video is 60 minutes long and was made in 1989 on VHS. The technology is old. The presentation is a little bit dry but these only are minor complaints. If you're interested in this sort of thing they won't make a difference.",1220918400,,803,4.418918918918919
8032771,1,B0002VAQQ0,"Painful to watch. If you really want to see Ray Buckland lisp his way through an hour or so of ego masturbation interspersed with uninspired ritual and a buxom naked woman endlessly circumambulating an altar in a mindnumbing rite of self initiation then this is your video! If not, I'd suggest sticking your head in the oven as the next best thing.",1113523200,5,348,4.629032258064516
