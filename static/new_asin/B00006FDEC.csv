1745870,5,B00006FDEC,"Yes it's true. The path of the original is not strayed from very often. However, like me, if you are not of a superflus cynical nature and can see past this mere glitch, then what you have is a thoroughly entertaining, though not terribly taxing, romp. Rock star turned actor wannabe Jon Bon Jovi is a hunter in a similar role to Woods in the orig' and while not as commanding, does show that not all crooners are hopeless on the silver screen. The rest of the cast add there blood to the mush but it is definetely Bon Jovi's platter. Not the usual type of "" arty "" movie he would normally make, I can only assume he was bored or perhaps wanted to practice, as he certainly doesn't need the money. Again, the plot wouldn't trouble the mind of a 12 year old though it moves at a decent pace, enough to keep you interested. Good fun !",1027728000,7,832,4.20625
1745871,3,B00006FDEC,"John Carpenters Vampires Los Muertos is a fairly good sequal. I have recently seen this movie on the Starz Action Channel and it was pretty good. The acting was pretty good and so was the music score, but it is basicly a rehash of the first one which is in my book a classic John Carpenter film. We baiscly have more vampire hunters who is headed by Jon Bon Jovi, a girl who is part vampire, and a master vampire who is after the black cross. The difference's in this film is that the half vampire girl takes pills that allow her to be out in the sunlight and help her with the craving. The master vampire is a woman who in my opinion is more violent and less seductive then the one in the first film. I was upset that they never mentioned any of the events from part 1. But other then that it was enjoyable, and it also left it open for another sequal. Hopefully if they make another one they will talk about the events of the previous films.",1027036800,5,943,4.158469945355192
1745872,1,B00006FDEC,"What is this?,the stupip, predictable and same vampire movie about a group of slayers chasing them and puttin' them in the daylight?, You have to be kidin'.
The male star is the popular singer Jon Bon Jovi(`Pay it forward'), he's a profesionall hunter. He's hired to kill a vampire that is looking for some ritual weird thing.
In his way he gets with Zoe, the beautiful Natasha Gregson Wagner(Two girls and a guy, Urban Leyend, Modern Vampires).Then a priece, a black big tall guy and Sancho, a mexican tenn(Diego Luna, the kid from the mexican movie `Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN'.
Toghether they must kill this female vampire, but what they don't know is how long will Zoe be normal, because she had been beaten by one of the vampires.
This movie uses the same thing that in the first John Carpenter's Vampires, only that this one is cheaper and worser.
Not worth seeing it at all. A non-clever piece of vampire bad film.
Cast: Jon Bon Jovi(Derek), Natasha G. Wagner(Zoe), Diego Luna(Sancho).
Running time: 90 minutes.
Rated: R
Final grade: F(Really bad)",1026950400,,1045,4.747252747252747

1746024,4,B00006FDEC,"In this sequel a Vampire Queen is attempting the perform the ritual Valek had failed to complete.  She found the Black Cross and several Vampire Hunters.  But the ceremony was more complex than she realized, her first attempt was a failure.

Pursuing her was a Hunter named Derek and a ragtag bunch of hunters.  They'd gained an unlikely ally, named Zoey.

Zoey had been bitten about a year before meeting them, and gone straight to an Aids clinic.  Though the clinic couldn't identify Vampirism, they slipped Zoey an experimental drug, which kept the infection in check - keeping her somewhere between human and Vampire.  She functioned in daylight, though she didn't like very much of it.  She craved Red Meat.  She was also cold as a corpse and psychically linked to the Vampires - she sensed them and saw visions of their feedings.

Zoey's drugs intrigued the Queen.  The Queen stole them and took the entire bottle.  Once the drug took effect, she stepped out into the Daylight.  Although she the drug wore off quickly, it still worked.  Clearly the Queen would eventually find a way to complete the ceremony or obtained a supply of drug.  Either way a Queen who could walk in Daylight too much of a threat.  She had to be destroyed, at any cost.

At the movie's climax Derek infected himself with Vampire Blood.  Which allowed him to infiltrate the Vampire Lair.  He and Zoey  battled the Vamps and slew the Queen.

In the epilogue Derek and Zoey were heading to Mexico City for more of the drugs.  Their future was unclear.  If the drug worked, they'd keep hunting. If it didn't, they'd both turn.  Either way it was clear they be staying by each others side.",1448755200,,1666,4.646048109965636
1746025,4,B00006FDEC,"Not bad...not bad at all. Jon Bon Jovi is a surprisingly decent actor; very relaxed, no awkward or bad acting that most newbie actors that all of a sudden find themselves in front of a camera...The newbies discover that it's much, MUCH, so much, harder to pull it off than they had thought. So how did a Rock Star God, known for his awesome voice (and great hair by the way) pull off a solid performance in (of all things) a vampire flick!?!? Well, ol' Jon had a little practice...I mean, standing on a stage in front of millions of fans for a couple of decades kinda gave him the ability to pull off the ""devil may care"" attitude with obvious ease. The first Vampires movie with George Clooney and Quinton Terrintino was just a tad bit better than this one, but this part two, Los Muertos was a decent watch. Would I watch it again? Obviously, because this is like, my third time...would I recommend it to a friend to watch? You bet. Was it the greatest movie of all time?..um, no. Not even close. BUT, to be totally honest, I'll probably buy this vid if I run across it somewhere. All the supporting actors/actresses, also, did a good job. It was worth the couple of bucks to rent it.
Okay, SHORTSUMMARY (no spoilers)
...Another alpha vampire(ss) and her brood, are out hunting and killing. Well, killing is what vampires do, right? Right...but not entirely accurate. This particular Alpha is not only a she vamp, she's old. Among vampires, age is strength, blinding speed and stealth, cunning, she's also very powerful, and kind of a hottie too. But, the worse thing is, she's out to find the hiding place of the ""Black Cross"" that will give her the most important thing to all vampires...especially to the old ones... The Black Cross will make her a Daywalker. This is huge. The sun is the only reason they haven't come after us yet. The poisonous sunlight is stopping them from feeding and multipling at will until we humans are history. During the day their weak. And when they lie week, they are vulnerable. They MUST HAVE THAT CROSS. The Black Cross is a most precious thing...especially to a vampire that hasn't seen the sun in centuries.",1447804800,,2147,4.579220779220779

1746169,4,B00006FDEC,"Now, when it comes to sequels and remakes, I try very hard not to do comparisons. This one, however, despite a similar storyline, has a lot more differences, at least, to me. First off, John Carpenter stands aside as director, but maintains producing status, and director Tommy L. Wallace of Fright Night II, Halloween III, and don't forget Stephen King's IT) still knows what he's doing. The actors in this one, including Jon Bon Jovi/Derek Bliss, I have to give credit, because he's somewhat nicer and more gentle than JW. Now, is this film better than the first one? Duh! Of course not. However, I feel this one could stand on its own, which is why ""the Turning"" is almost gratuitous, no, I haven't seen that one, and frankly, don't care to.
Another difference is the vampire violence is somewhat more implied, plus the vulgarity isn't nearly as constant.",1376438400,,858,4.76510067114094

1746172,1,B00006FDEC,"Have you ever wanted to see Jon Bon Jovi as a badass, lone-wolf vampire hunter? Probably not.

But if you are one of the six people who DID want to see that, then ""Vampires - Los Muertos"" is the right movie. This is a block of incoherent, grade-A vampire cheese that unwittingly entertains just by being so inept -- it has wooden acting from every single actor who isn't Diego Luna, and stumbles through some of the worst action scenes ever choreographed.

Freelance vampire hunter Derek Bliss (Jon Bon Jovi) is hired to get together a team of hunters to do... something. Then an entire monastery of priests and monks is slaughtered to get at the ancient the Berziers Cross, which can apparently make vampires immune to sunlight. The culprit: the evil Una (Arly Jover), who... well, wants to be immune to sunlight.

So Derek reluctantly teams up with the only people available: a demi-vampire named Zoe (Natasha Gregson Wagner), a priest who can't emote (Cristi&aacute;n de la Fuente) and a fifteen-year-old boy who wants to be a vampire hunter (Diego Luna). They set off into the assorted ruins of Mexico, since the filmmakers seem to think that Mexico doesn't have any intact/inhabited buildings, hoping to stop Una before she becomes unstoppable.

The casting in ""Vampires - Los Muertos"" truly fascinates me, mainly because of Jon Bon Jovi as a hardened veteran vampire hunter. Not only does he look like an aging surfer, but his wispy physique and silly-looking stake-gun make him look less plausible than Sarah Michelle Gellar. And yes, he is more wooden than his stakes.

He's not the only one: de la Fuente seems to have been cast entirely for his chiseled good looks, and Wagner seems to think acting consists of talking loudly in a flat, affected voice. And the casting of Jover is pretty baffling, because she and Wagner look almost identical -- I kept waiting for the revelation that they were related somehow, but it never came. Really, the only good performance is Diego Luna as an eager-puppy teen sidekick, and he's pretty much wasted.

And for a movie with such a simple plot (vampire steals crucifix, vampire hunters must get it back), it's pretty difficult to follow -- I had to watch the opening twenty minutes several times before I could figure out what was happening. What follows is an increasingly disjointed hunt for Una, punctuated by magical plot convenience -- a vampire attack is thwarted by an old man who ""had a dream"" that warned him. How convenient.

And it has plot holes the size of Mars. For instance: an experienced vampire hunter allows a pale, unknown woman to wander into his camp, cuddle up to him, and give him a blow job. Yes, he really is that stupid.

Finally, it has some of the worst action scenes I have seen in a movie with an actual budget. Any energy that the movie builds up dies horribly at the climax, which is a dusty, literally dragging action scene involving a harpoon, a lot of metallic cords, and (somehow) a crashing car. I have seen better action scenes in Internet videos.

""Vampires - Los Muertos"" is a mass of cheese left out in the Mexican sun -- it's confusing, poorly-acted and has a plot that makes your brain turn inside-out. If only Rifftrax would give this movie their TLC.",1367452800,2,3244,4.717314487632509

It's one extreme or the other.  No one remembers balance anymore. I miss characters like Dracula who could be charming and occasionally sympathetic but still able to be predatory and vicious.  Now that is an interesting vampire. I miss vampires like that.

It's just as bad as it sounds.

A master vampire desires to exist in sunlight, and JBJ's crew must stop that from happening.  To do so they must eradicate all vampires in sight, protect a black cross, and keep their head above a tidal wave of campiness.  Most of the acting is so nonchalant I could swear one of the actors fell asleep while delivering a line.  Some decent gore here and there, but action is horrible and acting is worse.

Just because Bon Jovi made a song called ""Shot Through the Heart"" doesn't mean he should be ""acting"" in vampire movies.  Avoid this like syphilis.",1331942400,4,961,4.546511627906977

It took me awhile to realize who the lead actor was.  I thought that the film was made in the 80s at first, with the bad lighting, the bad acting, and the bad hair.  And then I said to myself, ""Self, the lead kind of looks like Bon Jovi."" And then it hit me like a freight train.  I was watching JON BON JOVI STAKE VAMPIRES.

As a committed reviewer, I feel it necessary to explain that this is a terrible movie.  And yet, for fans of vampire movies, it is also historic.  I mean, this is the guy who received multiple awards for his 1991 hit, Blaze of Glory! And this is the same Bon Jovi who had a brief, uncredited role as ""long haired corpse in coffin"" in Young Guns II.  So in a sense Vampires: Los Muertos is a sequel to Young Guns II, which makes it...Young Guns III.  With vampires.

Bon Jovi (do I just call him Jovi? Doesn't seem right) is Derek Bliss, doing what he does best - staking vampires. In a tenuous connection to the first movie, Father Adam Guiteau (Tim Guinee, earning his SAG rate) dies while creating a team that can...hunt more vampires, I guess.  Bliss assembles a cast of stereotypes: rocker pretending he's an actor (Jovi.  See? Doesn't look right), substitute priest Father Rodrigo (Cristian de la Fuente), cute redhead Zoey (Natasha Gregson Wagner), spunky sidekick Sancho (Diego Luna), and quippy tough guy Ray Collins (Darius McCrary). Each of them has their own secrets, starting with Zoey, who is half-vampire but ""takes pills"" to avoid completing the transformation.  Does anyone think that this will turn up as a major plot point later?  Anyone?  Anyone?

Right.  So the vampires, who are not ever content to just be vampires, have a new master plan, which is the same old master plan in every other vampire movie: they want to walk around in daylight.  Vampire princess Una (Arly Jover) wants the legendary Berziers Cross, the same cross that the vampires wanted in the first film, which through a black mass will make the vampires invulnerable to sunlight.

So listen, vampires.  Can we talk?  Look, I know you're really bummed about sleeping during the day, but in exchange for your super powers you get to be all pouty and goth. If you really wanted to walk around in the day, we have a race that can do that already - it's called humans.  If you wanted to walk around in daylight so badly, maybe we should think about the poor choices that led you to becoming a vampire, hmm?  We have a name for undead creatures walking around in daylight thirsting for human blood: zombies.  And nobody wants to be a zombie.

The plot is full of twists about every character. The acting between the two leads is as wooden as the stakes they wield.  The sole redeeming feature of this film is that it works hard to show how supernaturally fast and deadly vampires are and succeeds once or twice.

And Jovi.  Bon Jovi.  Jon Bon Jovi.  Whatever.  He adds an additional star, because he is one.",1322697600,,3180,4.532513181019332

This does fit into the vampires storyline and although it doesn't have the angry 'james woods' character in it., it's still ok. I like the fact that it's done in mexico as well. Mexico is a scary country ,even without vampires running around down there. TO be sure these days it's one of the worlds most dangerous places by far. back in 2002 it wasn't as bad but was still a dangerous place all the way. The cast here is fine, the direction is ok, it's not john carpenter though and  this one probably played few movie houses or any before it hit the dvd racks back in 2002.

Beside the stupidity of having a spiritual condition (undeath) palliated by drugs, and the shredding of the mythology developed for the first movie (wood isn't special, it's just that stakes are useful for dragging out folks into the sunlight, so the wooden shells shouldn't signify), the general level of competence is pretty low.

Jon Bon Jovi may have been a mediocre semi-entity of a rock-star, but as an actor...he's a mediocre semi-entity of a rock star.  Ms Muriel Fouilland, who plays the master vampire, is good enough, and I believe is inspired-by/ripped-oiff--from Anne Parillaud in ""Innocent Blood"", but the dubbed-in wild-cat noises also taken from that movie detract from her appearances...Natasha Wagner offers up as aggressive a piece of non-acting as I've seen this side of high-school plays and pr0n.

Diego Luna, who plays Sancho (""The Kid"") is the only one of the main players worth seeing again.  With his exception, the less English a character speaks, the better the acting job...a little reminiscent of the early Prof. Quatermass movies, in which a good English cast was saddled with a has-been American lead.....",1282867200,,1229,5.125

He is essentially a bounty hunter who only handles vampires.  Now he has a big new job but the client insists he puts together a team.  This is easier than it sounds as slayers are being killed all over the place.  A tough new master vampire is making things tough.  Jon also meets someone who is infected but has not turned due to an experimental drug.  The hope is the drug will continue working until a true cure is found.

The contact takes Jon and his new team to Mexico where it is soon learned that the new vampire master is looking for the Black Cross so that she can walk in the daylight.  But is the Cross the only way this can be possible?  Some old ruins turn out to be the site of the final showdown and the revelations.  We learn the motives for many of the characters including the one who hired the team.

Although the tone of this film is much different from the first, the story is fairly consistent with the first film.  When vampires are killed they need to be beheaded and we see the same winch technique used in the first film.  We really don't get a sense for the bounty hunting end of things other than that Jon has an agent of some sort and that apparently enough people accept vampires as real so they don't need to work under the Church or any other organization.

1746273,3,B00006FDEC,"""Vampires: Los Muertos"" is a sequel of sorts to ""John Carpenter's Vampires,"" which means that it inhabits the same world. James Woods and his over the relentless and entertaining chewing of each and every scene has now been replaced by Jon Bon Jovi's lethargic turn as vampire hunter Derek Bliss. I guess he is supposed to be a bad ass just like Woods' character, but he only gets the role half right (the first half people, be nice). This was just a mondo bad casting decision and writer-director Tommy Lee Wallace dug his 2002 film into a hole on that basis alone. The second strike is Arly Jover as the master vampire Una, not just because the name strikes me as silly but also because she is no where near as scary or as sexy as she is supposed to be. If the hero and the villain are essentially boring, what hope can a vampire spaghetti-western have?

Whereas Woods headed an organized group of vampire hunters that was decimated early in the film forcing the hero to go almost solo, Bon Jovi does the reverse. Bliss is a free-lance vampire hunter for hire who has to put together a crew, so there are all sorts of trust and competency issues. If Bliss cannot count on Father Rodrigo (Cristin de la Fuente) then his merry little group and the audience are in for a long hole. We are still in the world where vampires explode into flames when exposed to sunlight, even when you use one of their heads as a hood ornament, but that is also something old and something new along with everything borrowed from the first film. The idea of being able to communicate through the shared blood of the vampire from Stoker's ""Dracula"" comes back and works in with the more contemporary idea that vampirism is essentially a blood disease.

""Vampires: Los Muertos"" is a bad film, but it picked up its third star because of one intriguing idea off of the blood disease idea. Having established that a drug cocktail has stopped Zoey (Natasha Gregson Wagner) the requisite damsel in distress from turning into a vamp despite having been bitten, Wallace does come up with an interesting twist by having Una use the magic medicine to help her take a walk in the sunlight like she was wearing the Gem of Amarra. The execution is not as exciting as the idea and you really wish it had been used in the service of a much better film. Here it is just too little, too late in terms of saving this film from driving off the cliff, but it does stand out as the one bright spot in this dreary little film which continues the idea that vampires are flourishing south of the border.",1096416000,2,2558,4.475374732334047

I bought this movie and the original while I was leaving up in Maryland a couple days after Christmas one day. I had already seen the first one and liked it, of course it was written and directed by John Carpenter and he returned to produce the second one. After watching the original by John Carpenter I was a little worried that this sequel would not be any good at all as John only served as and Executive Producer. Thankfully after viewing this film all the way through I can honestly say that not only was this a good movie but it was a worthy addition to the series.

The movie is all about a vampire hunter for hire who is considered one of the best in the world. After making a few new fresh kills he is contacted by the Van Hellsing Corporation with a new job, a dangerous job. He is hired to take out a female vampire who is after something that can make her a day walker, as in sun light will not affect her. Of course any vampire with potential is a dangerous adversary and warrants more then one hunter to take her out. So off our hero Derek Bliss goes in search of a team that can help him get the out come he wants. Along the way he recruits Father Rodrigo, Ray Collins and a few more professionals, including a female who may be a vampire her self. So off we go on what is really a road movie which really adds to the charm of the film, battling vampires along the way making to the head of the family.

Writer/director Tommy Lee Walace did an excellent job with this film in my opinion; I think this is a very entertaining movie that John and Sandy King produced. I love Walace's commentary on the DVD; it really gives you a lot of information and even goes into how he got the job to make this film. Also Jon Bon Jovi does an amazing job in this film as the lead; I really believe that he is this vampire hunter. Of course every body that is in this film does an amazing job, especially the lady who plays the lead vampire who wants to walk in the sun. Darius McCrary who you will all recognize from a popular TV series does a great job as well.

This is actually a very good sequel to the first; the film was written and directed by Tommy Lee Walace. I think he did a great job; the story was very entertaining and well rounded. Even Jon Bon Jovi did an excellent job on this, this is the first film I have seen with him as the star. Cristian De La Fuente, Arly Jover, Darius McCrary, and Natasha Wagner all did great jobs on this film. A lot of people have knocked this film as a remake of the first, well all I can say is you try to make a movie half as good as this, I bet you can't.",1052438400,2,2626,4.0852713178294575
1746332,1,B00006FDEC,"To begin with, John Carpenters' original movie 'Vampires' was no great shakes. Sure, it was an entertaining time-waster - but, from the guy who once gave us the sharp tension of 'Halloween' to the gross delights of 'The Thing', the film displayed the director far from the top of his game. However in comparison, this cheap-looking and plodding sequel not only manages to make the original movie resemble something quite good, it also makes other recent vampire movies out there (ie, The Forsaken) seem a whole lot better in retrospect.
The story (I use that term loosely) has slacker-ish vampire hunter Derek Bliss (played by a comatose Jon Bon Jovi) enlisted to track down a female vampire in Mexico. He bands together a team (hewever, he doesn't like this as he usually works alone), only to discover they have just been murdered by said vampire. Along the way he picks up Natasha Gregson Wagner, who has been bitten and is slowly transforming into a vampire as we meet her. She keeps her vampirism at bay however, by the use of a startling new drug which slows down the infection and is keeping her human. (Give you a slight plot hint. Guess what happens to her drug around two thirds through the movie?) From then on its the usual desert roads, banal vampire attacks and boring character (un)development all the way until we are taken to the rather dull and frankly boring finale.
Its a shame this movie was so bad. Director Tommy Lee Wallace has tackled the vampire genre before in the underrated 'Fright Night Part 2', and proved he could move the action along fairly well. His other movies (Halloween 3 and IT) have all been decent enough productions to warrant that this endeavour may at least be a little entertaining. However, he seems to be preoccupied in presenting us with dull characterisations, uneven storytelling and lacklustre direction. The opening vampire attack (and subsequent payoff) are poorly handled and seem more at home in an episode of Buffy or Angel than in a movie of this kind. Jon Bon Jovi seems to be bored out of his mind throughout the movie, and the rest of the cast are playing their roles in the usual genre movie manner that we are all accustomed to. Only Natasha Gregson Wagner comes away from this movie looking any good (as she does from most of her other roles), portraying the character with depth and charm.
The cinematography is crisp and audio is sharp, which of a movie this recent that should be expected. Extras include an interesting commentary from Wallace (who informs us of the low budget he had to work with) and a the usual trailers, etc. To sum up, if you are a fan of the original you may enjoy this one but probably not much. It feels tired and has a 'so-what?' attitude running through it which left me feeling grouchy and I quickly began to remind myself about the good old days when great vampire movies like 'Near Dark' were actually trying to be something like entertaining and strange.

Despite the 'good guys must stake evil vampires' plot, Los Muerteos had its moments. Jon Bon Jovi does well, as the laid back and practical Bliss, and the supporting cast are completely up to the task of portraying a band of 'hunters,' with enthusiasm.

I settled down with a beer and pizza and watched the film unveil itself as Jon Bon Jovi works for a mysterious Van Helsing Group and gets hired to take out a 'colony' of vampires by an anonymous source. He suspects it is the Catholics because they lost quite a few hunters a few years before (a not so subtle nod to the first movie.)
His mission is to put together a vampire hunting unit. In a nice turn of events, all the guys he is supposed to gather get killed or are dead. The monastary he visits to find the priest from the first movie (who died before he got there) gets wiped out by the vampire and only one survives. Yada yada yada, the movie goes on and he collects a rag tag group of unlikely hunters (a vampire who is on a drug that allows her not to be a vampire, a 16-year-old boy, the ""priest"" who hunted maybe once, and a big black guy the Van Helsing Group sent to help him.) Who are the turncoats? You know somebody has to, I'll leave that part a secret.
The movie kind of revolves around the Black Cross yet again and a Master Vampire wanting to be able to move around in sunlight (kind of like that medicine the vampire chick is taking...hmmm.)
There are some great moments in the movie though. In the beginning Jon is driving this jeep with a surfboard in the passenger seat. It seems odd until he has to clear out a church of vampires and we discover the surfboard is actually the case for his wooden lances and other weapons. It's cool because it made me think of a cartoon that could stem from this: Jon Bon Jovi and his Surfboard of Doom!
All in all I like this kind of movie, not a lot of thought, just enough twists that they aren't 100% predictable and unlike Blade II where he knows who the traitors are, poor Derek Bliss (JBJ) finds himself befuddled.
The movie played out like a bad rpg video game, though, collecting characters, having little asides, watching expendable characters die on cue and putting in the predictable little twist ending. What twist, yeah right, as if you couldn't guess that Jon Bon Jovi would make it through the movie without ... well, I guess you'll have to watch it to find out.",1038268800,6,2403,4.295154185022026
1746336,1,B00006FDEC,"Dont waste the money on this stinker.  Jon, stick to your day job of rocking teenage girls and middle-aged housewives.  This is supposedly some sort of sequal to Carpenter's ""Vampires"" which totally rocked, Los Muertes is nowhere near being in the same league.  Obviously an excuse for Bon Jovi's female fans to see Jon with his shirt off unfortunatly guys there are no gratutious female bod-shots for us to make this movie worth-while.  Forget the fact that the plot jumps around so much that you give up trying to understand it and just pray that it somehow gets better before you fall asleep.  Take some advice and rent it like I did.  Especially if there is nothing else you would rather do than numb your mind.",1033948800,,715,4.634920634920635
1746337,3,B00006FDEC,"""Vampires: Los Muertos"", a sequel to John Carpenter's 1998 hit ""Vampires"", is one more fine film in the Jon Bon Jovi canon.  This time around, Jon plays a vampire slayer who has his hands full saving the world deep in the heart of Mexico.  While it re-uses many of the elements from the first movie, and borrows one major plot point from Kathryn Bigelow's ""Near Dark"", the script has enough going for it to be an enjoyable way to waste an hour and a half.  And, of course, Jon shows that his two years of acting classes paid off.",1033516800,,529,4.3232323232323235
1746338,5,B00006FDEC,"So, this is the ninth review.  What can I say, this movie kicks ..., and while it was made on a lower budget, the special effects (for the most part) and the acting is definitely excellent.  I have always loved lower budgeted horror movies, probably because they tend to have more emphasis on make-up effects and gore; a lot of work, energy, sweat and blood from the actors, director, and make up artists get put into the film.  This movie captures all of that, and more.  Jon Bon Jovi kicks ... at killing Blood Suckers.  He is such an incredible actor, as well as a musician (Yeah I'm biased!  I was born and raised in Jersey!).  I love every movie he's been in, and it is good to see Jon as a slayer in this Gothic/Western Vampire flick.  The rest of the cast is just as phenomenal, it's even got Natalie Wood's beautiful daughter in it (Natasha Gregson Wagner).  It is an excitingly suspensful, fightening, edge-of-your-seat vampire event!  Don't miss it!",1032566400,6,959,4.555555555555555
1746339,4,B00006FDEC,"This was a very intertaining film; much better to watch than James Wood's version, although I must say I did like his as well.  I thought Jon Bonjovi brought a more down to earth, likeable, and more fanciful hero in the vampire hunter genre.  I recommend this to any vampire film enthusiast and to any fellow Jon Bonjovi fan. This is one of  Jon's best performances and you can tell that he is having a great time making this film (and he makes a great vampire himself). I was surprised that he didn't get very good reviews for his work in this.  A good ""pop-corn thriller""; great for a rainy afternoon when there is nothing else to do.",1032048000,4,636,4.364406779661017
1746340,5,B00006FDEC,"Well, I just recently saw the movie and I thought it was great! Jon really shined in this movie, Like he doesnt in any other movie! At first, I thought It was more of a blood and guts movie and it is, I like that. I like a movie that follows a plot and keeps you on the edge of your seat with anticipation of what's going to happen next. I thought jon would die in the movie. I will not say if he does or not, Just in case no one has seen it. THis is one of Jon's best movie roles ever. I think. Sit back and relax. Enjoy the show!",1030147200,8,531,3.7079646017699117

The acting is almost as bad as ""Teen Alien"". It's not scary. The scariest thing may be Bon Jovi's yellow polo shirt. Or maybe his hair.",1505174400,,274,4.392156862745098
