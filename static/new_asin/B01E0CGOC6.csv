7729906,5,B01E0CGOC6,"Expect action with this Jack Irish bloke. A criminal lawyer gone rogue as debt collector, drunk, gambler, and more after his wife's murder. Guy Pearce (Kings Speech) becomes the character that was created from the crime novels of Peter Temple. 100 minutes can't do justice to the novel, but character focus is preserved, as well as the Melbourne setting, the filming location. Adaptation feature-length TV mystery is based on a contemporary novel by Peter Temple.
Jack is a fallen, grieving lawyer who investigates dark lives--a series that is Aussie character driven.
I loved the touching scenes in the wood shop which included the old cabinet maker Charlie (Vadin Glowna). There are also some great give-n-go comic moments in the local pub.

SDH SUBTITLES available for the 3 feature-length stories and bonus
Bad Debts
An ex-client turns up dead, so Jack falls back into a bit of his old life. Politics, crooked cops, business, and murder for $$$ all become a part of the cleverly woven plot of conspiracy and corruption that get the protagonist, Jack Irish, back into the investigative life he so hoped to avoid. Yet he keeps a hold on his gambling and woodworking apprenticeship during life and death events. A bit of nudity during bed scenes with reporter Linda (Marta Dusseldorp) who wants more than just a news story scoop. Complex suspense keeps you on your seat's edge.

Black Tide
Jack Irish's dad's old friend has a case that might provide him some insight into his own dad's past. The friends son, Gary, is missing along with $$$ belonging to his father. And Jack's cabinetmaker gets involved indirectly. As always there are evil people in high places. Romance takes a back seat, well they're not really seated. Plenty of action.

Dead Point
In this episode Judge Loder (Barry Humphries) is about to release a dockyard criminal report and asks his son-in-law Jack to find an incriminating red book. That's just the beginning of a waterfront conspiracy with unknown involvement that includes drugs, violence, corruption in the force, theft, gambling, murder, and blackmail. A full-meal-deal in crime investigation for down under, Aussie style.

All 3 are gritty, course, and complicated. Adult fare that's hard to watch at times, yet you get glued to the screen compulsively. Blimey captivating, with Melbourne's beauties and beasts.
On the personal front, even though Irish yet grieves for his dead wife Isabel, he's romantically involved with a blonde radio talk programmer, Linda (Marta Dusseldorp A Place to Call Home).

7729908,3,B01E0CGOC6,"The ""Jack Irish"" movies were produced for Australian television in 2012-2014, adapted from novels by Peter Temple. Set in Melbourne, they recount the adventures of former defense attorney Jack Irish (Guy Pearce) who lost his beloved wife Isobel to a violent death at the hands of a deranged ex-client. Grief-stricken, he retired from lawyering to live by his wits, drink, gamble, apprentice cabinetmaking, and drive a 1960 Studebaker Silver Hawk. Jack is enticed into investigating crime when another ex-client meets a violent end shortly after trying to contact him. In the course of this investigation, he meets ambitious, muckraking journalist Linda Hillier (Marta Dusseldorp), with whom he becomes romantically involved. All the while, he makes a living betting horses with wealthy investor Harry Strang (Roy Billing) and his good friend Cam Delroy (Aaron Pedersen), whose fast cars and habit of packing a pistol are helpful given Jack's talent for landing in hot water.

I've read only bits and pieces of Temple's novels online in an effort to discover why the series is called ""noir"". I found that the novels have some hard-boiled flourishes, but the movies do not feature any ""noir"" predicaments or themes. Jack's laconic nature is problematic, as his personality comes across as flat, if not actually weak. Guy Pearce tries to make Jack the silent, introverted type, but he doesn't have much to work with. Linda has a strong personality, but it is boorish, selfish, and unethical. It is hard to imagine any attraction between these two. The mysteries, themselves, feature a lot of corruption clich&eacute;s, but they are all right. It's nice to see new locations and to hear Australian accents, having grown up on British mysteries. But these movies have a flatness to them that never engages the audience in the story or characters. Jack's relationship with his betting pals, though tangential, is more interesting than his other relationships, but we don't see a lot of it.

The movies are:

""Bad Debts"": While Jack Irish is away on business in Sydney, old client Danny McKillop (Simon Russell), who went to prison on a hit-and-run conviction, leaves several messages on Jack's phone. Upon Jack's return, he finds that McKillop is dead, shot by a police officer in a car park. Feeling guilty, Danny attends the memorial service and learns from McKillop's wife (Alicia Gardener) that a mystery woman recently contacted Danny about evidence that would prove his innocence in the death ten years earlier. Jack feels compelled to investigate.

""Black Tide"": Jack is paid a visit by an old friend of his father's, Des Conners (Ronald Jacobson), who wants Jack to find his son Gary (Nicholas Coghlan), who has disappeared and left his father to pay a $60,000 second mortgage on his home. Jack connects Gary's employer Levesque to a series of shell companies. Federal agent Dave (Don Hany) is also looking for Gary and for his partner Dean Canetti (Lachy Hulme), who arrested Gary in Thailand as part of a secret anti-drug operation. Meanwhile,  Jack's friend Harry Strang (Roy Billing) suspects a competitor of drugging his racehorses.

""Dead Point"": A police bust of a quantity of drugs in the trunk of a red Porsche is foiled when a driver materializes and takes off with it. The suspect, Robbie Colburne (Dominic Allburn), is later found dead of a heroin overdose. Jack's father-in-law Justice Colin Logan (Barry Humphries) asks him to find a red leather book that Robbie possessed, containing photographs that the Justice does not want made public. Stonewalled by the Drugs Squad, Jack goes to The Snug, ""an oasis of privacy and discretion"", where Jack tended bar, and meets its venomous owner Rose Elliot (Kat Stewart).",1504569600,4,3728,5.0932896890343695

8757476,5,B01E0CGOC6,"The movies showed what happened to Jack Irish after the death of his wife and also show how noir situations were handled in Australia .  Note that the movies were before the TV series.  I would show the movies best with subtitles because many terms for common items are different in Australia.  Jack Irish movies are fascinating for the way Jack ask simple questions and the bad guys overreact by trying to threaten or kill him.  That background is fascinating for showing the grimier side of Melbourne and also criticizing modern life. The way horse races are handled is very primitive, similar to the old British bookie system without any electronics. Jack is a broken man trying to make the best of a bad situation. Note the first movie is Bad Debts and shows the death of Jack Irish's wife at the beginning of the movie.",1527120000,3,824,4.623287671232877

8757478,5,B01E0CGOC6,"Takes some license with the plots and characters in the book, but the characters still sound and behave like they do IN THE BOOK.  That is a commendation by the way.  I judge adaption of book to TV or movie by how much characters sound and look as I imagine they sound and look when I am reading the book.  Jack Irish and most of the characters in the DVD are as real as they are in the books.  Good job of casting and acting.  I'll watch as much of Jack Irish as you put out there.
