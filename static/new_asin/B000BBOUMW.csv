2411292,5,B000BBOUMW,"This is (also) a review of the REMIX VERSIONS. I won't go into the awesomeness of Cowboy Bebop other than to say that it is the best anime series ever, I'd even call it one of the best television shows ever!

While it has been universally noted on various postings about the remix versions that the sound is significantly better than the original sessions, there are multiple varying reviews on the PICTURE QUALITY. Some say there is no difference at all, some say it's a bit better, some say it's a lot better, all say they have ""checked"" both versions. Well, I took it a step further. I watched both versions side by side on an Avid Nitris Professional video editing system with high definition high resolution (HDHR) monitors and here is the DEFINITIVE ANSWER. There is a difference, they lightened it and did a very slight color correction. Basically, the old versions were a bit dark and some of the detail went unnoticed while the remix versions are lighter and there is more visible detail and color. In terms of viewing expeirience this means that a majority of the scenes look noticibly (if marginally) better. There are certain scenes, however, where the lightness works against it. Some of the more noirish scenes look a bit bleedy. Overall I would say that there is a difference in video quality and that the difference is mostly an improvement. But, even to the die hard fan the difference is negligible.

If you don't own the originals, if they're scratched, if you're a huge fan, if you have an awesome theatre system with good surround, or if you have a crappy small tv and can't see the detail in the image, GET THE REMIX. If not, while they are cool, they're not worth the $30 a pop.",1133827200,28,1701,4.592105263157895

8084697,5,B000BBOUMW,"I bought this volume to replace a faulty/fragged disk in my Legends set I got at a convention a few years back (absolutely no defects found in this product by the way, it arrived in perfect working condition) and now I finally have a full working set and after watching it in full I have to say I love it! Popular anime like this often end up over-hyped, so much so that even the best can't live up. And it's because of this that I tend to avoid many main-stream anime because what they were once is now buried in media hype. But that is not the case with this one, it stands on its own with only 26 episodes and a single movie to its' name (take that Naruto, Bleach, Poke'mon has really started to lose it's mojo) when will it be known that much of the time less is more? It packs a lot of personality and story into its' 26 without the monotony of many longer mainstream series. Bebop has this... aura, I guess, that makes it beloved. I guess I could describe it as the Firefly of the anime world. Anyway, if you have never seen it I highly, highly recommend that you do so, anime fan or not you will not be disappointed! Trust me this one is different than most.",1418774400,,1165,4.15929203539823

8084700,2,B000BBOUMW,You offer a video with spanish language option but only have english and japanesse option. I am very upset with this situation.,1362787200,,127,4.818181818181818
8084701,1,B000BBOUMW,I am a big fan of cowboy bebop and so I was really dissapointed when I went to play episodes 17 and 18 on this dvd and they didn't work. I've gotten three different copies and they all do the same thing so make sure they work on your copy when you get it.,1304899200,,255,3.740740740740741
8084702,5,B000BBOUMW,i love cowboy bebop. the improvements on this series make it more enjoyable as well.,1266019200,,84,4.666666666666667
8084703,5,B000BBOUMW,"You can buy any of the other volumes without getting utterly lost since most of the episodes are stand-alones. The ""Remix"" actually means more than what I've been seeing lately by adding a 5:1 soundtrack for both English and Japanese!!!",1262131200,,236,4.925
8084704,3,B000BBOUMW,"This disc contains the fifteenth through eighteenth episodes of Cowboy Bebop.  Two of the episodes give some backstory on Faye Valentine, one episode gives some backstory on Jet Black, and one is... well, a ""filler.""

The only real special feature on the disc is commentary by the director and the composer about the episode ""Mushroom Samba"" (which is one I feel is a ""filler"" episode).  The only other thing in the special features section are previews for other Bandai DVD releases.

Honestly, if it hadn't been for ""Mushroom Samba"" and the relative lack of special features on the disc, I probably would've given this four stars (the other episodes on the disc are very well done).",1197417600,,684,4.870689655172414
8084705,5,B000BBOUMW,"Faye Valentine is one of the most mysterious occupants of the Bebop...actually everyone is pretty mysterious because you never get their entire pasts laid out. But that's ok. It's like real life. How many people do you know everything about? Nobody really wants to listen to her story so she's relegated to telling Ein about her past....and even he doesn't want to hear it! We do find out why she has such a humungous debt. Jet takes center stage in the second episode, ""Black Dog Serenade"", in which his old partner enlists his help in nabbing the bounty of an escaped convict who just happens to be the guy that caused Jet to lose his arm. ""Mushroom Samba"" continues the spotlight episodes with Ed and Ein being the stars. After the Bebop is a hit and run victim of another ship, it crashlands in the middle of a desert.  Ed and Ein venture out to find food for the famished crew and find themselves in the middle of a 70s blaxploitation film setting!  Lastly, a strange package is sent to Faye COD so she thinks her creditors have found her again. In typical Faye fashion, she goes on the lam. Jet and Spike discover that the package is a beta videotape but the only way they'll be able to play such an ancient artifact is to find a player on devastated Earth!

The thing that has always made Bebop great is its characters and the spotlight of these episodes is to bring them to the forefront. Instead of Faye coming off as the icelady vamp, after we learn a bit about her past, we can recognize that a part of her heart will always be tinged with sadness. For, you see, she has no memory of her past. She has no memory of her family. She doesn't even know her real name. So unless she gets some help, she'll be doomed to never know her true self. Ein and Ed are the total opposite of Faye. They don't seem to have a past and I doubt this troubles them at all. I think Ed would be fine locked in a prison cell for life if she only had a computer in front of her. ""Mushroom Samba"" is a miracle of motion, even today, and really brings across the kinetic nature of Ed and is an amusing Japanese take on black films like ""Shaft"". All in all, a batch of classic episodes remixed in 5.1.",1146614400,3,2185,4.2729468599033815
