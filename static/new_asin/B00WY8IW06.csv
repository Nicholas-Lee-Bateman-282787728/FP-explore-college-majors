8714594,5,B00WY8IW06,"This is the second time that this complete series of cartoons was released on DVD. This time, though, it was done right. The cartoons are actually in chronological order this time - and, most importantly, are all complete and uncut - even the three that were edited down in the earlier release. However, the one called ""Labor Shortage"" still has that fix in that significant animation glitch in that scene where Beetle talks while he has kitchen items all piled on top of him, but this is only a very minor nitpick.

I also know how they were able to fit all 50 cartoons and the special all on one disc: file compression. On occasion, I notice a tiny bit of quality loss in the picture, but again, this is also another minor nitpick. I am very happy that these cartoons are all completely uncut. That is what mainly matters.

For more avid fans, one edition of this collection also comes with some art and information of this comic strip series. This is a nice treat for fans like me, too.",1532044800,,989,4.458563535911602
