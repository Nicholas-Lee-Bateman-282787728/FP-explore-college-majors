1833886,1,B00008AOX6,"Despite the overwhelming public response to have this great season released in the form of complete season sets following the release of ""Married With Children: The Most Outrageous Episodes, Vol. 1"", it seems that our cries have fallen on deaf ears.  Columbia/Tri-Star has decided to go ahead with a 2nd compilation set containing ONLY 5 meazily episodes.  I love this show to death, but while lesser known sitcoms are getting the Royal treatment, the show that was innovative on so many levels recieves a paltry 5 episodes per disk.
For those who are interested, the episodes contained on this disk are as follows:
""A Man's Castle""
""Raingirl""
""Have You Driven A Ford Lately""
""If Al Had A Hammer""
""Who'll Stop The Rain?""
This disk, same as the first, features a ""Salute To Sinatra"" as well as extra trailers.
Why Columbia/Tri-Star would continue releasing this show in this calabre is beyond me.  It's a perennial classic which definitely deserves the full season treatment.  Geez, if ""Sports Night"", ""Felicity"" and ""Larry Sanders"" can be granted full season sets, then why on earth can't they do the same with this one.  In my opinion, it is one of the best sitcoms ever released.",1044835200,29,1181,4.885
1833905,1,B00008AOX6,"Let me start by saying, Shame On You Fox!!! This was one of the greatest comedy sitcoms of all time. It changed comedy on tv, like no other sitcom before it. And you got the stones to release these sub par ""best of"" sets...no chance, i aint buying! This was the only tv show that i watched with my father growing up. This show has fans from all age groups. This series needs the respect it deserves...Season by season box sets!!!  So many stupid shows get season by season releases...just take a look at  any dvd section in any store!!!! these ""best of"" discs are a joke. If fox has any respect for the fans that stuck by that amazing show for so many seasons that will release the greatest  season by season box sets this world has ever seen. We want Justice, No Pieced together ""best of"" sets!!!!!",1060646400,11,799,4.348993288590604
1833906,5,B00008AOX6,"this dvd was better then the first one, as i wasn't too partial to any of the episodes chosen. but the episodes on this DVD are better. it even features one of my favorites of all time when al builds his own room with his dad's hammer.
the episodes chosen make this DVD more then worth every single penny, go out and buy it today.",1057881600,2,330,4.092307692307692
1833907,4,B00008AOX6,i think this dvd could be better if it was in box sets of the seasons. i am a huge fan of married with children. we want the box sets the dvd could be better.,1051833600,6,158,3.5428571428571427
1833908,4,B00008AOX6,"I wasn't too impressed with volume 1, but this set is definitely better.  When i say better, i am just talking about the episodes chosen, because this release is basically identical to the first release on everything else.  Same Sinatra Salute.  Same trailers. Same everything.
But anyway.  Dont expect much from this disk.  It is what it is; five (probably random) Married with Children episodes.  Of the five episodes, three of them are great with the other 2 just being mediocre.
Even after all these years, i still don't understand how they got away with some of their material on TV. It could still be considered ""Outrageous"" even by todays standards.
I just can't wait until season sets start appearing.",1049673600,,709,4.866666666666666
1833909,2,B00008AOX6,"Another volume of disappointment from the good folks at Columbia/TriStar, this time featuring the episodes ""A Man's Castle,"" ""Raingirl,"" ""Have You Driven a Ford Lately,"" ""If Al Had a Hammer"" and ""Who'll Stop the Rain.""  Is it just me or are the majority of the choices they make for 'Most Outrageous' not that outrageous?  It seems by the views of CTS any of the 250+ episodes in their library can be considered 'Most Outrageous.'  If they're going to continue releasing best-of compilations instead of the much more preferred seasonal sets the least they could do is release the absolute best episodes such as ""Pilot,"" ""NO MA'AM,"" ""It's a Bundyful Life,"" or the controversial ""Her Cups Runeth Over,"" just to name a few.  Perhaps the worst part of this particular volume is the fact that the presentation of ""If Al Had a Hammer"" is the SYNDICATION version, complete with the shortened opening credits and the TV-PG logo in the top left corner!  Just when you thought they were treating the show bad enough...",1049241600,9,1008,4.837209302325581
1833910,2,B00008AOX6,"First of all FOX is the best in DVD Production from the X-files,Simpsons,Malcolm in the middle, 24 to the movies Fight club,X-men.
and so on..
Though the show ran on FOX Network. The Tv show is propertey of Columbia Tri-Star So hating FOX won't accomplish anything.
Instead Hound columbia tri-star. Though Dissapointing, I will still buy anything Married with children. I love this show.",1048118400,2,387,5.0625
1833911,2,B00008AOX6,"Once again companies refuse to understand that best of dvd's are pointless.  While they capture a variety of episodes from varies seasons, a true fan would much rather have a complete season that is organized and packaged well.  I would not recommend buying this because of the fact that shows like Friends did the same thing and came out with best of dvd's and then followed that with complete seasons.  The clock is ticking though for tv shows to appear on dvd and before too long the TV powerhouses will come out(FRESH PRINCE, SEINFELD, Home Improvement, and Roseanne)",1047859200,11,571,4.8061224489795915
1833912,1,B00008AOX6,"As Bud said, ""Am I the only one who sees that the emperor's not wearing any underwear?""
This show was not all about idiotic NOMAAM skits and one-sided, propagandistic humor that the Married With Children spinoff featured (the spinoff being seasons 7 through 12). There was a time when characters tied together, creating the most intelligent show on the air. Most of the episodes on this DVD are misguided tripe, the kind of episodes which eventually made me stop MWC long before it was taken off the air. And given all the reasons, I place the blame squarely on Fox, for ruining such a show.
I agree that Steve's departure was a big loss, but I disagree that Jefferson ruined the show. Some of his early stuff, like ""You know in prison I could've had her silence for 3 cigarettes,"" is MWC-worthy hilarious. I don't think it was Jefferson who was responsible for the show's demise. One day (first episode of season 7) MWC just stopped being MWC. The rest was just a spinoff - and not in that funny Top of the Heap way.
And here we are again, with a ""greatest hits"" set. You're wrong if you think being a die-hard MWC fan requires you to buy this DVD. These DVD's were made for the casual viewers, people who don't really understand the show, but like the occasional humor. These people would watch Dharma and Greg just as gladly.
As a long-time MWC fan, I think Fox owes to the show's fans to produce decent sets. I'm glad people got together to give this DVD an average rating of 2.5 stars, because it doesn't deserve more than that. Release ""greatest hits"" collections when you're done putting out season sets. As for those who claim buying this DVD will help convince Fox to make season sets - don't pee on my shoe and tell me it's raining.",1046217600,13,1742,4.481132075471698
1833913,3,B00008AOX6,"Why is it that studios today are releasing every tv show's entire first season??? I even saw that ""Evening Shade"" was being released... But when it comes to my favorite show ""Married with Children"", the piecemeal it out in these little ... 5 or 6 episode bits... What an insult.
I still gave it 3 stars because I do enjoy Al and the gang. It didn't get 5 because I just hate FOX so much for doing this to us.",1045008000,10,408,4.1125

7981197,3,B00008AOX6,"I love ""Married With Children"" and watched it from the very first episode to the very last episode after eleven seasons. This DVD claims to be the second volume of the series' most outrageous episodes. The episodes include ""A Man's Castle"" From the fifth season; ""Raingirl"" from the fourth season; ""Have You Driven a Ford Lately?"" from the first season; ""If Al Had a Hammer"" from sixth season; and ""Who'll Stop the Rain?"" from the fourth season.

The first episode, ""A Man's Castle,"" from the fifth season where Peg redecorates Al's bathroom. It's funny especially when he goes to a gas station bathroom with other men and they let him go first. He jokes ""My wife made my bathroom pink.""

The second episode, ""Raingirl,"" from the fourth episode has Kelly working as a weather girl at a local television station while Al gets a raise at work. It's cute but not one of my personal favorites.

The third episode ""Have You Driven a Ford Lately?,"" from the first season has Steve and Al bonding over restoring an old Mustang car. They bought the car from one of Kelly's dates.

The fourth episode ""If Al Had a Hammer,"" is from the sixth season where Al builds his own room with his father's hammer.

The fifth episode is entitled ""Who'll Stop the Rain?,"" from the fourth season where Al is determined to fix the roof. By the fourth season, Steve is looking for a new career and brings home a deadly bug.

The tribute to Sinatra is really a commercial . The extras include trailers. I have watched all of the episodes numerous times so the episode choices were a bit disappointing. There were so many other better choices in the first six seasons.",1501977600,,1641,4.602739726027397

7981200,4,B00008AOX6,"Once again...a clan of loveable losers that took center stage in our living rooms back in the late '80s through the '90s...people of a lower middle-class existence that we can relate to when we all feel like we got a bum deal out of life. Just for the record this is not the dvd that contains the ""too shocking for TV"" episode called ""I'll See You In Court"" that one is on Volume 1. With that said the episodes listed are: ""A Man's Castle"" ""Raingirl"" ""Have You Driven a Ford Lately"" ""If Al Had a Hammer"" and ""Who'll Stop the Rain?""
Special highlights: Peg's re-decorating of Al's bathroom all girly-style, Kelly as a local weather-station intern being managed by none other than Al himself; she cracks me up mispronouncing ""Chicago"" saying it like ""Chick-ago"" lol...Al building his own private room and trying to repair the leaky roof with ensuing hilarious mishaps, Steve and Al restoring a classic Mustang. The usual nosy Rhoades neighbors, ascorbic wit from all characters and the sense of disenchantment with the modern-day ""American Dream"" how it's not all it's cracked up to be.
A great piece of entertainment that captured the vignettes of post-""Leave it to Beaver"" family life with just the right amount of raunch and wit. Back when sitcoms did their main duty well-made us laugh.",1425168000,,1288,4.806306306306307

7981204,5,B00008AOX6,"Memorable episodes in this package are ""Raingirl"",which premiered on Fox on April 29,1990 and ""Who'll Stop The Rain?"" which premiered nearly four months earlier on January 7,1990. These episodes are from Married...With Children's fourth season and I saw them both when they first aired. In ""Raingirl"",Kelly Bundy(Christina Applegate),takes a job on a TV news program as a ""weather bunny"". Her superiors realize how dyslexic Kelly is. Instead of saying ""storm"",she says ""strom"". Also she pronounces ""Chicago"" ""chick ago"". She was under contract for three years with an annual salary of $250,000 but her contract was revoked shortly after taking the job. Kelly's brother Bud(David Faustino) conducts a tour of the Bundy home(the tourists are Bud's high school buddies) and the buddies wave to Bud's and Kelly's mother Peggy(Katey Sagal) but not their father Al(Ed O'Neill). Kelly could have been making more money then Al as a shoe store manager. In ""Who'll Stop The Rain?"",Al goes to war against the Bundys' roof to plug up a hole and fix the television antenna atop it. Al,in his ""moron on the roof suit"",as Peggy calls it,falls off the Bundys roof,landing in the backyard. In another scene,Al and Peggy are in their bed and Al has a frying pan over his head to catch the dripping rainwater falling through the hole in the roof. After many pleas to call a profesional plumber,Al does no such thing. That's why he went up on the roof himself. This episode was also one of David Garrison's last. In this same episode,Garrison as former accountant Steve Rhoades,brings a gerbil from a pet store he now works at to the Bundy household. The female,poisonous creature attacked his wife Marcy(Amanda Bearse) after Steve placed her on Marcy's back. Steve told Marcy that the creature,that he thought was male and non-poisionous was just playing. Marcy ended up with a large lump on her back. After Garrison departed from the series in late 1989,it was written that Steve and Marcy got divorced and Steve became a forest ranger. But Marcy re-married a short time later. Long Branch,New Jersey-born Garrison returned to New York City to do a broadway show(he commuted from NYC to California to do MWC). He was later succeeded by Ted McGinley,late of Happy Days,who would play playboy Jefferson D'Arcy,who'd become Marcy's second husband and stick with her through the 1997 cancellation. The other episodes are awesome! This item is a must for every MWC fan.",1133222400,,2447,5.029556650246305
7981205,5,B00008AOX6,"It has been some time since this was released, and Seasons 1-3 are now out on DVD (Season Three having a busted theme song), but there are still points to make on this product.

Not necessarily a ""bad"" DVD per se, this (and Volume One) was intended to gauge customer response. If response was great, more DVDs (and season sets) were to follow. I guess we can safely say that response was DAMN great! Aside from picture quality issues (I'm not gonna say it's great, I ain't gonna say it ain't), the subsequent season sets were quite great!
