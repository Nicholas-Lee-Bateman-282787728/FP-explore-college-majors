6359004,2,B00JIW9S1S,"Slickly produced film with flawed script.  Adult protagonists are far less likeable than the children and the dog, Tucker.
Ostensibly ""good"" hardworking people wield power over each other mid-family and community, adults make threats, adults ignore animal neglect and abuse, and adults regard a dog solely as property.
Life saving dramas and plot resolutions do not diminish dour delivery of harsh realities, stern statements, and questionable lessons about what constitute moral decisions and appropriate actions.  Tucker's adult owner being called ""gracious"" by grandma suggests that her charitable instincts cloud her perceptions of reality.  A neat post Christmas dinner sermonette in part evidences the movie's flaws. One may reasonably consider that the script results from efforts to create a story as a means of sermon delivery.",1479513600,,836,5.672

6359015,3,B00JIW9S1S,"This is the story about how a fatherless boy, living with his grandparents, comes together with a golden retriever.  The kid and the dog are wonderful.  The plot, however is a bit much, involving a curmudgeonly grandfather, and a ne'er-do'well next door neighbor who implies that he can possibly abuses and certainly neglects the golden  'just because he can'.

At first the neighbor kids don't like the dog, because trapped in a small enclosure, it barks all day. However, when the ne'er-do'well briefly goes to jail, the grandfather (who has always refused to give his own son a dog) takes the dog in - one of those inexplicable scenarios where someone will do something for a stranger he never did for his own son/grandson.

Meanwhile it is a terrible winter.  The kid ends up working a shift running a snow plow (and he looks about 11-12) and milking cows at 4am, then falling asleep in school in between. Meanwhile the other adult, the grandmother, makes dinner and answers the phone while the kid works. When the ne'er-do'well returns the dog goes back to him, until he gets in trouble again, (the kid, who in addition to delivering milk to everyone on the plow route, also gets caged into delivering something else to the ne'er-do-while.

The kid  takes over the dog again after it nearly froze while the creep incapacitated himself post the special delivery.  The boy thinks, to his joy, that the dog is finally his. But when the grandfather finds out that the kid was involved (though he was concerned for the dog and threatened to boot) demands the kid give the dog back to the creep, because the kid has proven he doesn't deserve it  Meanwhile, I'm thinking, the creep certainly is worse (and is an adult).  And why can't the grandfather teach his moral lesson to the kid in some way that doesn't involve returning an animal to someone guilty of neglect, if not outright abuse?  Why make the helpless animal a pawn in his moral lesson?  What kind of moral lesson does that teach, given it nearly froze to death before?

You can see I don't think much of whomever wrote the screenplay, because the dog is handled more like a prop than a creature. The adults (and even the kid who solemnly agrees he doesn't deserve the dog) regard it's welfare as secondary to their morality play.  Anyway after a few more plot twists, it ends well enough.  But I ended up liking the dog a lot more than any of the people. A sweet golden who was cued through the movie by  an amusing rainshower of not so discreetly dropped treats. :)",1449273600,5,2527,4.604910714285714

6359017,5,B00JIW9S1S,"Watching this now-never saw it, it's playing right after ""A Dog Named Christmas"" ( a favorite!), so this will undoubtedly be on my DVD watchlist.
Take heart about this Region 2 Version.  If you google your DVD player's make/model about how to make it region free, you can watch different region dvds.
I have a Sanyo 22"" TV/dvd combo and also a Phillips portable (7"") player, was able to make both region free.
Instead of being Region 1, there is a way to make it 0 which should be region free.  The Phillips portable dvd player will play PAL dvds also (from Europe and outside USA).
I balk at the $32+ price on this dvd.  I agree-Halmark needs to reissue this.",1448236800,8,660,4.43801652892562
