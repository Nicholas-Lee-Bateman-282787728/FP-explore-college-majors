7909523,5,B00000I1HR,"The first section of this short (30 minute) film is in black and white, and contains footage of Diego Rivera working on his mural for the Detroit Institute of Art in 1932, as well as interviews of people who were there with him at the time. It's incredible to see him painting this vast project, using nothing bigger than pie plates for a palette.
The second part, in color, shows the entire glorious mural as the camera pans around the building, and then shows each piece individually, as selections from Rivera's writings that explain some of his symbolism are read. What  astounds me most is his use of perspective, and the expressive quality of the figures...it's pure genius.",976752000,9,680,4.762711864406779
