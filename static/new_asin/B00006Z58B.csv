7973378,1,B00006Z58B,"It's all about a karate lesson going on, and someone video taped it. Those rate 4 stars and above are probably people in the classes who bought it for their own collection. The whole show was shot under poor lighting (I think he does not want the distract the class that was going on.) and quite blurry.",1139961600,,303,4.333333333333333
7973379,5,B00006Z58B,This dvd demonstrates how powerful uechi ryu can actually be. It's a good dvd for the uechi ryu fan but a better dvd for anyone who has doubted the power found in the uechi ryu style. It's an excellent buy and comes highly recommended from an experienced martial artist.,1099958400,,270,4.530612244897959

7973381,1,B00006Z58B,"I ordered this DVD because my daughter takes this type of karate and I wanted a guide to help her learn the routines, which can get complicated. However, the quality of this DVD is COMPLETELY unacceptable -- it's so dark and pixilated in most places that one cannot even see what is happening. It is truly awful, and totally unwatchable. If there was a negative stars rating I would have used that -- I hate to give this even one star. I have written to Amazon and suggested they remove this piece of, well, you know, from their site to avoid disappointing more customers.",1049068800,9,572,4.509615384615385
