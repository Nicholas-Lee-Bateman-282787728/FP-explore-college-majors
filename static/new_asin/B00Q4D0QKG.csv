6853918,4,B00Q4D0QKG,"In the interest of being honest, I want to say that my son and I were zombie extras in this movie, so we were really looking forward to seeing this film. We did see it during it's first showing and I have to say, I was happily surprised. Knowing this was a lower budget movie by first time director Brett Mullen, my expectations were low, until I started seeing his body of work. He has done extensive commercial work including ESPN and Hondajet and you can see his skills when viewing those projects. Anyway, back to the movie...

Apparently this movie was done in the style of Italian horror films of the 70's and 80's. If you are a fan of those, then you will enjoy this. Me, I have no idea what that means. I'm just a fan of fun horror flicks, and this one is FUN. The story line is fine and the acting is good, but what really shocked me was the quality of the special effects and the video work. It is a beautiful movie to watch. Being an extra on set and seeing the crew ready a HUGE drone carrying a full size Canon dSLR camera to do flyby's during shooting let me know this wasn't just some silly school film project. It was being taken seriously. And the effort paid off.

If you enjoy your horror movies with humor, good acting and fantastic video and special affects, then this movie is for you. Buy it, you won't be disappointed.",1419379200,6,1342,4.258823529411765

6853920,3,B00Q4D0QKG,"This is a solid 3.5 star corny zombie move.
It is fairly well written, has decent actors.

Do not go into this, thinking it is a billion dollar Hollywood movie.
This is a charming horror flick that has some really good moments.

I'm not sure what you could expect going into this with a title like Bombshell Bloodbath. Other than a charming zombie flick.",1464825600,,354,4.515625
6853921,4,B00Q4D0QKG,"Very good send up of B-movies. I would like to hear a director's commentary
revealing all of the movies he borrowed from.
Good cinematography and effects for  a $500,000 budget.
Solid lead performances.
I watched the classic 1985 ""The Return of the Living Dead"" in a small
movie house. The audience reaction was incredible, with alternating screams and laughter.
Watching it, or Bombshell Bloodbath now,solo, on a computer monitor is just not the same experience.",1464566400,3,463,5.173333333333333
6853922,2,B00Q4D0QKG,"as drive-in grade grindcore it works well. T, A & zombies ... what's not to love? as serious cinema it does not work at all, but the producers and the director make plain that the movie is not serious cinema and should not be viewed that way. i have no doubt that the producers and director are pleased with their product, the hard copy of their hard work. as drive-in grindcore i would give it 4 1/2 stars which is probably a more honest and relevant appraisal of the movie as applied to its intended audience.",1464220800,6,511,4.333333333333333

When exposed to her father's experimental attempts to reanimate his wife, Cara (Alex Elliott), must find a way to protect her family's secret while slowly slipping into the world of the living dead.

If you love a good zombie movie then look no further as this one is very unique fresh and quite a gem, its a small budget movie but is really well thought up, it does steal things from previous horror movies and mashes them up but in its own style, the movie is a great homage to 70's and 80's zombie movies and really feels like a movie from the VHS era allot more than most that have tried over the years, the music score especially is very cool and has a 70's-80's vibe, the cast is all good here and the effects are all oldschool, some good bloody gory moments throughout, this is really worth picking up, great zombie entertainment!",1456531200,,845,4.451612903225806
6853925,2,B00Q4D0QKG,"This is a hillbilly zombie film that takes place in the 1970's (?) or so. The deranged Dr. Carter (Rob Springer) experiments with stem cells in an attempt to re-animate his wife, but creating zombies instead. Most of the film was boring. The rednecks killing zombie scenes provided some brief entertainment, they should have started there.

As far as the nuts and bolts of the film, i.e. soundtrack, low budget effects, etc. it was superior to most low budgets. No hand held jerking and choppy sound.  The plot stagnated and the actors couldn't make the dialogue exciting.

6853928,3,B00Q4D0QKG,"** I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

When looking at indie zombie flicks, I'm willing to overlook a lot IF the film has a lot of heart.  This means I will look past mediocre acting and even a flimsy storyline, but only if the film is a labor of love.  These movies are usually easy to spot, mainly because they pay homage to some of the excellent living dead flicks from yesteryear.  Such is the case with BOMBSHELL BLOODBATH, a film from Monarch Home Entertainment that is far from perfect, but still a lot of fun nevertheless.  This film is a low-budget jaunt into familiar territory, but is worth checking out.  And what it lacks in budget, it makes with heart.

I knew I was probably going to like this film from the start.  The opening scenes show some great zombie makeup, which is a huge plus for me in any film.  Also, in addition to the zombie effects, we get some nice gore, too.  These two components alone are enough for me to recommend the film.

BOMBSHELL BLOODBATH looks decent from a cinematography standpoint, however there's nothing that necessarily makes it stand out.  Likewise, the production value of the film looks fairly high for the most part, a nice touch given the film's low budget...however, there are a couple of aspects that just broadcast it as a cheaply made film.

First and foremost is the acting.  The primary cast is pretty talented, and they do a great job in their roles overall.  However, the background and secondary characters are cringeworthy in almost every regard.  This becomes painfully evident late in the film when a group of rednecks show up in a truck to target practice on a group of zombies.  As much as it pains me to say it, these cheesy stereotypes almost ruined the film for me.

The storyline of BOMBSHELL BLOODBATH is straightforward to start off with, but soon diverges into a few odd subplots.  This part of the film threw me for a loop, because I wasn't sure where the story was going.  At the end, things are wrapped up for the most part, which made me go, ""Oh, ok...I see why that happened now"", however at the time it was kinda confusing.  I don't really classify this as a negative, however it is certainly noteworthy.  My actual complaint about the plot is the explanation of the title; it isn't mentioned until the very end, but it doesn't make sense to me.

On the flipside, the special effects team in BOMBSHELL BLOODBATH deserves a round of applause.  I love the makeup and the gore because it definitely gives a nod to Fulci's classic, ZOMBIE.  The fact that so much effort was put into the effects shows a true desire to make a solid movie.  Thus, I cannot fault the production team for a slightly confusing plot or mediocre acting.

Although it has some faults, BOMBSHELL BLOODBATH is still a slick indie zombie film that is worth checking out.  I commend director Brett Mullen on what he has accomplished here, and I look forward to seeing more of his work in the future.  The film is available today if you want to give it a look.",1422316800,4,3044,4.513711151736746
8690270,4,B00Q4D0QKG,"Very well done for a B film. I loved the grindhouse feel and the practical effects. The acting surprisingly wasn't bad. There was obviously errors in the film, from forced jokes, to some sub-par acting (though not everyone), a scene where a guy has no blood then the very next second he has it on his face lol, and the wrong sound of a knife dropping from the foley artist. Alex Elliott was a standout talent, I thought she did very well.",1532563200,,438,4.353658536585366
8690271,5,B00Q4D0QKG,"Look, some of the acting isn't great and the production value isn't perfect. However, the make-up and special effects are great. The camera work is good. And the story is is good as well. I could sense the various influences on the director (Tarantino especially). I really liked it and don't understand why it got such low reviews.
