7825656,4,6302453143,"Esther is shooting a movie and is engaged to her costar. She is aggressively pursued by a navel officer serving as an advisor on the film. Quintessential Esther Williams. Splashy musical numbers from the start. Lots of music, water, swimming, singing, dancing, beauty. Durante provides the humor. Cugat and his band provide most of the music. More dancing and singing than dialogue or plot. If you appreciate these stars, give it a try. Entertaining.",1477267200,,450,5.094594594594595
7825657,1,6302453143,"The dancing, swimming and singing (Durante) routines were all dull and below what these great performers did in other movies. SOB director Richard Thorpe got both Esther and Cyd badly injured, physically, but luckily for all the stars, who were all about the same age (late 20's), this badly directed movie didn't derail their careers. Every routine is off. Montalban with his driving, threatening tone of voice and Lawford with his nasal delivery were competing for most annoying boyfriend. Only Williams and the chihuahua dog looked up to snuff. She's the only player in this movie, the others seem like stand-ins. It's incredible this incompetent director couldn't get more out of this script, the choreography was poor also. Cyd Charisse showed what a lousy dancer Ricardo Montalban was, even as he's praised for being good. Finally, Florida is a very different tropic than Hawaii, they were in the former pretending to be in the latter, complete with hula dancers and sarongs. The costuming was good, the stars all looked great.",1448409600,,1033,5.08235294117647
7825658,4,6302453143,"On an Island With You is fun because it is a movie about making a movie, but the all-star cast and MGM production values take it a notch above the average story. A swimming starlet (Esther Williams) is making a movie with her fiancee (Ricardo Montalban) but she is being pursued by the movie's military consultant (Peter Lawford) while her co-star (Cyd Charisse) is making eyes at her man. The lovesick soldier takes matters into his own hands and flies the object of his affections to a remote island where they once met during a USO show. How we are meant to empathize with a man who literally kidnaps a woman and forces himself on her I do not know. Truth be told, the set-up almost makes us, almost. But the chemistry between Williams and Montalban in their late-night swim routine is too strong to make us root for Lawford too much. The opulence of the movie is the real draw and it delivers generously. If you're looking for a wonderful escape, look no further.",1430697600,,967,4.531428571428571
7825659,5,6302453143,"A classic movie with the gorgeous EstherWilliams. Add to that a fine musical adventure with Syd Charisse,Xavier Cougart and his Orchestra. And,for me Jimmy Durante is the co star. One of the best entertainers of that era(1948) his personna is timeless. A throwback to a glamorous Hollywood era that is lost but thankfully preserved in film.",1428969600,,340,5.089285714285714

7825661,5,6302453143,"Filmed on Anna Maria Island in Florida, this movie is for those who love the beautiful laid back Florida atmosphere, swimming and just clean fun. Esther Williams is gorgeous, as always in her films.
I liked the movie, not only because I am a fan of Esther Williams, but also because of our vacationing on Anna Maria Island numerous times since 2003. It was fun to see what it looked like back in the 1940's.
Anna Maria Island is still a wonderful, laid back ""old"" Florida that has no high rises. The scenery of the movie was the highlight for me.",1377129600,,546,4.415841584158416

7825663,4,6302453143,"I like Esther Williams movies especially when she is paired with someone handsome, so this was a good combination with Peter Lawford and Ricardo Montalban both; I wish she would have done more films with one of them. I like the Latin dance numbers with Ricardo Montalban and Cyd Charisse, and the storyline is romantic, though the ending is a little abrupt (which isn't surprising with MGM musicals!).

  Great on a windy night with popcorn and hot chocolate!",1144800000,,459,4.858974358974359
7825664,4,6302453143,"I am now an Esther Williams fan, thanks to this film. I found her to be quite a funny actress. HEE-HEE!!! I was slightly annoyed to find that Jimmy Durante was in this, though, (i can't stand him), but I managed to get along.
There were several dance scenes that I thought were uncalled for and much too long. Boredom. And I was watching this on TV, so I couldn't skip them!!
Undoubtedly, my favorite character was the beyond-adorable Penelope Peabody, a very minor person. She was played Kathryn Beaumont, best known for voicing Alice in Disney's Alice in Wonderland and Wendy in Disney's Peter Pan. She was about six or seven years old, and her little British accent was too cute!
I suppose that I recommend this film to all...yes, i do!",1064707200,5,739,4.56390977443609
