Mr. Banks, his pretty wife and all the kids. The DVD's are good quality not great but respectable and very watchable. Sound can be a bit muddled at times but not horrible. One DVD had goo glue on it but with work I got it cleaned up without damage. I won't take a star off for anything I can fix to brand new condition.",1511568000,,466,3.8645833333333335

5558577,5,B00B5AAWD4,"Fortuenly enough I had no issues with missing episodes or mislabeled disks, though that seems to be corrected by the manufacture based on recent reviews.

I love this show so I knew what I was getting in terms of content, so I won't go into detail there aside from the show being great due to its equal balance of comedy and message.

What I wanted to review instead was the packaging and the collection itself. I must say that it is amazingly put together. From the box to the disk, there is enough splashing of colors to be reminiscent of the shows 90s astethics. Inside each case is a stacking of the DVDs, which doesn't seem to be much of a problem compared to some other box collections that attempted that. Also inside the case is a paper describing what each disk contains along with a brief description of each episode. As for the disk, they are all clearly identified with the number of designation along with a color of their own.

Overall, incredibly organized for the person who cannot stand a mess for a collection. This is by far one of my favorite collections, need I say more?

If there are any complaints it would be with the handling and not so much due to the design of the collection. I did notice some tear on the box set cover but the most noticeable was a crack in plastic of one of the disk cases.",1503273600,9,1321,4.357723577235772

5558580,5,B00B5AAWD4,"I think far too often, some folks review the actual shows and not the product.  I'll try and do both.

The show:  to me, it was a very family friendly, in your face with current issues/social problems of the time (which still exist today).  It broached many topics in a hilarious way, and the cast had a very solid chemistry, even after the new Aunt Viv debuted.  The series finale is still one that was so emotionally driven, but I think you can say that about any show you invest 7-ish years of your life watching characters in.  From Will Smith to Jazzy Jeff, and Uncle Phil to Carlton, this show was and is one of my favorites of all time.

The product:  it came exactly as advertised in a nice kept, well organized box set.  The price, in comparison to me shopping around, was solid as well.  The best deal I found was season 1 at Wal-Mart for only $9, but they didn't have any other seasons.  I've watched the show from the discs, and the quality was superb.  Overall, a solid purchase",1499212800,4,991,4.326086956521739

5558584,5,B00B5AAWD4,"I love this show! I put off buying the series because the price seemed high for a show, but it was worth it. And the quality is better than I expected for a 90s show. I only wish they could have condensed it to 5 or less dvds instead of 20. Still, I'm happy.",1489190400,,258,3.7962962962962963
5558585,5,B00B5AAWD4,So cool to get the entire season of the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air!  I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it!,1486339200,,124,3.96

5558629,4,B00B5AAWD4,The reason for the four stars is solely based on the DVD cases in which the seasons arrived in. They arrived in those annoying cases where all the discs are stacked on top of one other. I have always found that annoying but manageable. I simply purchase empty DVD cases and transfer them over - they're not too expensive luckily. Seasons 1-4 have four discs and 5-6 are three. None of the discs arrived damaged nor scratched and they all played perfectly!,1470096000,8,455,4.560975609756097

I'm glad I took their advice and watched them before the 30 day window.

This is how my Season 2 was set up:

Disc 1 = Disc 1
Disc 2 = Disc 1
Disc 3 = Disc 4
Disc 4 = Disc 2

If all the content was there but just mislabeled I could live with it but my content for Disc 3 is completely missing! So, since this isn't a real box set anyway and the seasons are just shrink wrapped together. I will be repurchasing them individually after I mail the return.",1383696000,3,571,3.8632478632478633
5558772,1,B00B5AAWD4,Manufacturing error - seasons were mixed up and mislabeled.  Some research indicated this was a common problem.  Had to return for my money back.  A set this poorly done with apparently no QC should be pulled until the errors are corrected,1383264000,2,239,4.780487804878049
5558773,5,B00B5AAWD4,Fast shipping. Exactly as described. Fresh Prince can't be topped. Worth every penny. It was a gift for my girl and she loves it.,1379289600,,129,4.416666666666667
5558774,2,B00B5AAWD4,One dvd was the exact repeat of another and therefore episodes are missing. I am very disappointed and would like it replaced.,1375488000,2,126,4.7727272727272725
5558775,5,B00B5AAWD4,Will Smith is so funny in this show as are all the other actors. One of the best shows of the 80s! Our family loves it!,1373241600,,119,3.6153846153846154
5558796,1,B00B5AAWD4,"Some of the disc's I received were not what they were suppose to be, they were not matched with their respective disc titles. For example, disc one and disc two were both disc four, and disc three was disc one, and disc four was disc two. Also, the case for season 1 was damaged on the inside and no longer can hold the disc in place. I would encourage you to buy from somewhere else. Great price but not worth it.",1373155200,,414,4.1234567901234565

5558803,1,B00B5AAWD4,"I bought this pack and took a nasty disappointment because the second season is wrong from factory, apparently there are four disks as there are four hard prints numbered 1 to 4 in different colors but here's the surprise when you play the DVDs happens:
The labeled as 1 DVD contains the chapters of the DVD 2. (Poor)
The labeled as 2 DVD contains the chapters of the DVD 2. (Good)
The labeled as 3 DVD contains the chapters of the DVD 3. (Good)
The labeled as 4 DVD contains the chapters of the DVD 1. (Poor)
In short, missing DVD 4, despite being badly printed, which is not ideal for what you pay, missing  six chapters and that's what I cannot accept, I hope the seller fix this as I have to pay extra for sending and returning goods.
Hope this does not happen with other seasons as I did not review them all.",1359676800,18,813,4.245161290322581

He watched disc 1 of season 2 and then when he popped in disc 2, we were both surprised to see the same menu and episodes. We look at the box and see that, even though the disc art is correct, the disc labeled disc 1 has the same episodes as disc 2. So even though we have a disc labeled disc 1, the content (episodes) on the disc is in fact, disc 2. So we have a duplicate of disc 2. No receipt. No refund.",1357084800,,556,3.7606837606837606

I ordered this DVD box set for myself after watching a marathon of it on TVone. Definitely worth the buy! You know its comedic genius when you can watch this show over and over, know the punchlines for every joke, and laugh at them....HARD like it came out yesterday. Forever one of the best shows on TV.",1357084800,,448,4.1022727272727275
5558831,3,B00B5AAWD4,I bought the entire season for a Christmas gift.  There were some damages to one of the DVD cases but overall the playback quality is great.  Not sure if it's worth the $125.00 price since I see the individual DVD sets on sale at Target for $7.99.  (6) seasons for $125.00?  It's a great collection but the price is high.,1356825600,,321,4.3

Finally in May of 2010 it prospered and continued on with honors! I was going around and telling my friends and family about it. Trying to keep the sales strong and luckily it did for the 6th and final season came out in April of 2011. Almost a year after it's 5th season release. This is the kind of respect that I hope I can see for ""The Wayans Bros."", ""Murphy Brown"" ""The Jamie Foxx Show"" etc real soon. But bottom line ""Fresh Prince"" is a great classic show.

In a nutshell, the disc was mislabeled and so lucky me, I got 2 disc 2's and no disc 1.  As the packaging on these seasons were the original manufacturer wrappers, I don't know if this just got by quality control or what.
