3147248,5,B0015RRNJI,"This is a truly amazing collection of underwater films. Anyone who likes fish, sharks, the beauty that lives in the ocean or is interested in oceanic conservation will love this set. I've been watching it with my son who is really interested in this kind of stuff since going to the aquarium. We have both learned a lot.",1225670400,20,320,4.5344827586206895

8259717,1,B0015RRNJI,"It was a total waste of good money, an older film about someone's attempt to make a documentary about  coral reefs and ship wrecks.  Some of the footage was reused over and over.  Reminds me of a much older show I used to watch before I went to school in the 60's.",1449273600,,264,4.038461538461538
8259718,1,B0015RRNJI,very old footage it was analog night HD bad quality I gave it to the library,1426723200,,76,3.8125
8259719,2,B0015RRNJI,"The photography is very low resolution and the music is very repetitive. However, the shipping was fine no problems there.",1384387200,,122,5.15
8259720,1,B0015RRNJI,"Others have said it, but let me echo their sentiments.  The production claims to be shot in high definition.  Yeah, right... in their dreams.  This looks worse than an old VHS tape. I couldn't even finish it.  It's full of ramblings by the guy who made it, so save yourself some time and money and pass on this.",1381536000,,311,4.310344827586207
8259721,1,B0015RRNJI,"If you're willing to make the best of it, mute the sound entirely to create an opportunity to imagine what they could be saying. In every case that would be more interesting and sound better than what they are saying. As well, you can save yourself from becoming subject to the crappiest audio track of all time. Then you're set to view vintage washed-out footage and hang onto the idea that you haven't gotten screwed. After those four seconds are over be prepared to accept that you have been. In this instance SCUBA means sorry, caution unconditionally and boldly advised.",1314230400,,575,4.76
8259722,1,B0015RRNJI,"I bought this thinking it was by the makers of Planet Earth.  Not so!  (If you're looking for that it's called ""Blue Planet"", which I do recommend).  The quality of Planet Ocean was very poor.  Although it says 2008, most of the footage is quite dated.  I was very disappointed with the narrative as well.",1248652800,7,305,4.472727272727273
8259723,1,B0015RRNJI,"First of all, this is a Canadian production that was originally released as ""The Living Sea - Collectors Edition"".  It has no link whatsoever with the highly acclaimed Planet Earth collection.  As another reviewer mentions, the release date on this set is 2008.  The copyright date however is 1995, and I suspect the filming date is even earlier.  It appears to be a series of 20-30 minute films that look suspiciously like an old TV series.  I think the rerelease of this under the Planet Ocean title was a direct attempt to cash in on the success of the BBC Planet Earth series.

What that means is that film and sound quality are horrendous.  Watching it, I almost expected the flap-flap sound of a film roll running through an old projector. The colours were washed out.  Underwater lighting was inadequate, but may have been the best there was at the time of filming.  There were almost more shots of the divers than of any undersea critters.  Sound tracks were hokey at best, at times sounding like old westerns and at other times, sounding like Grade F sci-fi movies. Shots of fish were not very numerous and when they did find a good specimen, there are multiple shots that appear just to be cropped, while the narrator - marine biologist John Stoneman - drones on philosophically about the planets oceans. In the segment on shipwrecks, where some commentary would have been helpful, there was none, leaving you to wonder what was going on.  A lot of the segments were repetitive, covering subjects covered in other segments.  Each of the 4 disks has 2 25 minute segments on it, so that the fact that there are 4 disks is rather misleading, since we are only talking a 4 hour total here.

Generally, if you want to see underwater life, I'd give this set a miss.  Instead, I'd highly recommend Ocean Realm.  Film quality is vastly superior in Ocean Realm.",1242000000,25,1862,4.651376146788991
8259724,1,B0015RRNJI,Although the release date is listed as 2008 this series was obviously photographed a number of years ago. Photographic quality as well as sound quality is very inferior in comparison to contemporary standards. Limited narration is provided and the disks do not measure up to what would be expected from the text descriptions.,1239062400,10,325,5.150943396226415
