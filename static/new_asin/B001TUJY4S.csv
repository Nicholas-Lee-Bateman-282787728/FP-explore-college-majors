So what sets this apart from all the others, well, not much - but considering the amount of really bad zombie films that us horror fans watch from day to day and invest in - this one is a step up for the no-budget zombie flick.  I was a bit annoyed that a zombie gets shot in the gut with a shotgun and nothing happens to him except he falls back - the special effects, some are good, some could of used work, but in regards to the effects the zombie baby toward the end of the film was awesome, a riot, fun, entertaining scene.  In these no budget flicks I kinda give 'em a pass as long as they try to put in some good gore and blood.  My only real knock on the film is the pacing, for crying out loud, the amount of driving shots in this film were mind-numbing.  It feels padded and I don't like that - just make a shorter film.  I enjoyed it and have watched it a few times and it's def. worth a watch considering the amount of doe we drop on these films, at least this one ain't half bad.  It ain't a 10 and it ain't an A plus, but what it is, is an okay zombie flick worth throwing on the tube and giving it a watch.",1327968000,,1260,3.9137254901960783
