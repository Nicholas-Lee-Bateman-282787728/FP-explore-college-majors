8197468,3,B000QUCQVK,"This is a fun dvd and despite the only other customer review I bought it anyway. It's a two dvd set,the first disc has two movies one is Lady Frankenstein wich stars Joseph Cotten (lattitude zero,soylent green)and suprisenly some nudie scenes. The other movie is Jesse James meets Frankenstein wich is why I purchased the dvd in the first place. The title alone attracted me. The second disc has an interesting documentry wich focuses on Mary Schelly's life and a bunch of trailers from the Frankenstein brand including universals original Franky and other lesser ones like Frankenstein vs. The Space monster. Pick it up used it's worth the few bucks.",1326931200,,651,4.927272727272728
8197469,2,B000QUCQVK,"Being the horror fan that I am,and therefore quite the fan of Mary Shelly's classic story,I purchased this DVD.....used for 1.00.
DO NOT PAY THE TEN DOLLARS,that this site charges for this DVD,because this is clearly of a bargain basement background.
Despite cute packaging,not much creative is in store for the curious.
Two films are available on the set,the already available public domain titles of Jesse James meets Frankenstein's Daughter(1966),which has the distinction of being both director William Beaudine's final film,and one of the worst horror(and western!) films ever made.
The second film is the Hammer ripoff,Lady Frankenstein(1972),which has the distinction of being directed by Mel welles(the flower shop owner in the original,Little Shop of horrors),Joseph Cotten(!) as Doctor Frankenstein,and the gorgeous(and frequently unclothed)Sara Bey as his daughter.
The Dvd is also accompanied by a documentary which focuses on Shelly's life and how Frankenstein was developed. The film quickly goes into tedium however as it goes(consistently) into topics of irrelevancy and confusion,and bores the viewer.
Probally the only Frankenstein documentary that also never mentions Boris Karloff!
There's also a few trailers of some classic Frankenstein films for filler to try to satisfy the fans.
Overall,a very cheap package,but okay if you FEEL you NEED the above mentioned titles,or if your a completist of some kind,but other than that,nothing special.",1222560000,2,1463,5.684931506849315
