4018243,5,B002ZG4QDE,"Honestly I have never seen the Academy Award-winning Wallace & Gromit but I am sure glad it's creators came out with Shaun the Sheep. I have seen Shaun the Sheep a few times as short skits on the Disney channel, but I didn't think much of it. When I watched this DVD, I laughed, laughed, and laughed some more! It is adorable and even though it is claymation and doesn't use spoken words. The way those mischievous sheep get into trouble with the dog trying to watch over them, and somehow the farmer never catches them!

Shaun the Sheep ""A Woolly Good Time"" is just the newest video featuring those crazy sheep and it is 40 minutes of laughs, and I don't usually like slapstick humor. I was really surprised too that my 3-year old liked it, as he usually only likes cartoon but even he was laughing when the sheep were sneaking around! I can still picture those crazy sheep with the farmers clothes on their heads! I would definitely recommend it for all ages, not just kids!

I was given a this DVD to review. This review is 100% my opinion and has not been edited or reviewed by anyone.",1265241600,33,1089,4.3861386138613865

4018245,5,B002ZG4QDE,Can never get tired of watching them over and over again. Thank you to the one who thought of creating them. A real family entertainment that is clean and funny.

4018248,5,B002ZG4QDE,"Our grandkids love Shaun the Sheep (and I do, too.) Our autistic granddaughter always wanted to watch it on Netflix when she came to our house. Then Netflix removed it from their list and she was unconsolable and couldn't understand why Grandma wouldn't play it for her. Finding these available on DVD saved a lot of crying when she comes to visit.",1427760000,,348,4.629032258064516
4018249,5,B002ZG4QDE,"OH.My. Gosh - these are an absolute hoot. You hear about ""good for all ages"" - well these REALLY are - from toddlers (nonverbal) to the oldest of the old - really a hoot. Claymation, from the Aran sweater designs to the sheep who drop poop when scared - just a riot. Better for kids than the punch-em-shoot-em-up or dainty-girly pablum offered for kids these days. Just an absolute delight.",1427500800,,390,4.585714285714285

4018264,5,B002ZG4QDE,Shaun the Sheep are really fun DVDs. They are interesting stories and a lot of fun to watch. I really like the way they are made and produced.,1397606400,,142,4.107142857142857

4018266,5,B002ZG4QDE,"No boogers, no yellow sponge, no talking back to elders in this claymation series.  I feel great about letting my six year old watch Shaun the Sheep.  Most of the time I even watch it with her just because it is so funny.  Many laugh out loud moments.  I sent this to my nephews and a great aunt who all loved it.",1392163200,,313,4.0

4018269,5,B002ZG4QDE,I bought this for my little grandson as he loves Shaun the Sheep. it is a fun movie enjoyed by all ages--even his Nana lol. So nice to have something for him to watch that has no hidden meaning just good clean fun--call me cynical but so much of what is on tv and in the movies that purports to be for children is far from innocent. Shaun is just good clean fun.,1387065600,,362,3.9726027397260273

4018271,5,B002ZG4QDE,"Oh, my goodness!  These things are by one of the most gifted of fellows.  He then compiled a team with the same sense of humor.  The hours of Claymation it takes to do this sort of thing.  And the other videos this man has created...the one on the moon and about Wensleydale Cheese, especially, and the one  --well, any of them!  Wonderfully whimsical!  Get.

4018272,5,B002ZG4QDE,"Gotta tell ya...Shaun the Sheep is classic.  I put it on Netflix for my toddler and my wife and I now love it as much as she does.
It's funny, it's clean, and the characters are great.

Parents, you will  not go wrong with buying any of Shaun's DVDs.  Veggie Tales is great with a moral, but Shaun is just slapstick fun and laughs.

And creators...bring more! Don't stop with just two seasons or so....",1362700800,,402,4.306666666666667
4018273,5,B002ZG4QDE,"Shaun the Sheep is HILARIOUS!  If you've never watched it, please order this and start it up as soon as it arrives on your doorstep.  Our kids (6 and 3) laugh and laugh at the scenarios that Shaun gets himself into... and my husband and I do, too!  We own several different Shaun the Sheep videos, and this one is great!",1361145600,,320,4.213114754098361

4018275,5,B002ZG4QDE,"I am a 22 year old without children, and I love this show! I only say this because it doesn't have to be a ""children's"" show, Shaun the Sheep is one of the few good, clean shows on television! It's funny and entertaining, and it doesn't hurt that the sheep are so darn cute!!",1309046400,6,275,4.111111111111111

4018277,5,B002ZG4QDE,The transaction with Media Planet was as expected.  Maybe a day long on shipping but still on target.  Their prices blew everyone else away! The DVD has been viewed several times by the kids and it seems as high of quality as any other DVD I may have purchased at the store.  Shaun the Sheep is funny stuff!!,1295308800,,308,4.275862068965517
4018278,5,B002ZG4QDE,"Shaun the Sheep is perfect for children of any age.  The stories are interesting, and there is always a good message.

I've shown this DVD to kids from three to sixty-three, and all enjoyed it thoroughly.

I highly recommend that you add the entire Shaun the Sheep collection to your private DVD library.

In service,

4018282,5,B002ZG4QDE,"this was an easter present for my 3 1/2 year old.  the whole family enjoys it, there is the obvious animation attraction for a kid, but there is also a level of jokes kids don't get but parents do.",1272499200,5,197,4.051282051282051
4018283,3,B002ZG4QDE,"This is a cute video, but my 5 y/o wanted this specifically for the pigs on the cover.  We were all disappointed to find that the pigs aren't in this episode at all, contrary to both the cover and cover description. The Wallace and Grommit shorts (Wrong Trousers, A Fine Day Out, Close Shave) are perfect for the whole family, but the Shauns and their nonverbal slapstick humor appeal more to my children, not so much the parents. If this is your first Shaun, go for Off the Baa rather than this one.",1271635200,5,500,4.376344086021505
4018284,5,B002ZG4QDE,"I have a 5.5 year old boy and a 2.5 year old girl and they love Shaun the Sheep. I'll admit, I find myself getting sucked into watching it with them too. It's amazing to me how a movie without words can be so entertaining but I think that's what makes it even more hilarious. The facial expressions on the sheep crack me up every time and the dog is absolutely hilarious. You will not be disappointed with this or any Shaun the Sheep movie!",1271116800,3,440,4.188235294117647

Unfortunately, there are only 6 episodes totaling 40 minutes, and the front & back cover both show the pigs which do not appear in any of the episodes.
Also, they have added some new sound effects, which is neither here nor there.

4018290,4,B002ZG4QDE,"Great Shaun the Sheep shorts from Aardman for kids and Adults. Good buy for smaller kids due to the nonexistence of dialogue.

Any child can follow along Shaun, the other sheep and farm dog as they skirt around problems and always arrive at a humorous end.",1268265600,3,318,4.8
4018291,5,B002ZG4QDE,"This DVD is one of many Shaun The Sheep in our collection. My kids love them all and this one is no exception. I enjoy watching it, too as there's always a touch of adult humor that goes right over the kids' heads. I love Shaun b/c I can rest assured there is no violence or foul language (no language at all, actually!) and I can let my kids watch it while I'm out of the room. It's wonderful b/c there are few DVDs that the kids love and I like as well so it's great to watch them together, too. Highly recommended.",1268265600,12,517,4.029126213592233
