1339620,5,B00004CZV5,"John Mills plays a submarine commander in ABOVE US THE WAVES (1955), the fascinating, essentially true story of a clandestine British mission to destroy a superior German battleship that is wreaking havoc on Allied supply convoys.  The bold plan is to approach the battleship in still unproven four-man submarines and, rather than torpedo the vessel, plant explosives underneath their target's hull.

Ralph Thomas directed the suspenseful drama, which co-stars John Gregson, Donald Sinden, James Robertson Justice and, in smaller roles, Theodore Bikel and Anthony Newley.

Directed by Ralph Thomas

Another great film from the British Invasion from VCI.  This film is a low key film with subdued performances. War isn't depicted as a heroic game, as these men face deadly danger and fully aware of it.  Do your job and carry on quietly - now that's bloody real courage for you.

German stereotypes on the Tirpitz, yet their Captain salutes the ""brave men"" who have arrived to attack his boat.

Great acting, powerful direction and real emotion, with an excellent British cast the way they used to make them.

John Mills and John Gregson are the background of training and the eventual attack is very absorbing, filmed in beautiful stark black and white.

Watch for a young Anthony Newley in the Midget X class submarine sequences.

Special footnote: -- In the film, the name of the vessel that carried the manned human torpedo chariots was called ""Ingebord"" but in the real-life it was really named ""Arthur"".  The code-name of the real life World War II mission that this film was based on was Operation Source. This operation utilized the Royal Navy's midget X class submarines.

1339622,3,B00004CZV5,"I purchased this video out of curiosity.  I had read a Reader's Digest ""condensed book"" version of the story of the British attempt to sink the Tirpitz.  That was circa late 70's or very early 80's and I don't remember the details of that written story except that it was titled ""Twelve Against The Tirpitz"" and involved a number of tiny submarines and was fascinating reading.  This movie version of the story is a bit dry and, if you don't know the background history of the Tirpitz and the attempts to sink her, is likely to be somewhat confusing and disjointed.  I'd recommend watching this movie only if you first read the historical data about the Tirpitz as available on wikipedia or some other source.",1243296000,8,709,4.648
1339623,4,B00004CZV5,"This movie is based on true events which took place in the UK and Norway during the Second World War. The German battleship Tirpitz was wreaking havoc on British shippimg in the North Sea. It was anchored in a remote and inaccessible Norwegian fjord and was impervious to attacks from the air or from the sea using conventional surface vessels or ordinary submarines. The British Admiralty devised a plan  to destroy the ship by using manned ,midget submarines to inflitrate the anchorage and destroy the ship

The movie takes us through the various stages of the expedition starting with its conception and the training for the mission ,followed by its execution and ending with the aftermath .In this respect it bears more kinship to a caper movie than to a blood and guts war movie .We are not given slam bang action here but sit back and watch to see if the plan works ,rather as we do in a caper movie like ,say Topkapi ,although the stakes are a great deal higher in this type of exercise .The movie works by the slow escalation of suspense and tension

World War Two movies were a key part of British cinema in the 1950's and this movie deploys many of the era's most stalwart performers all giving commendable performances .John Mills ,Donald Sinden ,John Gregson impress as mariners on the mission and James Robinson Justice does a neat turn as the Admiral in overall charge .

The monochrome photography of Ernest Seward adds much to the movie as does the suspenseful direction by Ralph Thomas

This celebration of planning and heroism is a well worth watching if suspense is your bag but not if you insist on lots of gunfire in your war movies",1193616000,31,1654,4.631399317406143

1339684,5,B00004CZV5,"This is a very good, solid old British war film telling an unbelievable but absolutely true story. Below, some more of my impressions, with limited SPOILERS.

This film as it was already said tells a true story. After the archi-famous operations ""Rheinubung"" (May 1941) in which ""Bismarck"" was lost and ""Cerberus"" (Channel Dash) in February 1942, which ended with ""Scharnhorst"" and ""Gneisenau"" being both mined and damaged, for the greatest part of 1942 and 1943 Hitler's Kriegsmarine was left with only one capital ship - the superbattleship ""Tirpitz"". Supported by four heavy cruisers (""Lutzow"", ""Admiral Scheer"", ""Admiral Hipper"" and ""Prinz Eugen""), three light cruisers (""Leipzig"", ""Nurnberg"" and ""Kln"") and a screen of as much as ten modern, powerful destroyers, with many U-Boats, ""Condor"" bombers and seaplanes acting as scouts, she was the main element of a potentially extremely lethal naval squadron (even if ultimately Kriegsmarine never managed to gather all those ships for one operation). In summer 1943 German squadron got even stronger, once ""Scharnhorst"" was repaired and returned to duty...

In order to ensure safety of allied convoys in Northern Atlantic and especially in Arctic waters, Royal Navy had to keep available in this area a considerable number of naval and air assets - and even US Navy had to chip in for a time... Or, in those decisive years of World War II (1942-43), all those ships, planes and men were badly needed elsewhere, from Central and Southern Atlantic to Mediterranean and Indian Ocean - and American heavy cruisers USS ""Wichita"" and USS ""Tuscaloosa"" and their screen were greatly missed by Nimitz in Pacific... If you are interested in knowing more about this pickle in which allies found themselves because of ""Tirpitz"" existence, there is a really good, comprehensive book on this topic ""Target Tirpitz: X-Craft, Agents and Dambusters - The Epic Quest to Destroy Hitler's Mightiest Warship"" by Patrick Bishop (see my review of this book).

Pressed relentlessly by Churchill, both Royal Navy and RAF tried to find a solution to this ""Tirpitz"" problem. Amongst the most promissing ideas was the use of naval special forces, operating unusual weapons. In the film we are told that Royal Navy high command was initially reluctant to consider that such operations could succeed - but that is definitely not true. The potentially deadly efficiency of unconventional naval attacks was greatly demonstrated by Italians already in First World War, on 1 November 1918, when Italian frogmen riding a manned torpedo sank the powerful, modern Austro-Hungarian dreadnought ""Viribus Unitis"". Later, already during World War II, Royal Navy itself was greatly hurt by such special attacks, when Italian explosive motorboats crippled heavy cruiser HMS ""York"" at Crete in March 1941, when Italian frogmen badly damaged battleships HMS ""Queen Elizabeth"" and HMS ""Valiant"" in Alexandria in December 1941 and finally when a Japanese midget submarine grievously injured battleship HMS ""Ramillies"" at Madagascar in May 1942. Therefore the value of naval special attack methods was in summer 1942 generally recognised...

This film tells the story of two attempts made against ""Tirpitz"": operation ""Title"" in October 1942, with frogmen using Chariot manned torpedoes and operation ""Source"" in September 1943, with the use of more performant midget submarines (X-crafts). It covers the selection of volunteers, the training, the first attack, the escape of frogmen by land to Sweden, the training for the use of X-Crafts and finally the second, extremely dramatic attack.

Made in 1955, this is an old film, in black and white, without virtually any special effects and sticking to the reality and therefore operating rather on a matter of fact, low-drama level - but all of this doesn't hurt this movie at all, to the contrary! Most of actors who play in ""Above us the waves"" are fogotten today, but in 1955 those men were considered as a rather ensemble cast, with John Mills, John Gregson, Donald Sinden, Michael Medwin and James Robertson Justice being the most known.

The last 20 minutes of this film count certainly amongst the most dramatic, nail-biting moments of war movie tension I ever saw - and I saw A LOT of war films!

The one thing which can be problematic for those who (like me) are not native English speakers is the absence of subtitles. With the sound being of rather average quality, nonobstant my fluency in English I had some problems to follow the dialogs... But this is a minor point.

Another minor points are some little details, like the presence of clearly POST World War II frigates in some scenes in British base and the massif use of Lanchester sub-machine guns by German sailors. On this latter point, OK, granted, with some effort they can pass for German MP-28s (of which they were copies), but honestly, couldn't the Royal Navu, which generously assisted in the making of this film find a couple of MP-40s somewhere? Finally, let's just stress, that any Kriegsmarine officer who would dare fly even of the most modest patrol ship the flag we see in this film (the official III Reich national flag - which was VERY different from naval flag!) would find himself in a penal squadron on the Ostfront, clearing mines somewhere near Leningrad - PRONTO! Honestly, considering that there is only one scene in which a Kriegsmarine flag was necessary, was it so difficult to actually find one?

Bottom line (sorry I couldn't resist...), this is an excellent movie, aged but still valiant, to see absolutely if you are into war films. Cut through the steel nets, avoid patroling destroyers, dive under ""Tirpitz"", arm the charges and try to make good your escape - and if you can't, well, count the minutes... Enjoy!",1381276800,,5767,5.100635593220339
1339695,4,B00004CZV5,"This film portrays a part of the British sub-aqua developments of men and small submersibles in WW2.
Italy and Japan had led the way, Britain and Germany followed on. The British deployed the best and most effective force and operations, although not suicidal, were both extremely dangerous from defensive measures and from the experimental nature of the equipment and machines.
These men did there duty as well as they could, and there actions were heroic, even as the film portrays them.

1339698,5,B00004CZV5,"It was a really good movie although it is a 1955 film technology. From what has been written it is more realistic as the equipment used was circa 1945 and apparently was readily available. The James Caan movie (X-1) is more fictitious (Cowboys and Nazi's) where as the 1955 one is trying to depict the real story of the Tirpitz Operation. They did not say that the Tirpitz was sunk or not sunk, but there was a huge explosion. The Tirpitz was knocked out of commission for about 6 months. This film actually was much closer to the truth than was really known at the time as PBS did a later show of diving ""archaeologists"" who wanted to find out just what did happen based on locations and what was on the bottom of the Fiord where the operation took place. Their summation was that the 1955 film was quite accurate. The 1955 film probably had a benefit of interviews of people who were there and had a more recent memory of what happened without a lot of interpretation which can fog events.
  Those guys were brave, I wouldn't have dived with those suits. It's a small wonder that they wore heavy wool sweaters. Those subs had to have been cold. The average water temp in that area in September is 55 degrees. Yowee! That's pretty cold. Having dived as a kid in water almost that cold without a wet-suit we could stay in about 20 minutes. At that point we would be shivering uncontrollably.",1366761600,2,1391,4.450980392156863
