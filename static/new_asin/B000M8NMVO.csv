2726849,1,B000M8NMVO,"I bought this set because I was jonesing to watch some baseball history before the season started, and boy am I sorry I bought this.  The narrator is bad, the soundtrack is cheesy and repetitive, and most of the biographical information is presented in a way that keeps it from being interesting.

Even at six times the price I recommend buying Ken Burns' ""Baseball"" documentary, by far the best thing I've ever seen about baseball.  But if an 18 hour documentary is too much for you to watch, then I would recommend the ""When it was a Game"" series.  Anything but ""Baseball's greatest Legends - Diamond Memories"".  This set is so bad that I was only able to get about 2/3 of the way through the first disc and I haven't even bothered looking at the other two discs that came with it.

Please, save yourselves the money and most importantly the time.  Do not buy this!",1177027200,9,867,4.484076433121019

8167120,2,B000M8NMVO,"You will see why you purchase Major League Baseball videos, or any baseball video that can pay for the rights to decent footage. I'm not going to overly bash this, as I acquired it relatively cheaply, but I watched it before giving it as a gift, and having watched it, I am NOT giving it as a gift. The information is all right and it's reasonably accurate, but the production values are a tad underdone as they say. You won't be pulling this out at Thanksgiving or Christmas or Opening Day and gathering people around the flatscreen to bask in the glow of this production. If you do, you're going to watch as people's eyes glaze over and they wander off into other rooms, and other realities, wondering what's playing down at the cineplex and begging off to go there. But--if you can get it cheap and you need something to watch as you nod off after the third eggnog, you go right ahead.",1384041600,6,888,4.420731707317073
8167121,5,B000M8NMVO,My grown son Loves baseball so I found the DVD to be a Perfect Brithday gift for him. He seems to be just as interested in the former plays more so than the new ones however he Loves anything that has to do with baseball. I am sure he wll enjoy and get much use from this DVD!,1373500800,,276,3.7758620689655173
8167122,5,B000M8NMVO,great video for any baseball fan! i would recommend it. Not too long..there is just enough information for each player.,1362268800,,119,5.0
8167123,4,B000M8NMVO,"For a baseball history buff, this is one that brings back great memories. Many black and white images of the earlier 50's, 60's, and on up highlight some of baseball's greatest players.",1359417600,,185,4.8125

8167125,3,B000M8NMVO,"A 3 DVD set organized into 9 ""innings"" and bonus material. Each inning is focused on one legendary player: Ruth, DiMaggio, Robinson, Mays, Gehrig, Reese and Mantle, with a closer look at the '61 Home Run race and some extra footage also provided. Narration on regular chapters sounds like an old elementary school film. Narration on bonus footage sounds like an old newsreel. Provides a very high level overview of the times and a very light look at the players -- it goes a mile wide and a foot deep -- but provides good old footage and pictures. It is mostly NY-centric, featuring Yankee, Dodger and Giants footage with little else.

Mixed bag in terms of highlights -- for example, while video footage of Babe Ruth's farewell at Yankee Stadium is shown, the audio is not included -- they just go on narrating while you see Babe speaking, which is disappointing. Also, one of the bonus chapters features highlights of the '56 World Series. However, the focus is more on rare color footage rather than true highlights, so while Larsen is mentioned and the final pitch is shown, Berra's memorable leap into Larsen's arms following the final pitch is noticeably missing, which is also disappointing. It seems to be this way with most of the memorable moments -- they are lightly touched on, but the documentary falls short of showing the key highlight.

Overall a fair collection and a reasonable introduction to some of the legends of the game.  The treatment is light and it lacks the excitement and color of the game, but those looking for a touch of nostalgia and some vintage footage may find it interesting.",1224374400,12,1612,4.770609318996415
8167126,3,B000M8NMVO,"While I agree that the narrator and soundtrack are not very good, I think this is a decent set.  The sound bites with current and retired MLB players are sometimes insightful (and other times boring, I'll admit), and the archival footage and photos make the series visually pleasing.  The text of the narration is not bad at all, but much of the info is basic--a hard-core baseball fan will enjoy the set OK, but will probably not learn anything new.  This would be a great set for a young fan.  I don't think it is fair to compare this production with the Burns series--they are different animals.  The Burns series is a tour de force...one of the best documentaries of all time.  This is just a fun little celebration of the game.",1201046400,6,732,4.507575757575758
