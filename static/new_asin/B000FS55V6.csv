The guy in charge, Joey, seems cool and so it didnt' feel lame to follow along like on a lot of other vids I've seen. I've lost 22 pounds so far thanks to diet and doing this workout and I highly recommend it. :)",1183420800,2,310,3.859375
8125956,1,B000FS55V6,"I'm usually not one to write reviews, but I felt the need to share my opinion on this DVD since I have a whole library of workout videos. This one was painfully boring! There are two particular dance moves that you can default to if you get lost, and they are also used to link the separate dance sequences together. The problem is, you spend 2/3 of the workout doing only those two moves (which aren't very cardio-intensive anyway). You learn one new step, you go back to the defaults. You learn another step, you go back to the defaults. Then you link them together -- using defaults. I wish I could get my money back on this one. I was really disappointed. Try the Madonna Grimes dance videos if you want some more entertaining instruction.",1176768000,2,743,4.470588235294118
8125957,5,B000FS55V6,"I'm not a dancer by nature . . . as in rhythmically challenged and clumsy as all get out.  I tried the dvd as a recommendation by a friend, and was happily surprised that I could follow along.  Not only was I able to lose quite a few pounds doing the exercises and dance steps, but I've gained more confidence on the dancefloor.  Joey's World Dance Groove dvd is ideal for those that are looking for a fun and productive way to get in shape and stay in shape.",1158796800,3,459,4.134831460674158
8125958,4,B000FS55V6,"In my busy lifestyle, I don't always have hours to dedicate towards exercise.  What I like about Joey's World Dance Groove: Cardio Dance and Exotic Tone and Stretch is that I can get a total body workout in a timely fashion that is engaging, motivating and challenging.

I especially enjoy the exotic tone and stretch, which has helped increase my balance, core muscle strength, grace in movement and overall mind/body connection.",1151107200,2,430,5.042253521126761
8125959,5,B000FS55V6,"A long-time friend suggested I check out this workout.  She and I both had danced professionally (jazz, modern, ballet) for many years.  Now, we're trying to stay in shape and have fun, but still want a challenging workout!  I took her recommendation, and wasn't disappointed.  Far from it!  I'm hooked!  Never having studied this style of dance and movement, I found Joey's teaching style very upbeat, positive, and engaging.  Steps were broken-down, such that I could readily follow-along and mirror his movements.  This is a great combination of aerobics, stretch, strength, and movement that carries you along on a exuberant ""ride"", accompanied by engaging music (that will have you smiling and dancing-along to the beat in your dreams)!",1151020800,4,741,5.220338983050848
8125960,5,B000FS55V6,I'm not a dancer but I was looking for a different kind of workout that was fun and motivating...Joey's World Dance Groove is the one!  Fast-paced and easy to follow dance steps are broken down so that even an uncoordinated would-be dancer like me could learn them!  Joey Dowdy has a winning smile and engages the exerciser without being overbearing.  He includes toning and stretching to make for a fun and complete workout - highly recommended!,1150761600,3,446,4.842105263157895
