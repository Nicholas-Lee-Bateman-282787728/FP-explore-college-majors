8578672,5,B00C888NIS,They really are so awesome. All of their DVDs are good. The performances are always top-notch. Having the English subs is a huge help. Frankly I don't understand why all of their DVDs aren't subtitled. With their huge international fan base it would just make sense to put subs on every disc.,1424304000,,292,4.634615384615385
8578673,5,B00C888NIS,"I bought this DVD before I had a chance to see them in concert, I was lucky enough to finally got a chance to see them in concert. If you can't see CNBLUE live in concert, then you should definitely buy this DVD. When you watched it at home you will feel like you are actually at their concert because you will start dancing and singing along just like you would if you were at their concert. All CNBLUE most popular songs are on this DVD, like I'm a loner, LOVE girl, Intuition, Love, Have a good night, Wake up, Y Why, Just please, In my head, Get away, Hey you, You've fallen for me, and many others. There are English subtitle if you don't understand Korean, the quality, and the sound is excellent. The 2nd DVD have the encore songs and backstage footage, I really enjoy the backstage footage showing the band rehearsing their songs for the concert. The concert was very entertaining and fun, so I highly recommend this DVD to all the BOICE (CNBLUE fans) and Korean music lover out there. If you want to see more CNBLUE live in concert, Amazon also carry Blue moon, Come on tour, and Blue storm live in concert DVD.",1391212800,,1120,4.363636363636363

I put this dvd in when it's time for me to walk on the treadmill and before I know it I've walked through the whole ""concert""!",1384473600,,266,4.037735849056604
