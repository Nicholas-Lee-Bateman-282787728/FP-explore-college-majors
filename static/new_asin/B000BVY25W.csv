8093385,1,B000BVY25W,"I successfully hunted down a copy of this video, and found that it left a lot to be desired. First off, production value is good. They obviously hired a good film crew.

However, the video itself, which I believe was 15 minutes once you got past the beginning credits and if you didn't count the advertising for another ""how to"" vid at the end, didn't seem to have a clear audience. Was this to give the general public a look behind the scenes? Or for the absolute beginner who doesn't know how to calculate aperture and shutter speed? Was it to show off expensive specialty equipment to pros?

Basic, common sense advice was presented such as make sure the car is clean, have back up equipment, and know how to use your stuff. (I would hope that this would be a given)

The photographer showed that he used a large overhead softbox with a lot of powerpacks and what f stop he used. No reason why was given. Not a lot of in-depth information. Didn't even talk about panning your shots, or why lights are set up the way they are, and what I was hoping for the most-- on the back of the DVD case there is a picture of him hanging out of a helicopter shooting down on a car on the track-- wasn't in the video at all. What's up with that?

I don't know, I shoot cars and motorcycles for a living and was hoping for a good tip or new perspective. I could tell a newbie a lot more in 15 minutes than the video presented. If you're really into shooting cars, don't bother with this video-- you'll learn more elsewhere. I recommend James Mann's book ""How to Photograph Cars"" and studying photographer's work that you admire.",1197244800,2,1616,4.341059602649007
