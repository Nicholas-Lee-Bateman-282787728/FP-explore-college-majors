8267192,5,B0017T3PX2,"The two disc set is light on extras and the included mainly black and white pamphlet is only 20 pages which is smaller than some of the other Bandai Visual releases.  I would normally be a bit hesitant on buying the import without subtitles, but considering that Macross is tied up in licensing and the price down rerelease is a bit cheaper than the original standard DVD release makes this something worth adding to the Macross collection.",1471996800,,440,4.714285714285714
8267193,5,B0017T3PX2,Macross Zero on Blu-Ray is totally awesome!  If you already know the story and watched the fansubs then you'll enjoy watching this in 1080p quality.  I found it in Japan this summer and am happy to say it RULES!  This will probably never be in America so get the Japanese OFFICIAL copy and enjoy it.,1378598400,6,299,4.4
