We are able to witness the build up of the war: The President is told about the increase of Iraqi forces near the Kuwaiti border, and how the American officials responded.

Among the continuing news reports are:

The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the American soldier's departure and brief interviews with their family members, Saddam's Western hostages, forced statements from tortured pilots, famous film clippings from the first air raids over Iraq and much more.

My opinion is that this film gives a good overview over what that happened, but it is too superficial if you want a more in-depth view of what happened and why.",1119398400,,833,4.608108108108108
