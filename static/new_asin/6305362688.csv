It's so simple in structure and so deep that not so many people could understand the greatness of Abbas Kiarostami's form of  expression. For me, it is the best movie of the decade. It talks about the  essencial things in life and the way films should be. He states a new form  of Cinema thats so deep in content as any Tarkovsky's film. It's simply  Cimematic Poetry.",926294400,3,470,4.367816091954023
1011633,5,6305362688,"I have been following the Iranian film movement with great interest.  Unlike most films this one has no real beginning or end.  It is like the viewer is drawn into the protagonists life for a brief day and then the  viewer leaves before the climax ends.  When I saw it, the ending was  superb, because audiences tend to want all the ends tied before a movie  ends, but this movie didn't do that.  It chose to leave and let the  imaganition take over.  And that is what I loved about this film.  That is  what I love about Iranian films, because they take simple ideas and  document them with pictures, with great writing, and slow pace.  Most  people do not get it, but the ones who do, appreciate the effort the  filmmakers put in making these simple buy joyful films.

I suppose that it was so  different to the average Hollywood ""shootemup"" that some critics  thought it original. So original that the director obviously felt that  minor factors like character development, a story and an ending were not  really necessary. To be fair the camerawork is original and the film has a  neo-realistic feel, so, if you want an alternative to the latest offering  from Cameron and do not mind sitting through the long pauses, separated by  long pauses, you could try this film.",919900800,8,772,5.0236220472440944
1011665,4,6305362688,"I have a favorable opinion of this movie, though it was tough to watch, and I probably will never watch it again.

Most of this movie consists of close-up shots of a guy driving around a quarry near Tehran trying to find somebody who will help him kill himself.

There are so many touches of this movie that reveal the hand of a master.  It's almost like watching that LandRover drive interminably around that dusty quarry for an hour and a half will have you mulling over suicide yourself!  And the fact that the man's reasons are never offered was brilliant, brilliant.

Yes, the premise is brilliant, but I think it worked a lot better as a script idea than a finished product.  It is still more than watchable, however.

In other news:

1.  This movie has got to feature the most unexpected, mind-bending ending I've ever seen in a film!  The second you see it, you'll bound off to the internet to ascertain if there is a physical problem with your DVD.

2.  Whoever did the subtitles:  good job.  They're literate, and the translations are spot-on.  Seems like this isn't very common with Iranian films that make it to the West.",1245974400,3,1133,4.53960396039604

1011667,4,6305362688,"There is the old, and often neglected, nostrum about `gilding the lily.' I was reminded of this watching Abbas Kiarostami's acclaimed 1997 film Taste Of Cherry (Ta'm E Guilass), co-winner of the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, for while it comes close to being a great film for the bulk of its running time of 99 minutes (not the oft-claimed 95 minutes), its much discussed ending, of breaking the fourth wall (ala Ingmar Bergman, circa the 1960s) to reveal what has just been witnessed is all a film, is one of the worst endings for a film of quality I've seen; perhaps even worse than the tacked on uplifting ending to Akira Kurosawa's otherwise stellar Rashomon. The basic problem with the ending is that, unlike in Bergman's run of self-conscious films (Persona, Hour Of The Wolf, Shame), the big `revelation' that the film is a film comes after we've sat through it; assuming that even such a fourth wall braking could surprise one in these times. Even worse is that it undermines the penultimate scene, which is a better- if not great ending, but one which would arguably qualify Taste Of Cherry as a great film overall. And it is an all Kiarostami film, good or bad, as he produced, wrote, and edited, as well as directed it.
  Critics, pro and con, have prattled on about Kiarostami's meaning or intent, in regard to the videotaped, not filmed, ending of verdant hills (contrasting with the rest of the film's ruddy barren rock landscapes), but always seem to miss the result, which is that it emotionally deflates the whole story. They claim things such as Kiarostami's abnegation of preachiness, a disdain for tearjerking, some psychological reason why the reveal of the film's fictive nature, at its end, is profound, or his desire to make indeterminacy the film's major motif. Yet, before the ending of the film, it is not preachy, jerks no tears, is clearly fictive, and the penultimate scene spells out indeterminacy far more powerfully and cogently than the ending does. When confronted by such realities as this it is always amusing to watch fans of an artist alibi for failure when the simplest answer is simply failure- that Kiarostami did not believe enough in his film to let it end at its best point. And what the filmmaker desired to achieve, if any aside from himself could divine such a thing, is immaterial to the viewer.
  Taste Of Cherry has moments of rapturous almost pure cinema, where the visuals alone can sustain the film and indeed do last longer than the lesser parts of the film, but, ultimately, that quality and its often clever script, are undone by the ending. It does not ruin the film, in terms of making it a bad film, but it does keep it from the elusive goal of greatness, for it plays out as an attempt at innovation when, in reality, it was already decades pass (as well as being inappropriate to end the film). Kiarostami's film views the human from a telescopic and microscopic position, and which is the more revealing is debatable. That such an innovative approach is substantially ruined by the poor ending is a shame, even if as human as the dilemma it traces.",1221696000,4,3121,4.710622710622711
1011668,5,6305362688,"This was my introduction to Iranian cinema, and it's a fine introduction.  This film is one of Abbas Kiarostami's best films, and the first film from Iran to win the Palme d'Or at Cannes.  It's a hypnotic, fascinating, and intelligent film, which deals with many complex issues.  The film concerns itself with a man driving around Tehran looking for somebody either to kill him or rescue him.  It's really striking the way Kiarostami films things, as there is much driving, many long takes (which are all beautifully filmed), and sometimes Kiarostami lets his camera linger on one of the characters of the shot while never showing the other character.  There is a long conversation at a construction site with the watchman of the site, and during a 2 1/2 minute unbroken take, you only see the main character while listening to the other character.  These directorial decisions never feel forced, but very natural and beautiful.  The cinematography (and terrain) around Tehran is visually stunning, and the performances are top notch here.  The film is also very ambiguous, and never really provides a solid conclusion.  This is one of Kiarostami's finest achievements (even though I like The Wind Will Carry Us more than this film), and it's a great introduction to the poetic, deeply artistic Iranian cinema.",1220400000,2,1310,5.027777777777778
1011669,4,6305362688,"A Taste of Cherry (Abbas Kiarostami, 1997)

Given everything I've read about Abbas Kiarostami's methods of filmmaking, I had come to the (obviously, in hindsight) erroneous conclusion that A Taste of Cherry was going to put me in mind of Bela Tarr or the French New Wave; that is certainly not the case. If any of you who obsessively read film criticism have been staying away from Kiarostami because it sounds, when people talk about his stuff, like it's not really about anything, let me lay that specter to rest right now. A Taste of Cherry is most definitely about something.

Mr. Badii (Homayoun Ershadi) is the central character, and for the first twenty minutes or so of the movie, we follow him around while he tries to get someone to do something for him. We don't know what, and the dialogue cleverly conceals it-- is Badii a homosexual looking for a tryst? (Given the ubiquity of this interpretation, I'm assuming that was Kiarostami's intention.) Eventually, however, we find out (and this isn't a spoiler, as it's in the box copy) Mr. Badii wants to kill himself, and he's looking for someone to come make sure he's done the job properly the next morning. We keep following him, but now the film has taken on an entirely new quality, given that we know what he's after; the other ends of the conversations suddenly make a great deal more sense.

I'm not familiar enough with Iranian culture to grasp the cultural allegories I'm sure run through this movie, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying the story for the story's sake. Essentially, it's a feature-length discussion about the value of life, and whether one man's valuation of life is as valid as any other man's. Kiarostami pulls it off because Ershadi is completely believable in his role, and so is everyone with whom he comes in contact (I often felt the minor characters weren't actors at all, and that Ershadi had simply driven up to them and started talking in order to get reactions). There is, as you can probably tell from the synopsis, not a great deal of action to be found here, but the story is just as gripping as any action movie I've seen in recent years. A very, very good film, well worth watching. ****",1216339200,,2192,4.644329896907217
1011670,5,6305362688,"Kiarostami's obliquely moral tale about a seemingly average man who, for some unknown reason, wishes to end his life- plays out a huge taboo in Muslim society. Using a unique mix of long exterior shots showing Badii's car snaking through the hills, trolling for a passenger who will assist him, and more intimate point-of-view shots from within the vehicle, Kiarostami's film subtly coaxes us to consider the divide between inner life and the outer world of societal constraints. ""Cherry"" is also a strong meditation on the meaning of life, enhanced by the appearance of a Turkish taxidermist (Bagheri) who, fighting his own self-interest, challenges Badii to reconsider. An enigmatic yet cumulatively powerful film from Iran's preeminent director.",1184112000,,748,5.401709401709402
1011671,5,6305362688,"I'm afraid this is one of those films that you just have to see. No attempt at paraphrase or rhetoric can add to what's already there on the screen. You might want to talk about the technical features, the lack of music, the point of view shots in the car, the beautifully desolate views of the hills around Tehran,the ambiguity of the ending - it's all just noise in my opinion. This film (like any other of true quality) is not what people say about it. It's to be experienced. You have a feeling of being taken somewhere else for 95 minutes, even though the realist feel should rightfully keep you grounded - somehow it has an element which uplifts you. I was extremely happy and alive for the rest of the day after seeing this - perhaps surprising considering the subject matter. I don't know anything about Mr Kiarostami (aside from his reputation) or the actors involved, but I am so glad I watched this film and look forward eagerly to see another of his.",1176854400,4,962,4.471590909090909
1011672,5,6305362688,"When I first saw this movie I couldn't quite put my finger on it. I was obviously touched by this movie and at the same time I agreed with the critics that it was a bit slow. But I couldn't help think about it more and more as days went by. Then I saw a brief interview of Abbas Kiarostami. At one point he mentioned the kind movies he wanted to make and those he didn't. He didn't want to make movies that would hold the audience hostage with high suspense and after the show when the adrenaline drops down the audience would feel cheated. What he wants to make is ""boring"" movies and he mentioned that he actually felt asleep in some movies he considered to be great. There's no need for pulse rates to go high, the greatest achievemnt of a filmamaker comes when the audeince thinks about the movie for at times length after they get out of the cinema hall. When they can't shake off the feeling of seeing the movie and that feeling lingers on for a long long time.

  And for sure, he was absolutely right. I couldn't shake off this movie. It actually hit me slowly, literally. This is a great movie. It has served its purpose. Why Mr Badi want to kil himself is totally irrevelant, that's not the point. We see a desperate man who has lost all will to live. It's as simple as that.  All the characters in this movie feels real, too real..like watching my neighbours and friends go about their business. The movie is slow albeit one point. When Badi snaps a picture of a couple, he feels a sudden rush of doubt about what he is about to do. He says to the taxidermist to make sure he's still alive before putting the dirt on him. A stunning scene.

  I'm a great admirer of roger ebert but I've to disagree with him on this one. I think this is an important movie. Even though it won the the palm d'ore, it's not taken serioulsy all around and many past great movies have been misunderstood. I've an instinct that after some dozen odd years this movie will stand the test of time and be considered a remarkable achievement.",1139097600,10,2026,4.301837270341207
1011673,5,6305362688,"""taste of cherry"" is kiarostami's most complete work while-surprisingly-simultaneously being his most personal.i regard it as personal for reasons that to ME are obvious:homayoun ershadi(lead actor)looks a bit like kiarostami,he(in character) apparantely is of an intellectual atheism,his situation(driving around in his car for most of the time of the movie)can be depicted as a metaphor of either the director viewing through his camera or the spectator watching the movie and generally he is easy for the modern artist to identify with in terms of extreme lonliness.kiarostami wisely chooses to give no direct reason for his decision to attempt suicide.instead he focuses on his attempt to make human contact just before departure and from this premise forms the powerful drama of the film.kiarostami can be regarded as one of the most important figures of post-modern cinema:in use of new narrative devices,in this case the dialogues resemble comic book characters conversations where lines are written in  white clouds above the characters heads,on the other hand the movie is another take by the director on the subject of life as narrative.each passanger has a ""story"" to tell,and in the end its about which story will us and Badi'ee(Ershadi) swallow.also its compatible with the post-modern notion of the re-invention of the ""text"" in the readers conception due to its ""open"" ending,we can't tell whether Badi'ee commit's suicide or not because neither for us and nor for him that is not the point anymore,we have taken part in hearing differrent stories and and experienced different approaches towards existance.kiarostami reminds us that narrating life IS itself LIFE,just like cheherezad keeps on telling stories to remain alive in the thousand and one nights.taste of cherry is the most sympathetic and lyrical attempt of contemporary cinema in illustrating the urban mans loveless-ness.a word about the DVD:though i'm grateful to the creators of Criterion and not  only  because of this movie,i hope there will be some improvement in the extras of iranian movies in general.the interview with kiarostami is to old for this movie and due to the importance of this film in kiarostami""s canon, a fresh and extensive interview with the man is necessary,plus reviews by kiarostami-liking critics and praises of international fellow directors.",1128211200,10,2351,5.418032786885246
1011674,5,6305362688,"I'd say the message of the movie is pretty straighforward. Mr. Badii  doesn't want to live anymore and he is asking people to bury his body after he commits suicide. Most people don't want to make a deal and finally one guy accepts it. The people reaction ranges from being scared to trying to change Mr. Badii's mind and convince him to stay alive.

Obviously, the author was not the first one who brought up these questions. So the content is not a big surprise. But the form! It's  really something interesting.

First off, there are not too many Iranian movies around. Second, it's a very different culture. Third, it's a nice slow movie with plenty of time to think. There are a lot small tricks. E.g. the most of the film is really slow moving and you get used to that rythm. And all the sudden the final few events just fly by. I don't speak farsi but it's interesting to look at the faces when the characters are talking about the life and death questions. Sometimes it's not what you'd expect to see.

So watching this movie is something similar to visiting a museum. Relax, watch and think. Pay attention to the details. Try to understand a different culture. It worths a try.",1110758400,4,1186,4.497674418604651
1011725,5,6305362688,"Khayym was a few centuries before Nietzsche and Sartre in his questioning and denial of religion and god. It should also be no surprise that he was the contemporary of Khawrazmi, the Persian mathematician who has given the world the idea of zero, or NOTHING.

The abstraction of nothingness as dust is prevalent in Khayym's work. So it is in this presentation. The alienation of modern man from nature too ties Kiarostami and Khayym in an inverse manner, where Khayam saw all nature as nothing, except for the short flash of life, Kiarostami presents nature as a flash in a lifetime, of course along a long and winding road, where a single taste of cherries is equivalent to taking in the whole universe and attaining the freedom to evaluate life on YOUR own terms. If you choose to forgo cherries and mulberries to spare the ones you wish to live better, it is true shining of life.

The ""naturalist"" who tries to convince our hero, who is as bitter as any ""Omar"", that the taste of cherries is sufficient to give meaning to everything and make up for all angst, survives by stuffing birds. Are these not the same 900 year old birds who in Khayym's poetry ask the question of being and nothingness from atop ruins of bygone kings?

There is not enough room here to get into the cinematography and camera work in this movie. Obviously Kiarostami has watched a lot of Kurosawa too. None the less,

the final scene of the movie is simply beyond expectation. In the age of cold ""media"", the use of hand held video makes reality into a story, no matter how elating or how painful it might have been, it cools it to a story to be reviewed. Kiarostami uses this device to review a whole life before it is extinguished.

There must be an equivalent to ""reviewing one's life"" in Khayym's work which I have not discovered, at least not succinctly yet. Kiarostami may know it but doesn't, or can't tell us. But, so it was Khayym's problem.",1094342400,15,1929,4.547550432276657

It's that it's slow and doesn't deliver much to deserve the concentration required.  There's just not much here to justify the running time.  The improvised conversations are only moderately interesting (and that's assuming you survive the first major one, with the soldier, which is virtually content-free).  The characters are close to being ciphers; I could live with not knowing why Mr. Badii's doing what he's doing, but he hardly says anything personal about anything (""I enjoyed my time in the army"" is about as deep as we get).  The shots of roads are not much more artful than random shooting out of a car window with a video camera (at least Antonioni's or Tarkovsky's films are exquisite even when maddeningly empty).  The message is basically the same as the one in American Beauty (life is wonderful because of some quotidian detail of day to day existence).  This is a fairly large bag to hold such a small thought, and it's got a lot of room to bounce around in undisturbed by any others.
Compare to another recent Criterion release, Dreyer's Day of Wrath, and you'll see the difference between a filmmaker at peak intensity during every second of a slowly-paced film, and one merely mistaking tedium for significance.",1012521600,9,1455,4.894308943089431
1011732,4,6305362688,"As I read through the viewer comments on this film, it's clearly evident that they're are two sides the public has taken. Some say it's a slow, pretenious, boring film while others dare call it a masterpiece. A beautifully constructed film that was done with compassion and care. No doubt you can tell which group I belong to by the amount of stars I've given the film. But, that doesn't mean I am unable to see both sides of the film myself. As I first started watching this film, I too, became not bored, but, disillusioned with it. I was expecting something completely different, and was not prepared to see a movie which mostly takes place in the main character's van. Now, this does not mean I did not appreciate the obvious craft inwhich this film had been done with. I thought the cinematography was wonderful, the acting by Homayon Ershadi who plays Mr. Badi was enjoyable to watch, and the film was directed with style by Abbas Kiarostami.
 Some might be tempted to say this is Kiarostami's version of Ingmar Bergman's ""The Seventh Seal"", while that's not entirely true, I can understand why one would say that. Both films try to come to some conclusion as to the meaning of life. What is life all about? How does one find happiness? I admit I like Bergman's film better, but, ""Taste of Cherry"" in its own way is just as compelling and spellbinding. It has a more subtle tone to it then ""The Seventh Seal"". There are moments where the film does have a tendency to lag a bit, but, when the film starts to take shape, it's one powerful film.
 The story-line of ""Taste of Cherry"" as many if not everyone knows is about a man, Mr. Badii, who wants to committ suicide. His only problem is he cann't find anyone to bury him. This leads him on his own journey to find someone to do this deed. After searching and searching for someone, he finds Mr. Bagheri (Abdolrahman Bagheri). Its when these two meet that ""Taste of Cherry"" comes full circle. Now, there will be those who say, well, can you really say a movie is good if it only has 20 minutes or so that work? If they managed to swell up the feeling that those 20 minutes do, then yes! But, I do also feel that there is more than just 20 minutes or so of this film that works.

He meets a succession of individuals and discusses his plans with them. Each man provides his own thoughts on the subject, all ultimately refusing to go along with the plan. The story is a bit difficult and pointless to describe. The bleakness of the subject matter is best described by the film itself.

This is the starting point of this rare movie gem, a masterpiece of auteur cinema and a profound reflection on the Human nature. As a moviemaker, Abbas Kiarostami is well regarded in Europe as one of the great directors from the asian continent, together with the great japanese directors and the indian Satyajit Ray. The Palme D'Or that he received in the Cannes Film Festival is a proof of the profound recongnizement that the europeans have for him. It looks like that in the USA, the first contact with this outstanding moviemaker is becoming rather frutuous,demonstrating that auteur cinema is appreciated everywhere.  Without a great budget, Kiarostami managed to create a work that emerges directly from the depths of our soul, placing the problem of suicide before different persons of different religions and cultural roots. The rather harsh atmosphere of the movie, together with the magnificent performance of Homayon Ershadi, the main actor, make this a memmorable work, a piece of fine tapestry in the world of modern filmaking. I can only find simmilarities with Kiarostami, in the works of greek directos Theo Angelopoulos, specialy in his masterpiece ""Eternity and a day"", both directors that create portrayals of the human soul, their specificities, conflicts and problems.",977443200,13,1401,5.171806167400881

1011774,5,6305362688,"This movie is one of my favorites. On an abstract level, it is just the kind of movie that appeals to me. It raises complex philosophical and psychological questions. The overall tone encourages one to ponder these  questions and the movie encourages reflection and introspection. The depth  of those conflicts can not be adequately understood on a first viewing  alone: each time I watch it I am able to reach a little deeper into them.
The cinematography focuses on simplicity. Most of the movie is shot from  the inside of a Land Rover while the main character drives aimlessly or  talks with one of the passengers he picks up. There is no lack of  imagination, though. The idea is to create a kind of stark reality, without  grandeur. The effect is to bring one man's life and his character to the  forefront and to keep it there: we feel a distinct connection with this man  as a result of the simple method of movie-making. The acting, I think, is  amazing. Ershadi imparts astounding depth into his character - there is no  bombast or superficiality present: he is totally immersed in his character.  The viewer develops a deep connection with this character despite his quiet  and unexcitable personality. The main character is often criticized as  coming across as bland, but I think that there very subtle (yet intense)  emotion there.
The video and sound are excellent. The Criterion  Collection can always be counted on to produce high quality DVD's and this  one is no exception.

1011775,4,6305362688,"If you're going to make a film which largely consists of a man driving his Range Rover along dusty Iranian roads, soliciting various men for their assistance, you'd sure better make an engaging film. For the  philosophically inclined, Abbas Kiarostami has done just that.
Though  most of the film takes place on a few dirt roads over-looking Tehran, you  could still see it as a road movie, albeit a sophisticated, intellectually  engaging one.
Homayon Ershadi plays Badii, the driver of the Range Rover,  as a strong yet depleted man, a man with resignation etched into his face  in every frame. Mr. Badii is trying to find someone to help him with his  suicide. The job is simple: come to cover his body if he's successful;  rescue him if he is not. He's willing to give a tremendous amount of money  for only a little work. Each man he picks up reacts to his offer in a  different way--each of them conveys the belief that Badii's taking his own  life would be wrong, but each of them gives different a reason for his  inability to help. The only man willing to help Badii is another who once  attempted suicide.  Even he tries to convince him to remain, to remember  the taste of cherry.
The end of the movie has been misunderstood by some  reviewers; it's not a trick, the movie is not a sham. The ending simply  provides a jolting coda, reminding us that no matter how barren life may  seem, there is a reality uncolored by emotion and mental disease, and in  that reality there are others leading joyful lives.
Not only has  Kiarostami given us food for thought, he reveals gritty, dusty Tehran to be  a city of haunting golden beauty.  Another filmaker would have taken us to  Eden to prove his point, but Kiarostami shows us there is beauty wherever  you are, even in a land seemingly drained of color and steeped in binding  tradition.",950400000,50,1845,4.568807339449541

7887942,3,6305362688,"In Abbas Kiarostami's 1997 film Ta'm-e gilas (Taste of Cherry) one Mr. Badi, a man about whom viewers learn virtually nothing, drives around Tehran looking for someone to do him a favour: that night, he will kill himself in a quarry outside the city, and he wants someone to cast dirt over his body the next morning.

The first half of the film is essentially about Mr. Badi's difficulties finding someone to carry out this small task, in spite of the substantial amount of money he's offering. He is initially mistaken as a homosexual cruising for sex, a misunderstanding that Kiarostami even ribaldly encourages through suggestive dialogue. A seminary student refuses to help him because suicide is a sin. I must say that I was very disappointed by these 40 minutes plus. Shooting so much of the film inside the car as Mr. Badi drives around is a waste of the possibilities of cinema. Furthermore, there is no real rapport between Mr. Badi and the various actors, as it was originally Kiarostami sitting in the passenger seat, and the dialogue of the men Mr. Badi picks up was only dubbed in later. The film does largely rely on amateur actors, as is common in Iranian productions from this era. Mr. Badi is played by the architect Homayoun Ershadi, and though Ershadi eventually established a film career, this was his first role.

The film does become stronger in the second half, when Kiarostami starts to move from the dusty and barren quarry to more lively scenery of inhabited Tehran, a clear metaphor for the joy and colour of life that Mr. Badi would be giving up if he went through with his plans. The film starts to be thoughtprovoking instead of merely awkward, and as a glance at discussion forums will show, the film does offer enough to keep cinephiles talking about it. Unfortunately, the ending that Kiarostami chose for the film (which I won't spoil here) feels to me like a cop-out, not to mention something that is already an old auteur trope by now.

If you like the Iranian Second Wave, then you'll probably find it worthwhile to see Ta'm-e gilas at least once. However, in spite of its winning of the Palme d'Or, I do not feel this is an especially great film. It's also worth mentioning that this Criterion DVD release has no extras except an interview with Kiarostami.",1424649600,,2294,4.701492537313433
7887943,5,6305362688,"It happened that I had already seen Ten, made by Kiarostami in 2002, and I was struck by the resemblance of approach in the two movies. As I was now watching Taste of Cherry, dialogues from Ten were coming to my mind. In both movies a driver is running the car through the streets of Tehran (or on shabby routes around Tehran) and approaches various people. The reactions of those people are similar in both movies. It is like the driver is the only character played by a professional, all others are just common people who seem totally unaware that they are filmed.

There is a subject here in Taste of Cherry (I would rather not deconspire it, to not frustrate you of the pleasure of discovery), only I believe the subject is more like a pretext, for studying the reactions of those common people.

I believe that Kiarostami is actually interested in the reaction of common people confronted with the convention of the movie. There is a subject, yes: it is a convention proposed by the creator of the movie, like any filmic subject. It is not the reality, it is a convention, that presents itself as reality. However, it is a convention, not reality. How are common people reacting to this convention? Are they considering it as normal, as belonging to their universe?

Or, can these common people become part of the artistic universe? They belong to our, real, world. The main character (the driver) provokes them. They can enter the illusory world of the movie; they can refuse the illusion.

Anyway, either they accept the convention, or they refuse, it is a moment of contact between two worlds: the real world, the illusory world of the movie (pretending to be the real world itself). What is the relation between the two worlds? What is the relation between object and image? A question that has tortured so many artists in the twentieth century, and I believe this is also the question that Kiarostami is trying to find the answer.

The ending of the movie can be read in various ways. I believe that the sense of it is, hey, guys, a movie is just a movie, it is convention claiming to be reality, but it remains convention.

I know, of course, that I could be wrong :) I also believe that Ten developed Taste of Cherry in a more radical way.",1421193600,2,2251,4.573200992555831

Certainly this road movie is far to pretend to establish a cruel depiction about this desperate and fully convinced Muslim that life is not worth to be lived.

7887945,5,6305362688,"A middle-aged and middle class man drives through the streets of Tehran, searching for someone who might assist him.  He turns away the eager men who crowd his window, in hopes of being hired for day labor.  It's not clear what he wants, and not clear he knows exactly what he's looking for, and when he finally picks up a young man in a military uniform, the young man's growing apprehension mirrors our own.  What kind of job demands such secrecy?  Of course, if you've read the back of the dvd case, you know what he wants is for someone to assist him with suicide.  More precisely, he wants someone to come and bury him when the job has been done.  A paradox of the film is that in order to die alone, to leave behind no trace, this man requires an assistant.  He cannot end his life alone.  What is intriguing about the opening scene is that it sets up the uneasy soldier as a kind of surrogate for the audience, who will witness and assess this man's decision to end his life.  It raises questions for us, not only about the significance of life and what considerations might lead one to end it, but also about what it means to be a witness, what it means to observe a man's life, questions that will be intensified as the story progresses.

The film is deceptively simple, following the man as he attempts to convince someone, but not just anyone, to perform this final act, to cover him with dirt when he is gone.  It turns out, upon reflection, to have been structured with a great deal of precision, with two major parts divided by a transition during which the man stops to observe the workings of a nearby gravel site.  The digging of the earth, the anonymous machines hauling gravel and soil, all serve as subtle reminders of the burial contemplated by the man.  There is a powerful moment, as the man looks over the edge of a pit where dirt falls, and it seems as though his shadow is shrouded by the soil and silt.  He sits as the mounting dust obscures him from view, and a man comes and calls to him, in a manner that anticipates what he asks his prospective helpers to do, to call his name and be sure he is dead before burying him.  The three men he solicits as assistants are at different stages in their lives, and may suggest different generations and walks of life in Iran - they also seem to represent three very different perspectives on the theme of the film, on the question whether and why life should be lived at all costs: the perspective of the youth and of the military establishment, where law is decisive; the perspective of religion from a cleric in training, where morality and faith are called upon, and judgment is passed; and the perspective of a wise and aging taxidermist, who does not judge but only asks that the man stop and consider whether there is anything he values and could live for.  In his case, when he had himself contemplated his own end, it had been ""the taste of cherries"" that awakened him to feel and care again.

The final scene is both enigmatic and rich, and recalls Kiarostami's deliberate tendency in films such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Close-Up/dp/B003D63G5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Close-Up</a>&nbsp;to withdraw from key moments and allow viewers to fill in the gaps, allowing the enigma to intensify the imaginative response.  The exuberant and upbeat ending, in contrast with the style and feel of the film to that point, also points back to the beginning, opening space for reflection on the cinematic techniques and themes of the film as a whole, and manages to introduce new concerns such as the nature of cinema, of realism and fiction.  I have seen this film many times and see more each time.  Rather than make it seem more complicated, it gets simpler, more direct, with each new insight.

The pace of the film starts slow and continues on like that  to the end.  It was the endless driving around in a car by the main character that compelled me to watch and understand what is this man trully looking for.  And then, it becomes obvious that he is exhausted from living; there is something in this man's life that has effected him so much that he is unable to go on.

In his quest to find someone to bury him, character comes across several men: young soldier, garbage collector, security guard and a young seminary man.  None of them are willing to help him out with his wishes in spite of the fact that they all need money.  It is the moral code of their faith and their personality to prevents them to participate in such act. Until finally a man comes along who is willing to complete the task.  However, he gives his best shot to change the mind of the unfortunate man by telling simple stories about what is it that makes life worth living.

I kept thinking `this film certainly isn't for everyone' and I tend to think that a lot when watching films I adore.  The fact remains that films that can be classified as `for everyone' are generally your generic Hollywood feel good films.  The reason those films that don't appeal to everyone are so great is that they appeal strongly to you.  They have that certain something that reaches a personal place inside you, moving you in ways that it may not (or will not) move someone else.

`Ta'm e Guilass' is that type of a film.

The film takes place on one day in one place, a car.  That car belongs to Mr. Badii, a wealthy middle aged man who is looking for someone to help him commit suicide.  It's a hard request because beliefs on suicide vary and some are strongly apposed.  He just wants someone who will bury him after he's committed the act, and he will even pay handsomely, but still, finding someone willing is a difficult task.

There may be minor spoilers below...

The film may be too slow or uneventful for many, but it is within the films quiet center that the action really exists.  We never know the reason for which Mr. Badii wants to die, but it doesn't matter.  We understand him so implicitly because of his undoubted pain and sorrow.  I think that leaving the end open so-to-speak (on all fronts) was a genius idea here because we are allowed to truly contemplate who this man was, bringing him to a person level of understanding and even begin to relate to him.

Wiether we have had similar thoughts of welcoming death or not, we have all felt a pain that at a time felt unbearable.

Homayoun Ershadi is sensational here.  His eyes pierce the soul and deliver more than any explanation or confession could have.  He conveys the very pit of this man through a silent acquisition of sorts.

It is no wonder to me that this won top honors at the Cannes film festival.  Abbas Kiarostami's tender and personal film is a provocative look at pain and sorrow, but also of hope.  As the film draws towards it's conclusion we are left wondering if Mr. Badii was as moved as we were by the pleading of his eventual `helper'.  His monologue about the mulberries is so passionate and effective that we are renewed in our convictions that life IS worth living.

But did Mr. Badii feel the same?",1269907200,2,2453,4.472972972972973

He stops to ask strangers about their financial state, surreptitiously interviewing them for the reprehensible job, but leaves without declaring his intentions. He offers a ride to a young soldier (Safar Ali Moradi) on his way back to the barracks. An overhead crane shot follows their vehicle weaving through the narrow, unpaved roads as he drives the soldier to a remote basin where he has dug his burial plot at the foot of a tree. He sees a filial bond with the soft-spoken young man, having himself served in the military, and Mr. Badii reveals his plan: the next day, he asks that the soldier call to him twice. If he responds, the soldier will save him (and literally help him out of the hole that he has dug for himself). If he does not answer, then the soldier will throw twenty spadefuls of earth into the hole and bury him. The young man is horrified by his plan, and runs away. Mr. Badii then begins to follow an earth-moving vehicle and ends up at a closed cement factory occupied by a security guard (Ahmad Ansari) and a seminarist (Hossein Noori) on holiday. He attempts to recruit the religious man by appealing to his compassion, but to no avail. Instead, the gentle seminarist offers him a receptive ear and teachings from the Koran. Disappointed, he leaves the factory and comes upon a construction site, stopping to rest. Note the juxtaposition of Mr. Badii's shadow against the pouring soil. Eventually, he offers a ride to a talkative old man named Mr. Bagheri (Abdolhossein Bagheri) who works at the museum of natural history. Coincidentally, years earlier, Mr. Bagheri had attempted to commit suicide, but was inspirited by the presence of mulberries under his feet. He disapproves of Mr. Badii's plan, but his son's illness compels him to accept the regrettable assignment.

Abbas Kiarostami creates a visually austere and serenely contemplative examination of life in A Taste of Cherry: the unchanging, barren scenery outside the car window; the desolate, winding roads leading to the burial plot; the suffocating dust of the construction site. The barren, almost monochromatic landscape serves as a metaphor for the isolation of the soul. In essence, A Taste of Cherry is not about a man's search for death, but his search for a reason for living. By rejecting the laborers (who are undoubtedly qualified to bury him) in favor of his passengers, he is seeking empathy and connection. In the end, a chromatic shift transforms the empty landscape into a lush countryside. Perhaps, Mr. Badii, like Mr. Bagheri before him, has changed his own perspective.",1262736000,3,2879,4.887525562372188
