8731565,4,B014Q67NIU,"Good movie.  Always like Brian Donleavy.  We all know the story so it is presented in typical great old movie fashion, no joking around, no gays or lesbians, no racial struggles, just good acting.",1521936000,,196,4.735294117647059
8731566,5,B014Q67NIU,"Sincere story of the atomic bomb, the acting is excellent. Profound and not lacking in impact, although much of the detail could not be told at that time because details were still classified. Patriotic but is not an attempt to sugar-coat anything. Well made.",1521417600,,259,4.909090909090909
8731567,5,B014Q67NIU,Fascinating picture of how The Bomb was viewed by Hollywood two years after it was dropped on Hiroshima. The significance of this historic war crime is not even remotely grasped by the scriptwriters or the director. I will watch this until I learn something useful from it.,1474761600,,273,4.829787234042553
8731568,5,B014Q67NIU,"This is the ""Cliff's Notes"" version of the development and ultimate use of the atomic bomb on Japan. Made in the late 40's, not to be confused with cold war movies of the late 50's and 60's, yet to come, or the 50's si-fi cheapo B movie titled ""The Beginning OF the End"". The reason for 5 stars is because I saw this movie maybe 50 years ago and as a kid, was quite impressed by the premise and have since, never again, seen the movie in as many years. When I found it here on Amazon, I ordered it immediately and completely enjoyed reliving my childhood wonderment. The sound and look of the transfer and more than acceptable. Thank you Amazon for the digging this old favorite up for others to enjoy again. Be advised, somber subject, not for youngsters.",1474156800,5,756,4.368794326241135
8731569,4,B014Q67NIU,A highly enjoyable drama/history covering the building and deployment of the atomic bomb at the close of World War II. This is a must for anyone with an interest in this effort which ended the war. Picture and sound are in very good shape.,1463875200,7,239,4.454545454545454
8731570,5,B014Q67NIU,This is an interesting movie.  It details the discovery and development of the atomic bomb.  At the beginning of the movie we see a bunch of men standing out in a forest as time capsule is loaded in a special vault.  We are told it contains a copy of the movie we are about to see.  The time capsule is not be opened in 500 years. Actors portray the real people who developed the Atomic Bomb.  A few fictional people take part in development of the bomb.  It was amazing o how many people and how much material were needed to develop the Bomb.  It is no blockbuster but it is interesting and historically important.,1461024000,4,615,4.2956521739130435

8731572,3,B014Q67NIU,"PLOT: the docudrama of the scientists and people who developed the atom bomb~

This starts with a overly done version of the scientific means to start a nuclear chain reaction. It drags the first 30 minutes for this reason. Hume Cronyn as Oppenheimer and Tom Drake are two of the ""Chicago"" arm of the scientists. Brian Donlevy is General Groves who soon has a plan for several development sights~ including the mining and nuclear sights~ soon scientists from the UK and Canada are added to the group busy working. Finally the TEST in the desert shows a viable bomb~ and the plane and crew actually bombing Hiroshima including some actual film from the bombing. This is a solid movie but it gets overly done with Tom Drake and his wife Beverly Tyler~ and becomes a soap opera at times. What keeps us watching is the actual story it took to make the 4 main sights for mining and development of the bomb. We see families displaced and people sacrificing to help ""win the war"" and the efforts they made. This is something not covered in many other movies. I give it 3 STARS~ the title the Beginning or the End was actually coined from President Truman. Interesting overly done look at the history of the first atom bombs.** for added fun watch the very ""staged""... TRAILER of overly dressed up actors trying to give 'unbiased' positive view of the screening of the movie is comical""*** what kid under 15 would not have been bored out of the their mind with this plot let alone movie? amusing~",1453593600,,1488,4.593984962406015
8731573,5,B014Q67NIU,"This tension-filled mystery is a representation of one way Hollywood dealt with the post-WWII view of nuclear attack. The history may not be accurate, but the film is fascinating, and finely made with exceptional performances. The film begins (even before Leo's roar) with MGM putting the film in a time capsule so that future generations could understand the development of the atomic bomb. You don't need to dig up the time capsule to see the movie thanks to this crisp DVD which looks 100 times better than the battered print used for TV.",1451174400,6,541,4.827956989247312
8731574,3,B014Q67NIU,The utter lack of historical veracity is astounding. The other hand is that it is good representation of the psyche of post-war America.,1449792000,,136,4.956521739130435
