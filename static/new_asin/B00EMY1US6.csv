5928115,5,B00EMY1US6,A funny romp with madcap British humor. Give it a chance.,1406937600,,57,4.2727272727272725

5928117,1,B00EMY1US6,"Not funny at all, pretty depressing. The funny scenes you see in the preview are mysteriously not present in the movie itself. I'd pass on this one, save yourself some money.",1405728000,,174,4.645161290322581
5928118,2,B00EMY1US6,"I don't like to make negative criticisms of people's creative efforts, so I'll just say I was only able to tolerate a few minutes of this movie.",1404259200,,144,4.37037037037037
5928119,4,B00EMY1US6,"Entertaining but not worthy of 5 stars I believe.  Filming style reminds me of ""Best of Show"" and ""Spinal Tap"".  Overall, it was a good film with a great cast (excluding the Russian choreographer who wasn't funny at all) and the story was understandable.  I like the ending although somewhat predicable, but that's not always a bad thing.",1404000000,,338,4.793103448275862

8606914,5,B00EMY1US6,"Okay, maybe you know how it's going to end.  However,  it's verrrry funny getting there, without the same old tired gimmicks in American rom-coms.  Hilarious and sweet movie. (Much better than 'Bridesmaids'!!)",1410566400,,209,5.46875
8606915,2,B00EMY1US6,This was too much like an home made video.  None of the character was particularly likable and it ran like a 'stream of consciousness' book.  Hard to follow.,1409097600,,157,4.571428571428571
