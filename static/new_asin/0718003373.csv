2850,5,0718003373,"I don't know why people like The gospel of John better.  I never had.  Matthew is so much better.  I saw an edited version of Matthew on tbn in '94 and thought it was great. and bought the 4 tape vhs in '96.  and got the dvd in 2000. Matthew portrayel of Jesus was unlike any portrayel I ever saw before.  from his tender compassion to jolly sense of humor to his serious side.  Bruce does a great job of acting.  A must see.

but when John came out in '03, it wasn't anything like Matthew.  I was highly disappointed.  He wasn't half as jolly as Bruce.  I guess I was expecting something like Matthew.",1223683200,3,602,4.147826086956521
2851,5,0718003373,"This approach to Matthews's Gospel was superbly done.  The original text is used unexpurgated, but with the entire story acted out in full colour.  Anyone thinking of starting to take an interest in the Bible would be very well advised to buy this DVD.  And if you are sufficiently enthralled, there is a similar one based on the book of Acts.",1184889600,,343,4.590163934426229
2852,5,0718003373,We are using this for our small group study and the visual interpretation along with the word for word translation make this an exceptional learning tool.,1182124800,,154,4.961538461538462
2853,4,0718003373,"Hi...My mother first got this when i was about 14. I was touched on how good this was done by the actors. I am now 20 years old and i am living on my own, and this is a MUST HAVE. Too bad it's sold out on here becuase i would have bought this on here. Bruce has touched my life in many ways, and so has this film. Watch this for yourself and you yourself may incounter that the word of god is the most powerful words written in the world. Thanks visual bible!

2854,5,0718003373,"I thorougly enjoyed the Book of Matthew not only because it followed the NIV transalation word for word but the portrayal of Jesus was superb!  I've never seen a more human example of Jesus Christ.  He was playful, full of joy, and compassionate.  This is a MUST SEE!  The Falling Fire movie was also good but more of a dramatic portrayal than a word for word account.",1110844800,6,368,4.447761194029851
2855,5,0718003373,"Outstanding Performance by Bruce Marchiano& Richard Kiley. Jesus is Incredibly Loving and kind. One is drawn to Him(Jesus) by His love and compassion. The healing scenes are very moving. I do believe that Jesus was just as Excited as those who were healed because He loved meeting the needs of people and showing His love. His non-verbal communication of Joy shouted His Love to People. His message is Love. How can we help but love Him and Give Him our all. Yes Bruce Marchiano captured the Love of Christ to us, manifest by ""The Joy of the Lord"". Richard Kiley is also marvelous in his role as narrator and Tax Collector Matthew. Outstanding Film ...It will touch your heart with the love and Joy of the Lord!",1105660800,11,711,4.606299212598425
2856,5,0718003373,"Having not seen the dvd before buying it (a friend recommended it) all I can say is WOW. An incredible portrayal of someone who would have attracted the crowds that the actual Jesus did. It was a pleasure to witness a Jesus that was not somber, depressing or scary as in so many other movies about Jesus. As a preacher of the Gospel, I will show this again and again to whomever will give me the time to do so. You can follow along in your bible as it gives the verse reference for every word in the bottom right of the screen. Five stars is not enough for this movie. I cant wait to receive the Acts dvd that I just ordered.",1086998400,19,625,4.0894308943089435
2857,5,0718003373,"The Matthew film has made a huge impact on my vision of the personality and character of Jesus.  This film is word for word to the NIV translation of the Gospel of Matthew, and shows the chapters and verses in the lower corner of the screen.  There are no added stories, characters, or words; but all of the emotions are expressed to their fullest which gives you a great understanding and meaning behind what is being said.  It identifies a very approachable and caring Jesus figure.  This film has inspired everyone I have shown it to (and I have shown it to many).  In my personal opinion, the character of Jesus that is portrayed in this film, matches the Gospel more than any other movie I have ever seen about Jesus.  This video has given me a great picture to go with the words written in the Bible and has helped me get a better understanding of what I am reading.  I highly recommend this and all the other films made by The Visual Bible; they really do an outstanding job of adding personality to the characters.  I am convinced that this is very close to the way it really happened (besides being white and speaking english of course;)  I hope this review helped!",1071446400,98,1174,4.4485981308411215
2858,5,0718003373,"Using the NIV text as the basis, these DVD's are a film recording of the gospel of Matthew.  All the dialog, narration, everything is directly from the Bible.
The wonder of these videos, however, is the fact that they are able to make you think.  While sticking so closely to the Bible and with well researched visuals, the producers, directors, and actors give their own interpretation of the story, which allows you to open your eyes to something new.  The best example of this is Bruce Marchiano's portrayal of Jesus.  Instead of the solemn, serious person you usually picture, here we see a person who enjoyed life, laughed, and had some fun in between dealing with the serious issues of life.  When I first watched these videos, it made me look at my preconceived ideas of God very differently.
While expensive, these DVD's are worth checking out for a different perspective on a familiar tale.",1064880000,51,899,4.774193548387097

Even in the scenes where Jesus called the Pharisees to task for their work-righteousness and failure to love, he does so with a pleading look.  Well done, Mr. Marciano!",1447804800,,278,4.872340425531915

7788193,5,0718003373,WOW!  to see Jesus in an entirely different paradigm blessed me so much.  Seeing Jesus laugh and bless people helped me get over the view I had of a Jesus that was stern.  I have used clips of this film in teaching discipleship in my church,1424217600,,240,4.173913043478261

7788195,5,0718003373,"In this movie Jesus comes across as a warm, caring, feeling human being. not the standard cold, unapproachable judgemental God that people have consistently portrayed Him to be. As for when it appears He is smiling talking about Hell to the scribes and Pharisees if you listen , he is crying, He's getting choked up, He is hurt and He is sad, He may appear to others to be smiling ( no I don't see it ) I assure you He is not. This is the only movie I've seen that shows Jesus as one who laughed,  cried, got angry and broken hearted over all of his people, the kind of person who you would want to follow  because he wants to lift you up,not grind you down! I have bought this movie several times now for my family and friends to show them that Jesus really is our friend and Savior!",1372118400,,784,4.151315789473684
7788196,5,0718003373,"Very happy with this video. The story of Jesus as told by Mathew a gospel writer to his grand daughter made the Gospel of Mathew come alive.  The video was in  great condition  as described and delivery was very
quick. Packaging was good.  A trusted seller.",1337299200,,257,4.521739130434782
7788197,2,0718003373,"Jesus smiles after just about everything he says - even when talking about hell and when rebuking the Pharisees! It seem the producers of this movie were uncomfortable with a Jesus who often made rather harsh statements. Instead of acting in concert with the text, the actor playing Jesus seeks to uphold an extra-biblical perception of Jesus that looks nothing like what a natural reading of Matthew would suggest.",1334880000,3,415,5.028985507246377
