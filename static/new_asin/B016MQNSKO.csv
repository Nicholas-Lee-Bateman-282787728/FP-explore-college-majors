8736784,4,B016MQNSKO,"These short stories deal with a newly wed couple and the trials of a regular Japanese woman who is married to an Otaku.  This show is not written for kids!  There is a lot of mature (suggested but not graphic) humor and I don't even think teens would get as much out of the show as adults who have been through the trials of ""newly weds"".  Even if your not completely familiar with Japanese culture, you'll still find yourself laughing out loud or at times cringing at the chaos that hits too close to home.  Each episode is only about 5 to 10 minutes long but contains about 30 minutes worth of content, at that pace the dialog spins out faster that you can read the English subs.  Someone did good work on the English translation and even if you have to rewind and pause to read the speedy subs it's still worth it, the humor hits despite the language barrier.  Not to spoil, but the humor is typically risky, full of tongue-in-cheek and innuendo; the prudish be warned!  (The second season tames a bit but is not included in this collection).
My beef is that this product contains only the first 13 episodes and not both seasons (both of which are available to screen at a popular anime viewing site that I can't name because of copywrite, go investigate).  I've watched all 26 episodes and I would still buy this show just to have it, that is, if this copy contained all 26 episodes.",1482192000,3,1387,4.411764705882353
