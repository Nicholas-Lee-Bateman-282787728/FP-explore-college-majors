2561575,5,B000FDECH4,"John Hannah is one of the most talented, naturally gifted actors working today. This series was compulsive for me.  I had to see every epidsode after Rebus, with Hannah, ran out. Somehow, the Brits always get into the characters so well..why is that? Could it be the casting is perfect? Hannah,as Dr. Iain McCallum,  carries the series, is a devil with women, and everyone in the show does an amazing job. Where do these actors come from? I recognized only Hannah. The women have such a different,natural beauty, and none of the men could pose for underwear ads. Yes, they play compelling characters and are somehow much more interesting for looking like regular folk. The writing is superb; so much better than even the best shows on American t.v. With each episode, I could not take my eyes away from the screen because I had to know what McCallum was going to do and how he was going to get thru another big mess because often. motorcycle- riding McCallum is his own worst enemy. His personal life becomes as intriguing as who is raising the body count; and what is obvious, is that the writer of the series knows medicine and science well, so that the viewer is learning in every scene. This is not glamorous London; it's the seedy side of the East End of London and is as deadly and dark as Edinburg,Scotland in the Rebus series.  Don't miss McCallum if you like an intelligent and entertaining experience.  I wish there were many more episodes but Hannah is on to other assignments.",1175299200,15,1488,4.625

2561577,5,B000FDECH4,Had never heard of this BBC show before. Outstanding. Great acting and engaging CSI type story lines. Appropriate for mature teans and adults. Scot accents can be difficult to sort through at first.,1168473600,4,198,5.03030303030303
2561578,5,B000FDECH4,"As it appeared on broadcast television, at least, episodes of this series opened on a dark, moody and threatening looking Thames River flowing through London, under the famous bridges, while a sultry chick singer delivered ""Cry Me a River.""  Now recently released on dvd, scuttlebutt says this production of Scottish Television Enterprises has lost the voice-over opening song.  Licensing difficulties, I suppose.  But this is a blow to me, and, perhaps to others: the English singer Mari Wilson's take of this famous song put me right in the mood for what followed.

At any rate, hunky Scottish actor John Hannah, whom I first noticed in an episode of Taggart,came to widespread public notice playing ""Matthew""in ""Four Weddings and a Funeral."" Here he plays Dr. Ian Mc Callum, forensic pathologist based at St. Patricks Hospital in London's East End.  The darkness of the Thames continues into the hospital, which always looks so dark and dusty, I wonder how the pathologists can see anything through their microscopes. As befits a Scot, Hannah's character, McCallum is painted in dark, morose tones too.  At one point he and a friend take a stroll through London: it seems that, at almost every street, there has been a murder, and he has examined a body, and it is  obvious that he carries all those violent deaths, and all those bodies, as a burden all his waking, and sleeping hours.  Hannah, who was born to a large family in East Kilbride, Scotland, and began his working career as an electrician's apprentice, evidently has a gift for these dark law enforcement roles.  He played Rebus in several made for tv episodes of the Ian Rankin books, until a corporate reorganization resulted in his replacement by another actor.

At any rate, Mc Callum's  plots, too, are dark, but taut and spare: this is a well-written series. I call to mind an episode about a Jewish family that owns a bakery, and a really resonant one about illegal Brazilian immigrants being exposed to a mysterious fatal illness by the unlicensed English doctor they must consult for their medical needs.  There's an excellent one in which a female coworker of McCallum's is murdered shortly after they've made love: he's in an uncomfortable, untenable position: doesn't want to admit he was the last to see her alive, but unable to prevent the investigation  from going forward and snaring him at last.  And there's a dandy one about a man who believes Mc Callum has injured him, trying to take revenge.

There's some of that Scottish wit too, of course. Guess you'd have to conclude that this television series fits into that school of British mysteries now known as tartan noir: darker, more violent, more bloody than the norm.  But with some humor, too.  At one point, McCallum, talking to a woman he's about to get to know better says, ""Please, I'm Scottish.  We don't even make eye contact until after we've had sex."" Of course, there is sex, Hannah/Mc Callum is much too easy on the eyes to be going without, and almost every episode features a shot of Hannah's tasty tousch.  Another good reason to check this series out.",1160006400,79,3103,4.84280303030303

2561580,5,B000FDECH4,"This is one of the finest examples of British police/forensic programmes ever.  My only complaint is that they didn't make more episodes - with John Hannah.

I disagree with it being a forerunner to CSI though - as I think McCallum is entirely different. McCallum is so much more realistic, and a far far superior drama at the same time.",1153008000,55,337,4.6
2561581,5,B000FDECH4,"In my opinion, McCallum is the forerunner and inspiration for the CSI franchise on US television.  I caught most of the episodes on PBS long before CSI came on the scene and was totally caught up in it's dark, gritty, ugly portrayal of life and death in the East End of London.  John Hannah is excellent as Dr. Ian McCallum, forensic pathologist extraordinaire but a man who fights demons of his own...both in his personal life and at his job.  Hannah is surrounded by a superb supporting cast.  McCallum is a top-notch drama from the UK but be warned, it's not pretty, is R-rated and definitely NOT for the kiddies.",1151280000,108,616,4.572727272727272

2561589,1,B000FDECH4,"Being a big British mystery fan, I've tried hard to like this series but after watching 2 CDs, I think I've seen all I can handle. Bad, absurd plots, over acting, poor direction. The character interaction most reminds me of daytime soap. The plots consist of a series of improbable events where people do really dumb things with little or no reason. Everyone is angry and yelling at each other. Both McCallum and his wife supposedly deeply love each other but a nod and a wink from someone will have them jumping into bed with others. How many near-death experiences will be needed to keep them together? The gratuitous nudity does little to increase interest. It's a sad little series. Don't waste your time or money unless soap operas turn you on.",1366502400,5,749,4.681818181818182

2561594,4,B000FDECH4,"SPOILER WARNING ABOUT THE FINAL EPISODES.................. ANGRY RANT WARNING TOO.....If you buy this and love it as you go along, perhaps you should avoid the final episode.

This was an incredible, wonderful forensic drama, full of mystery and crime, great stories and characters and actors and really worth watching.  They biolt characters really well from the beginning, they had a good balance betweent the science, the police work, the personal relationships, and the workplace relationships. Good mysteries with twists and turns but not so much it gives you whip lash, just enough for you to get it wrong sometimes and get it right sometimes.

... however....sadly, it might as well have been made in the USA because the one thing I DESPISE about my great country's television series' is that some idiot at some network decides one night the series is over and instead of wrapping it up in a worthwhile way that pleases the fans and gives you a few episodes to adapt and be pleased some sort of ""end"", they just cut it off abruptly or pathetically wrap it up in a hasty, horrible, senseless way that angers everyone who has any investment in the series.

In the last 3 episodes they destroyed McCallum's relationships with every friend and co-worker he had, then destroyed Paddy's character worse than being a SYOA political jerk - he was an actual bad guy who hates McCallum and deliberately tries to destroy him after he (paddy) sleeps with a young student and gets her pregnant and then justifies it with ""if its offered you take it"" and doesn't care a bit that she was murdered carrying his baby, not a single comment about his baby being killed, and then they destroyed the entire show with the last episode as I describe in my rant below.

They took a page out of the USA tv network playbook, and it was one of the top 5 worst pages, only worse. Its not just a pathetic last episode- Its like they fired the creators and writers (and actors), brought in a bunch of people nobody knows, doesn't even give you an episode or 2 to KNOW the characters - they just swooped in for the final episode with new people and no reason for where the main characters went or why, and gives you a ridiculous episode that is all around stupid, poorly written, confusing and pointless-not even a decent mystery in the final episode! The few characters who returned for the final episode were insulted and ruined through the whole episode.  They couldn't even give us the typical Fuzzy or Bobby charm or Paddy's SYOA attitude, they were just background people who were treated like garbage, with no personality traits from their former characters whatsoever. Its like the cops didn't even know who they were - they were ignored by the other ""regulars"" and dissed by the new ""stars"" at every turn - I was disgusted. The cops didn't even work on the case, they were just extras with a few lines - Freakin bizarre!

I usually analyze through the whole episode ""who could it be?""  and within the 1st 20-30 minutes, there are multiple credible possibilities. Since there was no background or characters or story to latch onto, ""who dunnit"" was not anywhere near the questions I was asking myself - ""who are these people"" was the question, and it made it seem like it had to be one of the new characters, except that the 2nd to last episode already made ""McCallum's replacement"" a killer so why would they be going down the same road?  Yet, the new ""McCallum"" aka Gallagher was so unlikeable, it seemed like he was involved - until his new ""angela"" arrived and then it seemed she was involved because she didn't have a single redeeming character trait. OR was it Gallagher's new girlfriend who he met on the day of the first murder?  Since she was a mystery woman who was looking up Gallagher's forensic experience online and checking out his serial killer books, it seemed like her but it made no sense because she kept getting attacked by the killers but never actually killed.  Positively STUPID!!! meanwhile, the cops investigated NOBODY!!!!!

Who it turned out to be and why was even more ridiculous because they weren't even introduced to the story until about 5 minutes before they were found out to be the killers.  And some of the murders happened at the mortuary by people who didn't have access to the mortuary (what happened to the usually electronic security box that required a code in the previous episode?, how about the keys that only were available to the top 5 characters in the show and in the previous episode had to be secretly copied for the new ""McCallum/killer"" to have access?) And then the 1st murder that was thought to be committed in the morgue was not - it was viles of blood splashed to look like a murder scene, and then cleaned up only to be seen with a blue light, but no murder committed there - WHAT? but then the killers tried to kill Gallagher there - obviously getting into the building YET AGAIN without any security knowledge.  Sure, they made the security guards out to be completely incompetent in one scene to make sure you knew they were idiots but still - NO electronic box, no keys required, never showed them getting into the morgue....just being there and security not seeing them or seeing them and not wondering how they got in  - in previous episodes, there was no emphasis on guards - all the security was high tech and keys but suddenly its careless irresponsible guards and some old video cameras that don't work right - ever.

NO McCallum in the final episode HELLOOOOOOOOO? No Angela HELLOOOOOOOOOOO? Yes, we get the fabulous Fuzzy and Bobby but they both had their personalities removed and were turned into extras - not glorified extras, EXTRAS!  A few scenes with Paddy being angry and drunk but he was not part of the episode, his secretary who I don't ever remember being in any other episode (no offense if she was, but I have no recollection of her) and the usual cops, but they were extras too - since they didn't know the new stars of the show yet and didn't work on the case, they were worthless extras - even the offices/mortuary looks different, they used all different angles than before making it look like a different set with different actors and different characters and a completely implausible story that is all about the new main character who we don't know and don't give a hoot about.  ONE SENTENCE about Mccallum being ""head hunted"" and moving to California or something, and no comments at all about Angela - both of which had finally come to terms with their feelings for eachother in the previous episode, and seemingly rescinding their resignations (although that wasn't actually said, it was implied) - and then POOF, they are both GONE, and nobody says where for sure and definitely didn't say they were together or had another fallout or anything - just GONE. This usually doesn't happen in UK mystery shows because they have a beginning and an end. Possibly the worst writing I have ever witnessed in a series.

I really enjoy USA made mystery/crime shows but the other countries have some differences that make them really good in their own way, one is that they always END a SHOW. Not here, they just added a final episode that could have been a completely different show with writers who just came out of some high school writing program who created their own characters who had no connection to eachother whatsoever.  I'd rather have had the typical USA ""I got cancelled without any notice"" drop off episode than this garbage. What a waste to end such a great show with an episode that is so bad it actually makes me angry.  I wonder if fans at the time were as angry as I am after watching the dvd set and getting invested in the characters etc.

As I said at the beginning, if you enjoy the show all the way through, stop at disc 4 and don't watch the final episode on disc 5 unless you are watching out of curiosity about how bad it could really be.

5 star show with a ZERO STAR ENDING. I would be embarrassed if I played any part in the final episode of this show.",1339459200,6,8050,4.610062893081761
2561595,5,B000FDECH4,"Wonderful series!!

2561599,4,B000FDECH4,"I really liked this series a lot. The acting is good, the interaction of characters is great. They also killed off some of the regulars I didn't like. My only 2 complaints are, I would have liked a follow up episode of the Black Widow character and I don't understand why McCallum wasn't in the last episode.

But this is one of the few shows where the lead character is no longer in his own show at the end of it!  The stories are hot and steamy and are not for kids, this is a ""quincy"" type detective show in a way with forensic pathologists getting involved with crime cases. As the one star reviews have pointed out these characters do drink too much but that has happened in all work fields before so it doesn't hurt this show one bit so I disagree with their star levels. THe stories are good and the acting is good and it's prime 1990's gritty crime stories all the way. This is not for kids though.

Hannah is a great actor and his scope is wide.
It is at it's very best here as you can almost see the wheels turning within his mind to find the clue,cause and culprit.
I find that with my Australian background,i have tended to be exposed to British shows a great deal alongside the most popular U.S shows.
Each have something to offer.
One thing i enjoy head and shoulders about a British production like McCallum over the American shows of this genre,is that they are more real,gritty and they are far more earthy in their tone and interaction with each other.
So bring on more quality like McCallum and the really good American productions which are also excellent,but please stop the franchise when the fat and gristle start to overshadow the main course.

However, I suggest getting the series at the library and skipping the last one.  It's a total bore - McCallum (John Hannah) is gone, along with the exquisite Angela (Zara Turner) and everyone from the start of the series looks weary. The actors basically phone in their performances and the new people have no charisma whatsoever.  Either that, or the writing of this one episode is just really, really bad.

They have begun bickering like an old married couple by this time; the kid is beginning to get really good at his job and Bracken is suddenly threatened.  You have to see it to get it.

I must say it's the first time that the combination of rating and recommendation has let me down. While McCallum (the series) is adequate, it's not nearly as enjoyable as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kavanagh-QC-Set-1/dp/B000641YUU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kavanagh QC, Set 1</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wire-in-the-Blood-Complete-First-Season/dp/B0009H97IA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wire in the Blood - Complete First Season</a>, or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Silent-Witness/dp/B000053VC1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Silent Witness</a>&nbsp;(the latter of which also has a pathology component).

It seems that McCallum's focus was rather scattered. In addition to having a completely unbelievable premise of Pathologists working for a hospital (rather than the Home Office), the show struggles to find a focus. At one point it's HIV infection (when Bobby is cut during an examination), at another it's McCallum's serial monogamy (Joanna his regular girlfriend, who later and inexplicably disappears without much of a mention), or the affair that the student pathologist is having with one of the St. Patrick's staff, or the ""mystery disease"" that McCallum's one-time lover (I can't really call her a girlfriend) Joanna suffers after returning from a (convenient) trip abroad.

After a while I found the show tedious. McCallum will have his woman-of-the-day, have to run off to a scene of crime (on his motorcycle, of course!), exchange numerous stares with Angela (a coworker), have a tiff with Paddy (his boss), engage in some witty conversation with Fuzzy and Bobby (coworkers). In the end, everything is wrapped up nicely. Of COURSE Paddy is the ""bad guy"", as McCallum can only be ""good""; his only (seeming) failing ever shown is his fondness for women and his motorcycle.",1180656000,7,2034,6.446886446886447
2561610,2,B000FDECH4,"The series suffers from an obsession with promiscuous sex and nudity that add nothing to the plots of the episodes. When the characters aren't preoccupied with sex, they are preoccupied with drinking. In the midst of this the writers throw in a murder and the characters take a break from their escapades just long enough to solve the crime and catch the bad guys. There's nothing wrong with sex or partying but it should not be the primary focus of a murder mystery series unless the makers are willing to take the time to actually develop the characters and their personal stories so that the scenes actually add something to the plot. Not worth owning.",1179187200,24,655,4.7043478260869565
2561611,4,B000FDECH4,John Hannah and rest of cast struggle with a common problem...writers who start like an Olympic sprinter and end totally unravelled barely able to get across the finish line. Too much silly business of McCallum acting like a 12 yr old and then audience expected to believe he is a crack intellect full of perception...without sense enough to keep his pants zipped...people are just written out of the series and others grabbed to fill the void..the last show it would seem we are to believe McCallum in living the good life in LA...no other explanation and a new head pathologist and VERY irritating and unprofessional assistant...if they weren't going to meet Hannah's salary just end the program...which is what must have happenned....UNRAVELING and whimpering to an end...too bad...it was a good premise,1178150400,9,806,5.113636363636363
8121076,5,B000FDECH4,"Excellent.  If you like mystery & drama, you'll love McCallum.",1503187200,,62,5.2
8121077,5,B000FDECH4,John Hannah is just great in this series.,1434153600,,41,4.25
8121078,5,B000FDECH4,"Intriguing stories, good characterisations, and a protagonist you just want to grab by the collar and give a good shake for his misbehaviour. Might do to listen with the vlume up if you're not tuned in to the Scottish accent of the hero. One complaint (spoiler alert) - the very last episode doesn't even mention the title character, but has a ""replacement"" ME and assistant ME, and th e implication that the series, had it continued, could have been interesting enough. John Hannah is always good, and the other actors are quite convincing in their roles.",1414972800,,556,4.802083333333333
8121079,4,B000FDECH4,"We have watched about half on the episodes of this show and like it very much.  The biggest complaint is that it doesn't have English subtitles.  Heavy Scottish and Irish accents are difficult to translate for some of us.  However, the actors and story lines are very exciting.  The show is about crimes and forensics, interesting.",1395360000,,331,4.857142857142857
8121080,5,B000FDECH4,I HAVE FOLLOWED ALL OF FOYLES ADVENTURES AND WILL CONTINUE IF HE MAKES MORE.  ANY OTHER SUGGESTIONS WILL BE APPRECIATED.,1392336000,,120,5.0
8121081,1,B000FDECH4,I was hopeful I would enjoy this based on the reviews and my addiction to British mysteries but I could barely get through the first episode. This is not well done at all. A typical police procedural but without engaging characters or an interesting or well written plot. Having just finished the cracker series there is just no comparison. I guess the Brits have to have their losers too. I wish I could get my money back.,1392249600,,423,4.5064935064935066
8121082,3,B000FDECH4,"I was disappointed in this series. Didn't like the main character all that much, and didn't find the acting all that good. Worth viewing once, but probably won't go back for reruns.",1389571200,,181,4.6875
8121083,4,B000FDECH4,I liked this series until the last DVD which was a disappointment sort of lost the story line and the actors.,1385424000,,109,4.238095238095238
8121084,3,B000FDECH4,"Love love love the series.  One of the dvd's quality was not that great.  For something that is bought new, it should be perfect, and it was  not.  It had some wavy lines and it was not crystal clear.",1381708800,,200,4.051282051282051
8121085,5,B000FDECH4,"I love mysteries from across the pond be they British, Irish or Scottish.  This series is about a young, Scottish member of the police force who is a forensic pathologist and who performs autopies.  When he finds suspicious causes of death you can be sure a mystery is afoot.  I was worried that I would not be able to understand the thick accents, however, during the first episode I became aware that I was following along quite well.  I believe you just become accustomed to the language & it becomes easier to understand.  There are no subtitles & I wish there were, but, it does not spoil the program at all.  It has been called ""gritty"" & it is.  An autopsy is not a pleasant thing to watch & some of the villians are really repulsive.  But, it is exciting & the main character is wonderful.  He isn't perfect, but, he is finding his way.  It is a very good series with good acting, interesting settings & good mysteries.",1379289600,2,927,4.431952662721893
