6785742,3,B00P2G1OSY,"The movie looks great, and there are some good performances, but after the first fifteen minutes when all of the stakes are introduced, there's really not much of interest that happens until the final climax.  The sort of movie that makes you want to see what these directors do next.",1420588800,,284,4.68

6785744,1,B00P2G1OSY,"Unfortunately we said the title aloud about 50 times while watching it.  The cinematography is pretty stellar for an indie, but the writing and execution is very poor.  No character development or originality in this one: pass.",1419638400,,227,5.108108108108108

6785747,4,B00P2G1OSY,"This was a meticulously directed and edited film, with many brilliantly drawn characters.  I have seen this kind of film before, as it superficially evokes films like The Last Picture Show and American Graffiti, but it had a number of great twists on the traditional coming-of-age plot.  I particularly loved the way the sheriff communicated to Bobby the reality that limited both of them, without ever explicitly describing the situation.  Mark Pellegrino is a charmingly sadistic psychopath as Giff.  As a filmmaker myself, I commend Zeke and Simon Hawkins for their precision in executing on the plan for the film, and creating a world that drew the viewer in a little at a time.",1416268800,7,682,4.956140350877193
6785748,3,B00P2G1OSY,"You'll hear the name Jim Thompson referred to often in the Texas crime thriller, Bad Turn Worse. The famous Oklahoma-born novelist known for his gritty, hard boiled works of pulp fiction is clearly the inspiration for screenwriter Dutch Southern (!!!) and his tale of small-town larceny gone wrong. In fact, he ambitiously quotes the author in the film's opening sequence: There are thirty-two ways to write a story, and Ive used every one, but there is only one plot  things are not as they seem. While that would have you guessing Bad Turn Worse is a film with lofty aspirations and many crooked swerves, the film is merely another solid addition to an overdone genre.

The mechanics of Bad Turn Worse, directed by Simon & Zeke Hawkins, are recognizably dusty and dark, with allusions to economic hardship and dreams of escape. The performances by the lead foursome are what will resonate long after the end credits roll. Mackenzie Davis, who has been phenomenal in every film she's been part of (Breathe In, What If) does equally great work as Sue, who along with her boyfriend B.J.'s (Logan Huffman) best friend Bobby (Jeremy Allen White) are due to leave their small Texas hometown for college. When we first meet them they're engaged in a banal but slightly humorous conversation over the term ""biscuits and gravy"" if there is in fact only one biscuit. It's the kind of Tarantino-esque back 'n forth that is engaging up to a point, then becomes tiresome as it drags on. Here is also when the aforementioned Thompson quote emerges, mentioned in passing by the highly intellectual Sue, who clearly relates to Bobby on a level that she can't with the untamed (read: dumb) B.J.

It's B.J. who gets them in a mess that only Jim Thompson could love. With his two closest friends leaving in a few days, BJ enlists them for one final weekend bash, spending loads of cash that he claims to have been saving. The truth is that he stole it from Giff (Mark Pellegrino), a mid-level thug working for a major gangster known as Big Red (William Devane). When Giff finds out, he's understandably pissed, and behind a thin veneer of threats orders them to steal from Big Red to get the money back. In the film's best, most Thompson-esque scene, Sue and Bobby try to enlist the authorities to get out of the jam in their in. Let's just say the cops aren't always too fond of running afoul of the local crime lords, and the sheriff's attempts to admit that without truly admitting it are hilarious. Basically, Sue and Bobby are stuck, and when B.J. starts to get suspicious about the closeness of their friendship it adds a level of sustained tension that is both compelling and believable.

The colorfully-named Dutch Southern (how is he not a pro wrestler with that name?) paints a vivid portrait of small-town hopelessness, captured in the heavy burden carried by the three young leads. Bobby is a smart kid who sees his hometown for the depressing black hole that it is, but isn't fully capable of escaping its many pitfalls. We can see instantly why he'd fall for someone like Sue, who is beautiful, smart, and knows what she wants out of life. At the same time it's hard not to sympathize with B.J., the guy who knows he's destined to stay forever in the same place he's always been. Sue becomes the prized jewel between both men, who eye her for very different reasons. Southern's character work is fantastic, but the plot is so thin it can barely sustain the brief 90-minute runtime. Economy of story is oftentimes a good thing in these kinds of thrillers but there has to be some kind of spine to support it, and there is little to find here. It doesn't help that Pellegrino's villain errs too far on the comical side rather than the psychotically menacing. Davis is tremendous yet again, and at this point it's fair to say no other young actress does tough yet vulnerable better than her. Bad Turn Worse doesn't quite live up to the Jim Thompson aspirations, but fortunately it doesn't live up to its title, either.",1416182400,5,4012,4.6784702549575075

8686191,1,B00P2G1OSY,"A steaminng pile of direct-to-video stupidity.
The only things this movie had worth watching was the over-the top scene chewing from Mark Pellegrino, a subtle performance from Mackenzie Davis and an all too brief appearance from William Devane. At least the worst actors in the movies either had small roles or died before the end.
Don't waste your time.",1462838400,,354,5.016949152542373
8686192,3,B00P2G1OSY,"They say that the friends you make in school will be your friends for life. The film Bad Turn Worse explores these bonds and shows just how tight they can be. B.J. (Logan Huffman) is your typical Texas High School senior, who is more concerned with meeting the right people, and getting a good job, then he is about going to college, which present a problem in regards to his best friend and girlfriend, who are both headed towards university. B.J. wants to leave his friends on a high note, and decides in order to accomplish this, he needs to ""borrow"" some money from his shady boss. What B.J. doesn't know is just how connected his boss really is, and once it's discovered that he took the money, his life, and the lives of his two closest friends end up being in jeopardy. Logan Huffman stars and fails to follow up on the success he had in his debut film, Underdogs. In that film, Huffman looked like he would be the next big thing in Hollywood, but playing a dim-witted character in a somewhat anti-climatic story didn't do him any favors. He is paired with Jeremy Allan White, better known as Lip, in the hit series Shameless. I was hoping to see him open up and show some range with this role, but the truth is he was just playing the same character, a highly intelligent young adult who makes poor choices. As far as the story goes, it was pretty interesting, but there are too many breaks in the main story, which distract you from the big picture. There is a lot of discussion and strains on the groups friendship, which pop up at the absolute worse times and pretty much stop the film dead in it's tracks. Bad Turn Worse really did feature a pretty good story, with a ton of up and coming young Hollywood talent. It's very appealing in many ways, but also disappointing in others.",1462752000,,1792,4.433333333333334

8686194,2,B00P2G1OSY,"Bad plot, bad music, a slow plot built around a wacky love triangle and unbelievable bad guys. Why it won awards I guess is for creativity.",1437264000,,139,4.384615384615385
8686195,5,B00P2G1OSY,"As a film noir fan, they don't come much better than this. Taking place in a very small town in Texas, 3 teens (2 of whom are leaving for school in a week) party hard in Corpus Cristi. Little do Bobby and Sue know, they are partying on money that BJ stole. The 3 played by Jeremy Allen White, Logan Huffman and MacKenzie Davis are superb. These 3 young actors should have budding careers as actors. Damn, I'd hire them for sure. The money was stolen from giff (amazingly played by Mark Pellegrino) I will say no more about the plot because it is one hell of a movie. Bravos go to the actors, directors (Simon and Zeke Hawkins) , writer and everyone else involved.",1434412800,2,663,4.312
8686196,1,B00P2G1OSY,"A woefully pale imitation of early tarantino that's completely undone by wretched, totally wrong casting, dialogue that meanders to nowheresville, and a plot with more loose ends than an outdoor fiber doormat. the so-called young tough guy who sets things off by stealing 20K is so ill-suited for the role that it's painful to watch and hear him. while his gal interest throws off an acceptable young laura dern vibe, the other member of this hapless late-teen troika, is a wide-eyed naive sort who looks strange, acts stranger.  the adult villain plays everything to a faux comic fault, as if menace can only be demo'd through phony comic delivery. avoid this indie flick.",1426032000,,673,4.95575221238938
8686197,5,B00P2G1OSY,"Fast moving and smart, fun and edgy. Mark Pellegrino nails one of the juiciest villain roles of the last few years, but a solid performance from all concerned makes this a must-watch. Fans of Jim Thompson, Ross Macdonald, or Joe Lansdale will feel right at home.",1425168000,,262,4.717391304347826
