1658613,5,B00005S6KT,"We've become so accustomed to martial arts being a sport here
in the United States that even a casual review of the Monks
DVD will reveal significant differences.  In China, it is a way
of life.  From youth through adulthood, one is immersed in the
training, breaths and lives the art.  Neuromuscular control,
mental discipline, and absorbing the philosophy of martial arts
is paramount.  Only under this lifelong training and environment
does one achieve perfection.  The Shaolin epitomizes this per-
fection in every sense.
If one is at all interested in the differences in style and
training between the Western world versus that of the China,
the first several minutes will leave you in awe.  You'll be
left spellbound at the mastery of the art, the variations-on-
a-theme of the Chinese martial arts.  You'll be left stunned.
When you've watched it all, you'll replay it for those moves
too fleeting to catch the first time around.
The only thing better is to watch them in person.  You will
float out of the performance....transcended.",1013385600,21,1041,4.976878612716763
1658614,5,B00005S6KT,"I was watching this at a telivison show.  The monks are so fast I wish I had there speed.  The monks ae so lovable and so campsionate.  I am surpized thet don't harm themselves  They have this thing called chi.  I love the video.  Masters of kung fu get this video now.  I recomend this to everyone.  Thanks, Mary E.

1658615,5,B00005S6KT,"I had first found out about this dvd on line several months ago at their website... There was a sample video and lots of information about these monks. The show is a great display of traditional Shaolin Kung Fu along with feats of great mental and physical strength. Any one that yearns for more understanding of the Shaolin monks, or a great martial arts spectacle will get it on this dvd.",1011052800,,390,4.507042253521127
1658616,5,B00005S6KT,"I've been seeing a lot movies and performing about kung-fu and martial art, but this's a best one I've ever seen berfore. The way they perform their shaolin forms are so perfect. This is a great DVD or VHS you should have at home and especcial one for whoever is learning kung-fu or wu-shu.....",1010275200,,294,4.462962962962963
1658617,5,B00005S6KT,"It is worth watching it to see how shaolin monks demonstrate their skills---internal power (qi-kung) and their practice.  With strong will and life long practice, human-being can reach to the highest skill in martial art....",1008288000,4,224,5.4
1658618,5,B00005S6KT,"The strength and discipline alone of the adults and children in this program are mind boggling. The music and pageantry only add to the amazing feats performed. Steel and concrete are broken on these monk's bodies, along with youths balancing their bodies on the sides of narrow poles standing only on their tip. Seeing this show in person would be the only thing better.",1007942400,,371,4.8125
1658619,5,B00005S6KT,"Just sit in a relaxed frame of mind ( now a days?) and watch.
Imagine the potential.",1007251200,,84,4.0
1658620,5,B00005S6KT,"Excellent documentation of a fascinating production, which toured the US and told the story of the Shaolin teachings, as well as demonstrating the ""Kung Fu power"". The part I actually enjoyed most was the additional documentary about the creation of the production - how they formed a team to go the Shaolin temple and recruit monks of all ages (7-70) to be in the touring company. A very interesting story for anyone interested in some of the culture behind one of the world's true martial arts.",1167868800,,496,4.77906976744186
1658621,5,B00005S6KT,"This production is amazing and inspiring for all  walks of martial artists.  The choreography and pure talent of all the monks is humbling and unbelievable.  I highly recommend this DVD for those who study martial arts, and for those who enjoy a good show.  Flawless..",1146873600,,268,4.888888888888889
1658622,3,B00005S6KT,"Apart from a defective soundtrack on the DVD (fluctuation in volume from loud to near silence), this was an interesting theatrical presentation.  Unlike some of the reviewers, I have no martial arts background.  So, I am unable to pick apart the representations of various forms.  I am viewing this for what it is...theatre.  If an individual is so interested as to actual execution, then he can seek training.  However, I will agree that some of the presentations seemed more of the circus than of the temple.  Any three ring acrobat can perform a series of backflips.  I did enjoy the show and I found the documentary about the show, in the bonus features, interesting as well.",1145923200,,679,4.801724137931035
1658623,4,B00005S6KT,"Purists of Shaolin Gung Fu might have some technique issues,but this telling of the history of the shaolin order is easy enjoyed and will wow the newcomer as to the possibilities of martial arts, with  Shaolin style.",1130112000,,216,4.837837837837838
1658624,3,B00005S6KT,"I give this 3 stars.

1.  This really was more about flash than martial arts.  The forms were geared to showiness, not real martial arts.  They were good, but it wasn't practical.

2.  Worse, there didn't seem to be any real feel to what they were doing.  Mystical mumbo jumbo, standard tricks, and all forms done to speed without any consideration as to how the forms SHOULD be done really detract from the show.

Overall, that's enough in my mind to take away two stars.  It was a great show, if you like Contemporary WuShu.  If you want tradtional martial arts, look elsewhere, this isn't it.",1121299200,4,595,4.528301886792453
1658625,2,B00005S6KT,"Another video of fake Shaolin Monks performing intermediate level contemporary wushu. Not skillful enough to be accepted by one of the professional provincial teams, they shave their heads and dress up like monks to perform for the tourists visiting the Shaolin Temple museum in Henan. The more athletic ones get to perform on one of the fake monk foreign tours, but never inside China.

One ""monk"" performs nanquan as though it's changquan; no power, no root, just speed and improper technique. As any Chinese stylist knows, nanquan is southern fist from Fujian and never existed at the Songshan temple in the north.

Another ""monk"" performs meihua tanglangquan (very poorly) that originated in Shangdong and also never existed at the Songshan temple. If you want to see it done correctly, get a copy of ""The Shaolin Temple"" and watch Yu Hai do it.

The so-called ""superhuman feats"" they perform at the end of the video are standard, run-of-the-mill circus ""strongman"" tricks that rely solely on basic physics and are commonly performed by the ""hard qigong masters"" from China. The melodramatic preparations they did before each trick were totally unnecessary for the execution of the tricks. There is no magic in them.

Everyone that I've spoken with in my travels across China knows there are no longer any real martial monks at the temple museum. It's kind of an inside joke on the foreigners. But people continue to fall for the charade.",1101686400,8,1442,4.995833333333334
1658626,4,B00005S6KT,"It is no exaggeration to say that the secrets of the East - most specifically, the astounding physical feats of the mystical _kung-fu_ - have taken hold of recent mass-media output and, by extension, the mass-audience it serves/placates.  Extremely successful cinema such as *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,* and the *Matrix* franchise have melded the ambiguous philosophies of Buddhism/Taoism with plenty of stylistic [stunts]: and in hindsight, it's not surprising that this graceful, violence-as-dance instinct-invigoration was, for a period, so eagerly embraced by explosion-jaded spectators.  Unfortunately, the cycle of exploitation has almost come full circle, with Asian-style action so thoroughly replicated in subsequent substandard product that a ""wire-fu"" backlash has begun among moviegoers.  Do we really need to see abject bastardization a la Bulletproof Monk, Underworld, the latest Jackie Chan `vehicle'? (. . . oh how the mighty have fallen. . .!) And yet, despite the `simulacra stain,' an enormous amount of history, culture and spiritual power resides in the wushu, and the very difficulty of it - the austere commitment, the required devotion to meditative philosophy, and sheer physical hardship - practically guarantee that the `pure' form shall remain and thrive, in the dedicated few, while trendshapers move on and exploit elsewhere, until the cycle is ripe once again for re-examination and the profits to be reaped therein. . .  (. . .pause for mental breath. . .).  Thankfully, the _true_ aspects of this refined Asian aesthetic have been faithfully recorded and expounded upon by stanch enthusiasts, a sterling example being this DVD here.
Although kung fu was developed long before the Shaolin Temple came into existence (circa 495 AD), its teachings were, up to that point, primarily used for martial advancement: superior training most often equaled unsurpassed victory.  With the advent of Shaolin, however, a greater depth and spirituality was infused in basic form, for founding monk Bodhidharma advocated a meditative focus as the primary goal.  In Chinese philosophy, extreme tranquility generates dynamic energy; the physical release/expression of such energy can be seen vividly in this, *Shaolin: Wheel of Life,* the first and only media representation of the form/theory to be fully supported by the Temple itself.
And what a representation it is! Crafted by artisans wholly dedicated to providing a core-authentic entertaining experience, *Shaolin: Wheel of Life* combines historical tragedy, melodrama, hardcore wushu training (empty hands and weapons), and superhuman endurance feats, all presented in a sort of neo-Chinese Opera format (traditional instruments in modern music-scoring; traditional wushu form in modern choreography).  Like a session of martial-art practice, the tension and release of the performance builds over the course of the hour+ DVD, until peaking with a set of exercises that are truly astounding to behold, even if it is via a second-seat medium (this DVD was recorded during the tour).  The potential of human concentration and advancement - of both the physical and the mental, for the one supports the other - is explicitly revealed in these last ten to fifteen minutes; as a practitioner of Shantung Black Tiger form, I myself felt competing sensations of compassionate pride, artistic jealousy and sublime satisfaction in viewing these monks, the culmination and pinnacle of _unfettered_ human achievement.
As a reviewer stated below, this is not an `advanced' representation of martial-art mastery - *that* sort of ability is kept away from barbarian eyes, I'm afraid - but it is an excellent start for anyone curious to continue beyond the recent cinematic excursions as popularized by Ang Lee and the Wachowski Bros.  I rate *Shaolin: Wheel of Life* four stars due to the fact that a couple of the drama sections, notably the climax, cross the delicate taste-boundary of good/bad melodrama, and become rather tiresome in repeat viewings; also, it does feel that, at times, the Monks are held back in their ability, confined by the choreographed necessity of a theater production.  Still, this is an excellent DVD for fan and novice alike.  Highly recommended.",1081468800,8,4241,5.467889908256881
1658627,5,B00005S6KT,"I was only going to watch 5 minutes of this DVD, and dedicate more time for it later, but as it turned out, I could NOT stop watching.  I wound up watching the whole thing.  The ""actors"" are actual students from Shaolin.  Wheel of Life is the Chinese equivalent of the Irish ""Riverdance.""  The story is about a group of monks from Shaolin who help the Chinese king defeat barbarians, only later to be betrayed by him for their unwillingness to stay as imperial guards.  All the performance is done on the stage, and it was filmed rather well.  Sometimes you view from the audiences' perspective, sometimes you get an extreme close-up.  The performance was stunning.  The acrobatic and gymastic skills of the actors just made my jaw drop.  I found it very similar to watching a Cirque du Soleil show, more than anything.  If you're a serious kung-fu afficionado like the reviewer below, you'll be disappointed, but for the general public, I believe you'll find this DVD highly entertaining, and probably view again and again.",1039996800,15,1024,4.767045454545454
1658628,5,B00005S6KT,Simply put.  You will love this DVD even if your not a fan of Martial Arts.  The weapon forms are amazing and so are the their displays of strength and dexterity.  This is a DVD everyone should have in their collection.,1024963200,3,219,4.2926829268292686
1658629,5,B00005S6KT,"My gosh! Man these guys are good! This show is so good! This show captures these Shaolin monks at their best in a theatrical performance! For those of you who don't really know what this movie is about, it is a high quality video of a performance of Shaolin: Wheel of Life, a show put on in the West End of London in 2000 I believe. The producers of the show actually went to a Shaolin Temple in China and recruited 25 Shaolin monks to perform in this show, with the permission of the abby. They then proceded to put on this spectacular show full of martial arts at its best, great theatrical drama, and stunts that people would deem impossible. Absolutely amazing this is. I can't recommend it enough.",1019088000,9,702,4.407692307692308
7953147,5,B00005S6KT,"I saw the ""Wheel of Life"" live on stage  several years ago and was extremely impressed. This dvd allows me to relive that experience many times over.",1520899200,,149,4.518518518518518
7953148,5,B00005S6KT,A must watch if your into shaolin kung fu. It shows them doing unbelievable stunts that only they could do. And amazing weaponry display. Well its pretty much a story but its live showing amazing features. Watch it and you'll see what I'm talking about. I didn't regret buying this but liked it alot.,1456790400,,300,4.574074074074074

7953150,4,B00005S6KT,"Shaolin Wheel of Life is intriguing on a number of levels. Partly this is due to it pretty much being the first time that the Shaolin monks got to present themselves on the world stage in this manner, as opposed to the endless stream of cheap and interminable kung fu flicks we've been subjected to over the decades. This was the real deal. Not an imagined for cheap and tacky cinema representation of what the producers thought the audience wanted. Further the way the monks and their spectacular abilities are presented was carefully managed by people who actually knew how to put together a theatrical experience. This instantly removes much of the tacky cheese factor from proceedings. It also meant that - unlike some Chinese theatre for example - you didn't need to understand the artifices being used as it was digestible to a Western audience.

All of which neatly set the stage for this to be a very successful production wherein a story is told by people who were not actually professional actors, by people who genuinely seemed thrilled to be doing what they were doing, and in a manner that was accessible while at the same time showing people feats of self control and gymnastic ability that they'd rarely if ever had the chance to witness.

During the performance the monks leap, bend, swivel and strike with lightning efficiency and precision. Not only will their abilities appeal to people usually interested in dance productions but to martial artists as well. Further the very extremity of some of these stunts will mean that there is a certain 'wow' factor even for the general audience. The story itself is reasonably stock standard and I won't throw spoilers into my review, suffice to say it is an acceptable vehicle to display the proficiencies of the performers. The main 'party trick' stunts are saved for the end of the show after the main story is over. However they are no less impressive for that.

As some other reviewers have noted it is essential to watch the documentary that comes with this. It tells the story in a concise and upbeat manner of how this production came about and how the monks too their show on the road. Uplifting stuff indeed.",1412380800,,2179,4.7592592592592595

7953152,5,B00005S6KT,"""Shaolin Wheel of Life"" is a taped stage performance. It blends kung fu, Western theatre and several elements of Chinese opera, VERY beautifully.

There are lots of demonstrations of forms and breaking woven into a storyline about an Emperor betraying the monks after they saved him from an invading warlord.

There's also a lot of really interesting behind-the-scenes footage about how they found the monks and got permission from the temple Abbot to use them in the play.",1347494400,,473,5.051282051282051
7953153,5,B00005S6KT,"This DVD is excellent and I recommend it to anyone who has an interest in martial arts and/or Zen. The Shaolin monks are incredible martial artists and stake a well founded claim for being the basis of subsequent martial arts systems. The demonstrations provided by the Shaolin monks are mind boggling. It should be underscored that this movie places an emphasis on spirituality rather than violence.

I would also note that this movie also has relevance to the general public. It clearly dispels misconceptions about the martial arts that are fostered by numerous martial arts movies. Within this context it is more akin to the philosophical underpinnings of the 1970s television show ""Kung Fu"" than Bruce Lee's ""Enter the Dragon."" However it should also be noted that Bruce Lee expressed a similar philosophy in his interviews as does Jet Lee.

This is an excellent movie and I recommend it highly. Very thoughtful, entertaining and enlightening.",1285545600,,948,5.109677419354838
7953154,5,B00005S6KT,"I purchased this product to present to a class I teach about alternative health and exercise lifestyles.  My expectations were exceeded with every passing minute.  While the play begins slowly, it doesn't take long to become fully involved in the dedication, athleticism, and tenacity of the Shaolin monks.  I strongly recommend this DVD presentation.",1176595200,,351,5.462962962962963
7953155,5,B00005S6KT,"Like a Chinese Phantom of an Opera, but on film, and a lot more physical endurance, literally.  The story was a bit boring, and some of the physical attributes seemed a bit repetitive, but otherwise undeniably impeccable.  Some of these physical stunts people did take a lot of trust, physical strength, and endurance.  You can't be drunk doing this kind of show, that's for sure.  Things from a person standing on his two index fingers, probably with more help from the bar than we realize, and how a person made himself half lie flat on one sharp point, and another person laid totally flat on 5 sharp points with people he trusted helping him reach that point.  Almost seems like visual proof of how acupuncture has an art form to it, and possibly even works.  Some people being able to tumble or bend their bodies at incredible angles, especially if the people have some muscles, you'd think they'd be less flexible, but it's like holy cow, the entire package.  If you appreciate physical talent and movement and not much storyline, this is a great movie to watch.  Even though there's not much plot, it does not deserve criticizing!

I think there was only like one female in this movie if any, so sorry females!  I guess you assume that people just chooses to live like monks and join the crew.",1169078400,,1300,4.613043478260869
7953156,5,B00005S6KT,"I know absolutely nothing whatsoever about martial arts, but I will tell you that this is one helluva good show - sort of like a martial arts ballet - telling the story of the Shaolin Temple and its monks.  The monks themselves are graceful and strong.  It reminded me of watching the Olympics on TV - sort of a ""gee whiz, did they really do that?"" quality.  I also got a big kick out of the little kid monks.  I know kids are generally more limber than grown-ups, but jeez!  Don't let your kids try these stunts at home.  Some of the posters here seem to know a lot about gongfu, which I don't, but I will say that all in all, this is a very entertaining DVD.  .",1167868800,,663,4.093023255813954
