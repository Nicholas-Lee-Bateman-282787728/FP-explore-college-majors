2128515,5,B0002W4UDO,This IS the TV series despite what others have said. It is only 13 of the original 26 episodes but that is currently all that is available. The Robert Newton biography Apologise Later was recently published so hopefully the remaining episodes will show up in time. However time has not been kind to the original film quality so some episodes may be lost due to improper film storage. Time will tell!

2128534,4,B0002W4UDO,"Surprisingly, this is the best quality I have seen for the series.  This applies to all 3 Alpha DVDs.  This third volume is even of a little bit better quality than the first two.
Don't get me wrong, the episodes all suffer the same off-color problems as the other DVDs out there, but these are sharper and they have a bit of a richer color palate here.  If you already own the episodes, it's probably not worth the price.  These are OOP now and the Amazon dealers are pricing them accordingly.",1405209600,,494,4.395604395604396
2128535,4,B0002W4UDO,"There are many, many DVDs of this series on Amazon.
It is very important to know that this is the PLATINUM 2-DVD set of THE ADVENTURES OF LONG JOHN SILVER.  It says ""TV Serial Classics""  at the top of the front cover and ""13 Swashbuckling Adventures Starring Robert Newton"" near the bottom of the front cover.  It's got a yellowish color with a picture of Newton to the left and his ship to the right.
Be careful because these are also sold separately as Volumes 1 & 2.  They cost a bit more if you buy them that way but I am pretty sure they are the exact same 2 DVDs.  Just make sure it says ""13"" on the front cover.
This is the line up:
Disc 1
THE NECKLACE
PIECES OF EIGHT
THE ORPHANS' CHRISTMAS
THE EXECUTION DOCK
THE EVICTION
THE PINK PEARL

Disc 2
THE TALE OF A TOOTH
SHIP O THE DEAD
SWORD OF VENGEANCE
TURNABOUT
MISS PURITY'S BIRTHDAY
DEAD RECKONING
DEVIL'S STEW
Even though the quality on these off-color and faded prints leaves a lot to be desired, I give this 4 stars because this the ONLY quality in which these episodes exist.
It's not 5 stars because there is a bug on the episodes that comes and goes.  If you hit the reverse button for a second this water mark that says ""Platinum"" disappears.  I believe if you make a back up copy of this set, the bug will not be on the copy.
Anyway, of the 14 existing and circulating episodes, there are all but one of them here.
I have searched and bought many different VHS and DVD editions of these episodes over the years and they ALWAYS look the same.  It was even broadcast on a local cable station here and they looked exactly like this.
This Platinum 2-DVD set is the most complete I have seen.  They are the first 13 episodes of the series (26 episodes were shot) and I believe they are in chronological broadcast order.  Since the show was syndicated, it's hard to know in what order they were shot.  And yes, the quality is very watchable, but not very nice.

Bottom line: For the price, you get in one place almost every thing out there in the same quality as this and since I picked my copy up for less than $2.00, how can I not give it a good rating?
It is, after all, one of the best TV shows of the '50s and Newton is the definitive pirate.
Hey, they don't mimic Johnny Depp on THE SIMPSONS, do they?
It's Newton they are doing.
By the way, the only episode not on here that is extant and circulating is DRAGON SLAYER (Episode 19).
That episode can be found most cheaply and with the least repetition on the Alpha Volume 1 DVD of the 3 that they put out.  I have not seen that DVD yet, but I am sure that it will not be an improvement over this set.  If it is I will report back.

Yes, I am a big fan of the series and saw it first run back in the '50s.  Of course, I didn't have a color TV then so I can't report on the quality of the episodes in those long ago golden days.  I didn't actually care all that much how they looked over our old Admiral and TV with rooftop antenna.  All I can remember from back then was me and the kids in the neighborhood putting on homemade black eye patches and saying ""Argh!"" to each other.  I do recall wondering how they found a guy with one leg to play Long John!
I guess everyone now knows that Robert Newton had two legs, but he sure did have us believing that a shark must have chewed it off at some point in his previous adventures.
I should also add that Newton first played Silver in Disney's classic TREASURE ISLAND (1950) which is in excellent condition on a Disney DVD.
 He later played Silver in a second feature called RETURN TO TREASURE ISLAND aka LONG JOHN SILVER (1954).
This is a must-see prequel to the TV series and it too is out there in many, many different VHS and DVD editions.
The ONLY one to consider there is the one put out by VCI.  It's a gorgeous print in excellent color and, unlike the Disney pre-big screen feature, this is in full Widescreen Cinemascope ...BUT...
And its a BIG but!
VCI screwed up the image and stretched it out way, way too much.  Everyone looks a bit too short and plump.  And it's also a non-anamorphic widescreen transfer.
This major flaw can be tweaked with some TV monitors as mine will do it.
The only other way to get that film (which is an excellent motion picture, by the way) is to buy one of the cheap ones that are all over the place on Amazon, but they are full screen with most of the image cropped off and with bad color on top of that.
Hopefully someday VCI will re-do it correctly on a Blu-Ray because the colors are pretty spectacular.  Both of these films were directed by Byron Haskin who has done a lot of great stuff including the original WAR OF THE WORLDS and many other George Pal Productions along with a bunch of episodes of THE OUTER LIMITS.
The TV series we are talking about here, THE ADVENTURES OF LONG JOHN SILVER, starts off directly subsequent to the incidents following the 2nd film.
As mentioned it's got the same major cast, but its necessarily done on a much smaller budget.  The series was shot in Australia and from what I have gathered it was the first TV show ever shot there.  And it was pretty much made before there were any TVs there.  Go figure!
Anyway, sorry this got to be so long winded, but the Platinum set is the best way to go for the series and believe me, I have seen quite a few of the others.

PS:
It has been reported in another Amazon post (possibly it was on Amazon. UK) that the rest of the episodes were released on a UK set.  This poster reported that he had only heard a rumor of it's existence and that it was only sold in stores.
I have searched high and low for it and it has NEVER turned up anywhere.
These are the missing episodes and they are NOT on this set:

Voodoo
Strange Cargo
Temple of Evil
The Crisis
The Master's Touch
The Flag Flies Black
To Purity, a Daughter
The Siege
Infernal Triangle
Where Men Are Men

2128549,4,B0002W4UDO,"In the beginning of this movie, we find Long John Silver in the ""Cast and Anchor"", biding his time, waiting for an adventure to come his way. We don't have to wait long before another pirate arrives and identifies two crew members from the ship of El Toro, Lohn John's nemesis, and the adventure begins. This to me is the ultimate Long John Silver movie. Robert Newton IS Long John Silver though n through. No one embodies the classic pirate like he does. He puts his very soul into the part. His raspy voice and wild-eyed glances practically allow us to see the gears of his scheming turn. He portrays Long John quite a bit more softly in this version, than in the Disney movie, which is good because his misdeeds can be forgiven much more easily. Kit Taylor also plays a perfect Jim Hawkins. When I hear the name, I mostly see his face. I've loved this movie since I was a wee lad of seven years. I'm fourty now and love it to this day. I actually enjoy this more so than the Disney ""first chapter"". There is more story, more character development and it's all in all a better movie in the pirate genre. This movie takes us on more twists and turns and we venture to more locals as the story unravels. The score is also perfect. David Buttolph created a rousing score to compliment this movie, punctuating every scene to enhance the veiwers experience as no other score could. My only complaint here is the condition of the movie itself. It's newer than the Disney movie, but looks fifty years older. I cannot understand to this day, why the studio didn't protect this GEM as Disney did with theirs. I've looked for this in a rematsered/restored version but have come to the conclusion that one does not exist. I can only hope that a company buys the rights and restores it to it's original glory. Maybe even Disney (with its facilities) could buy the rights, restore it and pair it with their Treasure Island in a two movie package on Bluray. It seems a perfectly fitting combo for sure.

Well, its a nice adventure but for me interesting specially because I'm a big Tab Hunter fan.

2128552,3,B0002W4UDO,"Long John Silver, 1954 film

The story begins in a tavern where two men order rum. A knife is thrown into a wall. These men are from Mendoza's crew! ""After them."" Perch is stabbed, but tells what happened to Jim Hawkins before he stops talking. One man has a plan to get a ship and sail for the treasure. Silver has the map. He and his men go to see the Governor about fighting Mendoza to rescue the Governor's daughter. Silver will deliver the ransom money and then signal the Governor's ships. The money is placed on the beach, pirates land to get it. Two men find bad luck. Silver visits Mendoza's ship. Billy now finds bad luck. Silver consults with Mendoza in the cabin and explains his plan. The signal fire will misdirect the Governor while the pirates loot a warehouse. But there is a big surprise!

Captain Mendoza figures out Silver's plan as to where the blame will fall for the looted warehouse. The ransom is returned, and Silver asks for a small favor from the Governor. Silver returns to the inn for comic scenes with the owner Purity. Purity also has a plan to help Silver. Silver needs a medallion as the key to the treasure map. But there is a problem. Silver is prepared for a wedding. Captain MacDougall of the ""Thistle"" visits Silver to look for seamen. A one-eyed man visits Silver. So does Jim Hawkins with the medallion. Purity makes plans for a wedding. The one-eyed man gathers a crew for Silver! Purity is disappointed by the news. ""Come back!""

At sea Mendoza's ship approaches the ""Thistle"", but a man-of-war dissuades them from an attack. Jim overhears the pirate's plans to takeover the ship, and tells Captain MacDougall. They have a counter-plan, and it works. Does a man who quotes the Bible always have the Bible in his heart? The men are marooned on a coral island where Mendoza's men stay. Can they distract Mendoza and his crew so they can take over his ship? Jim will help them by a dangerous act. The tracks in the sand tell of a one-legged man.

The ship sails to Treasure Island. Silver wants his share of the gold to pay for a good lawyer. The Union Jack flies over the ship. Mendoza plans to pursue Silver. Silver's crew learns the island is inhabited, a man who will try to kill them one by one. Some men run away. But there is a new complication when Mendoza's crew land and attack. Israel Hands survived and makes a deal with Silver to save them and rejoin the crew. Mendoza destroys their refuge. Silver and his crew follow the map to the treasure in the cave. Hands chases Jim through the cave and up a hill, but fails to get his revenge.

The sudden riches affect Silver's crew. Silver wants Mendoza's crew to release Jim and makes a deal. There is an explosive surprise for Mendoza's crew! Silver survives and come out on top. Back on the island there is a happy ending for Silver. (He made a donation to Government House and bought forgiveness for his crimes.) Purity Parker will now wed John Silver. But there is a wrinkle in her plans. ""He went that way."" ""Not again!"" ""Come back John.""

You can see how the original story was loosely followed in this sequel. This version was enriched by its comic scenes to balance its lower budget. There was no cast listing. Did Rodney Taylor play the part of ""Israel Hands""? After the Dracula and Frankenstein movies of the 1930s its sequel was the comedy drama ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein"".",1323388800,,3394,4.528548123980424

2128558,4,B0002W4UDO,"Robert Newton was born to play Long John Silver. In these episodes the character of Long John is toned down from the R,L, Stevenson figure in Treasure Island, to one who can best be described as a ""loveable rogue"". Here Newton, as can be expected, plays the character with great gusto and humour.

 I had not realised that when I first saw the series in the late 1950's that it was in fact a landmark in Australian television history. It was filmed in Australia, in technicolour, with prominent Australian actors, several years before Australia itself had television.

Throughout the 26 episodes Newton is outstanding. Ably supported by his regular crew, notable contributions are made by Neva Carr-Glyn in ""the Orphan's Christmas"" and George Simpson- Little in ""Devil's Stew"". ""The Tale of a Tooth"" is hilarious and ""Execution Dock"" is brilliantly surreal, way ahead of it's time. The tender relationship that both Long John and Purity Pinker have for Jim Hawkins who is in their care( beautifully played by Kit Taylor), is moving. Newton, and this can be easily overlooked, was an actor of wide range,capable of great sensitivity. His skill in avoiding the matrimonial intentions of Miss Pinker is another amusing feature of the series.

The Adventures of Long John Silver is a thoroughly enjoyable series despite some reproduction flaws. I remember as a boy reading that Robert Newton did not always enjoy being cast as a villain but he loved playing a pirate . In this series it shows, every episode ends with a laugh and a smile. Excellent entertainment.",1250553600,,1559,4.961685823754789
2128559,4,B0002W4UDO,"Despite having been filmed by a non-major studio, this is a fabulous sequel to Disney's ""Treasure Island"".

In the present form, the DVD comes out shining. Excellent restoration and vivid colors make it fully worthwhile watching.

This is a 2.55:1 widescreen presentation, and as such it is presented here. No cropping of any kind (like reducing it to 1.85:1 or 2.35:1). The soundtrack is in an unbelievably clear and polished Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Stereo.

VCI Entertainment (the Label of this DVD) has surpassed itself for this production and this is simply a must buy.

Reprising his former role of said Long John Silver, is the brilliant Robert Newton, but the rest of the roles have been recast. Despite of it, they all do a marvelous job recreating what was left of from the previous movie and bring it back now, in these new adventures of high Sea piracy.

Due to its format, this is truly a spectacular movie, with wonderful vistas and a sense of grandeur, that in today's movies is usually lacking and replaced by overblown special effects.

It is not ""Pirates of the Caribbeans"", but still highly entertaining and amusing. Thrills are there and not artificial as the ones we get nowadays, but rather subtle in coming, and once they are there, they are truly felt.

I can only recommend it.

But do not forget its original predecessor. The Disney's version, although in Full Screen (as it was filmed) has to be in your collection, to be able to enjoy this one to the fullest.

My urge upon you, the viewer, is to buy them both in a package, since otherwise, you may not fully understand the action contained in this sequel.

I ordered it because it was cheap.

2128569,4,B0002W4UDO,"I won't go into the merits of the movie, because that has been sufficiently covered by other reviewers...in short, good movie and this DVD is the best copy of it available.  However, there is one thing that should be noted about the aspect ratio on this DVD.  While the back of the package states that it is ""Enhanced for 16x9 TVs"" (or ""Anamorphic"") the DVD is indeed encoded in a 16x9 aspect ratio...but the source picture is actually a 4x3 image that's already letterboxed, so the picture you see on your TV is extremely vertically compressed (making everyone look short and fat).  The remedy is: If you have a regular 4x3 TV, set the TV aspect ratio in your DVD player settings to 16x9 and the picture will look the way it's supposed to (just remember to change it back before you watch something else).  If you have a 16x9 TV, just use the zoom feature on your TV that you usually use with 4x3 non-anamorphic videos.  That's about the only real problem with the DVD, and I thought anyone considering purchasing it should be aware.",1156032000,,1034,4.537634408602151

2128572,1,B0002W4UDO,"I purchased this DVD because I remembered seeing it when it was first released in the 1950's. It was supposed to be a sequel to the Disney classic ""Treasure Island""..The film itself was typical of the era with Robert Newton chewing the scenery and obviously having a good time as indeed did most of the cast. What I do remember was the vivid color photography, however this transfer is possibly the worst quality I have ever seen (with the possible exception of ""New Faces of 1956""). The color is murky and the picture is out of focus. The film was photographed in Cinemascope however this transfer is in full screen and not even pan and scanned but merely cropped. Avoid at all costs. Even at the bargain price it is not worth it.",1090108800,,731,4.503759398496241
2128573,4,B0002W4UDO,"To the best of my knowledge, this is largest collection of episodes from ""The Adventures of Long John Silver"" on DVD.  A total of 26 episodes were produced in 1955 and fully half of those episodes are contained in this 2-DVD set from Platinum Disc Corporation.
The series was produced by the same production company, Treasure Island Pictures, that made the theatrical release ""Long John Silver"" (a/k/a ""Long John Silver's Return to Treasure Island"") which, in turn, was a sequel to the earlier Disney film ""Treasure Island.""  Most of the cast and crew of ""Long John Silver"" returned for the TV series, which was syndicated in the United States and it was the first television series produced in Australia to reach U.S. shores.  Sadly, the series' star, Robert Newton, would make only one other film after the conclusion of this series, ""Around the World in Eighty Days,"" before passing away in March of 1956.
As is the case with other classic TV releases from Platinum Disc Corporation, the prints used for this DVD set are not from the original film elements; rather, they are sourced from syndication prints.  The series was filmed in color, but time has not been kind to the prints utilized for this release.  Colors tend towards browns and a few episodes have that reddish look associated with the fading of color film but, in several episodes, colors are fairly vivid.  If you're used to seeing the public domain prints of the film ""Long John Silver,"" these TV episodes are comparable . . . watchable but certainly not ""high definition.""  The bottom line is that if you like Robert Newton, pirate movies and/or classic television from the 1950s, this 2-DVD collection is a must.

2128574,5,B0002W4UDO,"The incomparable Robert Newton reprises his role as the kindhearted pirate Captain Long John Silver! In this ""sequel"" to Treasure Island, apparently made by another studio for the purpose of cashing in on the success of the Disney original, we find Long John passing time in an old tavern/inn on a British controlled Caribbean island, where he awaits the start of his next adventure. We don't have to wait long, when an unfortunate pirate stumbles into the pub with news of Jim Hawkins and treasure on his dying tongue. The word is that the ruthless pirate ""El Toro"" Mendoza has kidnapped the local Governor's beautiful young daughter for ransom, and captured Jim Hawkins along with her for use as a cabin boy.  Around Jim's neck hangs a medallion that will help Long John find more of legendary Captain Flint's buried gold, still waiting to be discovered on Treasure Island. Immediately, Long John concocts a plan to get the kids back, and earn a little booty at the same time. He quickly confronts the Governor with his idea to help rescue the kids and capture El Toro, and in desperation, the Governor agrees to give Long John a chance.
  Putting his plan into action, Long John delivers the ransom money to El Toro in person, but he also attempts to strike a bargain with the cruel pirate. Long John tells El Toro that he'll send the Governor's warships in the wrong direction, so that he and El Toro would be free to sack the Governor's storehouse of valuables and rum.  When the two pirates arrive at the storehouse, El Toro attempts to betray Long John, but Long John has his men hidden away within the stored goods, and a grand pirate battle immediately ensues.  Long John's men soon have the upper-hand, and since he has told the children to run for their lives, he is now alone with El Toro and the other pirates, and free to reveal the next part of his plan. He sends the bad guys on their way, and takes all the booty for himself, blaming the ransacked storehouse on El Toro and his men when he arrives at the Governor's to receive a word of thanks for the rescue of his daughter. His plan a success, everyone has come out a winner except the evil El Toro, who has sworn revenge on Long John Silver.
  Now that Long John is reunited with his old shipmate, Jim, whom he hasn't seen in some time, though obviously not that long since Jim is still a boy, the old pirate is free to pursue the rest of Flint's treasure. His only obstacles are acquiring a ship and dodging Purity, the innkeeper woman who has plans to marry Long John and adopt Jim as their son. Before we know it, Long John has signed himself, Jim, and his crew of bloodthirsty pirates on as hands on The Thistle, bound for England, with secret plans to mutiny and return to Treasure Island! Little do they know of the dangers they will encounter along the way, including a confrontation with a cold-hearted pirate they had once left for dead!
  Long John Silver's Return to Treasure Island is a must own for any fan of the Disney original. If one can acquire a decent quality DVD or VHS (my VHS is quite a bit below par), it is definitely worth owning. It may not be as good as the original, but how can you go wrong with Robert Newton back as Long John, and a great new story with characters we already know and love! This is a great way to feed your love for carefree fun and adventure where the original film left off! Don't miss it!",1027555200,,3410,4.4432
