8098091,3,B000CEG06W,I was not thrilled with this movie and began to lose interest half way through it.  I found it a little too prdictable.,1375056000,,119,4.173913043478261
8098092,4,B000CEG06W,"It was a fun little movie.  But any rollercoaster nut would probably like movies like this.  Reminds me a little of the old 1977 film ""Rollercoaster"" with George Segal.  Worth a look, both of them.",1371340800,,197,4.571428571428571
8098093,5,B000CEG06W,The first time I saw this movie was on CBS when it appeared on TV a long time ago.  I love the action it has and the story about a father and his daughter trying to get over the loss of mother and wife.  To me it is a movie about letting go of your fears and love.,1305590400,2,264,3.5344827586206895
