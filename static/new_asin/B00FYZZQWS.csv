8619642,5,B00FYZZQWS,Wakefield Poole has created some interesting interpretations of parts of the bible that I found very enjoyable to watch. A must if you want to see some creative set design and directing. I especially liked the Bathsheba scene. That alone was worth the price of the DVD.,1389916800,5,269,4.74468085106383
8619643,5,B00FYZZQWS,"At last an original interpretation of The Bible. All film makers in the past have interpreted it literally resulting in mundane, over produced schlock spectacles. The Bible is an allegory, and, recognizing that, Wakefield Poole has skillfully taken three stories from the Old Testament and told them lyrically, humorously, and sensuously with beautiful bodies and tasteful soft core sex.

The extras on this beautifully restored DVD are a special treat. An audio commentary by Wakefield Poole himself, interviews with two of the stars Georgina Spelvin and Gloria Grant, and behind the scenes looks at the making of the film.

I couldn't have liked it more!",1388966400,2,656,5.238095238095238
8619644,5,B00FYZZQWS,"I have waited a long time for this film to show up on any home video medium. Happy to say the wait for the DVD was worth it. This is an avant garde masterwork by visionary director Wakefield Poole at the height of his powers. His re-imagining of three tales from the Bible is a fantastic fantasia of soft- core delights. Primarely a silent film,  it is gorgeously realized by a cast of actors one more dazzling than the next. 70's cult icon Bo White takes your breath away as Adam. The creation of man has never been more arousing. Red headed Caprice Couselle provides a virginal  Eve. Georgina Spelvin is comic perfection as Bathsheba, Ebony goddess Gloria Grant sensually seduces as Delilah and  the gorgeous hunk Brahm Van Zettan is a stunning Sampson.  The DVD has a  beautiful transfer by Vinegar Syndrome  and thanks to film historian Jim Tushinski, is  loaded  with extras, including naked screen tests and a audio commentary by Wakefield Poole himself.

In total, Bible provides a dream like landscape that will wash over the senses. This is a must for all fans of soft-core erotica from the 70's.",1388275200,7,1105,4.683937823834197
8619645,5,B00FYZZQWS,"When this film came out in 1974, audiences didn't know what to make of it. There is only one line of dialogue, it's choreographed to classical music, the nudity is frequent but the sex is tasteful and simulated. It was made by a former Broadway choreographer and director who was world famous for making artistic gay porn and it starred the biggest hardcore star of the 1970s - Georgina Spelvin. It's not porn, it's not sexploitation...it's ART. What??

The film is Poole's masterpiece, a gorgeous, lyrical re-telling of three Old Testament Bible stories, each filmed in a different style and packed with movie references (the famous breakfast scene in Citizen Kane is spoofed in the Bathsheba sequence, for example). Primarily, it's an homage to silent cinema - when, as Poole explains in the excellent introduction contained on this DVD, audiences dare not take their eyes off the screen for fear that they might miss something.

Bible was never put on video or DVD before, but Vinegar Syndrome has done an amazing job, restoring the film from original elements, so its visuals really shine. The disc also includes a wonderful commentary by Poole, new interviews with Georgina Spelvin and Gloria Grant (who plays the incredibly sexy Delilah), screen tests, and a vintage interview with Poole from a 1977 public access cable TV show.

What makes the telling of the Bible stories so interesting and unusual is that Poole decided to use the stories to explain why the women of the Bible did what they did. The Bible, as we know, casts many of its female characters as evil or a source of temptation. Poole turns everything around so we get the female characters' side of the story. The stand out is Georgina Spelvin. She's funny, poignant, and terribly cute as a pouting Bathsheba.

Lovers of Fellini, silent film, and the avant garde (think Kenneth Anger or Jack Smith or Pink Narcissus) will find something to love here. As will adventurous cinephiles and lovers of ballet and classical music. It really is an amazing experience.

And watch the director's introduction before watching the movie (that's one of the play options on the DVD). It will really help you appreciate this incredible movie even more.",1388188800,12,2208,4.924731182795699
8619646,1,B00FYZZQWS,"There's no dialogue, just some very muddy classical music, and the actors all look they're about to fall asleep. I was expecting something a bit John Waters-ish, but there's no humor, no originality, just some very basic nudity. I thought movies were more lively in 1973.",1387929600,5,271,4.913043478260869
8619647,1,B00FYZZQWS,"bad from first frame to last, slow to start, but never got off the mark. Georgina Spelvin as good as she always
is, couldn't save this turkey.",1387843200,3,142,4.296296296296297
