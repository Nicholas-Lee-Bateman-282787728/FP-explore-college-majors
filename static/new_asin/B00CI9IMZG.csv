8581984,5,B00CI9IMZG,"I recently bought the 10 disc set for $1.25 just to review it. I am an advanced/professional guitarist. I have had conventional guitar lessons. I can read music, read tab, and can also play by ear. I can only respond to the quality of the product, as I didn't buy it from the original Ralph Paul site. My take is that Ralph is a very good guitarist who genuinely enjoys teaching guitar. Yes, the course is a little unconventional, however, Ralph takes the time to show the student how to play what he's showing on the DVD. The approach is slow and methodical with repeated closeups of what he is teaching. Mr. Paul even points out in one of the DVDs that I own, that some guitar teachers might not appreciate his methods, however, I know exactly what he's doing, as I am also very well versed in music/guitar theory. Having said that, I can certainly see where beginners could get confused. Ralph's goal is to have the beginner be able to play and, therefore, that will encourage the student to practice. Many conventionally trained students quit because they can't play anything. So I believe that Ralph'sGuitar Made Easy encourages beginners to not only practice what he has taught them, but also to go on to even more training.",1519171200,,1230,4.621004566210046
