This is the DVD (or VHS at the time) that changed my mind about U2 and made me a life long fan.  Not to mention how incredibly hot Bono is when he's singing, ""Mysterious Ways.""  This DVD moves me in mysterious ways!!  Have a party sometime and watch it with your friends, LOUD!!!",1389571200,,365,4.388059701492537
