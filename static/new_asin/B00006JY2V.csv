8204272,5,B00006JY2V,"In this DVD, Ferry Corsten shows what he can do as one of the best DJs in the world.
It comes with a lot of content and the documentary is really good!",1266105600,,151,3.75
8204273,5,B00006JY2V,"a decade has passed since Ferry Corsten put the sound of Dutch trance on the global dance map pretty much single-handedly. He has conquered dance floors from England to Ibiza and storming into the UK's national charts in the process.

Yet ten years on and Corsten is still dedicated to pushing the trance sound forward for the next generation and reckons the genre is the healthiest it's been for years.  His latest offering, ""Backstage"" takes you around the world culminating in his legendary performance at his Full on Ferry event in his hometown of Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

""Backstage"" shares his unique experiences, his hopes, his dreams.  You're able to meet his team and his biggest fans that follow him all over.  The cd contains an outstanding documentary showing what really goes on backstage and of course the event itself:  Full On Ferry.  The performance is out of this world with several guests and guest DJS. Lange, Sander Van Doorn, Marcus Schossow, and Solarstone all make appearances.  Standout tracks include ""Twice in a Blue Moon"",""Feel You"", ""Visions of Blue"",and ""Made of Love"" featuring Betsie Larkin.

This DVD is flawless:  bass, beats, and arrangement work in perfect equilibrium with hugely infectious riffs.
Ferry's continual re-emergence is perfectly captured here on this impressively catchy DVD.",1265414400,,1329,5.226415094339623
8204274,4,B00006JY2V,"This is definitely a step up from the first Full on Ferry DVD. I was far more interested in seeing the documentary over the Full on Ferry event. The only reason this did not get five stars is that when it mentions guest DJs in the DVD, they don't actually get to mix on film. I would have liked to see more action from the guest DJs. Overall - great investment.",1259539200,,361,4.098591549295775
8204275,5,B00006JY2V,"I saw this at the Theaters after having gone to the concert and it was amazing. Weed is everywhere, ladies are dying to get with every rap artist in sight. It is like watchin a huge party.  I would like nothing more than to sit down with some Cobra and watch this documentary.",982022400,,276,4.2075471698113205
