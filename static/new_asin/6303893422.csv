7855099,5,6303893422,"Eyewitness Shark is one of a number of excellent videos made by this studio. The footage is absolutely breathtaking, even tranquil in some clips. As you would expect, the video is about the life history of the shark, and some myths along with it. It also explains that humans have always misunderstood these animals as cold- blooded killers.
  There is also some footage that may make this video unique. There is an actual scene of a Blue Shark drowning an innocent surfer. Whoa there Eyewitness! This film is not geared toward young children. It is made for people who seek a better understanding of the sea and its marvels.
  The film may be slightly, but insignificantly confusing at times. The direct switching of one scene to another without a long breath may confuse some who have a wavering attention span. (Just a precaution for other viewers.)
  However, if you are a scuba diver and love the sea, devour Eyewitness Shark and the unforgettable footage.",1087862400,3,961,4.829268292682927
