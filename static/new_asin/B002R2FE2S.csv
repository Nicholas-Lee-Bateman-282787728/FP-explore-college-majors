8378320,3,B002R2FE2S,"I enjoyed very much catching up with the legendary film that introduced THE DREAM OF OLWEN to the world.
This piece was played enthusiastically by gifted students of piano in parlours and front rooms around the English-speaking world. Charles Williams' music was often recorded on records and CDs, accompanied with the WARSAW CONCERTO, THE RED SHOES, SPELLBOUND CONCERTO and LONDON FANTASIA, all definitive popular works dating from the 1940s. So this was a special delight to discover at long last the film that established THE DREAM OF OLWEN.
How doubly disappointing to find that the Renown transfer is markedly inferior to what it should have been.

Not only does the monochrome image look muddy and lacking in sharpness when shown on a larger screen, but also the highlights of the image, the brightest areas, are ""burnt out"".
No amount of reducing the contrast levels will get rid of this overexposure of highlights. Despite the poor transfer, you can see the original photography was a fine example of excellent British studio lighting and decor that prevailed in quality productions. I don't accept that it was an inferior print; the overexposure of highlights indicates an inept transfer to DVD by Renown.

All the performances are very good, including that of Carol Raye, whom Australian audiences will recognise from her 1960s and 70s career in Australian television, including the legendary satirical MAVIS BRAMSTON SHOW",1524528000,,1432,5.194805194805195
8378321,4,B002R2FE2S,"The reason I purchased the movie was because of the music ""The Dream of Olwen"".  As a young girl, I would
hear it every night as the closing song for a radio program in the San Francisco Bay area that I liked to listen to.  The music touched me so much that I learned to play it on the piano.  Not long ago when I found out that it came from a movie, I could not wait to purchase and watch it.  It was a very interesting movie, well done for a movie back in the 1940's.  I am happy that I own it . I received the DVD in a timely manner .",1469232000,,537,3.675438596491228

8378324,4,B002R2FE2S,"While I Live is a story about a pianist/composer, Olwen, who dies tragically after nearly completing a tone poem called Dream of Olwen.  Her sister is sure that somehow Olwen will return.  It is primarily the music score that makes this story entertaining.

The haunting music Dream of Olwen can be found on YouTube and those who like this composition will probably enjoy the movie.  The title of the movie comes from a poem To a Siamese Cat by Michael Joseph.  The poem ends For while I live, you shall not die.  Part of the poem is used in the movie and it summarizes the story.

The technical quality of the movie is very good.  Only occasionally do artifacts of the old film appear on the screen.  It does appear, however, that four minutes of the movie are missing from the DVD.",1401408000,2,783,4.457746478873239
8378325,4,B002R2FE2S,"I first heard ""The Dream of Olwen"" on an old record many years ago and immediately loved it. The label said that it was from a film called ""While I Live."" I always wanted to see the picture. Eventually I bought a VHS tape of the movie and watched it. That tape was made from a heavily redacted version of the film that was made for television (to fit an hour). That version stunk. This DVD is the complete film. The plot is still improbable, but it is much better. The story centres on Julia Trevellian. Her sister Olwen composes music. Unable to complete ""The Dream of Olwen,"" Olwen arises one night and walks to the cliffs, where she falls. Julia is despondent. When a strange girl arrives at the house, Julia is convinced that Olwen has returned from the grave, especially when the stranger plays ""The Dream of Olwen"" on the piano. One minor quibble: there are a couple of places in the sound track where it seems that sounds were artificially augmented, such as the surf sounds in the opening scene.
The DVD is formatted for Region 0, PAL. It will not play on my DVD player, but it plays fine in the computer's DVD drive. If you play it in Windows, I suggest you use VLC media player and not WinDVD. The latter program can potentially mess up your DVD drive if it attempts to alter the region setting; VLC media player will not do that.",1391731200,5,1340,4.385542168674699
