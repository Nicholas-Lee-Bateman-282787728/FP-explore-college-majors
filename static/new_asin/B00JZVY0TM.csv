8654722,5,B00JZVY0TM,"i was an advid yoga person and haven't done it for sometime so I decided to pick up a beginner yoga tape, and I enjoyed Denise's ""You Can Do it! Beginners tape it brought me back to all the moves I used to do. It is awsome for new beginners it goes in order and not to fast. I love it. You can follow it as a beginner. I give this dvd a 5 star.
