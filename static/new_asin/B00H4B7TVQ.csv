quality of pictures but it's disappointing !!! That's a pity that I can't find any more Blu Ray movies of TINA TURNER",1411516800,6,345,4.164179104477612

I am a huge Tina fan and just found the sound to be a  poor quality.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Tina Turner: ONE LAST TIME Live in Concert was filmed at Wembley Stadium during the Twenty Four Seven Millennium Tour 2000, this is a state-of-the-art stage set, 18 cameras, one of the worlds directors David Mallet; combined with Tina Turners usual powerful performance and make this, and event never to be forgotten. It also shows a typical American giant spectacle and spared no expense. The best and the biggest are the categories in which Americans think obviously, when it comes to its foreign or self-presentation. The stage design is simply gigantic. The lightshow insanely expensive, especially from the special effects such as crane, hoist, explosions, fireworks and fire do not even talk.

We have a euphoric announcement by the celebrated American actor James Earl Jones, and supported by seven musicians, including John Miles, two backup singers and three dancers spreads the diva again from all their musical life before the well-humoured, appeared on masse audience. No matter what stage of this several decades spanning success story Turner Turner light up as part of the Gala, the reactions from the audience are always euphoric.

ONE LAST TIME includes an entire Tina Turner show from the era, and also bringing the native of Tennessee singer, as one knows it from her, even highly idiosyncratic versions of several numbers that are also known by other artists here. As befits this kind of occasion, Tina Turner plays tunes from throughout her career. From the Twenty Four Seven Millennium Tour 2000, we find four tracks: the title tune as well as Absolutely Nothings Changed; When the Heartache Is Over and Whatever You Need. We also get a mix of numbers from her solo years. Not surprisingly, 1984s comeback smash Private Dancer provides the most material, as it gives us five songs: Private Dancer; Whats Love Go to Do With It; Lets Stay Together; Better Be Good to Me and Help! We also discover We Dont Need Another Hero from the 1985 Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome soundtrack plus The Best off of the 1989s Foreign Affair CD Album.

For the most part, I felt the set included a nice variety of material. The appearance of the Twenty Four Seven Millennium Tour 2000, kept the show from becoming nothing more than a total oldies act, but she clearly knew what the audience wanted and she gave it to them. Since a lot of her more recent work has been pretty dull, thats a good thing. I respect artists who attempt to keep their shows lively, but the songs need to support their appearance.

None of the Twenty Four Seven Millennium Tour 2000 songs seemed tremendously memorable, but they came across more strongly than the Wildest Dreams efforts did. At least on this tour, Tina had the good sense to go out on top. Whereas Amsterdam ended on a somnambulant note, Twenty Four Seven Millennium Tour 2000 closed this concert with a bang that better suited Tinas fiery personality. For the video presentation of the concert, we found a good but unexceptional staging. Happily, the video offered a better balance of elements than did Amsterdam; also directed by David Mallet, the latter concentrated too highly on the dancers and Capello and appeared slightly bland. ONE LAST TIME did nothing inventive or original, but it captured the essence of the performance to a reasonably positive degree. But despite this, Tina Turner, is at least most authentic, the spectacle is always when Ms. Tina Turner concert is a no frills concept, but with the band included background singers share the stage and just sings. All in all it is just pure dynamic music!

Blu-ray Video Quality  Tina Turner: ONE LAST TIME Live in Concert had sharpness consistently seemed positive. A few wider shots came across as slightly soft, but those instances seemed minor. Overall, the image remained crisp and well defined. Jagged edges and moir&eacute; effects caused no significant problems, and I saw no signs of edge enhancement. One infrequently used overhead camera showed some jaggiest, but it only popped up a few times, so it wasn't a major issue. Source flaws seemed absent. I saw no video noise of digital artefacts, and the material remained nicely clean and clear throughout the concert. Contrast looked a little off at times, as parts of the show were somewhat too bright. This issue really did seem mostly related to the daytime factor; once it became dark, I saw less of those concerns. Black levels appeared acceptably deep and rich, and shadow detail was fine for the most part. Except for the mildly excessive brightness, those elements of the image were fairly well balanced. Ultimately, 'One Last Time' presented a good picture; it definitely could have been so much better, but it seemed sort of satisfying.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 5.1 DTS-HD-Master Audio quality sounded fairly solid. Vocals appeared natural and distinct. They featured a little stadium reverb to give us the correct sense of place, but the mixers didn't go nuts with this element, so Tina Turners voice remained crisp and warm. A few times when she Tina shouted at the crowd, her declarations sounded distorted, but that problem didn't affect her singing. All instruments seemed clear and bright, and they showed good fidelity. At times they got a little buried in the mix. especially since we heard that illogical crowd noise in the front, but usually the instruments came through effectively. Only some pyro effects brought it briefly to life; no musical elements came from the subwoofer. The mix still displayed decent low-end most of the time, but I felt it lacked the appropriate depth and oomph. Overall, the track remained quite good, and I had no major complaints with it, but it fell short of greatness.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Exclusive Backstage Interviews and Behind The Scenes Footage: ONE LAST TIME features only one extra, a program called Backstage With Tina. This 17-minute and 45-second program lacks much depth. It shows snippets of the show, a little behind the scenes material and shots of fans, and interview snippets with Tina. She discusses her career and her final tour, but she reveals very little that seems interesting or compelling. Overall, the piece offers a couple of decent moments but fails to deliver any substance. Despite those oddities, Tina Turners ONE LAST TIME Live in Concert offers a pretty solid affair. The concert itself shows Tina Turner in good voice and spirits during her farewell tour, and the video replicates the performance in a bland but acceptable manner. The Blu-ray features good but unexceptional picture and sound but lacks substantial extras. Nonetheless, ONE LAST TIME provides probably the best representation of Tina Turners live act currently available on this Blu-ray, and her fans should definitely give it a look.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: CELEBRATE! Here we have Eagle Vision presents another excellent musical programme, although this time it's not completely a concert presentation. CELEBRATE! is a Tina Turner 60th Birthday Party Concert that includes some of her biggest hits such as ""What's Love Got To Do With It."" I believe this was also broadcast as well, but here on this amazing Blu-ray we get the full experience with a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and 2.0 LPCM Stereo Audio. Also, between some of the songs we get footage of stars such as Mariah Carey wishing Tina Turner the best or interviews with Tina Turner.

Tina Turners CELEBRATE! Concert is the most indestructible original voice of soul music that celebrates six decades on planet earth! CELEBRATE! includes Tina Turners live 60th Birthday Concert, featuring duets with Bryan Adams. Also clips of archive performance with Cher, Rod Stewart, David Bowie and Mick Jagger. Plus a string of dedications to Tina Turner by a host of stars, including Will Smith, Cher, Ricky Martin, Oprah, Mariah Carey, Sting, Al Green, Bill Wyman, Phil Spector, Mark Knopfler, Bob Geldof, Paul McCartney, David Bowie, Annie Lennox, Dolly Parton and Bono and The Edge. Intercut with interviews with the birthday girl herself and this is true celebration of Tina Turner at her best.

Tina Turner has been a remarkable talent in rock and roll for quite some time. In 1999, there was a concert in London to celebrate what was then her 60th birthday. This amazing Blu-ray release is a fantastic showcase for not only Tina Turners talent, but an incredible line-up of well-known names that joined her to celebrate. As Tina Turner takes the stage, she remarks ""It's Thunderdome all over again"" and that's an apt comparison for the venue. Tina is in a stage at the centre of the audience with the musicians behind her, but it's nearly a circular setting. Tina Turner has backup dancers, and her band includes Bryan Adams as well as the backing of the Royal Symphony Orchestra. Tina Turner is also joined by the London Gospel Choir for the song Whatever You Need.

Is it a good concert? I really think Tina Turner doesn't know how to not put on a bad concert. I think there are hardly any entertainerswho gives as much heart and soul on stage as she does, and that certainly shows again here in this remarkable performance as a very talented group of musicians and dancers provide additional support. Celebrate! is a damn fine birthday concert, but seems a little too stage managed and, therefore, lacks some of the passion we've come to expect from Tina Turner. If you've never seen Tina Turner live, you need to see this as the next best thing. Definitely a great bonus for her amazing dedicated fans.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The video quality of the concert is outstanding as well in comparison to most other concerts that have been released on inferior DVDs. The 1.78:1 presentation is actually anamorphic, and the picture quality is often fantastic during the concert, with perfect sharpness and great detail. Colours are also excellent, with warm colours from the lights washing over the stage, but still looking crisp on this awesome Blu-ray presentation. I didn't notice anything in the way of problems such as pixilation or shimmering. But overall it is totally sharp, well-defined presentation that was a pleasure to view. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  As the programme goes back and forth between concert footage and clips about Tina, the sound for the other footage is nothing elaborate. The concert footage, on the other hand, sounds absolutely fantastic. Offered in both 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio and the 2.0 LCPM Stereo Audio, this was an instance where I felt that the DTS-HD version sounded noticeably, if not hugely, fuller and richer sound. I found the Dolby Digital version slightly lacking warmth and a little less comfortable to listen to. Tina's fantastic voice sounds natural and clear, and the music comes through very well. Surrounds are often just used for crowd noise; the majority of music is via the front speakers. Although I probably wouldn't put this in the list of most impressive concert for audio presentation, but it certainly delivered very pleasing audio quality and I found it extremely enjoyable.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Celebrate! Promo Videos [1] When The Heartache Is Over. [2] Whatever You Need. Biography. Photo Gallery.

Finally, the sound for both gigs are selectable in either 5.1 DTS-HD-Master Audio or 2.0 LPCM Stereo Audio, which you have to go to the Menu, as it automatically selects 2.0 LPCM Stereo Audio. The sound is phenomenal and a superb loud-blast by re-mastering by Eagle Vision. Both shows have been by the film-material re-optimised the best way. The ONE LAST TIME Concert from Wembley Stadium at the time it was recorded by the best cameras available in 2000, though it has a bit of weakness by the sharpness of the pic and also by the colours. But off course both shows are a delight, but in my opinion the CELEBRATE! Concert is the best the bunch by far, but despite this, Eagle Vision has done a brilliant job for what was available. Respect! Highly Recommended!

8629800,5,B00H4B7TVQ,"A great double-feature concert extravaganza, now on Blu-ray Disc!

Both programs are featured on a single disc and contain nearly 4 hours of content! This set includes a full-color booklet with both the original and somewhat improved artwork of the initial releases, and the disc begins with a very nice menu; listing both programs, as well as multiple chapters for each song and concert highlight. The quality of the sound and video, although not quite as good as traditional Blu-ray Discs, far exceeds that of the original DVD versions. For those complaining about the quality, I would ask you to re-examine the label. That's why it's listed as ""SD Blu-ray""! (SD ""standard definition""). It's certainly not like the label is trying to pull one over on you.

That said, I would highly recommend this title for both its content and the amount of care that went into presenting a piece of history, that is now approaching it's second decade since original release.

I only hope, that despite some of the complaints, Eaglevision releases a few more of Tina's classic concerts as double-features, such as ""Tina Turner Live - Private Dancer Tour"" (1985) and ""Break Every Rule"" (1987).",1482364800,2,1179,4.974619289340102

I am watching the concert One Last Time and here is what can say about it

Picture quality is good considering this was shot in 2000 with non HD cameras. Please remember Blu-Ray was introduced in 2006 so I wasn't expecting quality what we get today. Close up shots are amazing and pretty clean. Far away shots are petty bad but don't forget the cameras used!!

Audio quality is superb, PCM 2.0 or DTS-MA 4.1 works great and is the best we can get and I don't think it will get any better then this, I really believe this because I use Yamaha Aventage AV Receiver with DefTech speakers :)

Overall I think it was worth every penny because it is upgraded in everyway possible and it's worth having in your collection. Please go out and buy this because you won't regret this I promise you, just make sure you have a decent setup.
Good Luck & Enjoy

Here now is the SD Blue ray edition of that concert paired with the SD B-ray edition of the ""Celebration"" concert. Celebration is a compilation of several Tina concerts interspersed with interviews granted by famous artists  - Al Green, Keith Richards, Cher, Bill Wyman among them. It includes concert footage from her years with Ike Turner. If you love to collect concert videos this release belongs among your collection. Tina rocks!

This disc will play on your Region A/1 (US) blue ray disc player despite the seller's warning. If it does not it's your player's firm ware that may need updating (contact the manufacturer).

Considering that the concert disc is enhanced DVD and not actual blue ray I find the picture quality to be very satisfactory. With the audio selecting the DTS option does not generate sound in my center speaker when playing ""One Last Time"". But using the two channel LPCM option does.",1432684800,3,1016,4.895348837209302
