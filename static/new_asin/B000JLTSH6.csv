8260710,5,B000JLTSH6,"Today I got some Indie movies in the mail that I ordered off Amazon, I purchased these movie after reading the story lines and good reviews, so I watched 2 movies back to back ( A COUPLE OF DAYS AND NIGHTS and FLOURISH) one of these movies should be a Film School what not to do when making an Indie movie(A COUPLE OF DAYS AND NIGHTS) I might have to burn this DVD so a dumpster diver doesn't ruin his enjoyment of his dirty tuna fish sandwich by watching this movie, and(FOURISH) on the other hand is a perfect example of a what a great Indie Comedy can be.

  The cover of DVD posted on Amazon of FLOURISH is miss leading, when I got my DVD it has Jenifer Morrison looking strange as Gabby Winters with a caption under picture saying ""Keep It Realistical"", now that's more like it. Gabby Winters reminds me of some odd, off, stoner chick you might run across behind the counter of a fast food joint late at night, her accident my have contributed to why she comes off the way she does, I have to say I don't watch the tv show House but Jennifer Morrison came out of no where with me, what a perfect performance, acting perfection.

  Interesting, funny story, it keeps you guessing and laughing till the end, even then you have questions of whats is true in the end, as intended by the ambiguous, creative scrip, I really appreciate all the five and four star reviewers for turning me on to this Movie, now I got to go address my issues with the reviewers of that other Movie.........",1294012800,2,1486,4.327338129496403
8260711,5,B000JLTSH6,"Jennifer Morrison shows surprising depth in this unusual, quirky, darkly humorous film. The plot travels all over the map, figuratively speaking, and keeps you guessing/wondering how will all come together in the end. Definitely worth a look.",1226361600,8,242,5.5675675675675675
8260712,5,B000JLTSH6,This sleeper should wake people up soon...a fun mystery with awesome performances by Leighton Meester and Jennifer Morrison. A good time...and smart too.,1213833600,3,153,5.695652173913044
8260713,5,B000JLTSH6,"Okay, so let's face it: when you start to watch an independent film you immediately know that it's not going to be a movie that is going to have neatly-wrapped plot lines.  You also know that it is not going to be a simple film from beginning to end.  This is just how the independent movie market works.  With that said, I must state that I really enjoyed this film.

I'll admit that the reason I wanted to watch ""Flourish"" is because I am a big Jennifer Morrison fan and have come to hate the way the writers of ""House"" write her character Dr. Allison Cameron.  I knew that if Morrison was given the chance to portray a character that was angst-ridden and not such a one-dimensional character that she would excel and indeed she did.

The movie starts off with Gabrielle (Morrison) being filmed at a psychiatric ward for a documentary.  Throughout the film Gabrielle is telling the story of what happened the night Lucy, the teen she was babysitting, disappears and ultimately winds up dead.  We are shown a cast of eccentric characters.  We have Gabrielle who uses vocabulary which you may think sounds right and sounds smart, but is gramatically incorrect.  Words like ""realistical"" and ""logistically"" are frequently used in the film.  Other characters include Gabi's roommate who's in search of her stolen car to go run errands, the roommate's boyfriend who thinks his fiance is cheating on him, and a host of other eccentric, quirky, and downright entertaining characters that make this film one of the funniest indie films I have seen to date.

The thing about this film is not where it ends up, but the journey it takes to end up where it does.  Is this a film that you're going to get from one viewing? No.  Will multiple viewings help?  Probably not.  Does this detract from the all-around pleasure of viewing the film?  Absolutely not.  This film is filled with a mystery that will keep you on your toes and a dark humor that will make you chuckle and possibly laugh out loud multiple times.

Kudos to Jennifer Morrison for portraying a character that's supposed to be crazy and extremely flawed and making viewers relate to her due to her excellent acting.

So, bottom line, watch this film with an open mind you will definitely not be upset you watched it.  You might even enjoy the chaotic journey and relate to it.  If anything it will make you relieved to know that you can't be even half as dysfunctional as these wonderfully problematic characters.",1201824000,13,2466,4.672853828306264
8260714,5,B000JLTSH6,my friends and i really enjoyed this movie.  it had a great storyline and was really funny.,1190419200,3,91,4.352941176470588
8260715,4,B000JLTSH6,"Jennifer Morrison (HOUSE) plays ""Gabrielle"" in this comical/suspenseful movie with miscommunications and mishaps.  Amazon does a good job of telling the facts of the movie, so I'm not going to re-tell it here.  Jennifer does an excellent job in playing this woman, who is note quite with it, in such a way that she is funny, sympathetic, and draws you in to her own little world.  The cast works well together in trying to tell Gabrielle's story as she sees it.  If you watch this movie with the intention of trying to figure it out as you watch it, don't.  Keep in mind that Gabrielle is telling this story as she sees it and it resembles what a dream would be like.  Everything is explained in the end in Gabrielle's interview.  The guy who plays ""Carter"" in this double-role is hysterical.  When I watched this movie a second time, I found it even more hysterical because I was trying to make more sense of it the first time rather than just let it entertain me.  Of course ""Eddie"" (Jesse Spencer-HOUSE) does an excellent job playing his character, who, through misinformation, believes his fiance is cheating on him.  I'm still trying to figure out how his karate belt went from red to green but figure it is from the amount of vehicles he has ""beaten up"" on his way to find the guy ""doing"" his girl, advanced him through the karate belt colors.  ""Bridget"", Eddie's fiance, does an excellent job in trying to deal with Gabrielle, as well as ""Lucy"" the spoiled bratty teenager poor Gabrielle has to deal with.  Let's not forget ""Mary"" who is trying to be a good Christian but has a difficult time between good and evil.  Congrats to all involved in putting together this movie.  It is a little different than what you normally see, which is what I think is the interest.  The more you watch it, the funnier this movie gets.  Jennifer Morrison is just outstanding.  Good job Kevin Palys in putting all this together.  I hope this movie gets the recognition it deserves!",1167955200,21,1971,4.582857142857143
