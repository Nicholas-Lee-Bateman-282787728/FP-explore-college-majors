8750619,5,B00UGQ4BAI,"I have loved this movie from the very first time I ever saw it. The story line is great; as two most unusual pair of people learn to care for each other. Two actors I truly love. This movie is still prudent today as the day it was produced. I finally have it in my DVD library to watch whenever I want. I never tire seeing it over and over again. It is going up to my cabin, so I can watch it every time I visit Big Bear. If you like Morgan Freeman, be sure to add this to your collection of his movies.",1529539200,2,503,3.8
