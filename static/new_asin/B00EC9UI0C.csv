5901529,5,B00EC9UI0C,This is a really good show not to mention a really funny show. Michael J Fox was always very funny and in my opinion the star of the show. Ill never understand why the parents were put ahead of him on the opening credits. Anyway as I said this is a good show. You should get it.,1383436800,3,278,3.8947368421052633
5901530,4,B00EC9UI0C,"I was disappointed years ago when Season 1 came out on DVD without the pilot version of the first episode.  There is a version of the pilot with a different opening theme, different scenes, and different music.  This ought to have been a bonus on the DVD set.  Could that possibly be one of the bonus items on the new disc?  If it is, I can change from 4 to 5 stars, although since this isn't released yet and I don't have it, why is amazon letting me review it?  My star rating is not valid, but I had to select something in order for it to let me ask this question.",1381881600,5,567,4.026785714285714
5901531,5,B00EC9UI0C,I am so happy they finally came out with this; especially since they now released season 6 and 7 on dvd. I also heard on the imdb message board that this will come with the family ties frame thing that shows in the opening sequence and a special bonus disc! I will surely be buying this.,1377475200,7,287,4.142857142857143
8603727,5,B00EC9UI0C,What a great show! I absolutely love the show! Seasons 1-7 with the Keaton family. The characters are all great. My favorite characters are Mallory and Skippy. My favorite season is Season 1. My favorite episode is in Season 3. :) 1982-1989 rocked!,1460678400,,248,4.790697674418604
8603728,3,B00EC9UI0C,Great DVD series. The box is a piece of art in itself. However US region code so cannot be used on standard European DVD player,1415750400,,127,4.12
8603729,5,B00EC9UI0C,"This is an amazing Set
For years i was always a Fan of this wonderful Show. When i discovered this Edition of the Family Ties Show i was not sure if
i should order it.
I have already a few Season DVDs of Family Ties and also the price was what i was thinking of.
But when this complete Set arrived i was stunned and amazed of how wonderful this Set is.
Also the love of details they invested to this DVD Collection and above all the Idea of bringing it in a Photo Album.

As soon i opened the package i knew it was worth every cent.
Not only as a Fan of this Show but also as a big DVD Collector. This became instantly the Top 3 Items in my Collection. ( have more than 1000 DVDs/Blurays)
In this Set there are all the Seasons plus a Bonus Disc which i didn't watched yet.
It is made up like a real Photo Album which was in the 80s of course in every household and it has a huge nostalgia touch to it.
And this Photo Album looks really like a real one. From the size and the color.
Every Page of this Album includes a Season of the Show. There are 2 Discs for each Season on every page you turn. You can easily put out the Discs. The pages are very colorful and have pictures of the Season.
And what i liked most was that an  Episode Guide is included on every page for each Season. I am still positively surprised how well they made this DVD Set.

A definitive must have for every Fan of this Show and for the Fans of the 80s Shows on TV.
There is only one thing what i critizise. Why not bring it on Bluray??

This is a great Set, worth every Cent and made with a great idea and love to it.
I definitely recommend it.",1413590400,27,1619,3.941896024464832

8603731,5,B00EC9UI0C,Absolutely love this series. Brings me back to when I was a kid and watching with my family. Great packing concept with this collection. Totally worth the investment.,1402876800,4,166,4.964285714285714
8603732,5,B00EC9UI0C,"This box set of family ties is beautifully laid out, and very detailed. It also has many pictures throughout the entire
album of clips from the many different episodes. This family ties box set does not miss a trick.
If you liked family ties growing up, then you will absolutely love this DVD box set of family ties.
Outstanding product, I definitely recommend it.",1399248000,11,364,4.703125
8603733,5,B00EC9UI0C,"We watched Family Ties when we lived in Hawaii between 1985 and 1988. I bought the first series last autumn, to check it out and see if we still thought it was funny. It was, we enjoyed it just a much now as then, so decided to get the whole series, unfortunately this was only available in Region 1, however my son bought me an ""All Regions"" dvd player for Christmas so no problem. We now have about 60+ hours of pleasure to look forward to. We are now well into the second series and it is still great.",1390867200,7,504,4.101010101010101
8603734,5,B00EC9UI0C,"This is a wonderful set for fans of the series, it was a surprise Christmas gift for my daughter and she was thrilled to get the complete set as well as the extras, and loved the ""photo album"" format.",1388448000,2,200,4.153846153846154
8603735,5,B00EC9UI0C,"Used to watch this TV show back in the day, love the family the characters created.  I decided to buy this complete set because I love the way it's packaged and it seems when a great creative packaging occurs of a series, it's only available for a while before it's gone, this was totally worth the price, very happy with it, great show and big fan of Michael J. Fox!",1388361600,5,367,4.242857142857143
8603736,3,B00EC9UI0C,This DVD set looks similar to the previously released individual seasons of Family Ties with a bonus disc included. The DVDs are possibly all in cardboard sleeves.,1384560000,,163,5.074074074074074
