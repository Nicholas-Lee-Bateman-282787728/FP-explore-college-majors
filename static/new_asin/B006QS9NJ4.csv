8503128,2,B006QS9NJ4,"A very disappointing film.
It moves very slowly, the plot doesn't hold your interest, and the music at times is too loud to easily hear the dialogue.
The church leader refused to listen to the church elders and insisted they were attacking him, which was not true.
The topic of a church leader who stops believing in God is an important one, but this movie doesn't handle it well.
It does show the value of the church leader having a friend stick with him when he's deeply hurting.
This is a movie not worth seeing.",1381795200,,515,4.431578947368421
8503129,5,B006QS9NJ4,This a bold & powerful movie that gives the audience a great prospective into the world of ministry & the challenges that God's Shepard may face & the battle to battle back from the breaking point. Good movie!,1381190400,,209,4.526315789473684

8503131,5,B006QS9NJ4,"This is a film of how we as people truthfully need to live our lives, not to impress those around us, but to rather at least be as honest with ourselves in everyday life and the those around us. We all can learn and grow from each other if we would just give it an honest effort.
Awesome work by Jeff,Preston, Heidi and Sadie. This is a MUST have Film . M.M.J FH Az.",1327795200,6,366,3.9594594594594597
