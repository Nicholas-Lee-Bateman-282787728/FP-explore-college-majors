1834123,5,B00008AOWU,"Ignore the reviews bashing this program for recycling footage from the BBC Walking With series.  Of course it's recycled, that is EXACTLY what the package says!  It was reworked into a Saturday morning show for a younger audience.  And it succeeds wonderfully at reaching that target audience.  This show is great for young kids, about 3-8 years old.  Hopefully, they will be able to eventually also enjoy the more academic original series of programs.  But these are more accessible and I am thrilled to have them be preferred viewing over many of the other programming available on TV.  Definitely, if you have a young paleontologist on your shopping list, this is a must!",1112140800,83,674,4.911504424778761
1834124,5,B00008AOWU,I bought this DVD thinking that my 3 year old may watch bits of it.  He LOVES this DVD and asks all the time to watch it.  He has learned lots of new things about dinosaurs and quotes segments from this.,1105660800,3,203,3.926829268292683
1834125,4,B00008AOWU,"We first bought and repeatedly watched the BBC/Kenneth Branagh version. The kids (ages 4.5 and 2.5) stumbled across the Prehistoric Planet/Ben Stiller version on Discovery Kids Channel. THEY love it. It's not for adults really, in my opinion. It is a lite version of the BBC series and I think it's a good marketing move that they refashioned the footage into a whole new series for a different demographic.

The fun parts are the slangy language, the playing card graphics introducing the different creatures, and the new stories about the action on screen. Sometimes the creatures get nicknames from Stiller (and later Christian Slater) and I think my kids watch it in a different way than the BBC version, which by the way they also still watch.

I rate this good for kids.",1098144000,6,776,4.827067669172933
1834126,2,B00008AOWU,I was extremely dissapointed with this program and sold it.  It had the same footage as Walking With Dinosaurs and the narration was annoying to say the least.  I will not have this in my DVD Library.  Get Walking With Dinosarus and Walking With Prehistoric Beasts.  They are much better and well worth the money and the time.  They can be viewed over and over again.,1066521600,25,367,4.5

1834133,3,B00008AOWU,It is not for the adult mind. It is mostly for children. If you want to buy something for your kids this is the thing. It is taken from 'Walking with Dinosaurs'.,1399766400,,161,4.0625
1834134,3,B00008AOWU,This rating has nothing to do with the seller.  I received this promptly and in good condition.  The content however was lackluster at best.  Jurassic Park was made in 93 BBC could have done way better than what they did.  Granted BBC isn't known for great graphics.  Ben Stiller isn't made for narration and shouldnt do it.  He sounded bored and his inflections were terrible.  I guess that's what happens when you only do it for the money.  Much better programs out there.,1394064000,,474,4.626506024096385

There are scenes of carnivores eating other dinos, so if your little one is more sensitive to that sort of thing than mine, this may not be the movie for you.

1834144,4,B00008AOWU,"this is 'walking with dinosaurs' the show from 2002 redune in 2008 for discovery kids channel. It has a approach leveled directily at smaller children. I agree that the box says that this is in fact reusing the 'walking with dinosaurs"" footage. It's important to realize that wwd was a international sensation when it came out. And since then many shows have come out with similiar graphics and style. Although todays mainly are 100% computer graphics and this had animatronix or puppets in it too. Ben stiller is excellent and very kid friendly as the narrator in this repackaging. You also get 3-d glasses to look at some pictures in extra features section. The episodes are not three d though. I have walking with dinosaurs and it's still great to see this redone and around for younger viewers. Older viewers will want to own walking with dinosaurs or even the 1990's show 'paleoworld"" which isn't on dvd sadly.  Still if you have younger kids this will fit the bill nicely.",1329004800,,978,4.752941176470588
1834145,5,B00008AOWU,"My daughter watched this show a few years ago on Animal Planet.  They stopped showing it and she was devastated!  Santa brought this and, at age 7 now, she still loves it!",1327104000,,171,4.3125
1834146,5,B00008AOWU,My son loves dinosaurs and has almost every DVD there is. This one is one of the best. Learn alot and keeps a 4 year old watching so must be interesting,1327017600,,152,3.935483870967742
1834147,1,B00008AOWU,"I bought this for the birthday of a six year old girl. She loved it ..... until. A scene comes on where a predetory dinosaur kills, and eats a little baby dinosaur. Complete with flesh dangling from it's jaws. That was it. She freaked out! And that was the end of the movie. My $$$ (and present) into the garbage. AND what should have been an enjoyable and educational experience was lost. If you are making things for kids, leave out baby animal killing and the blood and guts!!!",1315612800,4,480,4.404494382022472
1834148,4,B00008AOWU,"My kids are Ben Stiller fans so his narration made it entertaining.  It is a very educational video for kids especially with interests for dinosaurs.  If your child does not have an interest for dinos, I suggest purchasing other videos that do not have as much narration and more action.",1315008000,,287,4.72
1834149,5,B00008AOWU,"Before purchasing any items here on Amazon, I always read reviews (I love this feature).  I appreciate informative, insightful reviews of the item.  That said, ratings based on ""slow shipping"", ""bad sellers"" or ""poor service"" do not help me.  I like to know about the actual product.  Ultimately I DID order this DVD based on the many [helpful] reviews - both positive and negative - especially the ones from other toddler parents.  One particular review that finally sold me was by ""Alexis N."":  ""ignore bashing"", ""reworked for younger audience"", ""great for young kids"".  Just what I was looking for!

My 3-year-old son is enamored with dinosaurs, sharks and reptiles.  We recently took a loooong road trip and I wanted something to keep him entertained during possible boring stretches.  Boy, did this keep him more than occupied!  I cannot say enough good things about this DVD.  Unexpectedly, not only was he entertained, but he learned SO much! In fact, he has taught both Mom & Dad more than we ever knew about them. :0)  My son appreciates the fact that it isn't ""cartoony"" (he says he likes ""real ones Mommy, not pretend"") and Mom likes that it is not gory or scary.

If you are looking for a realistic dinosaur series without the blood & guts, this is it.  For the older, elementary school-aged child, it does not use overly child-like terms but at the same time, it is still narrated in a way that a much younger [pre-K] child could follow along.  I was very impressed when my 3-year-old told me all about the Liopleurodon and how it lived in the ""Jurassic"".  So he thinks ""Jurassic"" is a city in ""Dino World"", heh, he's only 3! :0)  Admittedly, I had never heard of the Liopleurodon and honestly had chalked it up to a toddler's active imagination or at least, a problem pronouncing the actual species.  Come to find out, he had pronounced it correctly and it existed!  I am delighted that he has learned so much from a DVD.  And bottom-line:  he absolutely LOVES the series and enjoys it immensely, as evidenced in his watching it over and over and over and over.  It was the ONLY DVD he continually asked for the entire 2-day drive!  And he still watches/asks for it, unlike the many other toys/games/DVDs we've shelved, *sigh*.  I highly recommend this series for any budding Paleontologist and/or Dino-enthusiast in the toddler/elementary school age range (or an amateur, Dino-clueless adult like myself, haha).  Kudos BBC!",1285027200,5,2438,4.786570743405276
1834150,5,B00008AOWU,Bought this product for a 3-year old who loves dinosaurs.  Was mesmerized the entire movie.  The really good news was that I enjoyed it as well.  Definitely a keeper for someone that has kids who love dinosaurs!,1280534400,,211,4.648648648648648
1834151,1,B00008AOWU,Children are not stupid. They can understand many concepts when put clearly and visually. Get walking with dinosaurs. It is excellent.,1266537600,5,134,5.428571428571429
1834152,5,B00008AOWU,"If your child is in the dinosaur-obsessive phase as my son is, this is totally worth buying. The simulated dinosaur action is quite amazing - looks pretty real most of the time, and Ben Stiller's narration, which sounds half ad-libbed, is reasonably entertaining for the grownup in the room. I expect we'll be watching this many more times.",1263686400,,340,4.879310344827586
1834153,5,B00008AOWU,My grandson and I loved this DVD.  It was well made. The creatures looked real.  The story was told in a way that was easily understood by my 8 year grandson.,1255219200,,158,4.064516129032258
1834154,5,B00008AOWU,"I get this movie for a friend's son who just love this movie.  I get for his birthday.  He opened the present and was surprised and was excited about it.  He love the gift.  He didn't have any complaints about the DVD.  It was in good shape.  I am willing to buy from this seller again.  I receive the DVD as quickly as possible after I ordered it.  This I appreciate it very much because I had to get the DVD before his birthday. This happened, so I was happy about this.  Thanks again!",1239753600,,487,4.095744680851064

1834156,5,B00008AOWU,"My grandson has so many movies on Dinos. This is very Basic and keeps it simple. Takes you thru  all the time periods. And for this price you cant go wrong.
I would also say to get Perhistoic Park and the Ultimate DVDs.",1236038400,,219,4.093023255813954
1834157,5,B00008AOWU,"The only thing wrong with this video is that it's too short! The narration is great, and the action is thrilling. No boring scientists talking, talking, talking.  : )

Warning for the very young or very sensitive: There are several (tastefully executed, pardon the pun) scenes of predator dinos killing their prey, which is sometimes eggs or baby dinos. But, hey! That's life, even in the Jurassic.

My 3 boys (age 6-11) LOVE this video and watch it repeatedly.",1233964800,,461,4.810126582278481

1834162,5,B00008AOWU,"I can actually sit and watch these with my kids - they're pretty entertaining and informative!

1834165,4,B00008AOWU,I watched this last night - it does exactly what it says on the tin;a slightly dumbed-down 'street' version of the original BBC series Walking with Dinosaurs ably talked up by Ben Stiller notably with some of the more gruesome scenes edited out for the younger audience.  Given children's general fascination with all things ante-diluvian it is probably over-egging the prehistoric pudding to have this as well as Walking with Dinosaurs but perhaps for the very young or the ungifted child this would be a more accessible introduction to 'the lost world'.,1200528000,,555,5.032608695652174
1834166,2,B00008AOWU,"I wish I had read the other reviews before I bought this video!  My son is 9 and has been an avid fan of Walking With Dinosaurs since he was 3, so this video has nothing new for him--so disappointing!  If I had known it was a redo of WWD I definitely would not have bought it.  Would not recommend it for anyone who has the entire Walking With collection, as we do!",1198886400,,365,3.9726027397260273
1834167,2,B00008AOWU,"How can we make more money out of our excellent dinosaur series?  Let's take bits & pieces of it, mush it all together & get a big name to do the voice-overs!  If you have not already watched the other dinosaur shows in this series, fling this one on the garbage heap & get the really good ones.  This was not very good.  My son, the resident dinosaur expert, watched it for ten minutes, took it out & put Walking With the Dinosaurs back in.  He put it on the library return pile immediately.  I'd have to agree with his review.  Due to the excellence of the other series, it can't be completely terrible, but it sure comes close!",1185235200,,630,4.243697478991597

It gets a little old for mom and dad, but the kids have not gotten tired of it yet.  It is high quality, good information, and entertaining.  It is by no means National Geographic, but it is great for kids.  We have really enjoyed it.

1834170,1,B00008AOWU,"I have not purchased this volume but I have seen pieces of it on cable.  I would agree with those who gave it a very low grade because (at least the brighter) children are smart enough to follow the ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" series which has much better naratives.  When I was a child I would not have liked the stupid jokes in this series.  But I understand that challenged children who need a meaningless stream of audio distraction to hold their attention probably aren't going to learn much anyway and their parents (who gave this volume high marks) might want to keep them entertained for a while just to keep them out of trouble.  Those of you who have intelligent children would do them a great service by purchasing the ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" series for them instead.  They will become our future paleontologists.",1183334400,5,822,4.72027972027972
1834171,5,B00008AOWU,this version of the popular dinosaur dvd's is great for children and adults alike.  ben stiller does a very good job narrating for the school age sect.  unlike some of the other dvd's in the series this one will not frighten younger children.,1174867200,5,242,4.604651162790698
1834172,5,B00008AOWU,"Yes, this series is an edited version of the the original BBC series called Walking with Dinosaurs. However, in the original grown-up BBC series the dinos spend a lot of time eating their own young and dying tragic deaths (if you ask me the original dwells exceedingly on made-up tragic storylines). Prehistoric Planet very wisely edits out some of the more disturbing chaos and destruction of the original while still leaving plenty of chomping and meat eating to satisfy and inform the children. If your child is old enough to handle the nastier realities of pre-historic life in full color then by all means buy the original Walking with Dinos and Walking with Prehistoric Beasts--they are wonderful. If you have a younger child who just wants to see the magic of dinos coming ""alive"" without nightmares and anxiety then the Prehistoric Planet version is a great thing.",1169164800,32,872,4.938775510204081
1834173,3,B00008AOWU,"Prehistoric Planet is really just BBC's Walking with Dinosaurs but for kids. Now the question is which version is the best? Well, obviously it's Walking with Dinosaurs and I have always loved this program, but I did enjoy Prehistoric Planet when I was younger. The facts are simpler and easier for kids to understand and there's like a hundred lame wise-cracks by Ben Stiller. But hey, it's for kids and they'll probably like it but when they get older it's going to be on the shelf more often. Prehistoric Planet was aired on the Discovery Kids network and around ten minutes are edited out of each episode for syndication, and this DVD includes six twenty minute episodes. They are;

""Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" which is set in the late Triassic period, ""Jurassic Giants"" and ""Jurassic Beach"" are both set in the late Jurassic period, and the last three ""King of the Skies"", ""Dinosaurs of the Ice Forest"" and ""Death of the Dinosaurs"" are set throughout the Cretaceous period. Also included with this set are a few extras and a few DVD-ROM dinosaur games for the kids.

It's a safe bet that kids will like Prehistoric Planet, but if they want to learn more about dinosaurs Walking with Dinosaurs is for you.",1165795200,2,1204,4.701421800947867

7981283,5,B00008AOWU,"Excellent educational content with a narrative in each episode following a specific species as it lived and interacted with others. This reuse of 3D animation from Walking With Dinosaurs benefits from the narration by Ben Stiller. It follows a documentary style without cutting away to specialists or fossils, aiding immersion into a prehistoric world.

Walking With Dinosaurs is far superior to this DVD. The ""younger, hipper voiceover by actor Ben Stiller"" was for me, annoying. There were fart jokes, and other commentary that I don't want my children to repeat. The whole documentary is just Walking With Dinosaurs film re-cut, there is no new  footage.
