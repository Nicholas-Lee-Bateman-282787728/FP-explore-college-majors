4099601,5,B0039ZF8LY,It has been more than 25 years since I visited Israel.  This DVD provides a look at not only the past but the present and future of this fascinating country.  Truely an exhilarating DVD in the Visions series.,1355184000,4,208,4.447368421052632
4099602,4,B0039ZF8LY,"I was looking for a DVD that would show modern-day Israel, instead of just showing deserts and the ruins of ancient cities -- so I bought this DVD to show to resident's of a local Senior Center. While the scenes of Israel are magnificent, and the background music adds a nice ambiance, the music is - at times - so loud you can hardly focus on what is being shown.",1348704000,2,364,4.214285714285714
4099603,4,B0039ZF8LY,"Like the whole Vsions series this was a great video production. I was just a little disappointed because I was expecting more in the way of Holy Land visits. There are some but not what I was expecting. It says ""Israel"" and that is what you see and very good shots of the major cities. It is one you may look at over and over but I felt it cover areas I was not that interested in. I will be looking for another dvd with more Holy Land oriented scenes which I will watch more often.",1338422400,7,482,4.03125
4099604,5,B0039ZF8LY,"This is so fabulous.  It is my dream to take a trip to Israel but was hoping I could find a travelogue that could give me a good idea of what it's like, not only the religious sites but the modern city.  This is it.  You will be astonished at what the Jewish people have done with this country.  It is not only historic but modern and beautiful as well.  I highly recommend it.",1310342400,7,377,4.04054054054054
4099605,5,B0039ZF8LY,"'Visions of Israel' is still another excellent addition to the 'Visions' series. It is simply the best video on Israel I have seen and is perfect for tourists who want a memento of  an Israeli trip. Most other videos wonder aimlessly, are disorganized, or insert pointless political messages. This one is your traveler's keepsake.",1300147200,7,330,5.111111111111111
4099606,5,B0039ZF8LY,"this video took us back to the same places of our trip and added more.
It was great to watch and review all the experiences we had in real life.",1295222400,,144,3.8333333333333335
4099607,4,B0039ZF8LY,"Beautiful videophotography in Blue-ray format, and great narration. The content is not as strong as other Israel videos I have seen, but it has a distinction of being the
most visually satisfying to watch.",1285459200,3,205,5.0588235294117645
4099608,2,B0039ZF8LY,"All advertisement of this video were in color, the jacket cover, label on CD and the enclosed literature are all in color. The description of the CD on the case states: 16.9 widescreen color. The version that I have received is all black and white and is definitely not as advertised. Is this the correct version or is this a manufacturer's mistake? I would like to return this BLACK AND WHITE copy as it is not enjoyable to watch and is not satisfactory.

Thank you for your help in this matter.

4099609,5,B0039ZF8LY,"I've been buying all kinds of books and movies about Israel to prepare myself for an upcoming first-time visit there. I hesitated to buy this one because I thought it would be difficult to see the 'real' Israel if all the footage is from the view of a helicoptor. I didn't want just a fly-over. After reading the previous reviews I did buy it, and I'm so glad I did!

Visions of Israel managed to provide an enormous range of the country and people by air and on the ground. It covered more than I would have thought possible. I was able to get a better understanding of where sites are located related to other sites.

The bottom line is this. I 'know' Israel better after having watched Visions of Israel.

After enjoying this one, I bought Visions of New York City. I am scheduled to travel through there very briefly on my way to Israel. I want to be familiar enough with what is there so I'll be able to know exactly what I want to see during my time there.

UPDATE: I thought I had lost my copy of this DVD and I enjoyed it so much that I was planning on buying another one. However, I found it and watched it again last night, enjoying it even more than before, 'pausing' it a number of times to enjoy parts of it when I just wanted more time to enjoy it. Excellent job, Visions!",1282176000,21,1286,4.215447154471545
4099610,5,B0039ZF8LY,"Better than chocolate cheesecake. Perfection of High Defition aerial visuals. The 'Visions of Series' is enhanced by this new DVD. It takes you to Israel in a manner unavailable in any other way. It also provides history, culture, music, and...well...everything but the smell and taste of this interesting country.

Included is Jerusalem to Tel Aviv; Noah to today's fast paced locals; Mediterranean Sea to religious mountain peaks; farms to desert; brides to soldiers; Biblical to 21 Century architecture. The Sea of Galilee from the air is breathtaking. The Dead Sea Scroll site is significant as well as the scenes surrounding the Dead Sea itself. There is so much unexpected color there, the lowest point of the world. You see the 5000 year old Acre (Akko) port, and Masada, and of course, the Old City of Jerusalem. Just too much to list it all. Fantastic helicopter-mounted camera work, which also has unbelievable zoom capability. Awesome footage, like all ""Visions"" DVDs.

This DVD provides history & locations related to several religions. ""Visions of Israel"" is perfect for the religious pilgrim that cannot travel to Israel. Also enjoyable is the musical background; both vocal and instrumental music in forms from classical to folk. The narration is educational.

A bonus added segment of footage (almost 1/2 hour) includes more music background but no narration, except the written captions of site names. We were able to make use of CC and have all of the narration also in print on the TV screen for the main feature. One can use the bonus segment as a great musical background for an office or home, just by playing the DVD's bonus.

Check out all of the ""Visions of Series"", all excellent, all educational, informative, musical, and beautiful. All Aerial HD.",1277251200,38,1775,5.047781569965871

4099616,5,B0039ZF8LY,Very good DVD. I teach religious ed classes at my church for middle school and plan to show this to the students next year. I like the aerial view with the name of the location coming up on screen and the narrator giving you information. Covers a lot of locations.  I hope by giving the kids visuals it will bring their bible learning more to life and make it more meaningful to them. This year I used the DVD Where Jesus Walked by Readers Digest and that was very good and well received by the kids.,1430956800,2,500,4.208333333333333

4099621,5,B0039ZF8LY,"While indicating Israel as  ""...Holy Land to three major religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam"", the Editorial Review skips the fact that Israel is also Holy Land to the members of the Baha'i Faith and is in-fact the world center of the Baha'i Faith as it's founders were exiled and are buried there and it's administrative offices are beautiful jewels that dot the massive ""hanging gardens"" of Mount Carmel in Haifa.

Fortunately, however, this video does not neglect that fact nor coverage of some of these holy sites.  Beautiful helicopter videos do great justice to the Shrine of the Bab in Mount Carmel",1418688000,,613,4.990196078431373

4099636,3,B0039ZF8LY,"The Visions of Italy really was sensational. I could watch it over and over. Not so with the Visions of Israel. Rather boring. After watching it, we weren't inclined to visit the country. Didn't capture the excitement and beauty of Israel. It started to sound like a dull history class.",1388793600,2,286,4.74
