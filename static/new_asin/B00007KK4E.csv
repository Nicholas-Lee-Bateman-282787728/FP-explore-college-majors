But as the story unfolds, this movies reveals a plot that is perhaps the best of any Kung Fu film. The Kung Fu action sequences, direction, and the production quality are not at all noteworthy.

What makes this movie different is its characters and relationships. More specifically, it is about a relationship between a father and his son.

The son, not surprisingly, shares the same strengths and weaknesses of his father. The father sees the same foolishness in his son that he was once guilty of and has led him to a wrong path, and the father feels both guilt and pride that his son has grown to be a top-notch fighter without him. Too ashamed to reveal himself as his father, he decides to undo his unintentional sacrifice of his considerable reputation as a fighter on the behalf of his son...

I am a fan of the Kung Fu genre and have seen most them. Somehow, this film sticks in my mind as the one of the most memorable. Enjoy!",1309305600,,1040,4.43455497382199

China must have been a tough place to live back in the day, what with the poor economy and random groups of thugs beating on everyone. ""Shaolin Tiger Claw"" (actually the film's title appears as ""Shaolin Tiger's Claw""?) is the story of a man named Yu who wants to prove that he is the best fighter in China, and to prove this he sets out to challenge just about any Master he comes across.

After thoroughly beating a local Kung Fu Master, Yu learns of an old Kung Fu Master named ""The Tiger"" who is serving a jail sentence for murder. In order to test his skills against Tiger, Yu gets himself arrested and confronts Tiger only to learn that Tiger has given up fighting. Yu then hatches a plan to make sure the duel takes place.

""Tiger Claw"" is your typical 1970's era Kung Fu Theater-type flick. It's fun in a goofy sort of way, but doesn't stand out from hundreds of similar films. I think the biggest issue I had with ""Tiger Claw"" was that you would see Yu or Tiger beating up on some guys, hitting them with bamboo poles and whatnot, and the guys would fall down for like 4 seconds, then pop right back up to continue the fight. There are a couple scenes where the fight the same group of henchmen up and down the side of a mountain. You would think that if their kung fu was that great, one or two of the henchmen would be too hurt to continue fighting, and would stay down??",1304640000,,1556,4.2677966101694915
