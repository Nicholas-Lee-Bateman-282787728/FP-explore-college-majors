8166496,1,B000M5AJKY,This DVD was AWFUL! I started watching it and was Not impressed at all. It was too confusing and I could keep track of what was supposed to be going on. It didn't seem to have any real story line. I ended up only watching about 10 minutes of it and then basically throwing it away.,1241481600,,281,4.035714285714286
8166497,5,B000M5AJKY,"I first saw this movie when it came out on cable TV and thought it was terrific then.  This movie is a MUST for anyone thinking about going into healthcare or those teaching students in healthcare.  The majority of the movie is portrayed from a patient's perspective, down to filming the ceilings while a patient is lying on a guerney in the crowded emergency room.  It is a fast paced, enjoyable film though at times there is strong language used.  As a registered nurse with many years experience working in emergency rooms, I highly recommend this video.",972432000,8,557,4.711340206185567
