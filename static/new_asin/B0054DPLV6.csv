Get 'em while they're cheap.

BTW: The reason this collection is so cheap follows:
Half of the titles are FULL SCREEN--- and that is fine with me; I have a HUGE flatscreen.

Half of the titles are FULL SCREEN, occasionally, w-i-t-h MOSTLY window-boxed WIDESCREEN.
I have a 55"" TV, so the FULLSCREEN stuff fills the center 41"" of my screen.
The problem arrives when the mixed windowboxed & Full Screen episodes HAVE to be watched,
as-is (center 41"" full screen) and, mostly, black bars on all four sides, centered! Okay,
hit the ZOOM, and the, so-called, window-boxed widescreen/non-anomorphic widescreen ALSO
has names and titles slightly below the widescreen frame THAT CAN-NOT completely be SEEN.

If it does not matter to you that
FRED A. JONES:
SMITFIELD UNIV

appears on your flatscreen something like THIS:

FRED A. JONES:
^'`' ^ ^^''^^

then it is a great bargain.... or you can watch it ""normally"" like I do with a 55""....
IF you have a 55""---or BIGGER:
T-h-a-t is why this is such a bargain....
The titles need an aspect ratio remastering.

Picture watching the movie WOODSTOCK with all those ""floating"" mixed aspect ratios.
If you have a big television---it won't make you totally nuts. Just partially.",1331078400,2,2935,8.986348122866895

If you are a history fan you will undoubtedly love this compilation of 8 episodes of Decoding The Past! If you are not a fan of history, you will discover that you can be a fan by watching these documentaries. What the History Channel does is amazing! They take true, historical stories, sprinkle with a fancy reenactment, a dash of scientific proof, a splash of interviews and roll it in an enticing voice over for a worthy presentation on OUR past.

My favorite segment are regarding the Knights Templars. I am extremely interested in the code of the Knights. Who were they? What was they actual mission? Were they to protect the Ark of the Coven? Where they to assist travelers on their trips to the holy land? There is so much mystery surrounding them that you find yourself researching further. Anything that encourages further research is a good thing!

My second favorite is the segment on the secrets hidden inside our dollar bills. Conspiracy theories abound regarding the hidden messages found by looking at the dollar bill.  Why is there a pyramid on the dollar bill? There are no pyramids in America, why is it there? Did it have something to do with the Freemasons?

There is so much information in this DVD and it is shows like this that make The History Channel so popular in our household!",1319414400,9,1331,4.622881355932203

8456536,1,B0054DPLV6,"Some of the History Channel shows are not the best and this series joins that infamous group of shows. The series is uneven. For the purpose of this review, I watched the Mysteries Of The Garden Of Eden and was very disappointed in some of the ""facts"" concerning the old testament, which for the knowledgeable viewer, would raise red flags. First off, this episode takes the approach that the O.T. is a relative recent invention, going back no more than the first millennium B.C. The Dead Sea Scrolls, which are copies in and of themselves, refute that idea. We don't know how old the records are, but the view taken in this show is not widely held, by any means. Plus, the show presents a sensationalist view, which is even worse. I strongly recommend other history shows that are much more comprehensive in their approach to the facts.",1453161600,3,837,4.662162162162162
