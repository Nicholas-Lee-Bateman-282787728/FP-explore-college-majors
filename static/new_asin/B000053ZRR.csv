1392908,5,B000053ZRR,"Some time ago, I was at a local Hollywood Video and I saw BON JOVI: LIVE FROM LONDON! on the shelf. I had to rent it. It was good but was short and could have been better. When I found out there was going to be a new BON JOVI live video, I freaked, but was skeptical about if had all the good songs. I found out on the internet and got it. It rules. An 80,000 people sold-out stadium. Best performances: ""Lay Your Hands on Me"", ""Sleep When I'm Dead"", and ""Say It Isn't So"". But I wish they had ""This Ain't a Love Song"", and ""Never Say Goodbye."" Buy this DVD.",978739200,7,558,3.9469026548672566
1392909,5,B000053ZRR,"Jon & the crew worked hard while the rain poured down. Overall, the performance was awe-inspiring. This video is a must for major Bon Jovi fans, and is a clear display of what it takes to make it in the music indistry today. Gon bless Rock & roll, and thanks for Bon Jovi. -Ryan",978566400,,278,4.166666666666667
1392910,5,B000053ZRR,"I own this dvd and have watched it many times in Dolby surround sound. I can't watch it enough. The quality of this dvd is great. I was at the show in Nov. at the Forum in LA and even though there is nothing like a live performance, this dvd was the closest thing to being there. These guys put on one heck of a show. They still can rock. For any die hard BonJovi fans, and even the casual fan, I highly recommend this. You won't regret it. The 30 minutes of interview and backstage stuff is great. There are also 2 videos from the Crush CD, including one not released yet.",978480000,7,573,4.079646017699115
1392911,5,B000053ZRR,"Ver este concierto me hizo acordarme de los viejos tiempos en los que Bon Jovi reinaba el mundo del hard rock con sus discos Slippery When Wet y New Jersey. Practicamente cubre todos los discos de esta famosa agrupacin de Jersey (a mi juicio si hubieran incluido la cancion Blaze of Glory no le faltaria nada). Concierto lleno de mucha energia y excelente musica, y si tomas en cuenta que esta en DVD, la verdad es que vale la pena el gasto, an y si no eres fan de Bon Jovi. Altamente recomendable, no te arrepentiras.",977961600,3,518,4.40625
1392912,5,B000053ZRR,"The first live concert I went to was a Bon Jovi show.  It was the final stop on their US Slippery When Wet tour (Honolulu).  I had gone to keep a friend company.  Needless to say, I was hooked, and a die hard fan ever since.  Aside from ""An Evening With Bon Jovi"", which was more of a toned-down, MTV affair, I have been waiting for years for the definitive Bon Jovi live video.  The wait is over!
The guys cover most of their biggest hits, as well as some of their future hits too.  I was reading an interview with Richie Sambora, and he had said that they don't really rehearse for tours anymore.  For the Crush tour, they rehearsed a total of four (4!) days.  From watching this vid, you can tell that these guys define the term 'Road Warriors'.  Each knows how to work the crowd, and they always know where the others are and what they are doing.  True professionals.  As I watched the opening number, 'Living on a Prayer', I couldn't believe that it's been almost fifteen years since this song was released.  It has stood the test of time.  Their other songs are just as timeless, if not moreso.  ""Wanted.."" is to my generation what ""Stairway to Heaven"" is to the generation before mine...a bookmark for a period in our lives when all did was play air guitar and rock out.
Granted, the boys aren't as youthful as I remember them.  In ""Wanted Dead or Alive"", Jon reminds me more of Woody from Toy Story than a road-weary rocker, but I think that serves as a testament to their longevity more than to hurt their credibility.  Aside from Aerosmith and the Rolling Stones, can you name another band that has gone out and toured and toured for almost two decades?  (The Eagles don't count because they only did it once, and solely for the money.)
As for the disc itself, I was impressed with the video quality, and the editing.  The director was able to catch the electricity of being front row center at a Bon Jovi concert, while also allowing us to see what goes on backstage, behind the drum riser, behind the keyboards, etc.  This concert is in letterboxed format, and overall color and transfer is excellent.
The audio is Dolby Digital 5.1, although it seems as though the disc defaults to Dolby Surround 2.0.  The 5.1 presentation is very good, putting you in the center of the crowd.  It is laid out with the vocals taking center channel, guitar mid-left, and keyboards mid-right along with upper-range bass guitar.  The crowd noise takes the rear surrounds along with ambient noise from the stage.  The sound on this disc blends so well, that it's a case of ""close your eyes....you're there"".
The extras on this disc are comprised of a 30-minute behind the scenes, and the videos for ""It's My Life"" and ""Say It Isn't So"".  As a sidenote, Bon Jovi pioneered the concert performance video back in the 80s.  They were damn good at it.  I just wished that they could have stayed with the formula for these two videos, which do contain live performance footage, but only against the backdrop of other action in the video.  But I digress...
Bottom Line:  If you are a die hard BJ fan, this decision is a no-brainer.  If you enjoy high-energy stage shows with lots of audience participation, familiar hits, and gobs of nostalgia, drop the Andrew Jackson and pick this disc up.",977875200,18,3277,4.516129032258065
1392913,5,B000053ZRR,"This truly is a must have for any hard rock/bon jovi fan.  This concert spans their entire career - even includes the old classic ""runaway"" (a personal fav of mine).
I cannot comment expertly on the audio quality, because my song system isn't that crash hot (still saving for that Marantz amp), but to these ears it doesn't sound too bad.
Over 20 songs, plus a 30 minute documentary, plus the music videos of it's my life and say it isn't so, make this great value for money",977356800,7,474,4.386363636363637

1392938,4,B000053ZRR,"Bon Jovi keyboardist David Bryan perhaps said it best Bon Jovi is the ultimate bar band. No special effects, no computer generated sounds just rock and roll. In late August 2000, Bon Jovi took his Crush Tour to a sold out stadium in Zurich, Switzerland and on that rainy night he did what he does best he made pure American rock.

The show features what appears to be a slightly edited version of the concert played that night and it runs just over two hours. The band works its way through twenty songs (featuring seven from the Crush album) with plenty of energy and emotion to spare. This isn't a night for the mellow, it's a night of rock and roll power anthems. There is plenty of arm waving and singing along and it is a fun way to spend the night. It hardly matters that many of the songs sound the same.

The standard definition disc does a nice job with the visual quality but the 5.1 sound comes across as a little thin at times but this is hardly a problem. The disc features two videoes from Crush, an interesting and well made ""On Tour"" documentary, a slide show type photo gallery, and an up to 2000 current discography.

Well worth it.",1244851200,,1150,4.364485981308412

1392940,3,B000053ZRR,"Over all this had the best rating so that is why I picked it up. After watching the first few songs, I thought when did he try to sing and hold notes so much in his music. I assume it was because he knew he was going to be putting this out for DVD and wanted to show off. Maybe the mixer just had his voice more prominent. Either way, looks like he puts on a great show, but I guess I was just expecting more possibly. Over all it has the songs you want and good concert footage in Europe.",1228608000,,489,3.8514851485148514
1392941,5,B000053ZRR,"Bon Jovi's ""The Crush Tour"" DVD is by far in my opinion the best of all the ""Live"" performances. Trust me when I say that because I have all his DVD's an CD's! A little obsessed? Yes! Do I act like teenage groupie at 30 years old? Yes! This DVD show's you our favorite rock star at his sweaty and determined greatest! I especially love the part where he pulls a VIP member from sidestage and dances with her! I wonder if she knows she envied all around the world! So to the point...this would be a wonderful video to add to any collection for the newbie fan's and oldie fan's as well! I hope this helps!",1228089600,,603,4.162393162393163

1392970,3,B000053ZRR,"Bon Jovi are by far the greatest live band in the world, but the awesome live performance and atmosphere that anyone who has ever been to one of their concerts knows, is not apparent watching this DVD.  This DVD makes the great ones' performance look rather average, which is just plain wrong.  Like with the live CD that was released around the time of the Crush Tour you can not even hear the Zurich crowd in most songs with the producers seeming to care more about having studio quality sound, which I might add they did not always achieve. In fact Livin' on a Prayer and You give Love a Bad Name are the exact same recording as was on that album.  All shots looking at the stage are way above the crowd's heads meaning you don't get the concert attendees perspective at all.  Lots of editing means you also miss out on all the stuff between songs as well as a fair few of the songs as well.  Jon Bon Jovi mentions in the 30 minute ""backstage"" program extra, that the band would never turn up to a concert and reduce a two and half hour show to only two hours as that would not only cheat the fans but cheat themselves as well.  Yet this is exactly what those who put together this DVD did.

You can also get better live versions of the songs on here on other DVDs or bonus songs that came with their singles.  The, photo gallery, discography and film clips for the songs It's My Life and Say it Isn't So and 30 minute ""backstage"" program are pretty good.  It would have been nice though if they could have taken off their sunglasses during the interviews, but Jon did explain in the DVD he was doing this to hide his wrinkles.

Bon Jovi are by far the greatest live performers there have ever been.  Definitely make sure you have seen these guys at least once before they retire which hopefully is not for a while. Don't pay too much for this very average DVD though.",1148083200,7,1871,4.286931818181818
1392971,5,B000053ZRR,"I absoultely love this DVD and have watched it numerous times since receiving itapprox 1 month ago. The first few times i watched it on a laptop and the quality didn't seem all that great. but after seeing it on my flat screen tv, it is awesome! the sound quality is great and who doesn't enjoy seeing Jon Bon Jovi in a bandana???

1392975,5,B000053ZRR,"Loved this DVD of BON JOVI!!  It showcases many of the band's hits throughout the years, as well as a lot of songs from the Crush album.  They sound great in concert. Jon is very good at working the crowd, especially for ""One Wild Night""!  Richie is awesome on all his solos.  The Bonus feature shows the guys talking about being in the band and touring.  This is a nice souvenir for the Bon Jovi Concert-Goer!",1141257600,2,410,4.342105263157895
1392976,5,B000053ZRR,"I disagree with the negative reviews on this one BIG time. The concert was awesome! The picture and sound were great on my TV/stereo system. Although different than their concerts from the late '80's and early '90's (as one should expect), Jon, as always, has the crowd singing along, dancing, and waving their arms in unison (and not so unison at times, lol) even though it was pouring rain and the fans (and some of the band) were getting soaked as he exhibited his expertise as front man that he does so well. If you are looking for the origional (CD) versions and not variations or ""strays"" of their songs (especially their infamous hits from yester-year), this is not the CD that will provide that (though you shouldn't be disappointed). Just note variations mostly, the rockers are still rockers with only 1 exception that I can think of - and I especially loved the ""Runaway"" rendition - it was a hauntingly beautiful ballad that blew me away and I'd buy this DVD again for that song alone. Just as their self stated anthem ""Just Older"" is all about I think that Bon Jovi's music reflects on their maturity as a band and it especially reflects on their musical talent and genius. The fact that they are now playing to 2 generations of audiences, many of which thought ""Crush"" was their first CD, is fantastic and says a lot for the band and their talent by their ability to appeal to more than the ""just older"" crowd (just check out all of the young faces in the crowd absolutely thrilled to be there in the rain). I also thought it was cool that the concert was also broadcast over the radio, I sure wish bands did that here. They played 19 songs total (I rarely went to a concert where the band played 19 songs - especially in the rain! - and I've been to quite a few concerts in the past), with a 3 song encore (""Keep The Faith"" rocked!). An awesome fire works show at the end of the concert as the band leaves while ""Thank You For Loving Me"" plays in the background... a nice touch for the ending. Also interviews, pictures, and more on the DVD. Get it while you can, it's well worth it! Jon, Richie, David, Tico, Hugh... my hat's off to you all!

It was a bit subdued though compared to the wonderful Bon Jovi 'Live in London' one which I found infinitely more full of life.

I think the auduience were a lot of the problem. Shots of the front rows show fairly impassive faces and not a lot of joining in - one even was seen to check their watch (well it was a Swiss audience!)

It would have been hard to feel psyched up and carried along by this crowd (as they were in London)- though perhaps they felt there wasn't much to get excited about.",1102118400,3,621,4.158333333333333

I'm not sure if it was because it was at the end of the tour and they were just tired which would be understandable; or if it was just me being angry that they were out of the loop for so long.  This DVD has an amazing version of Runaway and wow Bed Of Roses is so beautiful it almost puts me in a comatose state!  The sound quality is superb here.  I played a trick at a party I threw and told everyone I was putting in Shrek and instead put in Bon Jovi.  When the sound clip Living On A Prayer came on, everyone went nuts and sang with the tune!

1393001,3,B000053ZRR,"I have loved bon Jovi for years, but i got to admit this is not one of their best video's.  I was at the gateshead consert only the week befor this concert was filmed and what I can't understand is why they didn't film that concert!  The night was perfect, blue skies, not a cloud in site and the band just rocked.  On the night this video was filmed it rained, the guys were soaked and to me they looked far too tired and didn't put their usual effort into the show.  Jon wasn't jumping around the satage like he did at Gateshead, but the music and the sound were good.  I think only a true Bon Jovi fan will buy this video.",996019200,4,625,4.048780487804878
1393002,5,B000053ZRR,"WATCHED THIS CONCERT DVD LAST NIGHT AFTER RECEIVEING IT IN THE MAIL. IT ROCKS !! ONE OF THE BEST CONCERT DVDS I'VE SEEN/HEARD. GREAT CAMERA WORK AND A FANTASTIC SHOW. JON, SAMBORA, AND THE GUYS ARE IN TOP FORM. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AS WELL AS THE NEW LIVE CD. GREAT PRODUCTION VALUES.",992995200,2,282,4.549019607843137
1393003,5,B000053ZRR,"This DVD concert is among the greatest you can see.  The performance is great, the crowd is unbelievable, and the DVD recording in Dolby 5.1 is amazing.  I thought it was much better than the ""Live in London"" concert because of the song selection, performance, and the audio sound.  Unless you sit in the front row of a live Bon Jovi Concert there is no way you can get closer to the action than by buying this DVD.",991353600,,415,4.294871794871795
1393004,5,B000053ZRR,"As a man who has already seen Bon Jovi twice (and the one was 12 nights before this DVD was recorded, in Wembley) I highly recommend this title. After watching it I decided to go to Germany and watch them again. ""SEE YOU IN STUTTGART"" EL GRECO",989798400,4,243,4.191489361702128
1393005,5,B000053ZRR,"Desde el dia que compre el dvd no paro de verlo realmente me encanto ,se puede apreciar los ultimo temas de crush en vivo mas un buen Backstage con entrevitas,etc. La calidad de imagen del Dvd me parece muy buena,el sonido es excelente uno se siente como si estuviera ahi presente,estos tipos pese a sus aos cada dia tocan mejor y en este ultimo concierto queda demostrado ,aconsejo a cualquier fan de bon jovi que se lo compre no se a arrepentir en absoluto.",987120000,2,459,4.476190476190476
1393006,3,B000053ZRR,"1. The performance of this title is not as good as the one ""Live from Lendon"". And many words and actions done by Bon jovi are the same as last title ""Live from Lendon"". It seems like they just performed in Lendon yesterday. 2. The stage is not as good as last title ""Live from Lendon"", you can compare with them. 3. Although this time this DVD features Dolby Digital 5.1 sound, but the quality and surround effect are poor.  4. Vocal performance is not good when compare with last live title. 5. Dynamic Range of sound quality is poor also, try to listen to the last title. Sound is not clear either. 6. Video quality is not good, especially it was taken in the ""Raining day"" ! 7. The most impressive part is you can find the song ""Born to be my baby"" on this DVD that you can't find anywhere on any Bon Jovi's published videos.
All of above is just my personal opinion.",983491200,,871,4.246987951807229
1393007,3,B000053ZRR,"I've been a big fan from Bon Jovi since the early days of Runaway, but i must admit this concert is not outstanding (not even close to that). I rate it as a 3 stars because the sound is awful and the guys seem tired and absent several times during the 2 hours of show. There is no clear emotional connection between the band and the audience. On the technical side, Dolby Digital quality is really poor in this DVD, so poor that i find it better to set my systems in the dolby surround mode.
But not everything is poor about this performance. The band made a good song selection: It's My life, born to be my baby, bed of roses,I'll be there for you, I'll sleep when i'm dead, bad medicine, lay your hands on me, the opening song living on a prayer and a slow version of runaway that i didn't like much, among others. It was a shame that they didn't play songs like always, these days, thank you for loving me, blaze of glory and this ain't a love song, but is really difficult to make it in two hours and also make the corresponding marketing needed for the themes included in their recent album CRUSH.
If you are a big fan from Bon Jovi, is not a bad call to buy this DVD. If you saw Live from London, maybe is better to pass this time, because the London one was a performance to remember, with Jon singing at his best, excellent guitar solos from Sambora and above anything, a big sinergy with the audience. If you haven't seen any of these concerts, then London is the right option. And finally, if you liked Crush, then maybe you have to get this DVD.",983404800,2,1556,4.207357859531773
1393008,5,B000053ZRR,"This disc is highly recommended. Great video very clear and crisp and the audio rocks with Dolby 5.1 channel(don't worry what's written above that it's only 2.0 stereo it's not it's in 2.0 surround and 5.1 surround). Don't know about what's written above on technical details which say's that's in full screen format but actually  when i played this disc it's in widescreen format all throughout the whole concert, and it's great seeing Jon and the band all in one stage. Very lively and energetic concert shouldn't miss it if you're a Bon Jovi fan or just a DVD buff who loves music DVD's. Either way you won't regret buying this disc, I love this disc. Good job island records !",982454400,5,680,4.619834710743802
1393009,5,B000053ZRR,"This is the best concert DVD I've seen in a long time.  Bon Jovi sounds terrific as ever.  They play some songs from their new CD, Crush, but wrap in some of the old favorites for their ""OLDER"" fans, too.  I highly recommend this DVD for any fan, new or old, of Bon Jovi.",981676800,6,271,3.9814814814814814
1393010,4,B000053ZRR,"This is a wonderful video, full of old and new Bon Jovi songs.  I enjoy watching it and singing along.  To whomever else has this video, I ask, Why the MORACCAS and AREOBICS?!  Totally made me disappointed.  But it is a great collection of songs.",981590400,,246,4.4
1393011,5,B000053ZRR,"With so little offcial Bon Jovi Footage available on DVD, its great to have over 2hrs released from the recent tour.  The Dolby 5.1 recording adds to what is a great performance - despite the pouring rain.  Certainly better than the Live from London DVD released some time ago - you feel more involved.  Live from London is more like a movie.
One thing is interesting - the show is recorded in Switzerland - yet this DVD is only released in the US and Germany at present.  Its not even available here in the UK.
Here's to a great One Wild Night tour (and another DVD in the Winter).",980208000,4,582,4.3119266055045875
1393012,5,B000053ZRR,"For those of you, like me, who were lucky enough to see Bon Jovi perform on their Crush tour this past fall, this is a video that needs to be purchased. The performances are amazing; in particular, old school songs like ""Livin on a Prayer"" and ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" and Crush tunes ""It's My Life"" and ""Captain Crash and the Beauty Queen from Mars"" are stand outs. Their performance of ""I'll Be There For You"" is surprisingly one of the best, in an emotional and passionate display. ""Bad Medicine"" and ""I'll Sleep When I'm Dead"" are fun favorites, as well as the haunting ""Bed of Roses.""  For those who wish to remember a performance they have already seen, or for those who wish to get a taste of what may be in store for future concerts, this video is a must-have.",979776000,6,766,4.394366197183099
1393013,4,B000053ZRR,"Great sound, great picture, great editing, great performance. Who could ask for more? Only one complaint. The layer change interrupts the beginning of a song.
