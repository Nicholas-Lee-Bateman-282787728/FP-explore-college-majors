5975099,4,B00FC5DGRM,"I liked Borgen, respected it, enjoyed it. But I didn't LOVE it, as opposed seemingly everyone in the universe (OK I found one Luke-warm review out of about 20 by major outlet writers - the rest were flat out raves). My wife loved it. My friends. So maybe I need to see it again? But 30 hours is a big investment in something that didn't blow me out of my chair.

It's about Danish politics, and the almost accidental rise of one woman - Brigitte Nyborg - a member of one of Denmark's 8 parties to the role of Prime Minister  after her less- pragmatic, better known male rivals self-destruct. It followers her, and those around her -- her team, the press, her political rivals -- as they try to stay balanced in the always choppy and morally confusing world of politics.

There's no question the show is extremely well acted. And the characters cover a wide range of jobs, temperaments, levels of honesty and ethics, while almost all remaining human beings (I do wish the leader of the far right party wasn't quite such a cartoon). The human problems the lead character faces as the pressure of high office takes its tolls on both her family and her ethics are believable and moving. And I loved that all the major characters are allowed to be flawed and make bad decisions while still being treated as decent people at heart.

Yet, for me there was something a bit too neat, a bit too old-school in the show's 'crisis of the week' approach, where almost every episode sometimes wildly complex political issues and situations manage to get resolved. While the personal issues are allowed to work in a more serialized way, evolving slowly over time, I don't love how the show pushes to close the book on a brand new political crisis almost every episode. It leads the show to need sudden convenient twists that can feel melodramatic at times, and sometimes makes our heroine just a little too perfect, a little too much smarter than everyone in the room for me to buy it.

Warning: mild, general spoilers for the 3rd season ahead

In the series' 3rd (and last) season, there was, for me, some compromise of what had seemed the show's own moral core. While I applaud the idea -- so lost in the US -- that effective politics is largely about pragmatism and compromise, in the show's 3rd season it starts to feel like Brigitte has become ALL about pragmatism and compromise to get what she wants , and that the show itself isn't seriously challenging her shift. Without some ideological, moral core I found it harder to care who won out. There is a clever last second reprieve that solves the problem to a certain extent. But I spent a lot of the last season feeling increasingly uncomfortable that the series itself DIDN'T seem to be uncomfortable, as it's heroine increasingly seemed a woman whose talents were exploiting the political machinery as an end in itself -- without deeply, critically questioning her character, or making us face the intriguing but uncomfortable possibility that perhaps she isn't the truly good hearted, nobly intended politician we all wished for, and that she had always seemed to be.

None-the-less, a LOT is good in the show, and given it's near universal enthusiastic embrace (and the fact I certainly quite liked it, even if I didn't love it) I may just be forced to hang onto my blu-ray set, and one day give it another go.",1397260800,2,3356,4.630252100840337
5975100,5,B00FC5DGRM,"I agree with the first reviewer, one of the best television shows ever. Great writing, impeccable acting, perfect casting, what else is there to say. I am not a big TV fan, though I have taken to many mystery/dramatic series including, Wallander; The Fall; The Killing; Spiral; The Eagle and recently House of Cards, for me, Borgen is the best series to date that I have seen (I am waiting on the original ""The Bridge"" to be released). If you like any of the series I mentioned, then Borgen is a MUST see. Happy Viewing :)",1394236800,,522,4.447916666666667
5975101,5,B00FC5DGRM,"I watched all three seasons on PBS, left rave reviews of Seasons 2 and 3 (some of which is repeated here). BORGEN has the PERFECT balance of the interpersonal and the political, public and private. I can't think of another show that more deftly illustrates the impact of political discourse on people's lives, and vice-versa, and it does so in a way that consistently delivers a POWERFUL punch both intellectually and emotionally. The camerawork is phenomenal, so intimate, pulls you right in. And perhaps best of all, the show is utterly original and continually surprising, yet, in retrospect, events transpire as they they likely WOULD- brilliant. The only small (but realistic) downside to this is that, not everyone is the recipient of a happy, storybook ending.  NOTE: This review contains only small, minor spoilers, nothing that will ruin your viewing experience.

I love the subtitles, obviously done by non-Native English speakers, e.g., ""Hey- those are just the perps that come with the job..."" [percs], ""you need the pressure of the right people"" [support], ""so"" substituted for ""but"", compassionate for sympathetic, etc., just slightly off, charming.  And as I recall, several times they used ""newspaper"" instead of [TV] ""network"", or vice-versa.  As with British shows, Danish TV doesn't censor obscenities, interesting to hear four letter expletives in Danish. It's often obvious what's being said from the inflection, even through they're blanked out in the subtitles for broadcast TV.  The Danish word for Bye is ""Hi"", and for Grandma is ""Mama"", it can get a little confusing.

Another aspect I find intriguing is the depiction of government on a much smaller scale. One soldier killed in Afghanistan produces a national outcry. In one episode the prime minister's kids were upset with her for not cooking dinner. Birgitte washes her own dishes, tries to unstop the kitchen sink, and cleans the house, but also flies to Africa to broker peace talks.

I have family in England, and BORGEN well illustrates the close ties and interdependency of EU nations and people, quite foreign (literally) to our insular way of thinking. Similarly, American politics and the media are so polarized, polarizing, it's refreshing in the extreme to see a story that shows conflicting, and yet well-fleshed out, comprehensible points of view. Everyone's human, fallible, sure, but it's not as simple as good guys vs. bad guys. Not to go off on a tangent, but for example, animal-lovers in America (of which I'm one) often villainize hunters- yet I've read that hunters have done more to safeguard animal habitats and preserve more species than any other group in America (starting with Charles Audubon, an avid hunter). BORGEN takes the time to paint people and issues in relatively fine brushstrokes (men and women too, all human, individuals, marvelous).

I loved the interplay between the personal and the political. Seasons 1 and 3 focused somewhat more on the political than did Season 2, which was slightly more personal, and I enjoyed both approaches. In Season 3 the politics, the nuts and bolts of forming a new political party, and all the machinations and strategizing relating thereto were absolutely fascinating and took center stage. What personal themes there were were handled with great subtlety.

A political aspect of the show I found fascinating is the fact that Danish government is seemingly much more fluid than ours (from what I gathered; politics is not my strong suit, so even MORE amazing that I was captivated by the show). There are multiple political parties; factions form and re-form alliances, shift and evolve, one year your party may be part of the majority, the next, when you differ substantially from the ruling party, you may be in opposition. Too many irreconcilable differences and a new election will be called, the people will have their say, and a new government (""Borgen"") will be formed (the word is also used to refer to Christiansborg Palace, which houses Parliament). The names of the political parties on the show are fictitious, note that over there ""liberal"" means conservative, the largest party in Denmark, as on the show, is liberal (that is, conservative.  And to make it even more confusing, they're denoted by the color blue, whereas the more left-leaning parties are ""red""). For the most part, there seems to be more of an incentive in this form of government for politicians to cooperate and work out differences, but human nature, being what it is... Some of the best quotes at the beginning of each episode were from Winston Churchill, e.g., ""Democracy is the worst form of government, except all the OTHERS that have been tried!"" and ""Some men change their party for the sake of their principles -- others their principles for the sake of their party.""

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the series for me was Birgitte's evolution, personally and politically- her growing self-confidence and skills at gamesmanship. Other things that struck me: 1) unisex/coed restrooms (with stalls) in Denmark, no-one bats an eye; 2) people smoke, even at work; 3) there isn't such an emphasis on thin, young, gorgeous actresses, women look normal, have meat on their bones, are sans make-up at home (Katrine doesn't even wear makeup to work, only when she's going to be on camera), pad around with cellulite showing, and women of all ages, with normal wrinkles, are shown. Also, women don't look like they were produced by a cookie cutter with the same hair styles, tight clothing, stiletto heels, no cosmetically enhanced breasts in sight, such a nice change from American productions (ditto for the men, they look real), 4) everyone rides bikes to work, even heads of political parties, 5) the Danish use the terms ""welfare"" and ""welfare programs"", with their original meanings, as we used to, meaning for people's betterment, for the improved, enhanced quality of people's lives, no negative connotations, and finally 6) The Danish are very matter-of-fact about sex (e.g., full frontal nudity, casual depictions of oral sex), this is a SEXY show, for adults only.

I found BORGEN irresistible, fascinating on many levels. I loved the tension, dynamism and symbiotic relationship between members of the press and politicos. A favorite character was the news chief of TV1, Torben Friis, phenomenal, another was marvelous reporter Hanne Holm.  Actually, there's not a character on the show who wasn't richly drawn, superbly acted, I wish I could mention them all- Katrine, Hesselboe, Pia, Bent, Philip, Svend, Ulrik, Laura, Magnus, Jeremy, Laugesen, Kruse, Nete, Jon, everybody.  Two favorite actors, playing Hoxenhaven, and Soren, Katrine's love interest in Season 3, were in earlier Danish police dramas Unit 1 (Hanne Holm and Katrine's mom, too), and The Killing.  I was riveted by Kasper- the actor, and the character. The shows in seasons 1 and 2 that had him at their epicenter were among my favorites of the entire series. But most of all, I loved Birgitte, and her essential decency, integrity. Though imperfect, she wrestled with what the ethical course was, and for her ends didn't justify the means. Every week there was a famous quote embodying the theme of that show. One of them was from Abraham Lincoln, who said (I paraphrase): Most men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him POWER. That sensibility informed the entire show. The writing, the acting, the direction was as good as it gets, for me, just wonderful.

My admiration for the show grew exponentially over its course, the circle complete at its conclusion (symbolized by Hanne's crooked scarf before her TV1 broadcast from Borgen in Episode 1, and again, straightening it before going on the air live from Borgen in the final episode). For me, the mark of a great television show is the extent to which it manages to balance the delivery of satisfying resolutions in EACH episode, with continuing threads that resolve more slowly, often imperceptibly, over the course of the series. BORGEN achieved both objectives spectacularly well- each episode stood in its own right and delivered a POWERFUL punch, but they summed to a whole that was far greater than the sum of the parts. Inspired.

The show got better and better, culminating in the pice de rsistance, the final episode. The finale was studded with magic moments, e.g., Katrine finally finding her Mr. Right, Torben finding his voice (and what his heart sought), the excitement surrounding the formation of the new government, Birgitte's triumphant arrival at Borgen, and most of all, the fact that when faced with the toughest decision of her life, Birgitte showed her mettle by putting her country's interests ahead of her own. Simply SPLENDID, inspiring, the arc of her growth, as well as that of the series, now complete. One of the BEST TV series EVER, and one that gets better with subsequent viewings (I've watched it through several times, each time I see more, delight in it more). Subtle, understated, yet jam-packed with life, powerful. Don't miss it!",1390780800,2,9080,5.070997990622907

After the first episode, we decided that it was like a fine book; we just couldn't put it down. We decided to watch it straight through - one episode every week night and 2-3 episodes on the weekend. It was engrossing to see how the Danish political system works. Even though there are several subplots that run concurrently, each contribute to the main political theme and maintain the intensity of the flow. We would not have even heard about it except that one of another Scandanavian series we watch showed a 'clip' of Borgen (that clip was enough to view to decide to get the entire series).

Through elusive broadcast television I had managed religiously to watch the first two seasons of this three season series but when I could find no way to finish the series I ordered the complete set.  For me it was worth it since the political and personal intrigue found in this series is superb.  The cast performances are believable and you find yourself easily wrapped up in the story.  Although there are episodes with a lot of English dialogue the series is mostly in Danish with sub-titles - no matter.  The viewer easily settles into the routine of reading the sub-titles and the excellent script carries you forward without even noticing or remembering that it IS subtitled.  In Great Britain, Australia and other English speaking countries the series has been a phenomenal hit and is reportedly being shown in at least 70 countries worldwide.  On a recent visit to Copenhagen the Borgen series prompted me to make it a priority to visit the seat of the Danish government - the beautiful Christiansborg Palace nicknamed ""Borgen"" (the castle) by the Danes and where much of the filming took place.  Only because of it's limited broadcast in the United States is ""Borgen"" largely unknown here which is a pity.

It's about Danish politics, and the almost accidental rise of one woman - Brigitte Nyborg - a member of one of Denmark's 8 parties to the role of Prime Minister  after her less- pragmatic, better known male rivals self-destruct. It followers her, and those around her -- her team, the press, her political rivals -- as they try to stay balanced in the always choppy and morally confusing world of politics.

There's no question the show is extremely well acted. And the characters cover a wide range of jobs, temperaments, levels of honesty and ethics, while almost all remaining human beings (I do wish the leader of the far right party wasn't quite such a cartoon). The human problems the lead character faces as the pressure of high office takes its tolls on both her family and her ethics are believable and moving. And I loved that all the major characters are allowed to be flawed and make bad decisions while still being treated as decent people at heart.

Yet, for me there was something a bit too neat, a bit too old-school in the show's 'crisis of the week' approach, where almost every episode sometimes wildly complex political issues and situations manage to get resolved. While the personal issues are allowed to work in a more serialized way, evolving slowly over time, I don't love how the show pushes to close the book on a brand new political crisis almost every episode. It leads the show to need sudden convenient twists that can feel melodramatic at times, and sometimes makes our heroine just a little too perfect, a little too much smarter than everyone in the room for me to buy it.

Warning: mild, general spoilers for the 3rd season ahead

In the series' 3rd (and last) season, there was, for me, some compromise of what had seemed the show's own moral core. While I applaud the idea -- so lost in the US -- that effective politics is largely about pragmatism and compromise, in the show's 3rd season it starts to feel like Brigitte has become ALL about pragmatism and compromise to get what she wants , and that the show itself isn't seriously challenging her shift. Without some ideological, moral core I found it harder to care who won out. There is a clever last second reprieve that solves the problem to a certain extent. But I spent a lot of the last season feeling increasingly uncomfortable that the series itself DIDN'T seem to be uncomfortable, as it's heroine increasingly seemed a woman whose talents were exploiting the political machinery as an end in itself -- without deeply, critically questioning her character, or making us face the intriguing but uncomfortable possibility that perhaps she isn't the truly good hearted, nobly intended politician we all wished for, and that she had always seemed to be.

None-the-less, a LOT is good in the show, and given it's near universal enthusiastic embrace (and the fact I certainly quite liked it, even if I didn't love it) I may just be forced to hang onto my blu-ray set, and one day give it another go.",1458604800,2,3356,4.630252100840337

5975135,5,B00FC5DGRM,"This Danish television series focuses on politics in Denmark, and, in its portrait of the Prime Minister, shows her attempting to hold her coalition -- and her family -- together despite significant obstacles.  The political slant in the series falls midway between the idealism of THE WEST WING and the cynicism of HOUSE OF CARDS.  However, BORGEN does not replace those series; rather, it supplements them.  BORGEN
is brilliantly acted, written and directed, but  because it was not widely shown in the United States, most Americans can only see it if they purchase the series on DVD.  If they are interested in truly riveting drama and a (presumably) realistic portrait of Danish politics, they will not be disappointed by the three seasons (10 episodes in each season) of BORGEN.  -- Jared Brown",1454025600,,799,5.015151515151516

I guess that communism is popular in Denmark as it is popular with liberals in this country.

It started to remind me of TV shows in this country...as I was betting that the writers were barely keeping ahead of the shows...and did not think that quality was as important as sensationalism..

Especially the episodes which elaborated political discussion. All actors were brilliant.  Has the author written any other dramas? I find all Danish films are so interesting and often one (almost) does not need to read the subtitles- the acting is brilliant.  eg The Eagle.,1448582400,,451,4.818181818181818

The shots of Coppenhagen buildings and streets are marvellous and the witty humour between certain characters is truly irresistible.

5975143,5,B00FC5DGRM,"Borgen is fantastic!

NOTE: Borgen is in Danish with English subtitles.

Simply put Borgen is the best political drama I have ever seen. The acting, dialogue, storyline, cinematography are all superb. I have recently viewed all three seasons (30 episodes) and am in awe of what I saw.

 (NOTE: Denmark is a multi-party Parliamentary government. On the political right (as we in the USA would see it) are the Liberals (in power when the series begins), the New Right Party and the Freedom Party, which is, among other things, rabidly anti-immigrant. On the left are Labor, Solidarity (Socialist/Communist) and the Greens. In the middle are the Moderates.)

(Mild Spoiler alert)

The three leading characters (there are many supporting players) in Seasons one and two are Brigitte Nyborg, leader of the Moderate Party; Kasper Juul, her media advisor (spin doctor); and Katrina Fornsberg, a television reporter.

Season one begins with Brigitte Nyborg, leader of a small centrist party  the Moderates- approaching an upcoming election in Denmark just hoping that her party will do well enough that one of the major parties will include her in a new government. Through a series of unforeseen events (which Ill not describe) both the ruling Liberal Prime Minister and the opposition Labor Party leader are publicly embarrassed the night before the election during a debate. Brigitte Nyborg gives an impressive debate performance which receives very positive press reviews.

Though the election results in no party winning a clear majority, Nyborgs Moderates make significant gains. Neither major party is able to form a government. After much maneuvering Nyborg emerges as Denmarks first female Prime Minister. (Historical note: during season two of Borgen Denmark did elect its first female Prime Minister. She is now out of office.)

Season one then focuses on the intricacies of governing Denmark, how being Prime Minister takes a huge toll on Nyborgs family, and significant character development. Most of the characters have back stories which are revealed over the course of the ten episodes that make up season one. Borgen is very fast paced. Crises develop quickly and unexpectedly, often derailing carefully laid plans. It is riveting TV.

Season two begins a year after season one ends. Nyborg is now in her second year as PM. Her husband has left her and one of her children suffers a serious illness. On the political front the war in Afghanistan takes center stage, as do Greenland (a Danish colony), piracy at sea, an education bill, and political intrigue. Nyborgs leadership is put to the test many times as she is forced to make difficult choices. Old alliances wither; new ones are formed.

Season three begins two and a half years after season two ends. Nyborg has been out of office for two years and is now a high-priced international corporate consultant. Dismayed by the direction she sees both Denmark and her old party taking, she decides to return to public life. Season three follows that return.

I think Borgen is a tremendous series. All of the production qualities are superb. The subtitles are very easy to read, i.e. they don't blend into the background. All of the characters are believable, and most are sympathetic. Naturally, when dealing with politics there are always a few slimy characters. They make things interesting.

If you liked The West Wing, or House of Cards, you will love Borgen.",1436227200,16,3426,5.0946428571428575
