4107276,5,B003BNZID2,"I found this to be excellent, and very indusive to just thinking about your perception/knowledge of everything re: Mary, and the entire tragedy.  This can make you question other assumptions or ideas you may have had yourself, and/or have read, seen, been told, etc..  Probably the film's most significant characteristic for me is just the overall tone/perspective, which while its not non-existent anywhere else, is a little less common.  I think general thoughts about Mary's possible involvement in miscellaneous 'other' events relative to the assassination, often tends to lean toward her being guilty.  It's definitely acknowledged in general that that's a question.  She could be either innocent or guilty - but much in the overall perception often leads to:  well, it's not 100% proven, but she was likely involved somehow.  I found this film is interesting in particular, because it shows more of another possible side - that she's not guilty, and was basically a family, religiously faithful, kind woman who got dragged into the whole thing, not due to any proof - it just happened. (i.e., primarily due to location & association of even a family member).  It even makes you question if the famous PACKAGE she accepted meant anything, or has been blown way out of proportion.

Another piece I found interesting & so well created for the film is the music.  It seems to just fit the mood of the scenes as things move along, just perfectly.  Lastly, another excellent piece is in the extra items - facts about Mary & the overall situation, that aren't commonly known.  They're focused on her, who she is, and thoughts on her potential involvement or innocence - not the assassination.  There are also some miscellaneous points I learned that were very interesting.

Overall, would highly recommend the film.  As mentioned, even in its 26 minutes, it definitely provides some different perspective, and makes you think...",1273708800,9,1927,5.073015873015873
4107277,5,B003BNZID2,"This movie is fascinating.  It appears historically accurate in costume and facts.  The acting is superb, and I ended up wishing it were longer.  One angle of the Lincoln drama I was not familiar with until now.  Great movie!",1268784000,10,225,4.6923076923076925
4107278,5,B003BNZID2,"Chris and Heather King's film ""The Killing of Mary Surratt"" is a bold accomplishment. A short film (26 minutes) that dares to tell the story of Mary Surratt, the only woman who was hung as one of the conspirators in the Lincoln assassination. A stunning and audacious achievement in depicting the period, including the assassination and the execution, and being so rich in period and historical detail. Mary Beth Barber as Mary gives a complete and compelling performance, conveying a sense of who Mary Surratt was in a largely non-verbal role. The whole film moves in a series of rich tableau visuals that evoked ""The Assassination of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford"" and Terence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line."" Director Chris King is obviously a history buff by the attention to detail in every frame. If I hadn't seen this movie on the big screen at a film festival I would have said that this movie could not be made as a short film and on a short film budget. But what you see on this DVD cannot be called short-filmmaking, but Epic Filmmaking. A film that you can watch again and again -- and will want to show and share with your friends.

This is a MUST-SEE film for any Lincoln or Civil War history buff -- as well as for any aspiring filmmaker to see how much can be accomplished when you set the bar extremely high for yourself and are able to excited other talented and committed people to come on the journey with you.

Chock full of DVD EXTRAS -- behind-the-scenes featurettes on both the historical and the filmmaking aspects, as well as a profile on the composer of the extraordinary music that binds the film. ""The Killing of Mary Surratt"" is a worthy DVD to add to the collection.",1268352000,25,1702,4.5588235294117645
4107289,4,B003BNZID2,"As a programmer for the Newport Beach Film Festival, I review about 200 shorts have volunteered for about 6 years so I see alot of movies.  I chose this for many reasons of course the authenticity of the story and the production, photography and education, some part of History that I knew nothing about.  I know that this will do very well in the future.",1320105600,,355,4.446153846153846
4107290,5,B003BNZID2,"Every time I watch the DVD, I am amazed at the depth and artistic production value of this short. Chris King is a master story teller both with the incredible dialog but more with the artistic quality of the landscape and attention to detail, not easy in an Indie Period Piece.

Each frame is compelling. For an amazingly small budget, 'Mary Surratt' delivers huge dividends and historical accuracy.

Character driven, thoughtful and well done. A must see.",1316822400,,456,4.909090909090909
4107291,5,B003BNZID2,"Normally I wouldn't review something I'm in, but this film is something special in terms of the story, direction, and teamwork from the Sacramento film and related communities. Chris King's instincts to produce a movie about this normally ignored aspect of history was right on -- Redford's later film of the same incidents showed that. The emotionally charged direction gives this story the attention it's due, and reminds a watcher that the Civil War consisted of real events -- tragic events -- that happened to real people.

The film also shows what kind of artwork can be produced in a small film community when those involved work as a team -- from the production staff who helped out, to all the actors who did what it took to look the parts, to the local vendors who supplied great equipment (the fantastic RED camera), to the staff at the California State Parks who shared the facilities for this film. Sacramento may have a small community of professionals, but they're talented and thrive from collaboration rather than competition.

There's one review here that expresses disappointment that The Killing of Mary Suratt was not a straightforward educational documentary about the incidents, but I feel the individual misunderstood the purpose behind the film. The point was not to simply inform the viewer of a historical event, but rather provide, in a nonlinear and emotional format, a narrative look at a possible view of what Mary went through before she was killed.",1316131200,,1481,4.991902834008097
4107292,5,B003BNZID2,"The story ask you to think; were we wrong to Mary Surratt, did we get the Facts right, is there resonable dought to the crime? or did she plan to help knowing the out come.
The factors are brought to you in this movie, bringing you to judge what a mother would or would not do for family and country. A country that was still divied but confused to whom to trust. Think a Special known actor come to you, knowning of his name, He has come to request a favour from you. you are willing to help and feel special he asked you. But are you helping a friend or do you know the dirty secret that will set forth an out come that may change a nation.

 The acting is world class the sceens are driven and dramatic. The photograph capture the moument in time that gives you the feeling of a full feature film and a timely slice of life. Thank you to Water Mark Films for lovely short film.",1315872000,,880,4.08092485549133
4107293,5,B003BNZID2,"This was a very gripping movie. It was extremely well written, acted and filmed, and left me wishing the film was longer! Very facinating story line, and quite moving. I couldn't help but notice that the Robert Redford movie clearly took insperation from The King's version. Even the actors were similar in appearence.",1315872000,,318,5.018867924528302

4107295,4,B003BNZID2,This film was educational as well as entertaining and suspenseful. Afetr seeing this film I noticed that hollywood was producing a full motion picture on the same topic. Nice Job Watermark films,1315872000,,194,5.09375
4107296,5,B003BNZID2,"The production value of this short film 'The Killing of Mary Surratt"" is an excellent example of how passion and creative vision come together using limited funds and a dedicated team to make something truly special. Produced on a 'non-Hollywood' budget and shot in Sacramento - the filmmaker paints an eerily imagined picture of the true events. The script, cinematography and acting are superb and in my opinion, King's short is a better film than the feature length version (The Conspirator) by Robert Redford that came out AFTER King's was completed. Chris King continues to impress and inspire us with his talent as a writer and a filmmakers as he consistently creates compelling films that make a big impact.",1315872000,,714,5.008403361344538

4107298,1,B003BNZID2,"This is the most worthless, bizarre, disconnected DVD we have ever purchased.  After all the recent talk shows concerning the Civil War and this woman, we were anxious to order the DVD.  We were expecting something similar to the wonderful, accurate stories told in a logical manner, on the History Channel. Unfortunately, we couldn't even figure out what was supposed to be happening the story wandered so badly, jerking back and forth, here and there with flashbacks and repetition.  We have tossed the DVD in the trash.  I wouldn't want to burden the local charity by donating it.",1303257600,14,583,4.918367346938775

8393832,1,B003BNZID2,"As a person who teaches a class on the Lincoln Assassination, I found that this movie was very short on a lot of important facts. For example, Mary Surratt was never forced to wear one of Stanton's miserable hoods. Never. Also none of the conspirators were wearing these hoods on the gallows. They were given the customary hood when they were to be hung, but never the one they wore in jail. In fact they were removed halfway through the trial because the court officers were concerned about the effects on the prisoners' health. Many try to portray Mary Surratt as a victim caught up in the hysteria. That is not true. She knew what was going on in her house, being a Southern sympathizer. She took weapons and binoculars to Surrattsville for holding, and told the tavern keeper to have ""the shooting irons"" ready that evening. Under the law, it was her responsibility to report suspicious activity, which she did not do. It is a shame that when movies like this are made because people who watch think that it is factual. It is not...",1430179200,2,1036,4.575268817204301

We never heard of Mary Surratt and to find out she was possibly connected to President Lincoln's assassination and was the first woman to be executed was noteworthy. Wonder what other important things in our history have been ""left out.""",1324857600,2,397,4.852941176470588
