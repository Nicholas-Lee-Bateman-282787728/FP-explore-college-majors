Like the italian movie Salo, this one focus on the horrific nightmare that pedofilia and child mistreatment brings to little innocent children. While Salo focused on four perverts that molest and mistreat lots of children, this one focus in one particular little girl named Midori that gets frequently molested and mistreated by a group of circus freaks.

Midori is pretty much a psychological drama with lots of creepy images involving rape, beatings, blood and gore for 45 minutes since it's actually a short movie. Also, what makes this anime so controversial is not just the horrific images, is the way it was made. Creator Hiroshi Harada wanted a animated film for his adaptation of the Shuehiro Maruo's manga Shojo Tsubaki, but he couldn't get any sponsors or famous studios for the adaptation because of the horrific and illegal imagery at the time. Harada had to make the entire film all by himself at home and by using all his life-savings for the animation, voice acting, distribution, ect that took him 5 years. The film was shown in some theaters in 1992 but the original copy of the film was burned along with all the remaining copies in Japan some years later. We are lucky to have this on dvd.

The movie is great if you like ""shocker"" movies but not if you can't take such a disturbing concept or gruesome imagery. I value this movie just as I value Salo, is a great but HORRIFIC cinematic art.",1432425600,2,1553,4.681318681318682
