3770946,4,B001QUF7DS,"And I only say 'predictable' because after seeing the trailers/commercials, you see the movie is one of those 'doesn't miss what she has until it's gone' type of things. Chestnut plays a husband who has fallen on hard times in his career & only longs to have children, while his wife, Henson, plays a corp.ladder-climbing woman who can't tolerate anything less than the 'all that 'life-style  & has no time for children. But instead of trying to work on the relationship w/her hubby, she uses him for her whipping post, only compounded when her 'mother from hell' arrives (J. Lewis is ALWAYS amazing in her roles - this fit her perfectly!)& they kinda mother-daughter tag team him until he snaps under the weight. THEN when Henson suspects hubby of leaning toward someone else who'll give him the time of day, she FINALLY sees the bitchiness of her & her mother's ways (Duh!), she goes after her man & begs forgiveness. I like 'relationship' movies w/a message, so this was all good. Nothing wrong w/food for thought.....",1238976000,16,1021,4.801136363636363
3770947,5,B001QUF7DS,"This movie is wonderful and a great conversation starter for couples whether married or not. Upon finding out the length of the film, I was initially concerned about the movie's ability to create profound characters. I was pleasantly surprised to see how this story unfolded and touched on a few poignant themes such as fatherhood, temptation, faith, resentment, and the role/influence of outsiders (friends and family) on a marriage. It really makes you think about what's important and what you're really willing to fight for when you love someone. You have to see this movie! I can't wait to purchase it on DVD!",1238630400,3,614,4.970873786407767
3770948,4,B001QUF7DS,"T.D. Jakes previous novel Women Thou Art Loosed was adapted into animpressive film, five years and his follow up film Not Easily Broken isjust as good. Directed by the underrated Bill Duke whose previous work includes Hoodlum and Deep Cover, Not Easily Broken tells the story of a couple (Morris Chestnut & Taraji P. Henson) whose marriage is crisis. After a car accident, injurers Henson's character things only get worseand their marriage but more importantly their faith is tested. I watchedthe film with my wife. It was a treat to discuss the film with her onthe way out of the theater to our car. And during the ride home we cameto understand a little more about each other. The acting considering the religious material is first rate, Morris Chestnut displays the sameleading man charm he always does and fresh off her Oscar Worthy turn in Benjamin Button, Henson does wonders. Jenifer Lewis steals every sceneshe's in as the mother-in-law, and Kevin Hart provides tons of comicrelief as a life long friend to Chestnut's character. Not Easily Brokenis the kind of film that most critics will tear apart. It could be therelack of familiarity for most critics when it comes to the gospel genre. Take for example the similar marriage in crisis themed film Revolutionary Road which is currently in release and stars Kate Winslet& Leonardo Dicarpo. Winslet just won a Golden Globe for her role in Road, while critics roasted Henson's performance in Not Easily Broken. While Winslet's character differs slightly from Henson's in Not Easily Broken both give performances that any women single or married canrelate to. While Not Easily Broken does have an overlapping religioustheme, anyone no matter what your religious beliefs willing to givethis film a chance will be pleasantly surprised.",1234051200,25,1790,5.091836734693878

3770993,3,B001QUF7DS,"I am really not sure of the message here.  Taraji's character comes across as being really pretention to her counterpart of Morris Chestnut.  It seems really superficial from the woman's standpoint and another movie which emasculates black men and plays up to the stereotype that deep down black men really want to be with a white woman.  What young married couple do you know wants their mother to move into their household once the daughter has recuperated from her accident?  Also the cameo of TD Jakes and Serita Jakes was misplaced.  Sorry but I had higher hopes for this movie but even though I am black, most predominantly black movies leave me wanting and this was no exception.",1456876800,,686,4.779661016949152

As Dave & Clarice, they marry, they get-along, then the trouble begins.  Dave not making the pros in Baseball, due to a torn ACL and being one of the men running a youth center, he becomes the target of Clarice, who DEMANDS more.  Throw in Jenifer Lewis as her mother, and Dave's troubles only intensifies.  A tragic occurrence causes Dave and Clarice's friend to become a tad emotional toward each other, which brings up another set of problems.  Dave wanting kids only inflames things.

3771082,5,B001QUF7DS,This is a funny yet touching love story. The two leads were great and Kevin Hart provided the comic relief. This is one of Jenifer Lewis best roles as the overbearing mother. Taraji was very annoying in this role and I felt for Morris because he had to deal with her smart mouth. It is hard for men to deal with the fact that their wives earn more money than they do. This can cause problems in a marriage. This is a Christian film. There are positive messages based on the Bible in the film but it doesn't seem preachy. I recommend this film for fans of romantic comedies. If you love Mr. Chestnut and Mrs. Henson you have to see this film. The only negative point was that Morris had on a ridiculous wig in the beginning of the film. Fans of Kevin Hart will want to see this as well. This is a uplifting- date film. Fans may also want to read the book of the same name on which this film is based. It's a good read.,1404000000,,917,4.1

It is a serious drama, very intense, with several plots, from a woman who is injured in an accident while driving with her husband to a boy who is emotionally abused by his dad. There are many good lessons, from marriage partners that neglect each other, to people who deal with real life situations that can impact marriage and home life, to an over involved mother-in-law.

If I was to compare this movie to any other movie in its genre in terms of greatness it would be Bridges of Madison County which is a better movie but you get the idea. Not Easily Broken is a story about a marriage in crisis as a couple struggles to try and mend a coming apart relationship. This movie tries to convey the point that love is effortless and that the moment one tries to force certain images and ideas upon the other its no longer love.

3771127,3,B001QUF7DS,"Not Easily Broken is based on a scripture from the book of Ephesians. Nevertheless, the scripture is hardly referred to in the Movie. Neither is God. I found so many parts of this movie inadequate. I understand that the goal was to not be too ""preachy"" so that people of all religious beliefs would be interested. Yet, if the goal of the movie is to prove that God is the way to hold a marriage together, shouldn't the couple pray together at least once? I think the movie also fell short in regards to portraying the true role of a Christian husband in a marriage. The entire failure of the marriage in this movie is blamed on the wife and her mother; in reality, all parties were guilty including the husband. The husband did not cover his wife adequately and he did not handle their conflict properly.

I think this movie had so much potential. If only a few more scene were added that mentioned how a couple in this situation could find God or what the wife and husband each did to lead to the destruction of the marriage, it would have been much more effective in portraying its intended message.

On the other hand, the acting was good and a few scenes made me very emotional because they were so real. I also like the fact that the scene of his affair is short and brief instead of long and x-rated (as is common in most movies).

3771130,5,B001QUF7DS,"I'm really surprised Not Easily Broken is better and *very* different than I went in expecting.

Let me mention something very important first- when you read the description you'll probably think to yourself ""Oh, it's one of THESE type of movies involving a person struggling to get by after a horrible car accident"".

However, the storyline definitely progresses well beyond that and in fact, the storyline morphs into something very very different so the original subject never comes back into the equation again.  The actual accident only occupies the first 25 minutes of film.

After that the plot switches to being about the relationship stuggles between the husband and the wife, and particularly the nurse who originally takes care of the wife after the car accident.  She ends up playing a bigger role later on because of a VERY shocking turn of events (which I won't spoil).  Not to mention the wifes mother who moves in after her daughters accident and becomes one of the more important characters.

There's also a subtle message of hope and not ever giving up through even the worst of times, and it's done in such a way that it's not overbearing or unnatural.  It's done just right.

Great acting, good storyline, and just a movie worth watching.",1288396800,,1258,4.868544600938967
3771131,5,B001QUF7DS,This movie was great I heard about it when it first came out but never went to see it. Well about 3 months I was looking for something to watch so I picked it up. And I am so glad I did it was a great movie and it spoke on so many things that go wrong in the world of the married folks. I would recomend this movie to anyone also it had some good laughs,1285200000,,353,3.5974025974025974
3771132,4,B001QUF7DS,"While it certainly has flaws, there is something so raw and beautiful about `Not Easily Broken' that I can't seem to shake.  Maybe it's the naturalness with which the actors fall effortlessly into their roles.  Maybe it's the relatable feeling I get when watching this marriage break and re-set.  Maybe it's the fact that `Not Easily Broken' avoids being `easy' and just tells it like it is.

The story is that of a young married couple (well, middle aged I guess) who are starting to crack.  Dave, once with large dreams of playing professional baseball, now coaches little leaguers after a severe injury crushed his goals.  His wife, Clarice, has become the family's primary breadwinner, growing her real estate dreams into something substantial.  The couple is constantly at each others throats due to diverting goals.  Dave, having separated himself from the life he once wanted to live, now wants a simpler life, one with children.  Clarice is still very much into her own needs, wanting to build her career and travel without the heavy weight of `family' dragging her down.  The couple has drifted apart, mentally and physically.  Still, their problems seem minor when compared to some of their friends (who happen to be lodged in a messy divorce) and so it seem manageable.  When Clarice is injured in a car accident, things come to a head in their marriage.  Clarice's bossy and overbearing mother comes to live with the couple, and her two-cents start to wage war between Clarice and Dave, especially when Dave begins to seek emotional comfort in the arms of another woman.

You will never doubt that Dave and Clarice will work through things, but getting their will be a rocky and at times heartbreakingly realistic road.

As far as faults go, there are a few.  I had a similar issue with Woody Allen's `Husbands and Wives'.  For some reason, these films tend to be slightly biased.  I mean, who isn't going to side with Dave here.  I think that the film should have made it a little more even, or at least peppered in a few faults.  And one cannot say that Dave forming feelings for Julie was a fault because, well, his wife and her mother would have driven ANY man to seek comfort elsewhere, and I'm telling you think from experience.  But, I will also say, from experience, that no story is that one sided.  Everyone has faults that contribute to the downfall of a marriage.  So, it's minor in this state (because this film, unlike Allen's, isn't trying to make a broad statement on the dynamics of marriage) but it's worth noting.  I also found the way the film wrapped things up to be a bit of a sell out (when it happens you will know what I mean), it just felt so Hollywood, especially when this film appropriately avoided `going there' for the most part.  I hated the narration (unnecessary) and I thought that the film (at times) felt like a Made for TV Tyler Perry Movie, which made me cringe a bit, but thankfully the film managed to reign in that overly preachy dynamic that Perry lustfully lathers over every frame of his overpraised films.

The acting, especially on the parts of Morris Chestnut and the BRILLIANT Taraji P. Henson, is great.  Even Jenifer Lewis (who is really nothing more than a clich&eacute; here) is exceptionally `raw'.  I loved Kevin Hart (hilarious, even when delivering the preachy lines of dialog) and I thought that Maeve Quinlan understood how to temper her performance so as to seem real and approachable as aposed to staged and `manufactured' (as most `other women' in these films can come across).

In the end I recommend this movie.  Like I said, it has flaws, but overall this movie really delivers a powerful punch that cannot be ignored.  Marriage is a very controversial subject, but it is one that deserves to be tackled without fear.  For the most part, `Not Easily Broken' manages to do that.",1284940800,,3854,4.714499252615845

3771149,4,B001QUF7DS,"""Not Easily Broken"" is an excellent case study on modern day romances and marriages.  Morris Chesnutt (Dave) and Taraji  P. Henson (Clarice) give a poignant portrayal of  the power struggle often waged  between husband and wife in an individualistic society.  There have been movies in the past that attempted to put a comic twist on the challenges of relationships like:  Albert Brooks', ""Modern Romance"" (1981) and Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner in ""The War of The Roses"" (1989).  The difference between the dramatic ""Not Easily Broken"" and romantic movies of the past is that the plot hinged on the breakdown of the relationship.  The relationships ran its course and both parties attempted to get out without getting their pocketbooks and heartstrings bruised too much.  But, ""Not Easily Broken"" is different in that it demonstrates the transformation of modern men and women.  Actually, it represents more the breakdown in people more so than the relationship. ""Not Easily Broken"" begs the question;""Do men and women have any real need for each other anymore?"" It sounds ludicrous to ask such a question.  But, to look at the dynamics in contemporary relationships of changing gender roles, advanced equitability in financial resources between the sexes and a myriad of self-serving motives  might not be ludicrous after all.  The movie attempts to develop a redeeming value of hope, but fails pragmatically in its quest, because realistically the challenges are too deep-seated.  For the relationship to actually work, the parties have to devolve into a time that has long past.  Granted, the past came with a high degree of challenges and disempowerment as well.  But, men and women seem to want and need each other despite the impediments.

I highly recommend this movie for the penetrating analysis of contemporary love.

If the critics do not like it, mainly Roger Ebert, I am not watching it because I have watched movies bashed by the critics and understood why.  I decided to violate my rule and watch this movie even though it was not critically well received.  This is a really good movie.  Once again, this is a really good movie.  The men in the movie have to express their feelings and make themselves vulnerable in order to solve their problems.  The women have to be honest with themselves and accept that they are not always right.  The characters have to be honest with each other, the roots of their problems, and the motivations behind their actions.  The cast in this movie is awesome.  I recommend this movie to anyone who had plans in life, have encountered complications, but deep down inside you want everything to work out.  This is a happily-ever-after-movie because in the end, situations get worked out and we are not used to that in movies these days because in ""reality"" notthing works out, well, if you do not accept that ""reality means bad in the end"" message but believe a rough road could end in happy times, watch this movie.

Plus, she is resentful of the time he spends with the little league team.  The husband also doesn't seem to take his wife's feelings into consideration.  After a car accident, their marriage experiences cracks that threaten to pull them apart.

3771162,3,B001QUF7DS,"I enjoyed this movie, and I gave it 3 stars...

But I was also disappointed in this movie.

First of all, for it to be promoted as a spiritual movie there was entirely too much cussing. I am far from being a prude, and those who know me are aware that I will let off a word or two.

However,as an author, I don't curse when I write Christian fiction, because when advertising something as spiritual or Christian its inappropriate.

It wasn't light cursing either, like a word here or there like in The Fighting Temptations...it was all over the place. Other than the minister, I had a hard time telling any of these cursing characters from one in any other movie.

As a writer I know I tend to over critique some stories...and this is one of them. While enjoyable...it had no rhyme or reason. It was just random drama. Perhaps that is what happens when a book becomes a movie, but in this case, it was just weird.

Again, I did enjoy the movie. It just was not at all what I was expecting, and honestly...I never saw God in this movie.

One scene with a minister and a prayer...does not make a movie spiritual.",1243036800,2,1110,4.333333333333333

3771167,5,B001QUF7DS,"As a fan of Taraji P. Henson (""Hustle & Flow,"" ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button""), I was curious to see what she would bring to her role as a wife dealing with a struggling marriage. My own involvement in ""Fireproof,"" as the one who wrote the novel based on the screenplay, gave me appreciation for this important subject, and yet I'd heard little about this film. My expectations for the overall story were low.

What a nice surprise! Without being crass or gratuitous, the script allows these characters to portray real problems in believable ways. Soon after the rosy opening, in which they tie the knot with the bishop's wise words barely sinking in, they find their marriage crumbling beneath financial pressures, different goals, and a drought of physical intimacy. Dave wants a child, while Clarice is career-minded and wanting to build a comfortable lifestyle--even if it means ""faking it till you make it."" Dave compensates by coaching Little League, an activity that Clarice fails to understand and which allows the mother-in-law to push her way into the home.

With things already rocky, a tragic accident leaves Clarice in physical therapy and feeling bitter. Her therapist, an attractive white female, turns the head of Dave's male friends, and the bond that he builds with her becomes threatening to Clarice and to their hopes of ever rebuilding the love they once had for each other.

The acting is superb, particularly on the part of Morris Chestnut, Taraji P. Henson, and the lady who plays the mother-in-law. There's some nice comic relief, and there are a number of powerful scenes that don't always end with nice tidy resolutions. The message is one of hope and encouragement, but it doesn't feel too preachy or glib. It's a satisfying and worthy tale on a number of levels, and not one to be easily dismissed.",1239840000,46,1834,4.890675241157556
