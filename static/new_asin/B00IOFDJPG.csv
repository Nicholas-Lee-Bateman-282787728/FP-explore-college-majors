6284113,5,B00IOFDJPG,Just got this today and it was pack neatly. I love this anime and wanted to own it. (^-^) thank you Amazon.,1423440000,,107,3.909090909090909
6284114,5,B00IOFDJPG,"Amnesia was the anime that made me return to anime and is the anime series that set me on the path to start up an anime blog through wordpress known as The Huge Anime Fan. Amnesia really made me re-evaluate that anime is always evolving and actually since 2013-onwards new changes and themes in anime have now been tackled even controversial ones.

Another thing noticed is the talented voice actors. So when I watched Amnesia I was even more shocked to notice how wonderful all voice actors sounded for the Amnesia cast. Many cheers for Kaori Nazuka!

The feeling from watching Amnesia really gives off a real sense of gravity or atmosphere. It becomes very obviously fueled by the music they use which consists of bell chimes and piano that plays in key important moments in Amnesia. This is good since a touch of a dream-like state is perfect given this anime series is about the main female character only known as Heroine feeling lost and dream-like in the world.

It is also nice to point out that having such a character being labeled Heroine is not a real drawback since not only is it a difference from the norm and also enforces that details of who the Heroine is are unknown.

The Heroine sadly keeps meeting people and coming into situations that deviate from another. All of this is entertaining to see especially when a cafe manager she works for can have a different personality out of nowhere. In one the manager of the cafe, Waka, is wise and stricter and in another easily angry at the smallest happenings.

She slowly comes to realize the reason for these changes are Parallel Worlds since she is drifting into worlds much like her own but a little different which includes the people around her and their personalities would, of course, change.

Even though the anime series is very cute and has many attractive bishonen anime guys. This journey is about the Heroine and how she handles situations.

Amnesia has a nice closure to its ending unlike so many anime have seen within my lifetime. It gives us a good possibility to decide for ourselves which option likely makes more sense for the Heroine to choose. Making us work to mentally piece together in what world she might truly belong to. Amnesia is devised excellently as both a reverse harem anime series and science fiction anime work.

6284115,5,B00IOFDJPG,"Absolutely love it. I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes the ideas of dimensional travel, and parallel universes. It's intriguing, with a healthy dose of romance and mystery. And it avoided hentai, which in my book makes it beautiful.",1416009600,4,245,5.0
6284116,5,B00IOFDJPG,"Unlike the previous review, I absolutely liked the English dub on this. It didn't sound boring, not at all. My ears didn't bleed and everyone sounded normal, even Orion, which I was iffy about at first. And the voice actor that voiced Ukyo did a excellent job sounding innocent and helpful; to psychotic and murderous in one full swing. The story really pulls you in and keeps you guessing until the end. The plot didn't really get resolved, meaning we didn't get to see the heroine's choice in which world she would stay in but despite that fact, the series can stand alone without that decision. If you like stories like 'Alice in the Country' and 'Uta Pri', I recommend getting this series.",1409961600,9,693,4.642276422764228
6284117,5,B00IOFDJPG,"This anime is an interesting plot where you'd never understand what was happening until the end where it explains it's self. I found it quit eye catching and watched this until it was finished.

No I haven't bought this, but I am putting it in my cart to by later! ;)",1408492800,2,267,4.235294117647059
6284118,5,B00IOFDJPG,I haven't bought this yet because I'm waiting for the price to go down because I'm basically broke. But this anime is awesome! I highly recommend it and if u want to see if u like it first they have every episode on you tube. I advise not watching English dub on this because it makes it kinda boring. The opening song is one of the best!!!!!! :D,1408060800,2,346,4.102941176470588

6284128,5,B00IOFDJPG,"This was nothing like I thought it was going to be... in a good way. The main character keeps waking up in alternate universes, by which she keeps dying. Her true love keeps bringing her into a new universe, making several failed attempts to save her and stop her inevitable death. (It has a happy ending). What I loved, aside from the artwork, was the creative rehashing of all the characters, in each new universe she was surrounded by the same people but their personalities would warp. Its very reminiscent of an alice and wonderland feel.",1423872000,4,543,4.666666666666667
8644054,5,B00IOFDJPG,"Just simply.... major fangirl moments!! I totally recommend watching this anime before playing the visual novel otome, Amnesia: Memories. This anime gives the heroine her own voice, which I actually liked. Japanese version with subtitles is far better, especially if you already fell in love with voiceovers from otome. It may only highlight some important plot points but is definitely worth watching. Also, I got some credible answers for good endings on game. ",1516492800,,463,5.342465753424658
8644055,5,B00IOFDJPG,"Thoroughly enjoyable and held our attention. It was a bit confusing but what else would you expect when seeing the story through the eyes of a character who has amnesia and doesn't know what's going on herself. The only downside [SPOILER WARNING] the ending is kind of open-ended, it doesn't really give a full answer to what happens, which is a little frustrating if you're looking for a straight answer.",1516147200,,405,4.8

8644057,5,B00IOFDJPG,One of my favorite animes. I played some of the game and thought the story was cool. Recommended.,1513728000,,97,4.444444444444445
8644058,3,B00IOFDJPG,"I like this series it could have gone further. And if you don't know it was a game first, it may be confusing.",1492646400,,110,3.8260869565217392
8644059,1,B00IOFDJPG,"It's bad enough when a movie or TV show makes you think, ""What did I just see?"" But it's far worse when it also poses the question: ""Why did I even bother?""

And that question rattled in my head for most of ""Amnesia: Complete Collection."" This odd little anime -- based on an interactive video game of the same name -- is a story so strangely forgettable, generic and teeming with pointless characters and stories that it barely even deserves a title. Literally almost nothing in this story actually has any true significance or importance until the last few episodes.

An amnesiac heroine (whom I shall call Nameless, since they never bother actually naming her) awakes at the back of a cafe, with no memory of how she got there or of any of the people she's interacting with. Or much of anything, really. Also, a strange flying child named Orion -- whom only she can see -- explains that her memory loss is his fault, and he wants to help her regain her lost memories.

And so Nameless tries to get to know her coworkers/friends -- brooding Shin, seductive Ikki, rigidly logical Kent, and obsessive Toma -- so she can figure out which is her boyfriend. Also, she has fragmented memories of falling, being accosted by a gang of angry girls, and there's a strange green-haired boy who seems to appear wherever she goes. To make things even MORE complicated, she finds herself shifting through parallel realities, where she is a different guy's girlfriend in each one.

How can a story with dimension-shifting, godlike spirits and a time loop end up being so staggeringly, stultifyingly BORING? From the very first scene it's painfully obvious what this story is going to be like: Nameless drifts around looking confused and vague, people say Important Things about past events, and there are a lot of fake-outs where it seems that something interesting is happening... only for it to be revealed that no, it didn't. It's like being slowly drowned in a vat of room-temperature wallpaper paste.

The biggest problem is that... to be blunt, ten of the twelve episodes have no actual importance to anything that ultimately happens in the story. They're about Nameless working out her romantic issues with the men (all are total strangers to her), but they effectively vanish from the story once their purpose has been served. Even the fragmented memories that Nameless starts to recall don't actually amount to anything of importance.

And this might have been okay, if the characters were interesting. But Nameless is exactly the sort of character you'd expect for a video-game stand-in to be -- she's so bland, useless, featureless and personality-free that she makes Bella Swan look like a dynamic and complex character. While this works in a video game, where the player would actually BE her, a passionless and useless heroine with no development or personality is not fun to watch in a TV series.

As for the other characters, most of them have exactly one character trait -- sexy, nerdy, mildly mentally unbalanced or tormented. The only exception is Ukyo, who ends up being the most intense, tragic and interesting person in the entire story.... and who therefore barely appears until the last two episodes.

Those two episodes are actually somewhat gripping... or would be, if I cared at all about Nameless. That is the point in the story when it's finally explained what's going on, and in so doing, revealed that a MUCH MORE INTERESTING story happened entirely out of our sight. In fact, a story filled with tragedy, death, intermingled hate and love, and the prospect of fighting against fate itself... but hey, at least we got to watch Nameless going to a street fair with Mr. Logic. Oh, and the story pulls a brand-new, never-before-mentioned character from its butt for a cheap deus ex machina.

Nine whole episodes of ""Amnesia"" can be skipped without actually missing anything of importance to the story, and the real tragedy is that the most interesting part of the tale is something we never even glimpse. Most useful as a soporific.",1472169600,,4047,4.853623188405797
8644060,5,B00IOFDJPG,"loved this anime!  it's so amazingly good!  it made me cry at many parts,  and I was on my edge the whole time,  and at the end of the episode,  the ending theme played at the right time, it was a perfect cliffhanger!  but the one thing that was very disappointing  was the ending....  for me,  I didn't like it very much,  she just says goodbye to Orion and that's it....  she just goes back to her world,  without seeing who she actually picks....  and another thing,  ukyo,  he said that he was her true love,  but they never went in depth with that,  so,  I really didn't understand  how that was true.  for me personally,  I think she had more emotions with Toma,  I wish they would have had a ending with Toma personally.  Great anime!  I'd recommend  to everyone!",1471564800,,770,4.290780141843972
8644061,5,B00IOFDJPG,"I played the iOS game first and did not know what  to expect with the DVD.  I was impressed with it to tell you the truth, it was nice to see them in action as opposed to just stills on my phone.",1466467200,,195,3.619047619047619
8644062,5,B00IOFDJPG,"Absolutely love this show! For one of the shorter visual novel-to-anime adaptations, Amnesia is actually paced quite well! I had first seen the show a while back and enjoyed it then, not knowing at that time it was based on a visual novel series. Recently, I finally managed to play through all of Amnesia: Memories and loved the depth of it so much that I just had to snag a copy of the anime!! I've always been a fan of Sentai Filmworks, was anxious to hear the English dub and the luckily it did not disappoint!! The voice actors do a fantastic job bringing our Heroine and her boys' personalities out just as I'd hoped! :)

For some it may feel a little slow paced, but overall it has a storyline that builds upon itself to reach a decent climax. Gotta keep in mind that an Otome game style makes the female heroine go through a handful of unique story paths with each romantic male interest, ultimately unlocking a final climax path that brings everything together. To me, Amnesia does a great job with this without making the show disjointed or dull.

Overall, it's a good anime with a fantastic visual animated style (I love everyone's colourful eyes in this show!!!) that I would recommend to any anime fans! If you're looking for that reverse-harem setup with a good story, good heroine and awesome male characters....here you go! :D",1465776000,2,1342,4.610878661087866
