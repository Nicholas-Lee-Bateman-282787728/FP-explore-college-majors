8661922,5,B00KVOBXEM,"I'm very happy to have this video, although a little put out it's been languishing in the vaults since 1994.  They brought it out barely in time for CPE Bach's 300th anniversary year (born 3/8/1714), so it's only 20 years late--or 6 months late, depending on your calculation.  For it would have made a much bigger splash last March, which was CPE's actual 300th birthday (also the middle of Lent when people are more turned on by a Passion oratorio, than late summer).

This particular performance of this particular work will be quite satisfying to those who are into classical oratorio.  I would daresay ""you know who you are.""  I would humbly submit it's not for the average consumer or the simply curious.  Let's get the worst news out of the way first--there are no English subtitles (or any subtitles whatever), in 90 minutes of singing German.  And if you say, no worries, I know his daddy's St. John and St. Matthew Passions by heart--sorry, it does not follow any of those texts.

Another small problem is that it often cuts away to B&W shots of medieval statues and icons that are frankly not very attractive.  It is nothing as bad as Karl Richter's St. John Passion video, which has questionable artwork over music 95% of the time.  This is maybe only 5%.  It's annoying, but not a deal-killer.

The performance is with a modest sized chamber orchestra using modern instruments, with adult mixed choir and soloists, and very competently done.  The hall appears to be from the 1800's and fits very well.  Picture sharpness, color and sound are all perfectly fine as far as I'm concerned, although I cannot comment on cinema-quality systems.

It's too bad about the lack of subtitles, and also with all respect the marketing is rather poor--one can't even find it on Amazon searching ""CPE"", ""C P E"", or even ""Emanuel"".  Update:  the complete German text (and there is a lot of it) is given in the enclosed booklet, although I would have much preferred subtitles, also English.

This DVD needs no recommendation from me--those who want it need only be made known it exists.  For the casually curious I would rather recommend CPE's Ascension Oratorio, which is done with original instruments and also has subtitles:
